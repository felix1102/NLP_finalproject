2019,Zantac Recall Widens as Sanofi Pulls Its Drug Over Carcinogen Fears,"The company’s announcement follows decisions by Walgreens, CVS and others to remove the drug from their shelves and after other manufacturers recalled their products. The French drug maker Sanofi said Friday that it was recalling the over-the-counter heartburn drug Zantac in the United States and Canada, a month after the Food and Drug Administration first alerted the public that versions of the drug contained low levels of a cancer-causing contaminant. Several manufacturers of generic versions of Zantac, called ranitidine, had already recalled their products, and major chains like Walgreens, CVS and Walmart had pulled the products from their shelves. Some countries, including Canada, have also requested a halt in distribution of all ranitidine products. In a statement, Sanofi said it was investigating the issue. “Sanofi is committed to transparency and will continue to communicate results with health authorities from the ongoing testing, and work with them to make informed decisions based on available data and evidence,” the company said. The F.D.A. said in September that the contaminant found in samples of Zantac was a type of nitrosamine called N-nitrosodimethylamine, or NDMA, which is believed to be carcinogenic in humans and is found in a variety of products, including cured meats. It is the same contaminant that was found in some versions of valsartan, a blood-pressure drug carrying the brand name Diovan. The discovery of NDMA in valsartan led to several recalls of the commonly prescribed drug. While the F.D.A. has said the NDMA found in the Zantac samples that the agency tested was at “unacceptable levels,” it pushed back against the findings of Valisure, an online pharmacy that said its testing revealed far higher levels of the contaminant. Valisure speculated that the source of the NDMA was the inherent instability of the ranitidine molecule, which can degrade under certain conditions, such as digestion, to create NDMA. The F.D.A. criticized Valisure’s testing methods, saying the results were invalid because the pharmacy heated the product, which created the higher levels of NDMA. Sanofi said that the recall applied only to the United States and Canada, and that its products sold outside the two countries were sourced from different suppliers. The F.D.A. has advised people who use over-the-counter versions of Zantac to consider using another heartburn medication. Patients who take prescription Zantac are advised to speak to their doctor before switching to something else.

2019,"Zawe Ashton: On Broadway and Off Broadway, All at Once","Suddenly all seems to be going the British actress’s way: A first book, an Off Broadway production of her play and a starring role opposite Tom Hiddleston in “Betrayal.” If only it were that simple. For the last five weeks, the British actress and playwright Zawe Ashton has been zipping back and forth between West 45th Street and Lower Manhattan. She has gone from speaking the words of her character Emma in an acclaimed Broadway revival of Harold Pinter’s “Betrayal” to watching her own words brought to life by a cast of others in her play “for all the women who thought they were Mad” at Soho Rep. “It’s like doing a boxing match and then swimming the Channel,” she joked recently over breakfast at a French cafe in Chelsea, dressed stylishly in a black dress with luminescent buttons and billowing sleeves, her glasses perched carefully on her nose. Everything seems to be falling into place for Ashton, who also released her first book this year and starred with Jake Gyllenhaal in the dark art-world satire “Velvet Buzzsaw.” Her play, which began previews the same day it opened at the Hackney Showroom in London, has its New York premiere on Oct. 27 and has already been extended. But the moment was a long time coming. Ashton, who grew up in London and whose mother moved from Uganda to England as a teenager, wrote “for all the women” 11 years ago, when she was just 24. She delivered the draft by hand to the Royal Court Theater, the culmination of her participation in the theater’s young writers program. But the experimental play has had multiple starts and stops since then. It features a constellation of women ranging in age from 8 to 65, and is based on months of research Ashton did on the myriad ways the British health system has failed black women, particularly when it comes to mental health and overmedication. The career-focused protagonist, Joy, begins to fall apart after witnessing a woman falling past a window, presumably to her death. Joy soon starts taking pills prescribed by a doctor. The other women surrounding her are a mixture of contemporary and ancestral voices. At times they serve as a kind of African-inspired chorus, interjecting and instructing Joy; their poetic text is influenced by Ugandan lullabies among other sources. The script, though set in Britain, feels relevant in the United States in light of recent disturbing data about black women’s health, including their significantly high maternal mortality risk. Ashton is both accepting and frustrated by the decade that it took for the play to find a home. “When I’m thinking about it in the most positive way possible,” she said, “I believe it had to brew and had to find its time and find its zeitgeist and find its conversation, which is very much a conversation that’s happening now in the U.S. in regards to the black female body.” “And then when I’m more my cynical 35-year-old self, I wish this could have just been produced earlier, at its most pure. Because it’s had a lot of face-lifts, it’s been handed around to many theatrical institutions and brilliant minds and it has changed a lot on the way.” She went on: “Everyone has wanted to make this play make much more sense. They wanted to turn it into a much more linear and literal document and that was never what it was. My 24-year-old self wrote it in 24 hours. I don’t say that in a boastful way — I say it as an invitation to understand what it’s like when things you’ve deeply intuited for a long time, even as a young person, are suddenly unlocked. That’s what happens when you are 24. You get married in a night — you break up in a night — you change countries in a night. ” She declined to offer too direct a connection between the material and her own experiences, but admitted she was influenced by women she has known and said the voices of the characters had been floating in her head for some time. The nonlinear, destabilizing nature of the piece appealed to Sarah Benson, the artistic director of Soho Rep, which regularly takes chances on formally experimental works, recently including “Fairview,” which won the 2019 Pulitzer Prize in drama. “It can only happen in theatrical form, this melding of content,” Benson said. “She’s making vivid something that black women have experienced for decades.” Whitney White, who is directing the Soho Rep production, said the play’s abstractions make sense for the current moment in New York theater. “Refracted black conscience is hot right now,” she said. “New writers, emerging writers are chopping and screwing all our lives, and spewing it out in an interesting, visceral way.” White said that often black women who are misdiagnosed or overprescribed drugs don’t report what they’re going through and can be demonized by the medical field. “There’s stigma. It’s unfortunate and it’s real and it happens,” she said. Even as Ashton gets ready for her own play’s debut, she is still performing eight times a week in “Betrayal,” where Ben Brantley in The New York Times praised her “breakout” turn as a vulnerable, world-weary wife caught in a love triangle between her husband (Tom Hiddleston) and his best friend (Charlie Cox). Despite the intense schedule, Ashton said she’s finding strength and inspiration in Pinter. “He’s not concerned with the truth, necessarily, in art and I love that,” she said. “You’re supposed to stumble across it in the dark every night. Good writing shouldn’t be wrapped in cellophane. It should be open to the elements and full of maggots and it should be left to grow and deepen and fester. I hang on to that.” In New York, she has found rare moments of solace wandering Chelsea and the halls of the Guggenheim, spending time with the Basquiats. She sees herself aligned “with the poets or the writers during the jazz era, more improvisational, truly collaborative. I’m in a nostalgic place, and I’m in America trying to figure it out.” Lingering after breakfast, Ashton said she finally knows herself well enough to trust her instincts. No longer does she believe, she said, that there can be real distance between the person and the creative artist. “It’s closed up since I’ve gotten older.,” she explained. “I can’t be in a situation where I feel distanced, othered, underrepresented, cross-questioned, put down, unseen as a person or as an artist and pretend that I will be O.K. That’s suppression I have released myself from.” Finally seeing her play onstage is part of that release. “Eleven years of this group of women in this play not having an audience to commune with has been a phantom limb,” she said. “I can’t wait to see it soar or fail. I just need to see it.”",The New York Times
2019,Zion Williamson Expected to Miss 6 to 8 Weeks of Rookie Season,"The New Orleans Pelicans rookie underwent surgery to repair a torn meniscus on Monday, an injury expected to keep him out of his first N.B.A. season until at least December. Zion Williamson, arguably the most highly anticipated N.B.A. rookie since LeBron James, won’t play in his first regular season game until at least December as he recovers from an injury to his right knee. Williamson had arthroscopic surgery Monday to fix a torn lateral meniscus, the New Orleans Pelicans said Monday. He is expected to miss six to eight weeks. Initially, Williamson’s injury, believed to have been suffered in a preseason game against the San Antonio Spurs on Oct. 13, was described as “soreness.” Now, the league is missing one of its main draws as it attempts to move past an ugly rift with the Chinese government with a splashy start to the regular season. The N.B.A. had scheduled the Pelicans against the Toronto Raptors as its opener on Tuesday night as part of a prime-time doubleheader. The Raptors won a title last season, but lost their best player, Kawhi Leonard, to the Los Angeles Clippers in free agency. At a minimum, Williamson is expected to miss one-fourth of the season, about 20 games. That hurts the slim playoff hopes for the Pelicans, especially given the competitiveness of the Western Conference. A return in six weeks would fall around Dec. 3, when New Orleans hosts the Dallas Mavericks. Williamson managed to meet the hype he had garnered after playing one year at Duke University in just a handful of preseason N.B.A. games. In four contests, Williamson averaged 23.3 points and 6.5 rebounds on 71 percent shooting. But there were injury concerns right away. At the N.B.A.’s annual summer league in Las Vegas, Williamson only played nine minutes in his debut, before missing the rest of the session. The culprit — banging a knee with another player.",The New York Times

2019,"Zion Williamson, Star N.B.A. Rookie, Out Indefinitely With Knee Injury","Williamson, the New Orleans Pelicans big man, is known for his explosive dunks, but he also dealt with knee issues in college at Duke. Update Oct. 21: The Pelicans announced that Williamson will be out six to eight weeks. Read more here. The N.B.A.’s sobering October continued on Friday when the New Orleans Pelicans confirmed that their prized rookie, Zion Williamson, is out indefinitely because of an injured right knee. Williamson is likely to miss the start of the season, which begins Tuesday, with what the Pelicans have termed “soreness” in the 19-year-old’s right knee. His dominant play in the preseason had been one of the league’s few upbeat counters to a breakdown in its decades-long business relationship with China, which has dominated sports news coverage for the past two weeks. The Pelicans open the regular season on Tuesday in Toronto as the opponent on ring night for the Raptors, who will be celebrating the first championship in franchise history, which they won in June. Williamson averaged a heady 23.3 points and 6.5 rebounds in just 27.3 minutes per game — while shooting a robust 71.4 percent from the field — in his four preseason appearances. But Pelicans Coach Alvin Gentry told reporters on Friday morning after the team’s shootaround at Madison Square Garden that Williamson is believed to have suffered the injury on Oct. 13 against the San Antonio Spurs. Gentry would not specify how long the team expects Williamson to be out. The Pelicans left Williamson behind in New Orleans on Thursday for further evaluation and treatment when they traveled to New York for their preseason finale on Friday night against the Knicks. ESPN reported on Friday that Williamson “has avoided a serious injury to his right knee but is expected to miss a period of weeks.” This will be the second injury absence of Williamson’s nascent pro career. He lasted just nine minutes in his summer league debut in July in Las Vegas after banging knees with an opposing player, resulting in an injured left knee that prompted the Pelicans to hold him out of the rest of the summer schedule to be cautious. Williamson bounced back in exhibition play with a level of production and efficiency that quickly established him as an overwhelming favorite among oddsmakers and N.B.A. pundits to win rookie of the year honors. Yet the emergence of another knee injury so quickly seems certain to amplify concerns about the weight Williamson carries on a 6-foot-7 frame. The Pelicans list Williamson at 284 pounds. Gentry rebuffed questions about injury specifics but insisted that Williamson’s spirits are “fine” in spite of his latest setback. “He’s not dead, guys,” Gentry told reporters.",The New York Times
2019,Zuckerberg Hates Warren’s Plan to Break Up Facebook. She Doesn’t Care.,"In leaked audio, Mark Zuckerberg said he would sue over Elizabeth Warren’s antitrust plan if she was elected president. She shot back. For months, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has made “big, structural change,” the rallying cry of her presidential campaign. And when it comes to the tech sector, that has meant taking square aim at giant companies like Facebook — companies she says have become so large that they are stifling competition. Ms. Warren rolled out a proposal to break up Facebook, Amazon and other tech giants in March. To ensure that tech workers got her message, her campaign paid for a billboard near a major transit station in San Francisco. It read “Break Up Big Tech,” in capital letters. On Tuesday, nearly seven months after Ms. Warren first unveiled her plan, The Verge offered a window into what Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, thinks about it. In leaked audio recordings of open meetings with employees this summer, Mr. Zuckerberg can be heard saying that the company would sue if Ms. Warren were to enact the plan as president. “If she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,” he said. “Does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don’t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. That’s not like the position you want to be in. We care about our country and want to work with our government to do good things,” he added. “But look, at the end of the day, if someone’s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.” Shortly after The Verge published Mr. Zuckerberg’s remarks, Ms. Warren responded by renewing her criticism of Facebook. “What would really ‘suck,’” she said, mimicking Mr. Zuckerberg’s language, “is if we don’t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.” The surfacing of grievances between Ms. Warren and Mr. Zuckerberg has the effect of publicly pitting one of the leading Democratic candidates for president against the head of the world’s largest social network, at a time when Silicon Valley in general and Facebook in particular continue to be scrutinized for their efforts to combat disinformation and prevent election interference in 2020 and beyond. In the audio recording clipped and published by The Verge, Mr. Zuckerberg ties his criticism of Ms. Warren’s plan to concerns about election interference. “It’s just that breaking up these companies, whether it’s Facebook or Google or Amazon, is not actually going to solve the issues,” he said. “And, you know, it doesn’t make election interference less likely. It makes it more likely because now the companies can’t coordinate and work together.” After the leaked audio was published and Ms. Warren responded, Mr. Zuckerberg commented on the episode in a Facebook post. “Every week I do a Q&A at Facebook where employees get to ask me anything and I share openly what I’m thinking on all kinds of projects and issues,” he said. “The transcript from one of my Q&As a few months ago just got published online — and even though it was meant to be internal rather than public, now that it’s out there, you can check it out if you’re interested in seeing an unfiltered version of what I’m thinking and telling employees on a bunch of topics.” Ms. Warren, meanwhile, used the renewed focus on the issue as an opportunity to reiterate that she is “not afraid to hold Big Tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon accountable.” In her proposal, Ms. Warren argues that the tech giants have essentially developed monopolies — they have “bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else.” Her plan calls for legislation that would prohibit platforms like Amazon from both offering a marketplace for commerce and participating in that marketplace; appointing regulators to undo some tech mergers; and rolling back some acquisitions by tech giants, such as Facebook’s deals for WhatsApp and Instagram. Later Tuesday, she pressed the issue, firing off a five-tweet thread that began: “Let’s talk a bit about my plan to #BreakUpBigTech and why it’s got Mark Zuckerberg so worked up.” “Facebook is doing pretty well right now,” Ms. Warren said, citing its acquisitions as evidence that tech companies had amassed significant power and face little competition. “Imagine Facebook and Instagram trying to outdo each other to protect your privacy and keep misinformation out of your feed, instead of working together to sell your data, inundate you with misinformation, and undermine our election security,” she said. “That’s why we need to #BreakUpBigTech.” By offering a steady diet of detailed policy proposals, Ms. Warren has grown her following significantly and risen to the top of the polls. Her plans to reshape the government extend to areas like the economy and education, where she has called for a wealth tax and canceling student loan debt. “We have these giant corporations — do I have to tell that to people in Long Island City? — that think they can roll over everyone,” Ms. Warren told a crowd there earlier this year, after Amazon pulled out of plans to build a new campus in the neighborhood. “I’m sick of freeloading billionaires.”",The New York Times
2019,Zuckerberg to Admit That Facebook Has Trust Issues,"SAN FRANCISCO — Mark Zuckerberg hopes that one day, in the not too distant future, billions of people will use a cryptocurrency created by Facebook to send money to friends and family around the world. Mr. Zuckerberg also recognizes that his company is a major impediment to that vision. Mr. Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, is expected to admit as much on Wednesday when he testifies about his company’s cryptocurrency project at a House Financial Services Committee hearing. “I believe this is something that needs to get built, but I understand we’re not the ideal messenger right now,” Mr. Zuckerberg will say, according to written testimony submitted before the hearing. “I know some people wonder whether we can be trusted to build payment services that protect consumers.” A torrent of criticism has been directed toward Facebook’s cryptocurrency effort, called Libra, since it was announced in June. But the company is pressing on. And Facebook officials over the last week have been on a charm offensive with regulators and lawmakers in Washington, leading up to Wednesday’s hearing. In his testimony, Mr. Zuckerberg is expected to promote the benefits of Libra. He plans to describe Libra as a democratizing financial system that will mostly benefit the poor, as well as the estimated 14 million people in the United States who do not have access to bank accounts and who cannot afford banking fees. “People pay far too high a cost — and have to wait far too long — to send money home to their families abroad. The current system is failing them,” Mr. Zuckerberg said in the advance version of his testimony. “The financial industry is stagnant and there is no digital financial architecture to support the innovation we need. I believe this problem can be solved, and Libra can help.” Facebook’s cryptocurrency project is the latest controversy to draw Mr. Zuckerberg to Washington. Last week, he delivered a manifesto on free expression at Georgetown University, defying requests by Democratic politicians to take down false and misleading information by political leaders. Weeks earlier, he met with President Trump and Republican lawmakers to beat down accusations that Facebook gives priority to liberal-leaning content. The House hearing will be the second time Mr. Zuckerberg has testified on Capitol Hill. In 2018, he was asked to respond to claims that the company did not properly handle its users’ data and had not treated privacy concerns with seriousness. A few weeks after Libra was unveiled, Maxine Waters, Democrat from California and chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, led several lawmakers in a call for Facebook to stop the project until it was vetted by lawmakers and regulators. David Marcus, the Facebook executive in charge of Libra, appeared before Ms. Waters’s committee in July, but he appeared to make little progress toward détente with the lawmakers. Central bankers around the world have also expressed concerns about Libra. And regulators say they do not have clear answers on how Facebook will handle important tasks like preventing criminal activity and ensuring the privacy of users. Facebook officials envision Libra being incorporated into the company’s various messaging services, like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. It could, over time, create a new revenue stream for the company. Though Facebook said it plans to allow people to use the cryptocurrency free, executives proposed offering different types of consumer financial services if the cryptocurrency catches on. Calibra, the separate entity Facebook has created to work on the Libra project, could ultimately offer financial products to people who regularly use Libra — much as a bank would. Facebook originally brought on 27 partners to join a Libra Association in Switzerland that is supposed to govern the network. But several big-name partners, including PayPal, Mastercard and Visa, have dropped out in recent weeks. In his testimony, Mr. Zuckerberg will say that Facebook will not allow the project to move forward until it gains the approval of the necessary regulators. “Even though the Libra Association is independent and we don’t control it, I want to be clear: Facebook will not be part of launching the Libra payments system anywhere in the world until U.S. regulators approve,” he is expected to say. The committee oversees housing, and Ms. Waters is expected to press Mr. Zuckerberg on accusations that Facebook has allowed discriminatory ad targeting for housing.",The New York Times
2019,"Facebook’s Zuckerberg, Accused of Lying, Withstands a Washington ‘Beating’","WASHINGTON — Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, traveled to Washington to defend a cryptocurrency project that has become the latest target of lawmakers frustrated with the social media giant. He ended up answering a smorgasbord of questions on other issues on Wednesday, as members of the House Financial Services Committee took him to task for everything from political advertising and disinformation campaigns to work force diversity and child pornography. Representative Maxine Waters, the Democratic committee chairwoman, set the tone of the hearing early. She grilled Mr. Zuckerberg on Facebook’s willingness to allow unfettered speech across the platform and its recent decision to avoid vetting political advertising. “The impact of this will be a massive voter suppression effort. Your claim to promote freedom of speech does not ring true,” Ms. Waters said. In recent months lawmakers have spared neither Facebook nor Mr. Zuckerberg. On Wednesday, that criticism became more than five hours of political theater, making it glaringly apparent just how skeptical of Facebook Congress has become through nearly three years of controversy. The company now faces several investigations by regulators in a number of countries and by 47 state attorneys general, as well as increasing calls that it should be broken up into a number of smaller, less powerful companies. Mr. Zuckerberg acknowledged his company has a trust problem. “I get that I’m not the ideal messenger for this right now,” he said. “We certainly have work to do to build trust.” Despite occasional stumbles, Mr. Zuckerberg, accompanied by a nearly full front row of Facebook lawyers, top lobbyists and public relations executives, stayed calm under the harsh questioning. He did what he was supposed to do as the chief executive of a big company called to heel in Washington. He took the heat. Mr. Zuckerberg still brightened when the grab-bag discussion veered into the technical details of Libra. While presenting a rosy view of how the cryptocurrency would provide a safe way for billions of people around the world without bank accounts to exchange money affordably, he pledged Facebook would not offer Libra anywhere in the world “unless all U.S. regulators approve it.” Committee members questioned whether Facebook executives can be taken at their word. Representative Nydia M. Velázquez, a Democrat from New York, pointed to Facebook’s promise in its acquisition of WhatsApp in 2014 to keep the messaging app separate from the main Facebook platform. A few years later, Mr. Zuckerberg announced it would merge data between the two apps. “Do you understand why this record makes us concerned with Facebook entering the cryptocurrency space? Have you learned that you should not lie?” Ms. Velázquez said. “Congresswoman, I would disagree with the characterization,” he said before getting cut off by further questions. Representatives homed in on issues of national security, and the ways that bad actors have used cryptocurrencies to pursue illicit activity. “You’re creating a whole new currency, which could be anonymous, that could create a whole new threat to Americans and national security, which is a huge concern,” said Representative Carolyn Maloney, Democrat of New York. Representative Ann Wagner, a Republican from Missouri, said she was troubled by Facebook’s history of dealing with child pornography on the site. The company has reported discovering millions of exploitative images and videos. “You are not working hard enough, and end-to-end encryption is not going to help the problem,” Ms. Wagner said. Mr. Zuckerberg acknowledged the difficulties of policing a global platform, but was defensive as he was challenged on his company’s ability to respond to the proliferation of images on it. ”We work harder than any other company to identify this behavior,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, clashed with Mr. Zuckerberg on Facebook’s desire not to fact-check political campaign advertising. Ms. Tlaib said the practice had resulted in widespread hate-mongering and a flurry of false information about her, personally. “It is hate speech, it’s hate, and it’s leading to violence and death threats in my office,” she said. And in a particularly intense round of questioning, Representative Joyce Beatty, Democrat of Ohio, said she found Facebook’s track record on issues of diversity and inclusion at the company “appalling and disgusting.” Republican members of the committee were generally more supportive of Mr. Zuckerberg. Representative Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, the top-ranking Republican, said that Democrats were going too far in trying to rein in new technology like Libra. “American innovation is on trial today in this hearing,” Mr. McHenry said. Mr. Zuckerberg spoke to that point, saying if American regulators managed to stop Libra, it would help countries like China develop their own cryptocurrency projects — efforts that could hurt the United States and the dominant role of the dollar. “While we debate these issues, the rest of the world isn’t waiting,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. “If America doesn’t innovate, our financial leadership isn’t guaranteed.” A torrent of criticism has been directed toward Facebook’s cryptocurrency effort since it was announced in June. But Mr. Zuckerberg, who is personally fascinated by cryptocurrencies, is committed to the project. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, was one of Mr. Zuckerberg’s harshest questioners, more than five hours into the session. She said that in order to make decisions about Libra, “I think we need to dig into your past behavior.” She asked him about his recent outreach to conservative news outlets. “Do you see a potential problem here with a complete lack of fact-checking on political advertisements?” Mr. Zuckerberg replied: “In a democracy, I believe that people should be able to see for themselves what politicians are saying, and judge their character for themselves,” he said. In the week before the hearing, Facebook officials have tried courting regulators and lawmakers, and recently Mr. Zuckerberg has been defending the social network in Washington more assertively. Facebook has one of the biggest influence operations in Washington and has fortified its lobbying. It now works with 60 internal and contract lobbyists, about twice the number it had in 2016. The company is on track to spend $12.3 million to lobby the federal government in the first nine months of the year, compared with $12.6 million for all of last year, according to public filings. The financial industry and tech companies are growing increasingly leery of the cryptocurrency project. Facebook originally brought on 27 partners to join a Libra Association in Switzerland that is supposed to govern the network, but several big-name partners, including PayPal, Mastercard and Visa, have dropped out. Though Mr. Zuckerberg remained collected during the session, it was clear how difficult it would be for him to win lawmakers’ confidence. “It’s good to have someone that’s sturdy and resilient,” Representative Juan Vargas, Democrat of California, said to Mr. Zuckerberg. “You’re probably the right person at the right time to take this beating.”",The New York Times
2019,¿Qué hacer con la basura de los aviones?,"El pasajero promedio de una aerolínea deja más de un kilo de basura en cada vuelo. Una firma de diseño británica pretende usar hojas de plátano para reducir los desperdicios. Se ha calculado que el pasajero promedio de una aerolínea deja en el avión más de un kilo de basura que incluye desde audífonos y cubiertos de plástico desechables hasta sobras de comida y residuos de inodoros. Para lograr que los viajeros de las aerolíneas piensen —y hablen— sobre esa gran acumulación de basura, una empresa de diseño británica ha rediseñado la bandeja de los alimentos de la clase económica y remplazado el plástico con materiales renovables como posos de café, hojas de plátano y madera de coco. Jo Rowan es la directora asociada de estrategia de PriestmanGoode, una empresa que durante más de dos décadas ha aplicado el diseño a la experiencia de viajar en avión, lo que incluye las salas de espera en los aeropuertos y los asientos en cabina. Rowan afirma que la empresa está enfocando su atención en la parte menos “glamurosa” de las cosas. “Los desperdicios a bordo son un gran problema”, apuntó. “Se acumulan muy rápido cuando viajan 4000 millones de pasajeros al año”. Estos artículos rediseñados se exhiben en una exposición llamada A bordo: Reduce. Reutiliza. Reconsidera, que el mes pasado se inauguró en el Museo del Diseño de Londres. Hasta ahora, el problema ambiental más importante de viajar en avión —y la razón por la que, en agosto, la activista de 16 años Greta Thunberg decidió viajar de Europa a Nueva York en barco y no en avión— radica en las emisiones de carbono relacionadas con esta actividad, las cuales están aumentando a un ritmo más rápido de lo que se predijo en las proyecciones anteriores, que ya eran alarmantes. Sin embargo, a medida que es más accesible viajar en avión, y conforme más personas lo utilizan como medio de transporte, las aerolíneas han hecho compromisos públicos para reducir su impacto en el medioambiente, lo cual también contempla el manejo de los cubiertos de plástico y las sobras que dejan sus pasajeros. Debido a que no existe una autoridad central que supervise las estadísticas sobre la cantidad de basura que se produce en los aviones, es difícil obtener cifras exactas recientes. Sin embargo, la Asociación Internacional de Transporte Aéreo (IATA, por su sigla en inglés), un grupo comercial que representa a unas trescientas aerolíneas, realizó un pequeño estudio en el aeropuerto de Heathrow en Londres y calculó que el año pasado las aerolíneas generaron cerca de 6,7 millones de toneladas de basura en cabina. Como ahora proliferan las líneas aéreas de bajo costo y la industria del turismo sigue seduciendo a los clientes de clase media, esa cifra podría duplicarse durante la próxima década. “En esta etapa, es una muestra relativamente limitada”, comentó Chris Goater, vocero de esa asociación comercial. Pere Fullana i Palmer, director de la Cátedra UNESCO de Ciclo de Vida y Cambio Climático, un grupo de investigación con sede en Barcelona, ha profundizado aún más en el problema de la basura en las aerolíneas. “No podemos mejorar un sistema si no lo conocemos”, dijo. El grupo de investigación de Fullana i Palmer unió fuerzas con Iberia, Gate Gourmet, Ferrovial y Ecoembes para analizar aproximadamente 3800 kilos de basura de 145 vuelos a Madrid. Este grupo descubrió que el 33 por ciento era desperdicio de comida; el 28 por ciento, cartón y papel, y el 12 por ciento era plástico. Debido a que los consumidores se vuelven cada vez más conscientes del enorme impacto ambiental que genera viajar en avión, las aerolíneas se sienten cada vez más presionadas para tomar medidas. Alaska Airlines, Ryanair y British Airways han prometido públicamente reducir la basura, y Air France dijo que, para finales de este año, eliminará 210 millones de artículos de plástico de un solo uso, como tazas y removedores de bebidas. En mayo, en un vuelo de Qantas, al que la empresa llamó “el primer vuelo comercial que no generó basura para vertederos”, la aerolínea eliminó envases de raciones individuales de leche y crema Vegemite, y sirvió sus alimentos en recipientes hechos de caña de azúcar, con utensilios elaborados de fécula de cultivos. Un mes después, en un vuelo de Chicago a Los Ángeles, United Airlines sirvió los alimentos en vajillas “totalmente reciclables o biodegradables”. Sin embargo, será complicado replicar esas innovaciones a una mayor escala. Los vuelos habituales no están equipados con las instalaciones ni los sistemas necesarios para que los sobrecargos gestionen los artículos reciclables, según Megan Epler Wood, autora de Sustainable Tourism on a Finite Planet y directora de la Iniciativa Internacional de Turismo Sustentable de Harvard (Wood comentó que en un viaje reciente vio a una sobrecargo que separaba sin guantes los artículos reciclables). Señaló que la solución sería solicitar una colaboración entre las aerolíneas, las autoridades locales y los aeropuertos, los cuales tienen, en última instancia, la responsabilidad de manejar y transportar la basura. La IATA afirmó que, a fin de aumentar el porcentaje de reciclaje, se deberían replantear las normas que rigen el desperdicio de alimentos y bebidas a nivel internacional, mismas que implican un conjunto complejo de normas internacionales y específicas de cada país destinadas a evitar la diseminación de enfermedades. Pese a que toda la basura en cabina está sujeta a las normas del país donde aterriza el avión, algunos países europeos, además de Australia, Canadá, Nueva Zelanda y Estados Unidos, han impuesto medidas adicionales para proteger la agricultura. Esto significa que incluso los alimentos y las bebidas que están intactos, los cuales, según los cálculos de la IATA, conforman aproximadamente el 20 por ciento de toda la basura de la aerolínea, terminan en los vertederos o son incinerados. Según esta asociación comercial, las normas que regulan el plástico de un solo uso, el cual estará prohibido en la Unión Europea para 2021, también plantean retos. “Hemos otorgado mucho asesoramiento para que las aerolíneas se encarguen del problema de la basura en cabina”, señaló Michael Gill, director del entorno de la aviación de IATA. “Pero las aerolíneas no pueden resolver el problema por sí solas”. “Es necesario que las autoridades reguladoras comprendan el impacto en su totalidad”, prosiguió, “incluyendo el mayor consumo de energía y de agua, así como de mayores emisiones de CO₂ derivadas de llevar a bordo materiales más pesados”. Fullana i Palmer reconoció que se necesitaba una legislación que permita que se reciclen o que se conviertan en biogás más materiales, pero afirmó que ese cambio es posible. “Me siento optimista porque se ha hecho un gran avance para salvar a nuestro planeta”, comentó. “Este tsunami es tan fuerte que todos los sectores tendrán que adaptarse”. Al diseñar los artículos que van a bordo, PriestmanGoode consideró el peso, ya que cuanto más peso haya en una aeronave, mayores serán las emisiones de combustible. La bandeja está elaborada con posos y cascarillas de café (subproductos del café). Los platos están hechos de salvado de trigo prensado y, para remplazar los cubiertos de plástico, se propone un solo cubierto que funcione como cuchara y tenedor elaborado con madera de palma de coco, un producto de desecho que, de otra forma, los agricultores quemarían. “Si lo sostienes, no notas que no es plástico”, dijo Rowan. “Parte de lo que estábamos tratando de hacer era ver cómo podíamos lograr que esto fuera un producto tanto atractivo como sustentable”. El equipo también diseñó tapas para frascos y platos que por lo regular son de plástico transparente para que se sepa lo que hay dentro: una hoja de plátano prensada para las ensaladas y guarniciones, un barquillo comestible para el postre. Rowan mencionó que la meta es “que la gente piense sobre la manera en la que viaja y que las aerolíneas y los proveedores de servicios también piensen sobre lo que ofrecen”. También, Rowan señaló que las líneas aéreas y los proveedores han mostrado interés en estos productos, los cuales, por el momento, solo se encuentran disponibles en el museo hasta febrero. “Estamos llevando esto al siguiente nivel de desarrollo para poder echar a volar algunas de estas cosas”, afirmó.",The New York Times
2019,قامت روسيا بقصف أربع مشافي في سورية خلال١٢ساعة فقط. استطعنا إثبات ذلك.,تظهر مجموعة من التسجيلات الصوتية للقوات الجوية الروسية، التي حصلت عليها التايمز، كيف ساعدهم قصف المستشفيات في إنقاذ حكومة بشار الأسد. وفقا لتحقيق قامت به صحيفة التايمز، قامت القوات الجوية الروسية و بشكل متكرر بقصف المشافي في سورية لدعم نظام بشار الأسد لسحق ما تبقى من المعارضة السورية. من خلال تحليل تسجيلات صوتية للقوات الجوية الروسية غير منشورة من قبل، وتصريحات شهود العيان والعاملين في مراكز مراصد حركة الطيران الحربي، تمكنت التايمز من تتبع غارات جوية استهدفت أربع مشافي خلال ١٢ساعة فقط في شهر أيار/مايو، و أثبتت تورط الطيارين الروس بشن كل من هذه الغارات. تعتبر فترة الـ ١٢ ساعة في يوم ٥ أيار/ مايو مدة صغيرة من الحرب الجوية في سوريا، ولكنها نموذج مصغر عن التدخل العسكري الروسي الذي استمر لأربع سنوات خلال الحرب الأهلية في سوريا. تم فتح جبهة جديدة في الصراع السوري هذا الأسبوع ، عندما عبرت القوات التركية الحدود مع سوريا كجزء من حملة تخوضها ضد الميليشيات الكردية. لطالما اتُهمت روسيا بالقيام بهجمات ممنهجة ضد المستشفيات والعيادات في المناطق التي تسيطر عليها المعارضة السورية كجزء من استراتيجيتها لمساعدة الأسد على الانتصار في الحرب الدائرة منذ ثماني سنوات. قامت منظمة أطباء من أجل حقوق الإنسان ، وهي مجموعة من الناشطين الحقوقيين تتابع الهجمات على العاملين في المجال الطبي في سوريا ، بتوثيق ما لا يقل عن ٥٨٣ من الهجمات المماثلة منذ عام ٢٠١١ ، ٢٦٦ من هذه الهجمات تم تنفيذها منذ بدء تدخل روسيا في أكتوبر٢٠١٥، هذا وقد قتل ما لا يقل عن ٩١٦ عاملاً في المجال الطبي في سوريا منذ العام ٢٠١١. جمعت التايمز مجموعة كبيرة من الأدلة لتحليل تفجيرات المشافي التي وقعت في يوم ٥ و ٦ مايو. من خلال المشاركات على مواقع التواصل الاجتماعي من سوريا في ذلك اليوم والمقابلات مع شهود العيان وسجلات الجمعيات الخيرية التي تدعم المستشفيات الأربعة، أصبح من الممكن الحصول على الوقت التقريبي لكل غارة. حصلت التايمز على سجلات لحركة الطيران يحتفظ بها مراقبون من الأرض لتحذير المدنيين من الغارات الجوية القادمة نحوهم، و تحققت من وقت كل غارة لتأكيد أن الطائرات الحربية الروسية كانت تحلق فوق هذه المناطق. بعد ذلك استمعنا وعملنا على فك رموز الآلاف من موجات بث الراديو التابع للقوات الجوية الروسية ، والذي وثق أشهر من نشاط الطيارين في سماء شمال غرب سوريا. حصلت التايمز على التسجيلات من قبل شبكة من المراقبين الذين أصروا على عدم الكشف عن هويتهم خوفاً على سلامتهم. سجلات المراقبين في يوم ٥ و ٦ مايو تؤكد تحليق الطيارين الروس فوق كل مستشفى في الوقت الذي تم قصفه، كما تظهر السجلات الصوتية للقوات الجوية في ذلك اليوم الطيارين الروس خلال تأكيدهم لكل غارة. وأكدت مقاطع الفيديو التي تم الحصول عليها من الشهود، والتي تحققت التايمز منها، وقوع ثلاثة غارات. إن قصف المستشفيات بدون مبالاة أو عن قصد هو جريمة حرب ، لكن إثبات المسؤولية عن ارتكاب جرائم الحرب وسط حرب أهلية معقدة مسألة صعبة للغاية. فحتى الآن ، يفتقر العاملون في المجال الطبي في سوريا و منظمات حقوق الإنسان إلى دليل على هذه الجرائم. إن مركز روسيا كعضو دائم في مجلس الأمن التابع للأمم المتحدة قد منحها الحماية من التدقيق وجعل منظمات الأمم المتحدة مترددة في اتهام القوات الجوية الروسية بالمسؤولية. “إن الهجمات على المراكز الصحية في سوريا ، وكذلك القصف العشوائي للمرافق المدنية هي بكل تأكيد جرائم حرب ينبغي المحاسبة عليها في المحكمة الجنائية الدولية في لاهاي” تقول سوزانا سيركين، مديرة السياسات في منظمة أطباء من أجل حقوق الإنسان. و تكمل قائلة بأن الصين و روسيا استخدمتا حق النقض (الفيتو) للاعتراض “وبصورة مخزية” على قرار لمجلس الأمن كان من شأنهما إحالة تلك الجرائم إلى المحكمة. لم ترد الحكومة الروسية مباشرة على أسئلة حول قصف المستشفيات الأربعة. بدلاً من الرد، أشار متحدث باسم وزارة الخارجية إلى تصريحات سابقة تدعي أن سلاح الجو الروسي ينفذ ضربات دقيقة فقط على “أهداف تمت دراستها بدقة”. فتح الأمين العام للأمم المتحدة ، أنطونيو غوتيريس تحقيقًا في قضية استهداف المستشفيات في أغسطس / آب. التحقيق و الذي لا يزال جارياً، يهدف جزئيًا إلى تحديد سبب الهجوم على المستشفيات على الرغم من أن تلك المستشفيات أضافت مواقعها طوعًا إلى قائمة منع الاستهداف التي ترعاها الأمم المتحدة والتي تم إعلام روسيا و أطراف الصراع الأخرى بها لمنعهم من الهجوم عليها. يقول سوريون عاملون في القطاع الصحي أنه يبدو أن قائمة الأمم المتحدة أصبحت تستخدم كقائمة أهداف عسكرية من قبل الطيران الحربي السوري و الروسي. قال ستيفان دوجاريك ، المتحدث باسم الأمين العام للأمم المتحدة ، في سبتمبر / أيلول إن التحقيق - وهو لجنة داخلية لتقصي الحقائق - لن يقوم بنشر تقرير، كما أنه لن يحدد “المسؤولية القانونية” لأي طرف من الأطراف. فاسيلي نيبينسيا ، المندوب الروسي الدائم لدى الأمم المتحدة ،شكك بآلية عمل اللجنة بعد الإعلان عنها بفترة قصيرة ، معربًا عن أمله في ألا يكون هذا التحقيق لكشف الجناة بل يجب أن يكون بحسب قوله تحقيق عن استخدام الأمم المتحدة لمعلومات كاذبة في عملية إنهاء النزاع. وقال مكتب الأمم المتحدة لحقوق الإنسان إنه في الفترة الواقعة بين ٢٩ أبريل وحتى منتصف سبتمبر، عندما هاجمت القوات الحكومية الروسية والسورية آخر معاقل المعارضة في شمال غرب سوريا، تعرضت ٥٤ مستشفى وعيادة في مناطق المعارضة السورية للهجوم. وفقًا لمنظمة الصحة العالمية، حاول ما لا يقل عن سبعة مشافي حماية أنفسهم من خلال إضافة مواقعهم إلى قائمة منع الاستهداف. في 5 و ٦ مايو، هاجمت روسيا أربعة مستشفيات كان جميعها ضمن القائمة. البداية كانت عند مشفى نبض الحياة الجراحي، و هو أحد أكبر مراكز معالجة الصدمات النفسية في جنوب محافظة إدلب حيث يقوم هذا المشفى بخدمة حوالي مئتي ألف شخص. هذا وقد كان يجري المستشفى حوالي ٥٠٠ عملية جراحية و يستقبل ٥٠٠٠ مريض شهريًا ، وفقًا لإحصائيات منظمة سوريا للإغاثة والتنمية، وهي منظمة خيرية داعمة للمشفى مقرها الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية. تعرض مستشفى نبض الحياة للهجوم ثلاث مرات منذ افتتاحه في عام ٢٠١٣و تم نقله مؤخرًا إلى مجمع تحت الأرض يقع في أرض زراعية، على أمل أن تتم حمايته من الغارات الجوية. في الساعة ٢:٣٢ مساءً من يوم ٥ مايو ، يمكن سماع ضابط روسي يعمل في غرفة التحكم بحركة الطيران في تسجيل صوتي وهو يزود الطيار بخطوط الطول و العرض المتوافقة تمامًا مع موقع مستشفى نبض الحياة. في الساعة ٢:٣٨ بعد الظهر ، يقول الطيار أن الهدف مشاهد بالنسبة له و يؤكد أن لديه “التصحيح” وهي كلمة تدل أن الهدف أصبح الآن على الشاشة في قمرة قيادة الطائرة. يستجيب مركز التحكم الأرضي بإعطاء الضوء الأخضر قائلاً: “ثلاتة سبعات”. وفي الوقت نفسه ، يسجل المراقبون مشاهدة طائرة حربية روسية تحلق في أجواء المنطقة. في تمام الساعة ٢:٤٠ مساءً ، وهو نفس الوقت الذي تعرض فيه نبض الحياة للقصف بحسب ما قالته المؤسسة الخيرية ، يؤكد الطيار إلقاء القذائف قائلاً: “نفذت”. بعد ثوانٍ ، قام الصحفيون المحليون الذين توقعوا الهجوم بتصوير المستشفى و تسجيل سقوط ثلاث مقذوفات دقيقة الهدف. تخترق هذه المقذوفات سطح المستشفى وتقوم بتفجيرها من الداخل وملئها بالركام و الغبار. كان قد تم إجلاء موظفي نبض الحياة قبل ثلاثة أيام من الهجوم وذلك بعد تلقيهم للتحذيرات التي توقعت حدوث غارة، لكن مستشفى كفرنبل الجراحي على بعد ثلاثة أميال شمال غرب المنطقة لم يحالفه نفس الحظ. قال أحد الأطباء العاملين هناك إن المستشفى تعرض للقصف أربع مرات، ابتداء من الساعة ٥:٣٠ مساءً۔ وقال إن الغارات حصلت بفارق زمني يقدر بحوالي الخمس دقائق بين الغارة و الأخرى دون سابق إنذار، مما أدى إلى مقتل رجل كان يقف في الخارج، وأجبر المرضى والطاقم الطبي على استخدام عبوات الأكسجين للتنفس وسط الغبار الخانق. سجل مراقبون مشاهدة طائرة روسية تحلق في الأجواء أثناء وقت الغارة، وفي تسجيل آخر للقوات الجوية الروسية ، أبلغ طيار أنه “نفذ” هدفه في الساعة ٥:٣٠ مساءً، وهو نفس وقت الغارة. ثم يبلغ الطيار عن ثلاث غارات بفارق يقدر بحوالي الخمس دقائق مما يتطابق مع التسلسل الزمني الذي أدلى به لطبيب. قصف الطيارون الروس مستشفيين آخرين في إطار ١٢ ساعة: مستشفى كهف كفر زيتا ومستشفى الأمل لجراحة العظام. في كلتا الحالتين، سجل المراقبون تواجد للقوات الجوية الروسية في الأجواء تزامناً مع وقت حدوث الغارات، كما أنه ممكن في الوقت نفسه سماع الطيارين الروس في تسجيلات الراديو وهم “ينفذون” أهدافهم في الوقت نفسه. منذ ٥ مايو، تعرض ما لا يقل عن ٢٤ مستشفى وعيادة في منطقة شمال غرب سوريا الواقعة تحت سيطرة المعارضة لاستهداف بالغارات الجوية. قال عاملون سوريون في القطاع الطبي إنهم يتوقعون استمرار استهداف المستشفيات بسبب عجز الأمم المتحدة ودول أخرى عن إيجاد طريقة لمحاسبة روسيا. وقال رئيس الممرضين في مستشفى نبض الحياة و الذي طلب عدم الكشف عن هويته خشية أن يكون مستهدفاً: “لطالما كانت الحجة من جانب الروس أو النظام هي أن المستشفيات تتم إدارتها من قبل مجموعات إرهابية”. و يكمل قائلاً: “هل من الممكن حقاً أن يكون جميع الناس إرهابيين؟”. “الحقيقة هي أنه بعد استهداف المستشفيات، و خصوصاً في مناطق مثل هذه حيث يوجد مستشفى واحد فقط، أصبحت منازلنا مستشفيات” ساهم في إعداد التقارير: ديمتري خافين وويتني هورست مالاكي براون وكوكترونغ بوي وجون إيسمي.,The New York Times
2019,‘#Female Pleasure’ Review: Fighting the Patriarchy,"Barbara Miller’s humane profile of five women fighting back against sexism and misogyny is a hopeful, clearheaded confessional. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Sexism and oppression wear many guises in “#Female Pleasure,” Barbara Miller’s illuminating if one-sided overview of the myriad ways in which women’s sexuality is controlled and subjugated. Profiling five women fighting back against repressive cultural and religious traditions, the film allows each to explain her embrace of activism. The Jewish author Deborah Feldman, who fled what she describes as crushing treatment in her Hasidic community in Brooklyn, now writes and lectures about her experiences. An inventive sex educator in India runs a website to advise young people about healthy relationships. And in Japan, the high-spirited manga artist Rokudenashiko challenges lopsided obscenity laws by fashioning art using molds and 3-D scans of her genitals. In a dramatically more poignant segment, a former nun describes her quest for justice and spiritual peace after being repeatedly raped by her superior, a Catholic priest. Quoting excerpts from Christian, Jewish and Hindu texts, Miller emphasizes how frequently sexual oppression and violence seem justified by scripture. It’s a cursory condemnation that makes little distinction between mainstream and outlier beliefs; yet it usefully illustrates the documentary’s choice of breadth over depth, testimony over discussion. Despite its distressing focus, “#Female Pleasure” isn’t an angry or accusatory film. The tone is confessional, clearheaded and often upbeat, the women relating their experiences with candor and resolve. Its most powerful segment shows the Somali-born psychotherapist Leyla Hussein, a prominent campaigner against female genital mutilation, demonstrating the brutal procedure to a group of young men using a large clay model. The horror on their faces may be the most hopeful image in the entire movie. #Female Pleasure Not rated. In English, German and Japanese, with subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 37 minutes.

2019,‘A Caricature of the Patriarchy’: Argentine Feminists Remake Tango,"buenos aires dispatch A group of activists is trying to make tango less dogmatic about traditional gender roles, and more assertive about rooting out sexual harassment and assault. BUENOS AIRES — Liliana Furió’s ruby red flat shoes glided across the dance floor in swift, assured moves, making her baggy pants sway gently. She and a lean young Russian man were rapture personified, clasped in a tight embrace as they circled counterclockwise with a few other pairs in perfect synchrony. But it was hard to tell who was leading whom. Some pairs appeared lost in a loving embrace while others swung back and forth playfully. And that is precisely what Ms. Furió had in mind when she created a weekly dance fest that would break all the rules of tango, Argentina’s prime cultural export. Ms. Furió started renting venues for the event earlier this year, calling it La Furiosa — or the livid woman. It’s part of a push by Argentine feminists to make tango less patriarchal. In traditional tango, men invite women to dance through a subtle head-jolt gesture known as a cabeceo, often signaled from across the room. On the dance floor, the man asserts control in a sequence of moves, often fast-paced, jolting and limb-entangling, that range from teasingly sensual to uncomfortably domineering. Whether they’re loving or enduring it, the women, who are expected to wear cocktail dresses and high heels, must hold tight for four-song sets. Veteran tango dancers say the 15-minute stretches can turn into agony when a male partner’s embrace feels suffocating — or when his hand wanders well beneath the waistline. “It’s a bit of a game to test where the limits are,” said Victoria Beytia, an avid tango dancer who, along with Ms. Furió, is part of a loose coalition of activists known as the Tango Feminist Movement. In July the group published a protocol to make tango halls less dogmatic about traditional gender roles and more assertive about rooting out sexual harassment and assault. The protocol provides suggested guidelines for tango venue organizers, including acceptance of couples who depart from heteronormative roles. It also offers guidance on how to handle instances of harassment and abuse, advising, for instance, that men accused of acting inappropriately on the dance floor be asked to leave. “Tango is a reflection of what is happening in our culture, and for a long time our culture has allowed men to touch you when they want to and if you complain you’re dismissed as crazy,” Ms. Beytia said. Ms. Furió, a 56-year-old documentary filmmaker, became acquainted with tango as a child. Her father, a strict military intelligence officer who years later would be convicted of grave crimes committed during Argentina’s dictatorship, made watching “The Grand Values of Tango,” a weekly television show, an obligatory family ritual. The show paid homage to the sensual, theatrical dance that arose in poor immigrant enclaves and attained mainstream appeal among Argentines. “I had a fascination with the dance,” Ms. Furió said on a recent morning, sitting in the sun-drenched living room of the apartment she shares with her German wife. “That unique embrace, those sensual choreographies, it’s something that I remember vividly.” As an adult, she began attending the storied tango halls in Buenos Aires known as milongas. But her passion for the dance was deflated by the rituals and codes of conduct that struck her as sexist and demeaning. Argentine tango is the product of a confluence of rhythms and traditions that intersected in the 1700s and 1800s, in poor districts of Buenos Aires that were home to European immigrants, former African slaves and locals. Initially shunned by elites and the Catholic Church, which deemed the dance transgressive and obscene, tango was ultimately embraced widely as Argentina received a huge influx of immigrants in the early 1900s, and Buenos Aires became a world-renowned cosmopolitan city. The lyrics of many tango classics are as dramatic as the genre, telling stories of passionate love, desperate longing and betrayal. But several are explicit odes to the subjugation of women, and physical violence against them, and are jarring to listen to today. The song “Amablemente,” or “Kindly,” tells the story of a man who walks in on his partner in the arms of another man. The male lover is dismissed, because, as the lyricist Iván Díez put it, “the man is not culpable in these cases.” The betrayed lover then demands that the woman prepare him a beverage, leans over to kiss her forehead and “kindly stabbed her 34 times.” “Tortazos,” by Edmundo Rivero, is an angry screed to a female lover who has moved on. “I don’t break you with one smack only because I don’t want to hit you on the street!” the song goes. “For a while, those lyrics were second nature and I would just laugh at them,” Ms. Furió said. But this subset of tango history began to come under scrutiny as Argentina’s feminist movement grew in visibility and vigor. In 2015, a campaign to draw attention to violence against women galvanized millions. Soraya Rizzardini González, a tango instructor who is part of the Tango Feminist Movement and helped draft the protocol, said that while songs that seem to explicitly condone violence may be a minority, tango has always reflected pervasive structural sexism in Argentina. The earliest film recordings of tango, she said, depict women being treated as “rag dolls” across the dance floor. “The gender roles are fixed,” Ms. González said. “One person is leading and the other is not.” “Tango is a caricature of the patriarchy,” she added. In the 1990s, gay Argentines began organizing dance collectives that upended the staid rules. In what began as a small, underground scene that would blossom, tango aficionados created spaces in which women could take the lead and same-sex couples could alternate between the leading and passive roles. An advertisement for queer tango lessons made Ms. Furió do a double-take in 2003. Having recently come out of the closet, she found the idea enthralling. “It meant being able to take ownership of a piece of heritage that is so deeply ours, but that had been accessible only to a segment of the population,” she said. “There was something very subversive about that.” Ms. Furió said learning to lead in tango took more than conventional classes; it required a psychological breakthrough as she came to terms with years of feeling belittled, underestimated and generally jerked around in her life. But there was a magical turning point, she said, when she learned she could embrace the assertive role on the dance floor. “As a woman, you realize that you can lead and that you can do it well,” she said. “Over the years, I have helped many women that struggled with the same thing.” As more women became tango instructors, and taught the dance in a gender fluid way, Buenos Aires milongas started embracing same-sex couples, women leading men on the dance floor and other breaks with convention. Some tango aficionados remain doggedly committed to tradition. Héctor Norberto Pellozo, who heads the old school milonga Los Cachirulos, insists that guests at his dance party dress elegantly and adhere to the courting rituals in which women must await interest from men. On a recent night, he and his wife welcomed old and new patrons effusively as he led women and men to sit on opposite sides of the dance floor. Mr. Pellozo scoffed at the suggestion that tango has perpetuated gender inequality and enabled abusive men. “Women know how to earn respect,” he said. “The issue now is that women want to overtake men.” Mr. Pellozo said that while he respected gay people, the notion that they can partake in tango was blasphemy. “Being chest to chest is not the same as it is between a man and a woman,” he said. Having been expelled from Mr. Pellozo’s milonga once for trying to dance with another woman, Ms. Furió is no fan. But she seems to be having the last laugh, drawing larger crowds at La Furiosa. “We’ve perhaps broadened it into something that is fraternal and not necessarily sensual,” she said. Still, watching her and her patrons dance under dim red lights while a live band played, it was easy to drift into something approaching a hypnotic state. An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the given name of one of the dancers. He is Rodrigo Barraza, not Eodrigo.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Addams Family’ Climbs Box Office, but ‘Joker’ Stays on Top","“Joker” left room for the arrival of another, less violently somber movie (with similarly strong Halloween costume potential): “The Addams Family.” It was a good weekend for gloom. Warner Bros. continued to rake in money with the grave supervillain origin story “Joker,” which topped the domestic box office Friday through Sunday with an estimated $55 million in ticket sales. The movie picked up an additional $123.7 million overseas this weekend according to the studio, bringing its worldwide cumulative tally to about $543.9 million after only its second weekend in theaters. The R-rated “Joker,” which stars Joaquin Phoenix, also left room for the arrival of another, less violently somber movie (with similarly strong Halloween costume potential): “The Addams Family.” That animated film opened to about $30.3 million in ticket sales this weekend, landing it in second place, above prerelease expectations. “The Addams Family,” distributed in the United States by United Artists Releasing, offers a new take on the macabre comics by Charles Addams. Following in the footsteps of past “Addams Family” adaptations, the computer-animated comedy begins its story with the wedding of Gomez (voiced in this version by Oscar Isaac) and Morticia (Charlize Theron). The plot involves the pair making their home in an abandoned asylum in New Jersey and, years later, confronting a planned-community development that encroaches on the family’s deliberately spooky surroundings. The voice cast also includes Allison Janney, Chloë Grace Moretz, Finn Wolfhard, Bette Midler and Snoop Dogg. “The Addams Family” was a hit despite lackluster reviews: it currently holds a 44 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. In his review for The New York Times, Ben Kenigsberg wrote that the movie “has just enough wit and weirdness to honor its source material.” [Read “The Addams Family” review.] In third place was Paramount’s action thriller “Gemini Man,” which opened to around $20.5 million in domestic sales according to Comscore, which compiles box office data. That is a letdown given that the movie stars Will Smith, and was directed by Ang Lee. It also cost a reported $138 million to produce. “Gemini Man” cast Smith as a retired sniper being hunted by his younger clone, whose appearance is achieved through digital effects. The movie currently holds a 26 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, an unenthusiastic critical response that might have veered audiences looking for star power and violent action toward “Joker,” which sits at 68 percent. Rounding out the top five were Universal’s “Abominable,” which made around $6.2 million during its third weekend in theaters and “Downton Abbey,” distributed by Focus Features, which was in its fourth weekend and sold around $4.9 million in tickets. Lionsgate’s “Jexi,” a comedy starring Adam Devine that opened this weekend, landed further down the ranks with roughly $3.1 million in ticket sales.",The New York Times
2019,‘An Exorcism Must Be Done’: An Anti-Putin Shaman Sets Off Unrest,"ULAN-UDE, Russia — A long-haired shaman arrived on foot from the frozen north, dragging a cart with yurt poles and a stove, and preaching that the president is a demon. Days later, a cabby, invoking the shaman, strode up to the Kremlin-allied mayor of this Siberian city, yelled a string of grievances and posted his rant on YouTube. Public protests erupted and continued for weeks, but the shaman kept walking west — headed to Moscow, “the heart of evil,” he said, to exorcise Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin. Then, what he called “dark forces” — a SWAT team — packed him onto a plane to Yakutsk, a remote regional capital in eastern Siberia. “My tales coincided with the desperation of Russians who live with injustice, poverty and destitution,” the shaman, Aleksandr Gabyshev, said in an interview at his sister’s one-room log cabin off a muddy road on the outskirts of Yakutsk. Referring to Mr. Putin, he added: “In him there is much evil, and he himself embodies the powers of evil, so an exorcism must be done.” That a mystic and a video-blogging taxi driver could touch off prolonged unrest in Ulan-Ude, a city of 400,000 people, underscored the depth and breadth of a new season of Russian discontent. A spike in dissent nationwide shows that after years of economic stagnation, Russians’ patience with their government is wearing thin. Pollsters report a sustained slump in Mr. Putin’s approval ratings in the last 12 months and a growing rejection of state television’s propaganda drumbeat. Waves of protest have roiled Moscow since June, resulting in thousands of arrests and prompting the Kremlin to make rare concessions. There is no unified nationwide protest movement that might threaten Mr. Putin’s two-decade rule, but in a growing number of flash points, years of pent-up grievances are being unleashed by previously unknown figures, or by one indignity too many. And despite the threat of arrest, dissenters like Mr. Gabyshev are willing to hold Mr. Putin directly responsible for their problems. In an echo of how the Soviet Union treated dissidents, the shaman now faces incarceration in a mental institution. His lawyers say the Federal Security Service, a successor to the K.G.B., told them last week that their client required psychiatric treatment. “This is most terrifying — what we really feared,” said one of the lawyers, Boris Andreyev. Mr. Gabyshev’s team says it will fight the attempt to commit him, a process that could take months. In the meantime, he is under orders not to leave Yakutsk. The patriotic fervor that overshadowed Russia’s economic problems in the wake of the Crimea annexation of 2014 has largely dissipated, and disposable incomes are effectively below what they were in 2013. Emboldened by cheap, expanding and mostly uncensored high-speed internet access, Russians are becoming braver in speaking out, knowing that even if the state news media ignores their voices, millions can hear them online. That’s why Dmitry Bairov, the cabby whose tirade drew more attention to Mr. Gabyshev, rarely leaves home without two smartphones in his gray shoulder bag, a battery pack at his hip and a tripod clip dangling from a carabiner. “I see that there is injustice — I hear it, I see it, and I talk about it,” Mr. Bairov said, adding that YouTube “is the only medium of — what’s it called? — freedom of speech.” Mr. Gabyshev, 50, is a former welder, plumber and carpenter who took up shamanism in the tradition of his people, the Sakha, more than a decade ago, after his wife died. He said he had lived as a hermit in the Siberian forest for more than two years. By the time he reached Ulan-Ude in late August, he had traveled for nearly six months, covering 1,600 miles. He predicted that thousands would join him along the two-year, 5,000-mile march to Moscow, to help exorcise Mr. Putin. Passers-by spread word of his journey, posting videos showing his wispy beard and singsong speech. Mr. Bairov learned about Mr. Gabyshev from other video bloggers on YouTube. He used a cabby chat group in the messaging app Viber to help organize support for the shaman as he approached Ulan-Ude. After the authorities detained one of Mr. Gabyshev’s supporters, Mr. Bairov accosted Mayor Igor Shutenkov on Sept. 9 next to the city’s most famous landmark, a 25-foot-tall head of Lenin. Mr. Shutenkov, backed by Mr. Putin’s United Russia party, had just beaten a popular Communist candidate in an election that critics called rigged. After Mr. Bairov parked his car at the central square to protest the treatment of the shaman’s group, the Communists parked a minivan nearby to protest the election results. The next afternoon, masked men in civilian clothes, wielding hatchets and backed up by riot police officers, stormed the two vehicles under Lenin’s gaze, broke the windows, dragged Mr. Bairov and a Communist politician into an unmarked white van and drove off. Anna Zuyeva, a longtime host on government-friendly local television, witnessed the raid and uploaded video of it to YouTube, where it was viewed around 800,000 times. The next day, she quit her job and refashioned herself from propaganda mouthpiece to critical blogger. “I don’t want to make a deal with my conscience,” she wrote on Instagram, adding in a later interview, “People can’t be silent anymore.” The ensuing protests were unheard-of for Ulan-Ude, a regional capital near the Mongolian border. It is home to the Mongol Buryat ethnic group, and residents describe the city as particularly calm. More than 1,000 protesters demanded new elections and the resignation of Alexey Tsydenov, the Putin-appointed governor of the region, Buryatya. They made huge banners showing a crossed-out hatchet, an instrument that quickly became the symbol of the state’s overreach. Cultural figures, including the artistic director of the government-funded State Russian Drama Theater, Sergey Levitsky, went public in support of the protesters even as more of the organizers were put in jail. “No matter what happened in Moscow or in other cities, everything in our city was always quiet,” Mr. Levitsky said. “People have crossed a threshold.” In Mr. Putin’s first decade in power, oil-fueled economic growth improved living standards and increased his popularity. Since then, low oil prices and Western sanctions have squeezed the country, but for years, Mr. Putin successfully convinced Russians that restoring their great-power status was worth the economic pain. Mikhail Dmitriev, a Moscow economist who uses nationwide focus groups to track public opinion, says the root of Russian discontent is economic, with years of stagnation in personal incomes breeding disdain for the authorities, distrust of the state news media and disinterest in Mr. Putin’s foreign policy adventures. But in the last year Mr. Dmitriev has detected a marked shift: For the first time since the early 1990s, most of his respondents said greater political freedom mattered more than higher incomes. “The conditions for a serious destabilization of the country don’t currently exist, but on the other hand this isn’t a static situation, it’s a dynamic one,” he said. The question now is how many more people will make the leap from private grumbling to public protest — the only effective way, many analysts say, to pressure the Kremlin. Anastasia Matveyeva, a 31-year-old entrepreneur in Ulan-Ude who organizes craft markets and nightclub parties, had no interest in politics until this year. But then one of her favorite YouTube stars, the popular journalist Yuri Dud, started voicing louder criticism of the state and backing the protests in Moscow. She began reading the opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s blog, which spotlights corruption in Russia’s ruling elite. She did not attend the rallies in Ulan-Ude, but is starting to think she needs to take responsibility for her country’s future. “I understand that, probably, something needs to be done,” Ms. Matveyeva said. Near a recent demonstration, a 55-year-old woman said she sympathized with the protesters but did not dare attend. As a company executive, she had too much to lose, she said, refusing to give her name for fear of retribution. “I’m a woman of the old days” whose relatives were executed by the Soviets, she said. “The fear is in my bones. The regime is coming back.” Mr. Gabyshev, the shaman, said that to exorcise Mr. Putin he would light a bonfire on Red Square, just outside the Kremlin wall. In the Sakha tradition, he would feed it fermented mare’s milk and horsehair, bang a leather drum and perform a prayer, and “Putin will come to his senses and quietly resign.” If the authorities were to prohibit the ritual, he said, people would rise up by the millions, calling for Mr. Putin to go. For now, he awaits his fate. He has moved out of his sister’s house, where after his detention he slept on two thin blue mattresses on the empty patch of floor, and is living in a separate cabin in the yard. The family still shares an outhouse. Mr. Gabyshev compared himself to a caterpillar that had been crawling slowly along a road and then wrapped itself in a cocoon. “A new world will appear out of this cocoon, flying very fast,” Mr. Gabyshev said. “No one knows when.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘As He Walked Toward Me, I Knew Instinctively That I Was in Trouble’","METROPOLITAN DIARY Recalling a thwarted childhood prank, help moving a car and more reader tales of New York City in this week’s Metropolitan Diary. Dear Diary: When I was 7, I noticed a fire alarm box on Central Park West, several blocks up from the Museum of Natural History. Not far from the alarm box, I found a Popsicle stick. For some reason, I thought it might be a good idea to use it to activate the alarm. I was too short, and the stick wasn’t making the reach any easier. Then I spotted an older gentleman in a black overcoat. He was watching what I was doing. As he walked toward me, I knew instinctively that I was in trouble. Unexpectedly, he smiled. I did not anticipate what followed. “If the fire trucks are here, and there’s a real fire at your home, the firemen won’t get there fast enough to save your family,” he said. “My grandma?” I said. He nodded. I dropped the stick and ran home. Thirty-five years later, I was on my way to teach a night course in Brooklyn. Ahead of me, I saw three boys. They looked like they might be around 7. Like 7-year-old me, they had found a fire alarm they couldn’t resist. I approached them and stood there watching, trying not to provoke fear. “If the firefighters respond to your false alarm here, they can’t get to a real fire in time, even if that fire is at your house,” I said. They went running off. — Andres Pérez y Mena Dear Diary: I went to get my Volkswagen Bug to drive to work. Because alternate side parking was in effect, it and all the other cars that were legally parked on the street had been blocked in. The car blocking mine had no note on the windshield with information about how to reach the owner. I honked. A man leaned out a nearby window. A few minutes later, he came down to move his car, which was in front of the one directly next to mine. I still couldn’t get out, because I was blocked in on the other side by a heavy wire fence around a tree that was planted there. I kept honking. By this time, a crowd had gathered. “I know,” said one of the men in the group. “Get in your car.” I did. Six guys surrounded my car, picked it up and put it down in way that allowed me to squeeze out. Everyone broke into applause as I drove away. — Louise Cooper Dear Diary: I was on Roosevelt Island on a second date. We had walked south after having a picnic. We sat on an elevated wall in the shade of some trees just as a large group walked north below us. They were all wearing white shirts, each one with a large letter on the chest. A W and two Ls walked by, and we began to wonder what it meant. Was it some kind of protest? A prank? Finally, I saw a question mark bringing up the rear. “What do you all spell?” I yelled. “We wrote ‘Will you marry me?’ to help our friend propose!” the question mark said. “Did she say yes?” my date and I asked. “She did!” the question mark replied. We congratulated him and laughed nervously, uncertain where our conversation would go next. — Rachel Sternlicht Dear Diary: It was a summer Saturday morning. I was riding my Vespa on the Upper East Side. I stopped at a red light at 95th Street and Park Avenue. To my right, I saw a man in his 60s drilling holes into the hood of a beat-up car. He then pushed his weight down as he inserted nails into the car. He was trying to make sure that the hood stayed shut. After a time, he stopped drilling. He looked up and noticed that I was watching him. “Nails,” he shouted. “Never enough nails.” He shut a toolbox that was sitting on the hood. Nails rained down on the ground. The light changed, and I drove off slowly. — Ramy Fakhr Dear Diary: I used to run into Cinnamon every morning as I walked through Central Park on my way to my job in Midtown. “This way, Cinnamon,” her owner would call out. What a nice name for a dog, I thought One morning, I overheard a woman who was reaching out to pet Cinnamon asking the dog’s owner if she was friendly. “She is,” he said, starting to walk off. “I’m not.” I chuckled as Cinnamon hurried after him. The woman stood there open-mouthed. When I got my new Pomeranian, a tiny ball of orange fur, I knew right away what I was going to name her. The next time I saw Cinnamon and her owner, I waved. He squinted. I told him I had named my puppy Cinnamon. He broke into a smile. “Great name,” he said, giving me a thumbs-up. As I hurried off to work I could hear him repeating: “Such a great name, such a great name.” — Masaki Sasaki Read all recent entries and our submissions guidelines.

2019,Opinion | ‘Baby Shark’ and the Sounds of Protest in Lebanon,"A tax on WhatsApp calls opens the floodgates of anger over corruption and Lebanese from all sects pour into the streets. Mr. Alameddine is a novelist. In a video shot in Lebanon over the weekend, a woman whose car is trapped among a sea of protesters, tells them that her toddler in the car is frightened. The protesters then launch into a song and dance of “Baby Shark” to calm the child. The video is both sweet and uplifting. It’s also surprising, because a Lebanese crowd acting in unison is such a rarity. On Thursday, Lebanese from all walks of life took to the streets to protest corruption, and as of this writing the crowds keep getting bigger, louder, and more united. The crowds on Sunday were estimated to be 1.3 million people, 20 percent of the population. What seems to have set off the protests was the government’s announcement of a tax on calls made using WhatsApp and other free online applications, supposedly to raise revenue during a fiscal crisis. The populace had protested a number of times before. In March 2005, in what became known as the Cedar Revolution, a huge protest erupted against the Syrian troops who, more than 15 years after the official end of the 15-year civil war, still occupied parts of Lebanon; that demonstration was followed by counterprotest by Hezbollah and other pro-Syrian groups. In 2015, people took to the street to protest the government’s mishandling of garbage collection — huge heaps of trash were left on the streets for months because government factions were openly jockeying for a piece of the next contract with the private company that picks up refuse. Although the 2015 protests were the first in quite a while to attract people from all the religious sects of Lebanon, the outcry itself was directed at some of the leaders, not all. In this latest round, however, the demonstrations seem to cut across sectarian and class lines and they are happening all over the country, from Tripoli up north to Tyre way down south, in big cities, suburbs and villages. And all the leaders of Lebanon are being held to account. The complaint that Lebanon has been mismanaged is nothing new. Corruption and nepotism are the rule. The economy has been so atrocious for so long — the country now has one of the highest debt-to-G.D.P. ratios in the world — and unemployment rates so high that a wave of young people emigrate every year looking for better opportunities. The Lebanese still don’t have reliable basic public services, including electricity and water. What has changed is the level of mismanagement and the indignities that the citizens have had to endure recently. The latest protests come at the heels of a series of bad news. This summer, Lebanon’s credit rating was downgraded, which means that the country’s sizable debt will have to be repaid at a higher rate. That was followed by two major outrages, one a sex scandal and the other an ecological disaster. On Sept. 30 came reports that Saad Hariri, the prime minister and American ally, had shelled out more than $16 million in 2013, while not in office, to a South African bikini model; two days later, the Lebanese government declared another economic state of emergency. Last week, wildfires ravaged the country. Every forest in every corner seemed to be burning. Firefighters were unable to keep up because their equipment was out of service since the government had not allocated funds for maintenance. Luckily, rains brought many of the fires under control. And then the WhatsApp tax. It’s not mere happenstance that the populace is unified this time around: As it happens, the government itself is unified for the first time in a while. This government, formed in January after more than a year without one, is supposed to represent all of Lebanon, supposed to include all the parties. That means that politicians — many of whom are the same warlords that led sectarian militias during the Lebanese civil war — haven’t been able to exploit the sectarian divisions that have kept certain families in power for generations (every politician grooms his sons to follow him). People had elected the same politicians over and over despite knowing of their corruption because, well, it’s better if one’s own sect leaders were stealing than leaving the money to another sect. The usual strategy of each political party blaming the others is unable to work now. No political party can escape blame this time. Heeding the calls for change, the government rescinded the WhatsApp tax soon after announcing it, and on Monday, it announced its agreement to a list of demands. But skeptical protesters are refusing to budge. In the meantime, the Lebanese are showing the world how to hold a great demonstration. They are partying, playing table tennis and celebrating weddings out on the street. Previous protests have had a measured success. The 2005 uprising resulted in the Syrians’ ouster, but much remained the same. Will this latest mass revolt be able to topple the government, will the people get the regime change they’re chanting for? Ask any Lebanese and you’ll get a nuanced answer, “Of course, things will change and nothing ever changes.” The opposing ideas of hope and despair seem to be held simultaneously by most Lebanese without much cognitive dissonance. It is how the Lebanese were able to have great nightclub parties inside bunkers during a civil war. Only in Lebanon would a song like “Baby Shark,” which is now being played at every crowd gathering, become the anthem of a revolution. The song is both catchy and repetitive, inspiring and interminable. Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo, baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo, ad infinitum.

2019,‘Batwoman’ and ‘Nancy Drew’ Reinvent Two Pop-Culture Heroines,"CW adds a comic-book crime fighter and an iconic mystery-novel detective to its deep roster of female protagonists. The fall broadcast-network premieres wrap up with a pair of dramas featuring pop-culture heroines with some years on them: Batwoman dates to 1956 and Nancy Drew to 1930. These thoroughly updated versions (“Batwoman” premieres Sunday, “Nancy Drew” Wednesday) continue a CW trend toward female protagonists — about 80 percent of the dramas it’s introduced the last two years have centered on women. But it’s also lost “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” and “Jane the Virgin,” so maybe the more significant trend is toward well-known franchises. The tireless producer Greg Berlanti now has six series on CW drawn from DC comic books, and he may have finally hit the point of diminishing returns. (If that didn’t already happen with “Legends of Tomorrow.”) This show about Bruce Wayne’s younger cousin, Kate Kane, who comes home to Gotham and dons the batsuit, has a generic quality — sufficiently well executed, with touches of quiet wit, but tinny and lacking in personality or excitement overall. It’s a superheroics delivery system, most notable for its efficiency. Something similar can be said of Ruby Rose, who plays Kate with intelligence, physical grace and a modest share of severe charisma, but not much expressiveness — her excitement at discovering a cache of batweapons looks about the same as her surprise when she learns her former lover has married a man or her tearful anger during an argument with her father, Jacob (Dougray Scott). She’s an action star in a show that doesn’t emphasize action, giving more space, as is common on CW, to dysfunctional-family soap opera. About that former lover: She’s a woman, and Rose’s Batwoman is being called the first openly lesbian leading character on a TV superhero show. (In the comics, Kate’s sexual orientation was retconned in 2006.) In the first two episodes — written by Caroline Dries, who, like Rose, is gay — the subplot involving Kate and her ex, Sophie (Meagan Tandy), is more credible and engaging in its limited screen time than the larger dramas involving the sister Kate lost as a child and the daddy issues she has with Jacob. (Tandy also provides some needed warmth and humor, as do Nicole Kang as Kate’s seemingly frivolous stepsister and Rachel Skarsten as the primary villain.) Part of the premise of the series is that the original caped crusader has been missing for three years (like “Gotham” and “Pennyworth,” it’s a Batman show without Batman), and Jacob Kane’s militaristic security company is picking up the slack. It could be interesting to see how the show juggles its mixed cultural messages — on one hand queer consciousness, on another the atavistic, “Dark Knight”-style celebration of vigilante justice. Kate explains that she needs to become a superhero because “people aren’t afraid anymore,” and she’s the one to scare them back into line, as soon as she can get the costume altered so that “it fits a woman.” Of the two new shows, this series created by Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage (“Gossip Girl”) represents the more radical reinvention of a traditional heroine. If you were wondering what it would be like if Nancy Drew and her friends were underemployed outsiders with active sex lives, now you can find out. A related question, based on the first two episodes, would be how far a girl-detective show can go in borrowing from “Veronica Mars.” The 19-ish Nancy (Kennedy McMann, in her first regular series role) now lives in the beach town of Horseshoe Bay. Her mother is out of the picture; her father (Scott Wolf) is a local notable going through a rough patch; she has a testy relationship with law enforcement and she’s drawn to those on the lower side of the tourist enclave’s income divide. Her first investigation, into the death of a wealthy summer resident, is reminiscent of “Mars,” as is McMann’s frequent voice-over narration. There’s even a skeevy character named Ryan Hudson, just a syllable away from the earlier show’s Ryan Hansen. Where “Veronica Mars” was a knowing and subtle tribute to film noir, though, “Nancy Drew” is just what it is: a CW ensemble melodrama cast with poutily good-looking actors in the late-teens to early-20s gray zone, offering mystery, some naughty romance and, to draw the “Vampire Diaries” and “Charmed” audience, a possible supernatural element. (The ghost of a pageant queen killed when Nancy was a child appears to be haunting the town, though it might just be a side effect of the fried seafood at the lobster shack where Nancy waitresses.) She has a Scooby crew consisting of her fellow restaurant workers (Leah Lewis, Maddison Jaizani and Alex Saxon) and Ned Nickerson (Tunji Kasim), who’s now a bad boy with a juvenile record (and more of a hookup for Nancy than a devoted boyfriend). McMann has some presence — she’s credible as the wised-up, slightly jaded, imperfect version of the spunky teenage sleuth — but there’s a dullness to the ensemble; no one’s striking sparks off one another the way performers like Adam Brody, Rachel Bilson, Peter Gallagher and Tate Donovan did in Schwartz’s first beachside drama, “The O.C.” That’s the first thing that needs to be solved.",The New York Times
2019,‘Betrayal in Berlin’ Recaptures a Golden Era for Espionage,"5 Things About Your Book In the early 1950s, the divided city of Berlin teemed with intelligence agents, all trying to keep a leg up for their side in the Cold War. In the midst of this activity, American and British operatives planned to dig a tunnel underneath the city, to intercept communications headed to and from Moscow. In “Betrayal in Berlin,” Steve Vogel, a former longtime reporter for The Washington Post, tells the story of the tunnel’s creation. He also delves into the life of George Blake, a British spy who became a double agent for the Soviets, reporting to them about, among other things, the progress of the tunnel project. Born in the Netherlands, Blake lived an outsize life of both great bravery and great deception. Below, Vogel talks about being inspired by his father’s work for the C.I.A., the similarities between spies and journalists, and tracking down Blake for an interview. When did you first get the idea to write this book? It basically came from being born in Berlin. My father had been stationed there as a C.I.A. case officer in the ’50s. I was born there when the Berlin Wall went up, and later I worked there as a journalist and covered the fall of the wall. I always felt a connection to the city. Writing was a career my dad had encouraged me to follow, but it was made clear to me that I should stay away from writing about him and his work, so I shied away from intelligence stories. He died in 1986, so I never had a chance to talk to him about his career and what he’d done in Berlin or anywhere else. Some of his friends from those days, who were also C.I.A. officers, were still close friends of the family, and I would see them at gatherings from time to time and hear these tales late at night — these strange, hilarious stories of what Berlin was like in those days. They were talking to me as a friend, not a reporter. In the last few years, some of them started dying, sadly, and I felt like the need for secrecy was past. I started to talk to more of them, and it seemed like a now-or-never story; they were all in their late 80s or early 90s. I wanted to focus on the golden age of Berlin espionage, which was before the wall was built, because there was a lot of movement back and forth across the border. I started to focus on the Berlin Tunnel because it captured the tension and ambiguity. In 2013, one of my dad’s closest friends, Gus Hathaway, died. I ended up writing the obituary for him in The Washington Post, and that struck a match under me. What’s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it? One thing that should have been more obvious to me that I still found quite striking were some of the similarities between journalism and espionage. A reporter and a spy are both working to find out things that other people might not want them to know. They’re both trying to establish trust with sources. They’re digging around, watching things. There are some lines you can’t cross in my work. You can’t dress up as someone else or dig a tunnel. But fundamentally, you’re both trying to learn the truth and trying to make some sense out of it. My dad told me once that if he hadn’t been a C.I.A. officer, he probably would have been a reporter. And that makes more sense to me now. In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write? Originally I meant to focus much more tightly on the tunnel, which is a pretty wild story by itself. But the more I got into it, the more intrigued I got by the whole life story of the British spy George Blake, from living in Egypt to working as a courier for the Dutch resistance during World War II to being recruited by British intelligence. And then being taken prisoner in North Korea and making the decision to betray the West. It’s the sort of thing you can’t really make up, and after talking to him I wanted to weave more of his life story into the book. Talking to him seemed like a long shot. I didn’t have my hopes high, but there’s no way I could write this book without making the biggest effort I could. I had a 14-page version of his life story from when he was arrested, so I was more focused on talking to him about the tunnel and why the K.G.B. didn’t stop it from the start. He was very helpful in that regard. Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work? I was really lucky to work with some great photographers, at The Post and elsewhere. Sometimes it seems like the best photojournalism comes from these guys when they’re being unobtrusive, establishing trust and being observant. A guy like Michael Williamson — we worked on this story at D.C. General Hospital back in the 1990s, we embedded ourselves in the midnight shift there for months. Every night there were shooting victims coming in. We got to know the police and the doctors and nurses really well, and ended up with a great package. Michel du Cille was another. Unfortunately he died in Liberia when he was covering the Ebola outbreak in 2014. He and I worked a lot on stories at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. He had this genuine empathy that really connected to a lot of the injured soldiers and their families. He respected them, and he earned their trust. A lot of that was reflected in the coverage. Bill O’Leary at The Post is another one, and Doug Mills, now at The New York Times; we worked together in Virginia when I was first starting out, in the 1980s. Persuade someone to read “Betrayal in Berlin” in 50 words or less. It captures this critical period when the Soviets were newly armed with nuclear weapons and the United States was effectively blind. We didn’t have satellite imagery or N.S.A. eavesdropping. The tunnel was built to get early warning, and the stakes were very high. Plus, George Blake’s story is pretty thrilling.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | ‘Big Mouth’ Is the Queer Childhood I Wish I Had,"Most L.G.B.T.Q. adults could not openly explore their sexuality as children, but the Netflix series provides a template (and hope) for future generations. Mr. Dunst is a journalist based in London. At first glance, Matthew of “Big Mouth,” Netflix’s adult animated series about puberty, appears to be a gay stereotype, a queer foil off which the more important characters can play. He’s flamboyant, snarky and judgmental, even running a tabloid-like morning gossip broadcast at school. But in its most recent two seasons the show has smartly expanded Matthew’s story line, depicting the life of a precocious queer adolescent who has a propensity for the dramatic and is almost entirely out of the closet. (The lone exception being what Matthew defines as the “don’t ask, don’t tell” détente between him and his father.) In Season Three, which premiered this month, Matthew (voiced by Andrew Rannells) even pursues his first same-sex romantic relationship, with Aiden (Zachary Quinto), who is the same age. Matthew frets about Aiden with Maury the Hormone Monster — a character who embodies each child’s confused pubescent impulses — but the pair eventually become, well, a pair. Their relationship is quite sweet: Awkward courtship takes place over FaceTime; the two kiss for the first time after Matthew coyly yet confidently slides his hand into Aiden’s while an unimportant movie playing on a nearby laptop fades into the background. I’m a gay man in my early 20s, so Matthew’s story line caught my attention, namely because his experience differs so substantially from my own lived analog. My queer friends and I all came out in our late teens or as adults and openly pursued our first same-sex relationships only in adulthood. This, queer people will tell you, is fairly standard. For L.G.B.T.Q. adults, Matthew’s subplot offers a glimpse into the childhood we didn’t have. But for those queers who will follow us, Matthew evinces hope. Despite hailing from a progressive family and growing up in New York City, I didn’t come out as gay until I was 20. My fears of coming out were not of my family or friends disowning me, but of the promised societal sea change, a tidal wave of sorts I assumed would wipe out the structures upon which my most important relationships had been constructed and relied. Such a storm, I thought, would destroy these foundations. And if their post-coming-out reconstruction failed, certain hallowed relationships would be lost. These fears were overblown, with no relationship loss coming to fruition, but similar anxiety appears anecdotally common among L.G.B.T.Q. youth. In his piece on gay male loneliness, the HuffPost reporter Michael Hobbes briefly discussed James, an 18-year-old New Yorker who grew up in “a big, affectionate, liberal family,” “went to a public school with openly gay kids” and still has a story similar to mine: “James had convinced himself that he would never come out.” “He knew rationally that everything was going to be fine,” said James’s uncle Perry Halkitis, who is gay and a professor at Rutgers University. “But being in the closet isn’t rational, it’s emotional.” This irrationality is perhaps why a 2013 Pew Research Center survey of L.G.B.T.Q. adults found that the median age at which respondents who had come out to family and friends did so was 20. Most queer adults did not openly explore our sexuality as adolescents, instead secretly experimenting with same-sex partners, if at all. Most — myself included — did not engage in a healthy age-appropriate public relationship like Matthew and Aiden’s. (Queer people often overcompensate for this lack of experience as adults by behaving with the rebelliousness of adolescence: “When your teenage years aren’t yours to live, you’ll act like a teenager when you’re 30,” writes Tori Truscheit.) Matthew’s character arc subsequently struck me as fantastical: Would a gay kid in 2019 really be so comfortable? Would he really be dating? My cynicism was misplaced. The age at which queer people come out has continued to decline, dropping to the early or midteens. In 2015, San Francisco State University’s Family Acceptance Project reported that the average age for coming out was “a little over 13.” Queer kids are coming out at younger ages because L.G.B.T.Q. people have increasingly normalized our identities, solidifying our place in society and subsequently mitigating some youth anxiety. In many (but not all) communities, there are fewer repercussions for coming out than there once were. I began to further grasp the mainstreaming of queerness while listening to a recent episode of the sportswriter Bill Simmons’s podcast featuring Nick Kroll, one of the creators and stars of “Big Mouth.” Mr. Simmons’s 11-year-old son, Ben, is an avid “Big Mouth” fan and interviewed Mr. Kroll near the end of the episode. The pair discussed the show, addressing its portrayal of sexuality — namely Jay, a bisexual character. (The elder Mr. Simmons and Mr. Kroll also discussed Ali, a pansexual character who has received mixed reviews.) Jay’s bisexuality and Matthew’s open gayness sparked no disdain from this 11-year-old — an age at which my peers and I, blind to the importance of rhetoric, bandied about terms like “gay” and “faggot” for failures as minimal as losing a Madden NFL video game. These slurs, I gladly realized this past summer while moonlighting as a coach for the high school football team on which I used to play, are substantially less employed now than they were even a few years ago. This all indicates to me that our imperfect world is becoming increasingly friendly to queer kids, allowing them, like Matthew, to come out earlier and pursue the relationships to which they are entitled. For these younger queers, Matthew’s story line offers a road map, a necessary how-to guide. But for queer adults, whether they be millennials like myself or older, “Big Mouth” presents a glimpse into the childhood we did not have — but one in which those who follow us will rightfully revel.

2019,‘Birds of Prey’ Trailer: Harley Quinn Steals Her Own Movie,"Margot Robbie stars as the DC Comics supervillain in a stand-alone title in which she and her female crew take on Black Mask (Ewan McGregor). With Joaquin Phoenix’s “Joker” poised to dominate the box office this weekend, Warner Bros. has just released the first full-length trailer for another supervillain-led potential blockbuster, “Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn.” Margot Robbie, who’s also a producer of the film, reprises the harlequin role she originated in “Suicide Squad,” but in this spinoff, Harley has broken up with Joker (previously played by Jared Leto) and struck out on her own. She assembles a team of female renegades, including Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) and Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), and faces off against a crime kingpin known as Black Mask (Ewan McGregor) to protect a young girl (Ella Jay Basco). The trailer features a jokier tone than the dark, Scorsese-influenced drama of “Joker.” Like that film’s director, Todd Phillips (the “Hangover” trilogy), the “Birds of Prey” filmmaker Cathy Yan is best known for comedy (the 2018 Chinese-set “Dead Pigs”). Her cast also includes the comedian-actress Ali Wong as well as Chris Messina and Rosie Perez. “Birds of Prey” lands in theaters on Feb. 7.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Boys Don’t Cry’ 20 Years Later: For Trans Men, a Divisive Legacy","Was the movie a landmark in representation or distressingly exploitative? It was both and so much more. When it was released in October 1999, “Boys Don’t Cry” was the first mainstream film to focus on a transgender man. Twenty years later, it’s still the rare feature to center on such a life. But as the culture has evolved, the film has proved to be very much of its time, with a contradictory legacy that trans viewers have grappled with. The movie was based on the tragic true story of Brandon Teena, a 21-year-old Nebraska trans man who was raped and murdered in 1993. His death was the subject of salacious headlines, and it galvanized a small group of trans people to witness the trial and claim him as one of their own. The director Kimberly Peirce, then a graduate student at Columbia University, was there, too, traveling with the Transexual Menace activist group as research for the film about Teena she was desperate to make. A self-described butch who, she told me, was questioning her identity at the time, she felt an instant connection with Teena. “I loved that Brandon shaped himself into his fantasy of himself as a boy and lived as a man and loved women,” Peirce said, “so I always understood that about him — the courage, the audacity, the invention, the humor, the naïveté to live so authentically and boldly as he wanted.” Peirce met with Lana Tisdel, the woman Brandon Teena fell for, and eventually secured her life rights. Hilary Swank was cast as Brandon and Chloë Sevigny as Lana, and the final result won over critics. “This could have been a clinical movie of the week,"" Roger Ebert wrote in his review, “but instead it’s a sad song about a free spirit who tried to fly a little too close to the flame.” Grossing $11.5 million at the domestic box office, the film drew a supporting actress Oscar nomination for Sevigny and the best actress statuette for Swank, who thanked Brandon Teena in her acceptance speech: “His legacy lives on through our movie.” The film’s success catapulted Teena’s story into the mainstream. For many Americans, it was their first introduction to a trans man (though there’s never any version of “trans” in the dialogue). And the fact that the movie was told largely from Teena’s point of view, presenting him as someone audiences could empathize with, was celebrated in some L.G.B.T. circles. At the time, the cultural conversation around transgender lives was virtually nonexistent. They were asked to take a back seat to other L.G.B.T. activists so progress could be made on issues deemed more palatable to the mainstream, like ending the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy. Trans people (largely trans women) were depicted in the movies and tabloids as deceitful cross dressers, more often than not. Transgender men were absent from any media, and several reviews of the film incorrectly described Teena as a woman posing as a man, not living his true identity. News coverage of Teena’s story portrayed him as “a Yentl for the new millennium, rather than a victim of anti-transgender bigotry,” Noelle Howey noted then in Mother Jones. Looking back, one of the film’s producers, Christine Vachon, told me, “There was definitely this fascination with the notion of that kind of deception, the stranger, the masquerade, the person who comes in and turns the town upside down.” Sevigny echoed her view. “It had all those juicy components,” the actress said, “not to diminish the story in any way, but as far as I think what people grabbed onto then.” (The Village Voice article that inspired the film took a different tack, positioning Teena as a self-hating lesbian. The author, Donna Minkowitz, has since publicly apologized for misgendering Teena, among other regrets.) For trans people, “Boys Don’t Cry” was simultaneously an opportunity for much-needed representation and an unavoidable illumination of a societal blind spot. Nick Adams, director of transgender representation at GLAAD, which tracks L.G.B.T. representation in the media, describes the movie as “a vital and high-profile correction to that biased news coverage.” “As grass roots transgender advocates were fighting for Brandon’s trans identity to be recognized,” he said, “it was significant that Hilary Swank affirmed Brandon as the man he was and used he/him pronouns to refer to him, including when accepting the Academy Award.” Acknowledging that the film changed her career forever, Swank said, “That we’re still 20 years from then talking about how it started an important conversation says a lot.” But as perhaps the most well-known piece of popular culture about a transgender man, “Boys Don’t Cry” bears the burden of representation for a highly underrepresented group of people, and it has become polarizing for some trans viewers. After a screening in 2016, protesters at Reed College in Portland, Ore., disrupted a Q&A with Peirce, arguing that the film was transphobic and exploitive for its casting of a cisgender actress and depiction of a brutal rape. Were the film being made today, activists would insist on a trans actor in a trans role. Scarlett Johansson withdrew from the film “Rub & Tug” last year after just such an outcry. At the time, there wasn’t any organized objection to Swank’s casting. Peirce said she had auditioned several “masculine-of-center” people (butch women, drag kings and some trans men) before finding Swank in her search for a performer who “could walk into an everyday environment and be perceived as a man.” But for trans men like the actor JJ Hawkins (CBS’s “The Red Line”), the optics of Swank appearing highly feminine on red carpets were confusing and had real-world consequences. “Of course it’s a step in the right direction — one single story about us — but also, she played a boy and she won best actress,” Hawkins said. “That was the first time I realized that people who see me see me as a girl dressed up as a boy because when they’re watching ‘Boys Don’t Cry,’ they’re watching a girl dressed up as a boy.” (Similar issues have arisen with recent trans women portrayals by Jared Leto in “Dallas Buyers Club” and Jeffrey Tambor in “Transparent.”) There are other reasons the mainstream success of “Boys Don’t Cry” was as validating as it was frustrating for trans viewers. Some, depending on where they were in their journey, found it crucial to their learning that trans men existed. Others recoiled from the dehumanizing brutality Teena endured. “It’s incredibly hard to see, even if it’s a dramatization, to know that that was his final moment,” said the trans actor Leo Sheng (whose film credits include “Adam”). While transgender women have seen more positive portrayals in recent years, trans men have yet to see the same.“I can empathize with young trans men who don’t want to see it,” Kate Bornstein, a transgender activist and author who attended the murder trial with Peirce, said, explaining, “You’re seeing a movie about yourself and then yourself is murdered, why would you want to go see that? Why?” Peirce argued that “Boys Don’t Cry” helped the culture become “more responsible.” If cisgender, straight American audiences can empathize with Teena, then maybe “Boys” could create change. “Aren’t they glad that it exists?” Peirce asked, then added, “I feel bad that the experience is painful. And at the same time I still think it’s important that we have a super-committed queer director trying to tell the story authentically.” Swank said that while a brutal rape is “not anything anyone wants to see,” the peril that trans and gender-nonconforming people face shouldn’t be ignored. “It’s still happening and it’s our job to all work together to make change and make the world a safe place for people no matter how they identify,” she said. Peirce said she believes that her story of Teena’s life and death is necessary, though she doesn’t specify for whom. “I understand a positive image,” Peirce said, “but sometimes you need a story.”",The New York Times
2019,‘By the Grace of God’ Review: A Devastating Film About Survivors of Abuse,"Critic’s Pick The often irreverent French director François Ozon gets serious with a fact-based story about a group of men who were childhood victims of a pedophile priest. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. For a member of the clergy to sexually violate a child is one of the most stark and cruel betrayals imaginable. That an institution would prevaricate and dissemble about these betrayals rather than take immediate, decisive action to pursue justice and provide restitution creates a greater betrayal. After years of such actions, betrayal reaches a near-unimaginable level. And yet. We don’t have to imagine. In the Roman Catholic Church, these violations have been rife, and the stories behind them are appalling. In “By the Grace of God” François Ozon, one of France’s most brazen and talented directors, tells a story of a group of men in Lyon, all childhood victims of a pedophile priest. These adults find each other and form an organization to bring that priest and the church’s higher-ups who covered for him to account for their actions. This fact-based story — one which, as we learn from the closing credits, has still not reached a conclusion — represents a break from Ozon’s usual fare. The director is known as an unpredictable genre-bender, confidently concocting erotic thrillers, anti-erotic thrillers, musicals, literary adaptations (his 2007 film, “Angel,” was an imaginative and very apt view of Elizabeth Taylor’s tricky, brilliant novel) and more. His movies are almost exclusively stylistically elaborate affairs. This is not the case here. Ozon’s screenplay — derived from his own research, including interviews with members of the Lyon activist group Lift the Burden — consists of three profiles, so to speak, of the adult survivors of one predator. The first, Alexandre, played with button-down precision by Melvil Poupaud, is a still-devout Catholic and family man haunted by the criminal priest’s continued activity in his church. François, played by Denis Ménochet, is a bearish atheist who first responds to a request for testimony with an emphatic “No!” But soon, the floodgates of emotion and indignation open, and he helps found the activist group. The movie then presents Emmanuel, played by Swann Arlaud, perhaps the most at-risk of the adult characters, a near-genius intellect whose abuse led to an unfulfilled, fraught adulthood. Ozon’s approach in “By the Grace of God” is not plain, but it is straightforward. The movie is not replete with what you’d call stylistic flourishes — although when one character ascends a spiral staircase, Ozon doesn’t restrain himself from doing as he always does in this situation, which is to include an overhead shot of the structure. And Ozon exerts his command of cinematic language throughout, in ways that are less immediately obvious. He crafts a film that is engrossing from the start, while building to something greater and more emotionally encompassing. The director’s resourcefulness is on particular display in the scenes with Emmanuel. Having established the precarious position this character is in, Ozon’s camera practically stalks him as he speeds his motorcycle to unknown destinations or stands on the walkway of a bridge. Ozon makes you worry for the character. “By the Grace of God” is a rarity: An important film that’s also utterly inspired. By the Grace of God Not rated. In French, with subtitles.

2019,‘Celebration’ Review: The Final Stand of Yves Saint Laurent,"Critic’s Pick There’s little joy in this documentary, despite its title. But the movie is both revealing and beguiling. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Early in this century, the documentary director Olivier Meyrou, at the invitation of Pierre Bergé, spent two and a half years filming the couturier Yves Saint Laurent and his employees and associates. Bergé, of course, was one of them: Saint Laurent’s longtime business manager, hard-nosed where Saint Laurent was dreamy, is a central figure in “Celebration,” which chronicles the creation of what would be Saint Laurent’s final collection. After a version of the film screened at the 2007 Berlin International Film Festival, Bergé took action to block its release. His move could be understood as protective. Saint Laurent, never the most robust of individuals, looks alarmingly frail in most of the footage. The designer died in June 2008 of a brain tumor. Seeing the way he’s frequently troubled by tremors in this movie is cause to shudder. Saint Laurent is trying to hold himself together while barely aware of where he is. But when he meets a model he had not worked with in many years, he is genuinely effusive. And other times, he is almost tragically recessive. His friend, the designer Loulou de la Falaise, seen often in the film, died shortly after Saint Laurent. Bergé, who had been a romantic partner, passed in 2017. Meyrou’s now slightly re-edited documentary is replete with arty touches — it toggles between black and white and color, and uses electronic noise bubbling up on the soundtrack to heighten tension — but it’s nevertheless a searching, sensitive and revealing portrait. Saint Laurent was essential to 20th-century culture, and “Celebration” shows the inevitable fading of glory as well as the enduring features of his life’s work. Celebration Not rated.

2019,‘Centrism Is Canceled’: High Schoolers Debate the Impeachment Inquiry,"At Chalmette High School in Louisiana, students in a world history class made their case for or against punishing President Trump. CHALMETTE, La. — It was impeachment day in Mr. Dier’s world history class at Chalmette High School. Andrew Johnson, the first impeached president, was on the lesson plan. So was Richard M. Nixon, who avoided facing such a fate by resigning. Bill Clinton, who also was impeached but never convicted, was also part of the discussion. But most of the class was centered on the latest president to face possible removal from office: Donald J. Trump, who is on social media just as much as some of Chris Dier’s students. At Chalmette High, located in a conservative Louisiana parish, the students in Mr. Dier’s class recently confronted the merits of the case against Mr. Trump, who stands accused of pressuring Ukraine to investigate his chief Democratic rival, Joseph R. Biden Jr. Mr. Dier saw the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump as an opportunity: a real-time lesson in civics and political science for his students. So, for two 90-minute class periods, Mr. Dier’s seniors pretended to be members of Congress, but without the bluster and sniping — dutifully obeying the signs on the walls about how to respectfully agree to disagree. “We have never studied anything that was unfolding live,” said Grace Bartholomae, one of the students. “This is history.” To help his students understand the details of the inquiry, Mr. Dier assembled a bit of a crash-course lesson plan, including an excerpt from the whistle-blower complaint about Mr. Trump’s 30-minute phone call with Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, along with a reconstructed transcript of the conversation. The idea was to try to answer the same questions voters are asking themselves about potential impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump. Is Mr. Trump being unfairly cast as corrupt? Has he brazenly weaponized his office for personal gain? Did he seek the aid of a foreign power to interfere in the next election? What are high crimes and misdemeanors anyway? And is the rarest of constitutional consequences, impeachment by the House and then possible conviction and removal from office by the Senate, worth the trouble a year before the next election — the first in which the students in Mr. Dier’s class, most of whom are 17 years old, will be eligible to vote? Chalmette High is in St. Bernard Parish just southeast of New Orleans, along the Mississippi River. Surrounded by water and built largely upon fishing and oil refineries, the parish lost more than half of its population after Hurricane Katrina destroyed nearly every home. The rebuilding brought more diversity, and today, of the 1,972 students at Chalmette High, about 52 percent are students of color. Mr. Trump handily carried the parish in 2016 with about 65 percent of the vote, but the students in Mr. Dier’s class did not always share their parents’ conservative views. Mr. Dier, 31, teaches in the same classroom where his mother, also a world history teacher, taught five years before. He had planned to tackle impeachment later in the semester, but when the Democrats began an inquiry last month, he moved those lessons up on the calendar to follow a study of the Vietnam War. He said the point was not just to study this particular impeachment inquiry, but to push his students to engage as informed citizens at a time when many Americans do not understand basic civics. Only 39 percent of adults can name all three branches of government (a jump from 32 percent last year) and 25 percent can name only one branch, according to a recent survey by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania. This year, congressmen in Florida and Georgia introduced a $30 million bipartisan bill to improve the quality of civics education in elementary, middle and high schools across the country. Another challenge for teachers, Mr. Dier said, is the fear of being accused of bringing too much politics into the classroom. His has shelves stuffed with books on political science and history, and posters of Ben Franklin, Helen Keller and Malcolm X. “I think social studies teachers are hesitant to teach controversial topics, past and present, due to hyperpolarization or pushback from parents,” he said. “Almost all of my students will be voting in the next election; they deserve teachers who do not shy away from current events because of our partisan climate.” If anything, Mr. Dier added, “our partisan climate means students need to be challenged more to learn how to navigate it.” He figured the best way to explore impeachment in a neutral way was sticking to the Constitution and the established facts of Mr. Trump’s actions. That meant having the students, in a condensed version of the impeachment process, study how the founding fathers framed impeachment and the step-by-step procedures in the House of Representatives and Senate. Mr. Dier divided the class into four groups and instructed them to read the material they had been given, including the call transcript and the whistle-blower complaint. The students huddled in separate corners of the room reading aloud. Before long, “bribery,” “treason,” “quid pro quo” and other impeachment watchwords floated above the din of the discussions. The students did not share the same opinion on the matter. To some, the phone call was a clear violation; others struggled with the degree of wrongness. A handful of students — a number that would grow by the end of the lesson — fully supported Mr. Trump. “Abuse of power is subjective,” insisted Hunter Wheaton, who questioned whether the country was ready for the ugliness of impeachment, which would require majority support in the House. Even though she felt impeachment and removal from office was unlikely, Jenna Riess said that the inquiry would reveal what the president had done wrong, and that voters would “use that in the next election and vote for a better candidate.” After the discussion, Mr. Dier polled the 21 students. This time there were three groups: those who supported impeachment (12), those who did not (four) and those who remained undecided (five). The undecideds sat quietly in the center of the classroom, and the two opposing groups prepared their strongest arguments. Chance Beck, speaking for those who supported impeachment, said Mr. Trump’s action set a bad precedent. “It’s not morally or politically correct for a president to be able to use national power or national aid that we give to Ukraine for a personal favor,” he said. “I believe he should be impeached and convicted and removed to make the case that this will not be tolerated.” Trinity Frey, representing those against impeachment, argued that it was not clear the phone call was inappropriate and that it was unrealistic to expect enough of the real-life Republican senators to support Mr. Trump’s removal. Though what he did might be considered morally wrong, she said, it was simply not severe enough for him to be taken out of office. After hearing from both sides, the undecideds had to make their move. “Centrism is canceled,” cracked Ms. Bartholomae, in the lightest moment of the exercise. One by one, each of the five students joined one of the two groups, greeted by cheers. Three of the five joined the anti-impeachment group. They said the stakes were too high and the evidence was too thin. “Show me where this says it’s illegal,” said Jihad Thabata, who questioned whether the call amounted to misconduct. In a closing statement about whether Mr. Trump should stay in office, Alexis Resendez coolly argued that members of Congress should respect the choice made by voters in the 2016 election. Ayla Hoey rebutted that the transcript may seem subtle, but Mr. Trump “knew the power he had over other countries. Even if it seems like Ukraine is not being pushed, he knew what he asked for was going to get done.” In that final round, a two-thirds majority voted in favor of removing Mr. Trump. The tally: 14 to 7.",The New York Times
2019,‘Chasing Rainbows’ Review: Judy Garland’s Happy Days,"Focusing on the entertainer’s early years, this Paper Mill Playhouse musical offers buoyant tap numbers but sidesteps the material’s most troubling implications. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed play or musical through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. MILLBURN, N.J. — Behind every great woman is a … troubled man? So suggests the musical “Chasing Rainbows: The Road to Oz,” a Judy Garland origin story in which the dominant influence over the star’s early years turns out to be her father. Nowadays, the most familiar Garland is the pill-popping, charismatically chaotic mess of the 1960s — the one Renée Zellweger summons in the new film “Judy.” This musical, on the other hand, focuses on the wide-eyed teenager whom “The Wizard of Oz” propelled to fame: It’s a loving but hokey attempt to tell us how Garland soared, not how she crashed. As its subtitle indicates, “Chasing Rainbows,” now at Paper Mill Playhouse, focuses on the lead-up to the beloved 1939 movie. Conceived by Tina Marie Casamento and written by Marc Acito, the show starts by taking us back to the wilds of Minnesota, where the young Frances Gumm, as Garland was then known, spent her early childhood. (The musical incorporates a slew of period songs adapted and arranged by David Libby, who also penned additional material with Casamento.) Sophie Knapp portrays Baby Gumm, as she is billed, a natural performer with a preternaturally mature singing voice. It’s not long before her mother, Ethel (Lesli Margherita), packages Frances (now played by Ruby Rakos) and her two older siblings into a sister act, and sends them on the vaudeville circuit. While Ethel is depicted as a benevolent taskmaster — the real Ethel Gumm reputedly was a horrid stage mom — her husband, Frank (Max von Essen, from “An American in Paris”), is shown as an affectionate, nurturing presence with whom Frances has a strong emotional bond. Alas, although Frank clearly loves his youngest child, he also spends little time with her, partly because he is estranged from his wife thanks to a Brokeback Great Plains-type relationship with another married man. Frank shares the show’s very first scene with Judy, and he is the last one left onstage at the end, like a forlorn ghost, so he is very much at the center of the story here. Yet the character is barely a sketch, and Casamento and Acito don’t give von Essen much to chew on. They don’t seem very interested in exploring, beyond Hallmark card sentiment, the impact of a young Judy Garland having been fixated (in this telling) on a closeted father. This is typical of the show as a whole: It keep bringing up, as it should, thorny characters and issues — Judy was repeatedly told she was too ugly, too fat — only to either soften or skirt any less-than-sunny implications. It’s not long before “Chasing Rainbows” pivots to Hollywood, where Judy meets other freakishly gifted kids. Rakos aptly relays Judy’s excitement in those scenes, and she is at her vocal best without being slavishly imitative. Violet Tinnirello is very funny, and slightly terrifying, as a cocky, preening Shirley Temple, but understandably she figures less than Michael Wartella’s Joe Yule — professional name, Mickey Rooney. Joe becomes Judy’s best friend and, more important for our purposes, leads the excellent ensemble number “All Ma’s Children.” The director/choreographer Denis Jones, a Tony Award nominee for “Tootsie” and “Holiday Inn,” comes up with an inventive combination of props and tap that captures the carefree energy of the Judy and Mickey vehicles. Jones also contributes the production’s other highlight: a brief interlude during the number “Got a Pair of New Shoes” when the orchestra stops playing and the ensemble taps unaccompanied. This creates the ineffable impression that time stands still while the performers are in motion, and it is glorious. But as soon as we get near the less savory side of show business, the show falters again. Far from the predatory mogul of real life, for instance, the MGM boss Louis B. Mayer (Stephen DeRosa) is here an avuncular presence, affectionately manipulated by his secretary, Kay Koverman (the Broadway and cabaret veteran Karen Mason). When Louis B. Mayer turns out to be a lovable if cranky guy, however, you know a show has a rainbow to sell us.

2019,"‘Contemplate, Then Capture’: Readers on Staying in the Moment While Traveling","Letter 129 The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau. Sign up to get it by email. This week’s issue is written by Tacey Rychter, the bureau’s audience editor. “What are your ways of staying present and more deeply observant when you travel?” I asked that question in last week’s Australia Letter, when I wrote about a coastal hike that led me to wonder what I was missing by delegating memories to my camera, not my brain. It resonated with many of you. Dozens of readers wrote to us with thoughtful suggestions. So I’m turning the newsletter over to you. Here are some of our favorite responses, edited lightly for length: “I give myself a quota of no more than 20 photos per travel. That way I think about each and every photo I take.” — Michelle Baltazar “I stay present when I travel by bringing only a film camera for photos. Digital cameras (even your iPhone camera roll) are the devil, you will never look back on hundreds (even a few tens) of digital photos. But you’re sure to treasure those precious few rolls of 36 exposures when you develop them after arriving back home.” — Greer Clarke “Ten-minute rule. Look. Don’t touch the phone or camera for at least 10 minutes before snapping. Let impressions sink in. Contemplate, then capture.” — Tom Neal Tacker “I carry notebook, colored pencils and a biro to study a scene, then sketch down — that image stays in my mind years later."" — Mary Mowbray “I love the idea of drawing but I’ve never been very good at it. So my substitute is to write stories about places. I take what I’m seeing — the people, the wildlife, the coastline, the atmosphere, the history — and condense it into fragments of fiction that, for me, really encapsulate the feel of a place. As I go back and read them I remember the places I visited, and when I revisit places I can add onto the stories I wrote the first time around.” — Javiera Scarratt “At the end of a day of travel, my boyfriend and I wrote separate diaries of the day’s events. We then read them to each other. It was remarkable how different our observations were, like we didn’t experience the same things.” — Marsha Matson “In 1980, I spent four and a half months hitchhiking from San Francisco to New York. Two months into my travels I mailed my camera back to Australia — I didn’t want anything coming between me and what I was experiencing and the people I was meeting. Even now with an iPhone in my pocket, a small sketchbook is what I’ll use if I want a visual record.” — Matthew Martin “I turn the phone off and only turn it on when I really want to remember the view. The odd thing though is it is the ‘feeling’ of the vista, rather than the vista per se, that holds the strongest memory.” — Mark Thomas “Stop and breathe for a second or two longer than is comfortable.” — Lisa Murray Now, on to the news of the week.

2019,‘Desire’ Is an Operatic Glimpse Into a Secret Garden,"Hannah Lash’s new chamber work, for just three singers and string quartet, moves freely between realism and abstraction. Hannah Lash was just 28 when her first chamber opera, “Blood Rose,” premiered in 2010. But while it was a success, Ms. Lash was not fully satisfied with the piece, which drew on the story of “Beauty and the Beast” to explore themes of vulnerability, conflict and intimacy. “I realized,” she said in a recent interview, “that in order to say what I wanted to say better, I needed to be just a little bit older and just a little bit craftier.” Nearly a decade older and substantially craftier, Ms. Lash has returned to some of the same thematic territory in her new work, “Desire,” which premieres at the Miller Theater at Columbia University on Wednesday. A stylized allegory, the opera meditates on the wonder, struggle and ephemeral nature of the creative process, of finding one’s own voice. It is also chamber music in the truest sense of the term: The septet of performers (a string quartet and three singers) will perform without a conductor, a rarity for opera of any size. “There is a very specific thing that I’m after in opera,” said Ms. Lash. “And that something, a little paradoxically, is incredibly intimate and not grand, something a bit uncomfortable, and very personal and loose-ended.” Moving freely between the realistic and the abstract, “Desire” is about an unnamed woman (the contralto Kirsten Sollek) who discovers a vibrant garden, and her confrontation with — and eventual transcendence of — the conflicting expectations of her partner (the baritone Christopher Dylan Herbert) and an otherworldly, muse-like being (the countertenor Daniel Moody). The work, which runs just over an hour, is reminiscent of Bartok’s expressionist (and similarly concise) “Bluebeard’s Castle” and Debussy’s symbolist “Pelléas et Mélisande,” which Ms. Lash point to as models for the way they allow audiences interpretive space. “I don’t consider myself to be a teller of stories,” she said. “Instead, I want to imply and suggest and ask and probe, with a very kind of indirect means.” To preserve the gossamer sense of abstraction she imagined, Ms. Lash wrote the poetic libretto herself. The words evoke more than they depict: “Shards of light sliver through a thousand sleeping rocks / Fleeting fragrances dance in a fever / Heat unfurling from stones / Vapor sails breaking into flame.” The instrumental music, written for the JACK Quartet, juxtaposes spare passages of arpeggiated pizzicato with moments of unrestrained lyricism; dynamic outbursts with ethereal whisperings in the uppermost register of the violins; and lean dissonances with lush harmonies. At times, curling tendrils of melody push upward, as if newly sprung from the earth. The quartet, said Rachel Dickstein, the production’s director, “is the engine of the woman’s imagination,” acting almost as her heartbeat. JACK will play onstage, and in costume; integrating the group into the set design was an artistic and acoustic puzzle, especially since the delicate music requires a more or less traditional setup for the players. “What we’ve come up with,” Ms. Dickstein said, “is the happy medium between our divine impulses and what will allow JACK to best play the score.” The quartet’s violist, John Pickford Richards, said in an interview that “there’s something sort of experimentally sparse about the music,” a shift from the harmonically rich and rhythmically complex sound world of “Blood Rose,” in which JACK also played. With frequent solos and duets, the instrumentalists are extremely exposed. “It’s like flossing in front of an audience,” said Mr. Richards. That vulnerability and intimacy are being cultivated among artists who have known one another for years. Ms. Lash, Mr. Herbert and the founding members of JACK attended the Eastman School of Music together. Between 2009 and 2011 alone, the quartet premiered her ruminative, mercurial “Frayed,” her harp quintet “Filigree in Textile,” and “Blood Rose,” which also featured Ms. Sollek. Having established a relationship with Miller Theater, JACK introduced its executive director, Melissa Smey, to Ms. Lash; the theater devoted one of its Composer Portraits concert to her music in 2016. In the discussions with Ms. Smey leading up to that concert, Ms. Lash mentioned her idea for a chamber opera with the quartet. It appealed to Ms. Smey that the project was beginning with a collaboration between composer and performers already in mind. Missy Mazzoli’s “Proving Up,” which Miller co-commissioned a few years ago, utilized the International Contemporary Ensemble at Ms. Smey’s suggestion, and is one of a slew of intimate recent operas that feature the talents of specific ensembles. “When you have composers that have worked for a long time with an ensemble and they know each other well,” Ms. Smey said in an interview, “that can make for magical listening experiences.” Desire Wednesday and Thursday at the Miller Theater, Columbia University, Manhattan; millertheatre.com.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Dolemite Is My Name’ Review: Eddie Murphy, Raw and Cooking","Murphy, Wesley Snipes and an ensemble of accomplices elevate a not-bad biopic of an unlikely blaxploitation auteur. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “Dolemite Is My Name” starts out as a comedy of failure and foolish hope. When we first meet him, in Los Angeles in the early ’70s, Rudy Ray Moore is a multi-hyphenate might-have-been. As he slides toward middle age, popular culture seems to be running in the other direction. His novelty R&B singles can’t even get played in the record store where he works as assistant manager. His semi-naughty stand-up routine (“What did the elephant say to the naked man?”) is too corny for a generation discovering the matter-of-fact raunchiness of Redd Foxx. Rudy, a real-life actor, comedian and dedicated self-promoter, is played by Eddie Murphy, one of Foxx’s heirs. Murphy’s celebrity, which has faded a bit recently (he’s been scarce on the big screen for a decade or so), both overshadows Moore’s and illuminates it. For much of the movie, we’re being treated to two wildly profane, bracingly inventive performances in one. But more is going on here than just one electrifying comedian impersonating another. There has always been something a little mysterious about Murphy, an edge to his charm, a suggestion of loneliness and suspicion in his eyes. Here, in the midst of mile-a-minute verbal acrobatics and slow-burn slapstick, those eyes register a dimension of sadness — of hunger, of hurt and defiant pride — that the film itself doesn’t really explore. Directed by Craig Brewer from a script by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski (with Murphy as a producer), “Dolemite Is My Name” sticks to the surface of a rambunctious, sometimes rousing show-business saga in which adversity is faced down, called all kinds of names and triumphantly overcome. It’s a superhero origin story of sorts, sparked by some desperate folkloric research. Rudy, in a last-ditch bid to scare up some new material, tape-records the rhymes, jokes and tall tales of a group of homeless men. Their filthy, braggadocious verbal flights — I wish I could quote just one word — look back to southern black oral traditions and ahead to hip-hop. Accessorizing a series of brightly colored suits with silver-topped canes and feathered fedoras, Rudy reinvents himself as Dolemite, a one-man symphony of outrageous archetypes. Accompanied by drumbeats and keyboard riffs, he spins out insults, sexual boasts and old-time fables, like the story of the signifying monkey. He hits the road, packing nightclubs and juke joints across the South, and releases a series of albums whose salacious covers hint at the exuberant obscenity inside. When Rudy decides to make a Dolemite movie, “Dolemite Is My Name” shifts gears into backstage farce, and Murphy shares the screen with a growing ensemble of accomplices, all of them great fun to watch. Early on, we catch a glimpse of Snoop Dogg as a D.J. — later, Chris Rock will man the microphone at a radio station — but the real scene stealers are Tituss Burgess, Keegan-Michael Key, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Craig Robinson and above all the irreplaceable Wesley Snipes. Snipes plays D’Urville Martin, an accomplished actor whose résumé includes “Rosemary’s Baby” as well as a number of blaxploitation titles. “Dolemite Is My Name” name-checks a few of those movies, and makes clear that by the time Rudy is ready to go into production with “Dolemite,” the blaxploitation genre is ripe for parody. The film he envisions will be a kitchen-sink stew of humor, sex and violence. Kung fu and bare breasts are central to his aesthetic. His screenwriter, Jerry Jones (Key), has aspirations to socially conscious realism. D’Urville, hired to direct as well as to play the heavy, can barely tolerate the amateurish anarchy on the “Dolemite” set. The whole thing seems headed for disaster. Even if you were unaware of the indelible existence of “Dolemite” and its sequels, you wouldn’t be inclined to worry too much. “Dolemite Is My Name” is mostly free of the glowering melodrama and puffed-up machismo of some of Brewer’s other projects (“Hustle & Flow,” “Black Snake Moan”). It has a loose, friendly, house-party vibe, and it’s impossible not to have a good time watching the actors have a good time with one another. If there’s a problem, it’s that the good humor has the effect of lowering the film’s dramatic stakes, and risks turning its cultural reference points into cartoons. Not that the Dolemite character and the “Dolemite” movie weren’t broadly silly and militantly anti-serious. They weren’t only that, though, and one of the striking things about “Dolemite Is My Name” is how hard it works to push history and politics to the margins of the screen. The movie collapses the difference between Rudy Ray Moore and the character he created, treating his creativity as another kind of high-spirited clownishness, and his struggle for recognition as a comic hustle. But if the filmmakers are careless with the dignity of the characters, the actors — Murphy and Snipes in particular — step in to defend it, upholding a tradition at least as old as Hollywood. “Dolemite Is My Name” is not bad, but it isn’t quite what its stars and its subject deserve. Dolemite Is My Name Rated R. Profane poetry. Running time: 1 hour 58 minutes.

2019,‘El Camino’: What to Remember 6 Years After ‘Breaking Bad’,"A new feature-length sequel comes to Netflix on Friday. But it’s been a while since the series ended in a cloud of gun smoke. Here’s where we left the major characters. Six years ago, AMC’s award-season juggernaut “Breaking Bad” came to a bloody and satisfying end, and with it the story of Walter White (Bryan Cranston), the high school science teacher who became an Albuquerque drug kingpin. AMC quickly spun off a prequel series, “Better Call Saul,” giving fans more time with characters like Saul Goodman, Mike Ehrmantraut and Gus Fring. But given that shift in focus — and all the carnage of the final “Breaking Bad” season — it was reasonable to think that the finale was the last word otherwise. Then in late 2018, the series’s creator, Vince Gilligan, secretly gathered his collaborators in New Mexico and directed his own screenplay for “El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,” which comes to Netflix Friday. Judging by the trailer, the movie introduces a bunch of new characters and brings back a few familiar ones, the most important being Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), whom we last saw looking broken but alive, speeding off through the desert in … an El Camino. But what about the rest? Remember Skinny Pete? And what about poor Flynn? It’s been a while, so here’s a refresher on where we left the characters who may still have some bearing on the sequel — alive, dead or somewhere in between. In Season 5, Walter’s right-hand man, Jesse, went through the wringer. First he came to realize just how much Walter had betrayed him. Then he was made a literal slave to meth-dealing white supremacists. We don’t know a lot about what happened to Jesse after the desert shootout that killed the D.E.A. agent (and Walt’s brother-in-law) Hank Schrader (Dean Norris). But by the time Walter came to save him, his existence looked tortured: imprisoned in the meth lab, cooking for monsters, rarely seeing the light of day. Walter saved him, relying on his usual mix of brazenness and ingenuity (and the help of a remote-controlled machine gun). Jesse sped off into the night, hysterical and screaming. The movie looks to pick up immediately thereafter, so remember the trauma inflicted by Jesse’s captivity. It will surely play a role. The first teaser trailer for “El Camino” offered a glimpse of Jesse Pinkman’s regular collaborator Skinny Pete (Charles Baker). He appears again in the official trailer, alongside his usual partner, Badger (Matthew Lee Jones). They were two of the last people to do business with Walt. In the series finale, they were paid by Walter to pose as assassins outside of the home of Walter’s former business partners the Schwartzes (Jessica Hecht and Adam Godley), a ruse to ensure that the couple would do as they were told. Pete and Badger also revealed to Walter that blue meth was still on the scene. Jesse has turned to them in times of need before. Judging by the trailer, he looks to need their help again. The last we saw Saul (Bob Odenkirk), he was headed to a new life — which “Better Call Saul” has since confirmed involved an illustrious career as a Cinnabon employee. Could he resurface somewhere on the timeline between his last “Breaking Bad” appearance and those ominous “Saul” flash-forwards? Certainly. And an appearance by Odenkirk could really tie all three “Breaking Bad”-related projects together. Saul’s lovable bodyguard, Huell (Lavell Crawford), has been the subject of much internet concern as he was last seen being told never to leave a safe house by Agents Schrader and Gomez — who were then killed by Nazis. Is he still there? If Saul comes back into the picture in “El Camino,” he could also bring back one of the few people he thinks he can still trust. There’s a shot of a photo of Jesse’s former girlfriend, Andrea, and her son, Brock (Ian Posada and Emily Rios), in the “El Camino” trailer, reminding viewers how important they were to Jesse — and to the plot: The end of “Breaking Bad” would have been very different if not for Jesse’s realization that Walter had poisoned Brock. In the second-to-last episode, Jesse watched as Todd (Jesse Plemons) murdered Andrea on her porch; maybe Jesse will try to be a father to an orphaned Brock in “El Camino.” And although most of the Nazis are dead and Jesse already strangled Todd to death in the finale, it stands to reason that some of Todd’s more distant associates are probably still alive. Will Jesse be seeking more revenge? The owner of Rocker Salvage (Larry Hankin) was a part of Jesse’s schemes in Season 5. He supplied the giant magnet used to wipe clean Gus Fring’s laptop in police custody. And he helped Jesse and Walt build their mobile meth lab operation. He has been spotted in the trailer for “El Camino.” Skyler and Walter Jr., a.k.a. Flynn (Anna Gunn and R.J. Mitte), again moved with baby Holly out of the family home in which so much of “Breaking Bad” took place. But Walter still found them in the finale. In a phone call the episode before, Walt Jr. had angrily asked his father to hurry up and die, so it’s just as well he wasn’t home. Almost unfazed by Walter’s appearance, Skyler listened to what Walt Sr. had to say, arguably got some closure, learned where Hank’s body was buried and then allowed him to say a final goodbye to his daughter. After leaving, Walter watched from afar as his son come home from school, unaware his father was seeing him for the final time. Left to reassemble the pieces of Gus Fring’s broken empire, Lydia (Laura Fraser) was a key part of how the series reached its conclusion. Her expanded role was short-lived. After Jesse killed Todd, she called Todd’s phone, expecting confirmation that Walter was dead. Instead Walter picked up: Turned out not only was he alive, he had also replaced the “stevia crap” she used in her tea with ricin the last time they met. Presumably she won’t be back. Walter was just about to turn himself in when he saw Gretchen and Elliott on Charlie Rose, talking about how little the now-infamous drug kingpin had to do with their success. He tracked them down, dropping millions of dollars on them with instructions to form a trust fund for his family. Perhaps “El Camino” will provide an update on whether they actually go along with Walt’s plan. In the series finale, Hank’s widow, Marie (Betsy Brandt), called her sister, Skyler, with news about Walt’s return. Will Marie figure into Jesse’s story? Probably not. But Gilligan has a sneaky way of bringing characters back, so we can’t rule it out, especially if Jesse re-enters Skyler’s life for some reason. Gilligan has confirmed it: Yes, Walter is dead. But the way Gilligan has played with time on both of his shows means we can probably expect a flashback or two on “El Camino.” Those could open the door to many characters who were dead when the series ended, including Jesse’s speedball-shooting ex, Jane (Krysten Ritter); Gus (Giancarlo Esposito); Gus’s right-hand, Mike (Jonathan Banks); and even Hank. The big question, however, is whether Walter will be among those familiar faces. Would it truly feel like “Breaking Bad” if he weren’t?",The New York Times
2019,"‘Emanuel’ Review: Race, Religion, Thoughts and Prayers","Through interviews with victims’ families, survivors and others, Brian Ivie’s documentary revisits the 2015 massacre at a historic black church in Charleston. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. At a time when news of each new mass shooting vanishes all too quickly from headlines, “Emanuel” offers a memorial. The documentary revisits the June 2015 killings at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., by interviewing relatives of the victims, survivors of the shooting, journalists and public officials about their experiences of the crime or of first hearing about the deaths. The director Brian Ivie weaves in a bit of the history about Charleston, a hub of the slave trade, and about churchgoing as a symbol of independence for African-Americans after the Civil War. Initially, it seems like a mistake for the movie to introduce the shooter Dylann Roof, a white supremacist, onscreen. He is seen only in archival footage, but why not keep the focus on the nine people, all of whom were black, he killed? Then the film shows that, at Roof’s bond hearing less than 48 hours after the shooting, some of the bereaved — like Nadine Collier, whose mother was killed — began to offer expressions of forgiveness for him. The film argues that these expressions were not submissive (as some critics have claimed), but demonstrations of courage and grace. It is possible to take issue with “Emanuel” on aesthetic grounds — a few brief re-enactments illustrating Charleston’s past seem incongruously slick, and at least two title cards are out of date (Nikki Haley, for example, is labeled as governor, which she was at the time of the shooting, but is no longer). But the movie is primarily an act of bearing witness that does not ask to be judged on conventional filmmaking terms. Emanuel Not rated. Running time: 1 hour 20 minutes.

2019,‘Faithless Electors’ Could Tip the 2020 Election. Will the Supreme Court Stop Them?,"Sidebar WASHINGTON — On Dec. 19, 2016, a little more than a month after the presidential election, members of the Electoral College gathered around the nation to cast their votes. Ten of them went rogue. A swing by that number of electors would have been enough to change the outcomes in five of the previous 58 presidential elections, according to a petition filed last week in the Supreme Court. In the 2000 election, after an assist from the Supreme Court, George W. Bush beat Al Gore by just five electoral votes. The petition asked the justices to decide whether “faithless electors” were free to disregard pledges they made to vote for their own parties’ candidates. It urged the court to act quickly. “This case permits the court to issue a decision outside of the white-hot scrutiny of a contested presidential election,” the petition said. Deciding the issue in the context of an actual election could do lasting damage to the Supreme Court, said Lawrence Lessig, a law professor at Harvard who filed the petition on behalf of three Democratic electors from Washington State who were fined $1,000 each for casting their electoral votes for Colin L. Powell rather than for Hillary Clinton. A ruling that tipped an election to one or another candidate could not but look political, Professor Lessig said. “It would be disastrous for the institution,” he said of the court, “if they had to decide it in the middle of a presidential election.” The Washington State Supreme Court upheld the fines in May, saying that the Constitution allows states to insist that electors vote for their parties’ candidates. In dissent, Justice Steven C. Gonzalez disagreed. “The Constitution provides the state only with the power to appoint,” he wrote, “leaving the electors with the discretion to vote their conscience.” Three months later, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, in Denver, rejected the Washington State Supreme Court’s reasoning. It said that Colorado had been wrong to discard a vote from a Democratic elector who had wanted to cast a ballot for Gov. John Kasich of Ohio. “Electors, once appointed, are free to vote as they choose,” Judge Carolyn B. McHugh wrote for the majority of a divided three-judge panel. “While the Constitution grants the states plenary power to appoint their electors, it does not provide the states the power to interfere once voting begins, to remove an elector, to direct the other electors to disregard the removed elector’s vote or to appoint a new elector to cast a replacement vote.” Such sharp disagreements in the lower courts make a Supreme Court review more likely. So does the importance of the issue: It is hardly far-fetched that the next presidential election could turn on the votes of faithless electors. Two things are reasonably clear. The first is that the framers of the Constitution and the language they used seemed to contemplate that electors would use independent judgment. The second is that over time people have come to assume that electors are meant to vote for their parties’ candidates. An 1892 Supreme Court decision captured this tension. “Doubtless it was supposed that the electors would exercise a reasonable independence and fair judgment in the selection of the chief executive,” Chief Justice Melville Fuller wrote. Over time, he added, “the original expectation may be said to have been frustrated.” Alexander Hamilton described that original expectation in the Federalist Papers. “Men chosen by the people for the special purpose” of selecting the president, he wrote, “will be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated investigations.” The Supreme Court these days is generally inclined to honor the original meaning of the Constitution, and the Tenth Circuit made a strong case that its language supports elector independence. The words of the relevant provisions, including “elector,” “vote” and “ballot,” Judge McHugh wrote, “have a common theme: They all imply the right to make a choice or voice an individual opinion.” On election night in 2016, the electoral vote was expected to be 306 for Donald J. Trump and 232 for Mrs. Clinton. In the end, though, it was 304 to 227. Seven electors succeeded in voting for other candidates. A fourth Democratic elector in Washington voted for Faith Spotted Eagle, and a Democratic elector in Hawaii voted for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Republican electors in Texas voted for Mr. Kasich and Ron Paul, a former representative of Texas. Three more Democratic electors, in Colorado, Maine and Minnesota, tried to vote for candidates other than Mrs. Clinton. Two were replaced, and a third eventually came around. The number of faithless votes was the largest in history, but the phenomenon was not particularly unusual. “Congress has accepted the vote of every vote contrary to a pledge or expectation in the nation’s history that has been transmitted to it — a total of more than 150 votes across 20 different elections from 1796 to 2016,” the petition filed last week said, citing data from FairVote, a nonpartisan voting rights advocacy group. Congress has only once debated the question, when some lawmakers objected in 1969 to counting a Republican elector’s vote for George C. Wallace after Richard M. Nixon won the popular vote in the elector’s state. Both houses rejected the objection, and the vote stood. Professor Lessig, the lawyer for the Washington State electors, said a decision in their favor could help focus public attention on the shortcomings of the Electoral College in reflecting the popular will. One response, he said, is the National Popular Vote plan, under which states agree to grant their electoral votes to the candidate who gets the most votes nationwide. “It could also convince both sides that it is finally time to step up and modify the Constitution to address this underlying problem,” he said. One possibility, he said, is a constitutional amendment requiring a proportional allocation of electoral votes at the state level. The key point for now, Professor Lessig said, is to have a definitive answer on elector independence before the justices can know which candidate might benefit from their ruling. “Whatever way you resolve it,” he said, “it should be resolved.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Fantastic Fungi’ Review: The Magic of Mushrooms,"Louie Schwartzberg’s informative and kooky documentary offers nothing less than a model for planetary survival. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Mushrooms, it turns out, are just the visible part of an awesome organism known as mycelium, most of which lies below ground. Neither animal nor vegetable, this vast network of cells has been sharing nutrients and forming connections for billions of years, breaking down decaying matter and transforming it into living soil. Making visible this endless cycle of decomposition and regeneration — and much more besides — Louie Schwartzberg’s lightly informative, delightfully kooky documentary, “Fantastic Fungi,” offers nothing less than a model for planetary survival. Our primary guide to ’shroom splendiferousness is the mycologist Paul Stamets (at one point sporting a Grateful Dead hat), who, vividly assisted by time-lapse cinematography, leads us through fungus-related science, history and even a dash of politics. (As some of you might remember, President Nixon wasn’t a fan of the psychedelic properties of some mushrooms.) Rounding up a chatty, knowledgeable bunch of fellow fungi enthusiasts, Stamets rhapsodizes over mycelium’s multiple talents. Apparently, it can clean our environment, kill termites and bedbugs, empower our immune systems and, on occasion, help terminally ill people face death. The same variety that may have caused our ancestors’ brains to triple in size (the endearingly named ‘stoned ape’ hypothesis) might also offer future help in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. A charming blend of science and conjecture, “Fantastic Fungi” wants to free your mind. (And maybe your wallet: Stamets sells as well as researches mushrooms.) I could have done without Brie Larson’s cutesy narration, but at least the press notes happily admit the appeal of her million or so Instagram followers — a level of social-media fame scientists can only dream of. And I’m pretty sure there’s a mushroom for that. Fantastic Fungi Not rated. Running time: 1 hour 21 minutes.

2019,‘For Colored Girls’ Is a Choreopoem. What’s a Choreopoem?,"This landmark work, “a whole new form of theater,” originated with a poet, Ntozake Shange, dancing. “For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf” is not a play. Or that’s not what the breakthrough work was called by its author, Ntozake Shange. Her word was “choreopoem,” and any production of “For Colored Girls,” like the major revival now in previews at the Public Theater, has to figure out what the term means. To the revival’s director, Leah C. Gardiner, the definition is not that complicated. “A choreopoem,” she said, “is a combination of all forms of theater storytelling.” Which isn’t to say that it’s simple to realize. In the carefully chosen words of the revival’s in-demand choreographer, Camille A. Brown, “combining text with movement is very complex.” For Paula Moss, the choreographer of the original 1976 production at the Public, “choreopoem” summons a memory of San Francisco in 1973. Shange, who died last year, had just met Ms. Moss in a dance class and invited her to a poetry reading. “She stood up and started to read a few of her poems,” Ms. Moss recalled in a telephone interview from her home in Rome. “Normally, poets stand there very stiff, but as she read, she starting dancing. Everyone was shocked.” “When she sat down,” Ms. Moss continued, “she turned to me and said, ‘I can’t do this anymore.’ I thought she was talking about writing. But she was talking about standing still.” From then on, whenever Shange recited her poetry, she moved. Often, Ms. Moss would be beside her, improvising in dance. “She told me to listen to her words and the sound of her voice and interpret them,” Ms. Moss recalled. “She had the flow of a musician, and she could communicate the most intimate and secret feelings that women were going through. And movement and words came from the same breath. There could be no separation.” Both in their 20s, they were quickly joined by other young women, and sometimes by musicians, as they performed the choreopoetry that would become “For Colored Girls” in women’s bars, cafes and Fillmore District clubs. After Shange and Ms. Moss drove to New York City, the work acquired a director and a more fixed shape. Eventually, at the Public Theater and then on Broadway, it became a landmark production of American theater, its script a classic of African-American literature. But it is not always remembered that it all started with a poet dancing. Shange, for her part, persistently emphasized the importance of dance in her life and work, the way it connected her to her body and her African-American heritage. “It’s how we remember what cannot be said,” she once wrote. In her essay-poem “Why I Had to Dance,” she recalled how, in the years she was developing “For Colored Girls,” dance became as important to her as writing. She acquired the habit of going directly from dance class to a coffee shop with her journal, as “the endorphin high” helped her “get to the truth.” More broadly, “movements propelled the language and/or the language propelled the dance.” After Shange relocated to New York, her favorite dance classes were those she took as a scholarship student at Sounds in Motion, the Harlem studio of the choreographer Dianne McInytre. Over the phone from Cleveland, Ms. McIntyre recalled “the beautiful flow” and flexibility of Shange in class: “She cut through space like a gazelle.” For the rest of Shange’s life, Ms. McIntyre often worked with her as a choreographer and a dancer. What Shange wanted from her, she said, was not literal translation: “You respond to the energy of her words, the meaning. You’re going deep to the place where she’s coming from.” There was “total collaboration,” she said, among Shange, a choreographer and a director. Similarly, it was “sometimes not easy to tell the difference between dancer, actor, singer. Everybody does everything. Everybody is thinking motion.” Aku Kadogo, another McIntyre student, joined Shange’s crew, improvising in bars then becoming an original cast member of “For Colored Girls.” Now the chair of theater and performance at Spelman College, she remembers how dance was “more public” back then: “Dance was around us, integral to our culture, and Ntozake captured that. She caught it with language.” References to dance abound in the text of “For Colored Girls,” in both the poetry (“we gotta dance to keep from cryin/we gotta dance to keep from dyin”) and the stage directions. Yet some audience members, Ms. Moss recalled, wondered where the choreography was. “That wasn’t the point,” she said. “This was a whole new form of theater. The choreography was within the poem and the performer. We worked hard to be free in our bodies as we recited the words.” It was a form of theater that Shange often had to defend. Calling herself a poet rather than a playwright, she railed against theater conventions, arguing that for black artists, plays without dancers and musicians were a waste of an “interdisciplinary culture.” Explaining her collaborations with choreographers and musicians, she wrote how in her work, as in traditional theater, “everyone’s efforts are directed toward the exploration and integrity of the text.” The difference in her collaborations: “The text grows.” Therein lies the promise and some of the perils facing the “For Colored Girls” revival. Ms. Brown knows something about the borderline between theater and dance. She is one of very few choreographers to maintain a successful contemporary dance troupe (hers performs at the Joyce Theater Nov. 9-10) and a thriving career in theater. (She choreographed the current Metropolitan Opera production of “Porgy and Bess” and her work on “Choir Boy” was nominated for a Tony Award earlier this year.) Interviewed before a recent rehearsal, Ms. Brown said that choreographing a choreopoem wasn’t so different from her usual practice. Much of her work is rooted in social dance and gesture. The children’s games — hand clapping, double Dutch — important to both the original production and to Ms. Gardiner’s vision, are a facet of African-American culture that Ms. Brown has already explored in her own “Black Girl: Linguistic Play.” It’s a connection that Shange recognized. Before her death, Shange interviewed Ms. Brown for a book she was writing about dance. (“I should be interviewing you,” Ms. Brown recalls thinking.) Planning the “For Colored Girls” revival, she told Ms. Gardiner that Ms. Brown was her choice for choreographer. Ms. Brown admits some difficulties, like the danger of falling into clichés of spoken-word performance. “How can we honor that tradition but still challenge people to think differently?” she asked. “How far can we stretch the abstraction and leave things a little more ambiguous?” But, especially as a choreographer working in theater, Ms. Brown said that she is grateful for the precedent set by Shange: “What’s beautiful about Ntozake’s work is that movement is not seen as a distraction. It’s part of the story. When I’m given the space to serve the story through movement, that feels good.” From her director’s perspective, Ms. Gardiner described the making of this choreopoem as a process of unusually pervasive collaboration. “You need everybody in the room at all times,” she said. “Even when I’ve directed musicals, everyone had a set role,” she added, whereas in “For Colored Girls” rehearsals, the team of black women — she and Ms. Brown and the composer, Martha Redbone — were “all in the pot, cooking it up together.” Working that way is costly, Ms. Gardiner noted. But it was Shange’s way, and Ms. Gardiner sees a connection between Shange’s example, a current upswing in dance and music in plays and a surge in black playwrights “working and writing out of our tradition.” It is, she said, “an exciting time in American theater.” A time that recalls an earlier time. Ms. Moss, thinking of the beginning in San Francisco, remembered a painful feeling, as she danced to Shange’s poems, of something holding her back, like being at the edge of a cliff unable to jump. “Until one day, I jumped,” she said, “and I felt this rush of freedom, and we drove that car across the country, saying to ourselves, “We have something.’”",The New York Times
2019,‘For Colored Girls’ Review: Ntozake Shange’s Women Endure,"critic’s pick The director Leah C. Gardiner delivers a warm and inspiriting revival of the landmark poetic drama, with a gloriously interdependent cast. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed play or musical through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Their individuality was always undeniable. But in their latest appearance on a New York stage, it’s clear that their combined strength is what has made these women so vital, so enduring. There are, technically, seven title characters in “For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf,” Ntozake Shange’s milestone work of theater from the mid-1970s. But in Leah C. Gardiner’s loving, collective embrace of a revival, which opened Tuesday at the Public Theater, seven also equals one. Such mathematics are of course essential to any ensemble performance, where interdependence is a given. Yet the team of actresses here, channeling what Shange called a choreopoem, takes onstage symbiosis to a radiant new level of both reliance and defiance. Their lyrical soliloquies may find their characters in extremis. But don’t ever think that they’re helpless in their vulnerability. These women always, but always, have one another’s backs. And as you watch a show that begins tentatively but keeps swelling in confidence, you realize that their number isn’t limited to seven, or more than twice that, if you count the all-female creative team. Legions of unseen others stand behind them. That includes the many actresses who played these parts in earlier productions, the women who inspired their stories and the female relatives of the cast members, whose faces are printed on their dresses, created by Toni-Leslie James. And of course, Shange herself, who died a year ago and who contained multitudes. “Colored Girls” was one of the most unexpected theater hits to emerge from the chaotic 1970s. First performed in bars and clubs, it found a more fixed home in New York’s Henry Street Settlement Theater, before moving to the Public Theater in 1976 and then, in short order, to Broadway, where it ran for 742 performances. Mainstream theatergoers had seen nothing like it. Shange’s free-form text was neither linear nor literal in its depiction of black women struggling to claim their own voices from a society that had either ignored or actively silenced them. “Bein’ alive and bein’ a woman and bein’ colored,” as one character says, “is a metaphysical dilemma I haven’t conquered yet.” Often they spoke in lush and startling metaphors — about the confusions of girlhood, the salvation of music and, above all, the men who used and abused them — and moved with hypnotic urgency. (“We gotta dance to keep from dyin’,” one says.) They were identified only by the hues of the dresses they wore, as in Lady in Red and Lady in Purple. And the term “colored girls” was neatly sprung from any patronizing racial context. Despite the rich specificity of its language, the play has proved surprisingly malleable in subsequent adaptations, which include a starry 2010 film by Tyler Perry. The last time I saw “Colored Girls” onstage — in 1995, with Shange directing — the palette of names had been changed (to shades like aqua and rose), and there were references to newly topical subjects, including AIDS. Gardiner’s version dispenses with those revisions. The text used here rearranges some of the original material. Other poems by Shange have been added and set to sensuous music by Martha Redbone, hauntingly sung by the siren-voiced Sasha Allen, as the Lady in Blue. But what’s most striking about this incarnation, which is choreographed by Camille A. Brown, is its pervasive sense of women talking to — and being deeply invested in — one another, as if in an eternal support group. It’s a sensibility that starts with its circular stage (Myung Hee Cho did the set, lighting is by Jiyoun Chang), which seems to exert a centripetal force, repeatedly pulling the performers into a single huddle. Not that the form of the individual monologues has been jettisoned. But while I remember “Colored Girls” as a series of vivid star turns, this version feels like an endlessly fluid collaboration. Some of the separate pieces have been divided, so that more than one person speaks them — or in the case of the balletically graceful deaf actress Alexandria Wailes, signs them. The individual narratives, many of which were drawn from Shange’s personal experiences, are often dense and elliptical in their imagery. And especially in the early sections, meaning is sometimes muddled. Other, later monologues land with an impact that shakes the house. They inevitably include the harrowing, climactic piece about a young mother in a disastrously destructive relationship (performed with scalding intensity by Jayme Lawson). But I was also blown away by Okwui Okpokwasili’s declaration of independence to the unnamed lover who “almost walked off wid alla my stuff.” It’s a great, trenchant piece of writing, irresistibly insistent in its repetitive accusations. But Okpokwasili knows just how to calibrate its quickening cadences. Throughout, you’re conscious of how all the performers — the others are Celia Chevalier, Danaya Esperanza and Adrienne C. Moore — are so completely there for the actress speaking. They snap their fingers and occasionally murmur in affirmation. If need be, they’ll step in to offer physical support, to prop up another woman if she seems overwhelmed or drained. They more or less enter dancing, by the way, in a prefatory passage that has them stretching their muscles, finding their grooves and loosely establishing a common physical vocabulary, as if in a workshop. It seems fitting that the show’s exhilarating high point isn’t a single soliloquy but a great, luminous coalescing of everyone onstage. This boisterous epiphany begins with one woman’s declaration, “My love is too delicate to have thrown back in my face.” The others join in, with a panoply of adjectives that define the incalculable worth of their love: It’s “too beautiful,” “too sanctified,” “too magic” to ever be taken for granted. Their voices meld, their bodies tumble and tangle together. And sisterhood becomes a single hydra-headed, multitongued entity, invincible and indivisible. God help the man who dares to cross it.

2019,‘Frankie’ Review: Troubled in Paradise,"Isabelle Huppert leads an impressive cast on a glum trip in Ira Sachs’s new film. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The first shot in “Frankie,” Ira Sachs’s new film, is an almost painterly study in color, like something by Hockney or Cézanne. The blue of a swimming pool, a spray of dense green foliage shrouding the creamy stones of the building (villa? hotel?) from which a woman emerges, her orange robe matching the tint of her hair. Leisure and languor, with a hint of intrigue, all of it beautifully rendered in Rui Poças’s mellow cinematography. Why set a movie in paradise unless you’re going to bring in some trouble? This beautiful spot — almost as charismatic as Isabelle Huppert, who plays the title character, a French actress — is in Sintra, a picturesque town near the coast of Portugal. A nearby beach has a name that alludes to the expulsion from Eden, so a suggestion of sin hangs in the air amid the churches and cafes. It’s part of the touristic atmosphere. The vacation that Frankie and her extended family are taking together has its own melancholy vibe. She’s dying — with the delicate radiance that only a movie star can bring to the task — and has summoned a husband, an ex-husband, a son, a stepdaughter and a close friend to join her for a few days of somber recreation. All these people have troubles of their own, and those compete with Frankie’s slightly inscrutable moods. Her husband, Jimmy (Brendan Gleeson), is miserable at the prospect of losing her. His predecessor, Michel (Pascal Greggory), is sympathetic. Jimmy’s daughter, Sylvia (Vinette Robinson), is preparing to leave her husband, Ian (Ariyon Bakare). Their daughter, Maya (Sennia Nanua), meets a handsome Portuguese boy on her way to the beach. Frankie’s friend Ilene (Marisa Tomei) has arrived with her lover, Gary (Greg Kinnear), who wants their relationship to become more serious. Frankie, though, wants to fix Ilene up with her mopey son, Paul (Jérémie Renier). All of this business has comic potential, or it would if Sachs were inclined to play it that way. His intentions seem more novelistic, as he stitches together minor-key vignettes on muffled emotions. Regret, longing, disappointment, ennui. To complain that it isn’t much fun might be to miss the point, or to repeat Frankie’s fundamental mistake, which is to expect pleasure to coexist with grief. But “Frankie” doesn’t summon much in the way of pathos either. Sachs is a disciplined anti-melodramatist, who at his best (in “Love Is Strange” and “Keep the Lights On,” for my money) can turn emotional reserve into its own kind of intensity. This time, though, the undercurrents of feeling are too faint to register much at all. “Frankie” feels less like a project that went astray than like one that was left unfinished. A cast of excellent actors stand around looking tentative, delivering stilted lines in scenery whose beauty is perhaps meant to take up the expressive slack. Huppert’s uncanny mixture of self-possession and wildness is never not interesting to watch, but when Frankie is off screen she takes the film’s life force with her. You can understand how everyone will miss her when she’s gone, but at the same time you can’t be too sorry that she’ll be free of these dull, dreary people. Frankie Rated PG-13.

2019,‘Freestyle Love Supreme’ Review: Hip-Hop Saves the World,"critic’s pick This exultant evening of improvised rap — created by Thomas Kail, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Anthony Veneziale — turns out to be a perfect fit for Broadway. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed play or musical through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. And just as you were thinking that life has no rhyme nor reason these days, along comes “Freestyle Love Supreme” to pump you full of hope. This exultant master course in the fine art of hip-hop, which opened on Wednesday night at the Booth Theater, suggests that there’s no feeling, thought or experience so anxious or so random that it can’t be translated into infectious, neon-bright rhythms. Confusion, frustration, depression — such emotions are banished by the team assembled on the stage to find the great, sick beat in your past and present woes. If you’re asking who gives a rap on Broadway, you clearly haven’t been in that neighborhood since a show called “Hamilton” opened there four years ago. That trophy-laden hip-hop portrait of America’s founding fathers redefined what a Broadway musical could be, finding an authenticity and vitality in the lives of those long dead through a defiantly contemporary sound. The team behind that work included Lin-Manuel Miranda — its writer, composer and original star — and Thomas Kail, its director. They are also the creators of “Freestyle Love Supreme,” along with Anthony Veneziale, who conceived the idea for it 15 years ago. On the night I saw the show, directed by Mr. Kail, the amiable M.C. in chief was Mr. Veneziale. The rest of the cast (which isn’t fixed) included two fellow rappers (Utkarsh Ambudkar and Aneesa Folds), two beatboxers (Chris Sullivan and Kaila Mullady) and two keyboard players (Arthur Lewis, who also sings sweetly, and Ian Weinberger). There is also a guest star at each performance. Mine was Mr. Miranda, whom the crowd greeted with the kind of cheers that follow clock-beating touchdowns at home-team stadiums. Finally, it was possible to make out that Mr. Miranda was saying, like a Dolly Levi in denim, that it was so nice to be back on Broadway, where he belongs. Indeed he does. And so does “Freestyle,” seen Off Broadway at the Greenwich House Theater earlier this year. This production may lack a script, a song list and a chorus line. Yet it is, in its way, the distilled essence of that venerable national institution, the musical comedy. The enduring appeal of that form lies in its ability to exalt the everyday by endowing it with the pattern of rhythmic song. This is also what the spontaneous, self-created musicians of the 1970s were doing in the Bronx, when rap began its unstoppable spread through this country’s culture. What distinguishes “Freestyle Love Supreme” from other Broadway songfests is that its numbers spring into existence before your very eyes, or ears. And you, dear audience members, are the co-authors of these numbers — feeding the onstage crew the words, ideas and emotions that they then transform into improbably rhymed performance pieces. That means live theater doesn’t get more live than this. “Freestyle” demands that you exist purely in the here-and-now of the show. And to guarantee you do so, it requires that all smartphones (and smartwatches) be locked into Yondr pouches before you take your seat. (Can’t we make this a universal practice on Broadway?) Unmediated experience. How scary. How liberating. What you see onstage, before the cast arrives, is more or less a tabula rasa. Beowulf Boritt’s set consists of four stools, a couple of keyboards, a bongo drum and a blazing neon icon of the show’s logo. You hear the performers before you see them, doing highly audible mic checks in the wings. Then as the dim stage brightens (Jeff Croiter did the lighting), they’re on. Which means you are, too. With a silken patter that never stoops to snark or condescension — and an inclusive attention that reaches deep into the mezzanine — Mr. Veneziale asks the audience to feed him words. (There is also a box full of words on slips of paper, to which theatergoers can contribute before the show begins.) Who knew how malleable and melodic the verb “dribble” could be? Or that there really are rhymes for “meniscus”? Or that any performer possessed the concentration to keep all these words in play for the entire performance? When the theatergoers are asked to come up with names of things they hate, it may seem like an invitation to partisan rancor. But this production has a way of appropriating and defusing what makes people angry and uncomfortable. The hate objects on the night I saw this show were “jalapeño,” “Brexit” and “living in New York City.” Mr. Ambukdar took jalapeño, and turned the peppery noun into a sweetly scatological lament about indigestion. Mr. Veneziale riffed tartly on Brexit. Ms. Folds, a newcomer to the team with a singing voice that scales the heights of exasperation, took us on a rhymed excursion through the overcrowded purgatory of Times Square. “Meniscus,” an anatomical term referring to a part of the knee, became the improbable basis for deeply heartfelt love letters to family members (Mr. Miranda’s children; Mr. Ambudkar’s bride). With godlike generosity, the longest set pieces allow an audience member to relive and redeem a regrettable moment from the past and — for the pièce de résistance — to see her day (the day of this performance) turned into an instant musical comedy. (In this case, since the volunteer was a theater student, Mr. Veneziale got to crow, “I am not throwing away my shot” — a key lyric from “Hamilton” — which allowed Mr. Miranda to offer a terse critique on his delivery.) There are elements of satire throughout, but they are never vicious or sharp-edged. “Freestyle Love Supreme” takes the love part of its title seriously. Any insults exchanged here bring to mind gentle teasing within an affectionate family. As the rappers turn chaos into cadence, let’s not forget who lays the foundation for the metamorphoses: Mr. Sullivan, whose voice becomes an inspirational symphony of percussive noises. At one point, Ms. Mullady enters to perform a beat duet with Mr. Sullivan. The throbbing begins with that ultimate beat-maker, the human heart. The performers enact what looks like an instant surgical heart exchange, so they can share the same rhythm. That’s a pretty good a metaphor for the blissful achievement of this show. We’ve all been given a transplant of a heart that, as they say, beats as one. And for the show’s all-too-fleeting 85 minutes, it’s possible to believe that rhythm and rhyme are a miracle cure for all that ails us.

2019,‘Gemini Man’ Review: That Assassin Looks a Lot Like Will Smith,"This globe-trotting action thriller directed by Ang Lee is largely forgettable, except for one co-star. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. I’m a little worried that the premise of “Gemini Man,” which is the most interesting thing about it, might also count as a spoiler. So if you don’t want to know anything about this movie other than that Will Smith plays a super-lethal military assassin hunted by nefarious forces in his own government — which is too much of a cliché to count as a spoiler — then maybe you should move along. Or just watch the trailer, declare the whole thing spoiled, and go about your day. Because what places this globe-trotting action caper, directed by Ang Lee, just a little bit above “utterly forgettable” is the fact that Smith plays more than one assassin. The first one is Henry Brogan, a sniper who has decided to retire after killing dozens of bad guys over the years. Not so fast, Henry! As soon as he settles down in his house on the Georgia coast, gunmen start showing up to terminate his pension. When he gets to Colombia, another would-be killer shows up, but this one — get ready! — is Henry’s own clone. Henry 2.0 is called Junior, and he is also played by Will Smith. He was cultivated by Henry’s former boss, Clay Verris (Clive Owen), a nasty bureaucrat with good taste in art. Junior is 25 years younger than his — original? donor? template? tissue sample? — an effect that has been achieved via digital de-aging, the cinematic trend of 2019. Various techniques to shave off the years were used on Samuel L. Jackson in “Captain Marvel” and on Robert De Niro in “The Irishman.” There is something both unnerving and poignant about seeing these familiar faces turned into younger versions of themselves, because they don’t quite recapture the smooth-faced stars we remember. Junior doesn’t look like the Will Smith of 25 years ago as much as he looks like a 25-year-old who is really, really tired of everyone telling him how much he looks like Will Smith. Junior tries to beat Henry to death with a motorcycle in Cartagena. Later on they trade punches in Budapest. Since a globe-trotting assassin needs someone to banter with and care about, Henry acquires two sidekicks, a younger (but not cloned) operative (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and a grizzled veteran (Benedict Wong). As the three of them uncover the buried secrets about Junior’s background and Verris’s treachery, some philosophical and practical questions arise about how Henry should relate to Junior. Is he a second dad? A big brother? A grouchy uncle? How well does he know the kid, anyway? The answers, tucked into a sludgy script by David Benioff, Billy Ray and Darren Lemke, will not surprise you. What might surprise you, and not happily, is the way “Gemini Man” looks, thanks to Lee’s insistence on using the high-frame-rate 3-D format that he first tried out in “Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk.” The effect is like watching a “Jason Bourne” dinner-theater production in the grip of a migraine. The performances feel slow and deliberate, and the hyper-clarity of the images undermines realism rather than enhancing it. Everything is either too bright or too dim. Action sequences rattle on in murky twilight, and actual places look like cartoons. It takes some work to make Budapest and Cartagena look like generic video-game backdrops, but Lee succeeds. Whatever mystery, intrigue or charm might have percolated in the story and the performances is bleached away by the soulless literalism of the pictures. The partial exception, as I’ve suggested, can be found in Smith’s faces, which haunt each other. The idea of confronting an unknown second self is full of rich, uncanny potential — there’s a literary tradition going back at least to Edgar Allan Poe — but “Gemini Man” squanders it, along with what might have been two interesting performances. Gemini Man Rated PG-13. Dudes fighting, and they might even be the same dude! Running time: 1 hour 57 minutes.

2019,‘Get Over It’? Why Political Influence in Foreign Policy Matters,"Readers have asked The New York Times why asking another nation for help ahead of an election is such a serious issue. Here are some answers. WASHINGTON — A July 25 call between President Trump and the president of Ukraine is the basis for an impeachment inquiry into whether Mr. Trump withheld American military aid until Ukrainian officials investigated former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son, Hunter. Last week the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, effectively acknowledged the quid pro quo, although he said the aid was in part contingent on Ukraine’s investigating Mr. Trump’s widely debunked theory that Ukraine, not Russia, was responsible for hacking Democratic Party emails in 2016. The theory is politically helpful to Mr. Trump because it would show he was elected president without that Russian help. Mr. Mulvaney was unapologetic in his remarks. “I have news for everybody: Get over it,” Mr. Mulvaney told reporters at the White House. “There’s going to be political influence in foreign policy.” (He later reversed himself and has said his comments were misconstrued.) Readers have asked The New York Times to explain why, exactly, another nation’s interference in the democratic process is such a serious issue. Here are some answers. Other countries have their own interests, and those interests don’t always match ours, said Trevor Potter, the founder of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan group that works to ensure fair elections. “Many countries are rivals of ours and of our democratic system,” Mr. Potter said. He listed as two chief examples China and Russia, countries that Mr. Trump has publicly suggested could help him achieve his political aims. “In some cases, they’re going to want policies that help them and therefore hurt us. In other cases, though, they just want us to fail.” Trump administration officials — but not the president himself — have publicly and repeatedly warned foreign governments not to meddle in American elections. Yes. The ability of a foreign nation to gain access and influence over America’s democratic process has been a concern since the early days of the republic. During the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787, delegates debated what kind of behavior should merit a president’s removal from office. George Mason suggested the standard of “high crimes and misdemeanors,” which holds to this day. One of the high crimes the framers had in mind was accepting money from a foreign power, or what Alexander Hamilton said was giving in to “the desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils.” In short, the authors of the Constitution saw few bigger threats than a president corruptly tied to forces from overseas. Mr. Trump has denied any explicit quid pro quo — a favor or advantage granted or expected in return for something — in his call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky. He has repeatedly referred to it as a “perfect” conversation. But several elements of the call could conceivably have been used as bargaining chips by Mr. Trump. One was the American military aid, which came to nearly $400 million for security assistance to help Ukraine fight Russian aggression on its eastern border. The other was a proposed Oval Office meeting between Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Trump, highly desired by Mr. Zelensky as a powerful show of American support at a time when Ukraine is under threat from Russia. According to a summary of the call released by the White House, Mr. Trump raised two matters after Mr. Zelensky spoke of his need for American help. “I would like you to do us a favor, though,” Mr. Trump said, shifting the conversation to ask Mr. Zelensky to investigate the Bidens as well as the conspiracy theory. Mr. Zelensky responded that his prosecutor general would look into those issues, and asked Mr. Trump to provide any additional information that could aid in the investigation. At its most basic level, asking another government for help — whether a quid pro quo existed or not — means that Mr. Trump would find himself indebted to another country. Doing this in private is especially alarming, Mr. Potter said, because the Trump administration’s decision to even temporarily withhold military aid for a country that needs to arm itself against Russia goes directly against American national security interests. “If the president of Ukraine has agreed to do this, he has something to hold over the head of the president of the United States,” Mr. Potter said. “It indeed opens the president up to political blackmail.” Asking a foreigner for aid in an American political campaign is illegal, which Ellen L. Weintraub, the head of the Federal Election Commission, has made clear. “If a foreign government is investing resources in producing something that will be a value to a campaign here in the United States, that’s a problem,” Ms. Weintraub said in an interview with ABC News. No. Both Republican and Democratic presidential administrations have resisted the idea of enlisting help from foreign powers for political advantage. In 1992, when President George Bush was behind in the polls in his re-election campaign against Bill Clinton, a group of Republican lawmakers suggested to White House officials that they ask the British and Russian governments to dig up unflattering information on Mr. Clinton’s actions protesting the Vietnam War during his time in London, and to look into a visit he made to Moscow. “They wanted us to contact the Russians or the British to seek information on Bill Clinton’s trip to Moscow,” James A. Baker III, Mr. Bush’s chief of staff, wrote in a memo at the time. “I said we absolutely could not do that.” Ten former chiefs of staff for five former presidents — Ronald Reagan, both Bushes, Mr. Clinton and Barack Obama — have all said they would have considered such a prospect unacceptable. But that doesn’t mean the Russians haven’t tried. The Soviet Union offered to help Adlai Stevenson make a third presidential run in 1960, a proposal he turned down. The Soviet ambassador likewise offered to help finance Hubert Humphrey’s campaign in 1968, drawing another rejection. And Leonid Brezhnev told Gerald R. Ford that he would “do everything we can” to help him win in 1976, a comment Mr. Ford brushed off without taking seriously. Yes. The Central Intelligence Agency helped overthrow elected leaders in Iran and Guatemala in the 1950s and backed violent coups in several other countries in the 1960s. It plotted assassinations and supported brutal anti-Communist governments in Latin America, Africa and Asia. The C.I.A. has planted misinformation and, at times, used cash as a way to achieve foreign policy aims. But experts have argued that modern American efforts are not morally equivalent to those in Russia. In recent decades, American efforts have been geared toward promoting candidates who challenge authoritarian leaders. Russian efforts, on the other hand, are meant to sow discord. “We often consider ourselves and hold ourselves out as an example of how other countries should conduct themselves,” Mr. Potter said. “When we have internal battles or things have gone wrong here, it is much harder to do that.” He added, “Countries can exploit that and say, ‘We may be bad, but the United States is no better.’” Sort of. The only impeachment involving foreign policy came in the case of a senator, William Blount, who was accused in 1797 of scheming to transfer parts of Florida and the Louisiana Territory to Britain. The House impeached Blount, but he fled Washington. The Senate opted to expel him rather than convict him at trial. Peter Baker contributed reporting.",The New York Times
2019,‘Gift’ Review: More Precious Than Money,"Robin McKenna’s documentary explores the social and ethical value of art. At a time when art is relentlessly commercialized and commodified, Robin McKenna’s “Gift” provides a gentle and welcome reminder of other values. Inspired by a book by Lewis Hyde that has gathered a passionate following since it was first published in 1983, and including some of Hyde’s thoughts as on-screen texts, this essay-like documentary argues that works of the imagination are governed by a logic of human exchange independent and often opposed to economics and politics. Traveling from New Zealand to Canada’s Pacific Northwest and from Rome to Burning Man, the film follows a selection of people whose creative pursuits aren’t driven by money or fame. Perhaps in keeping with this ethic of modesty, none of them are identified by their names. Each one explains the values, traditions and ambitions that guide them. The most conventional — or perhaps the most professional — is an artist organizing an exhibition at a museum, where patrons are given a flower that they then pass along to strangers. It’s interesting to see how uncomfortable such random acts of generosity can make their intended recipients. In other cases, though, there is a cultural context to help the gifts on their way, like Burning Man with a blend of high-tech and hippie utopianism, or the potlatch, an ancient custom organized around the redistribution of goods and the affirmation of communal ties. Perhaps the most radical space the filmmakers visit is Rome’s Metropoliz, described as “the world’s only inhabited museum” and a place where families, most of them undocumented migrants, live among installations and murals contributed by artists from Italy and elsewhere. Like the rest of this film, Metropoliz insists that art is worth most when it is least separate from the rest of life. Gift Not rated. In English and Italian, with subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 30 minutes.",The New York Times

2019,Opinion | ‘Harvey Weinstein Told Me He Liked Chinese Girls’,"Opinion Why it took me more than 20 years to tell my #MeToo story. Rowena Chiu.CreditCreditJason Henry for The New York Times Ms. Chiu is a former assistant to Harvey Weinstein. Harvey Weinstein told me he liked Chinese girls. He liked them because they were discreet, he said — because they knew how to keep a secret. Hours later, he attempted to rape me. You’ve most likely never heard of me. I’m not an actress. I don’t even work in Hollywood anymore. I was one of many ordinary, unfamous women trying to do their jobs who were abused by Harvey. What happened on that night would shape the rest of my life. Unbeknown to me, I was about to keep a secret — a devastating, suffocating secret, one that would drive me to attempt suicide twice, one that I wouldn’t breathe a word of to my husband of a decade, one that would silence me for the next 21 years. In 1998, I had recently graduated from Oxford with a degree in English literature, and my one ambition was to succeed in the film industry. This was perhaps unexpected, given my background: I was born just outside London, to parents who had emigrated from Asia and whose middle-class aspirations for my sister and me took the form of more conventional professional careers, like law or medicine. I regularly attended church and thrived in this sheltered environment. Working in Hollywood would have seemed an unattainable dream to me back then. So it was like an answer to prayer when I was chosen, while answering phones at a talent agency, to assist Harvey in London on his European productions. When my future colleague, Zelda Perkins, interviewed me, she warned that my potential new boss had a reputation for inappropriate behavior and towering fits of rage, but I was to “handle him robustly” and I would be totally fine. In July 1998, Harvey was en route to London to attend a private screening of the new cut for “Shakespeare in Love.” I watched as tension levels in the office rose. In the taxi to the screening room, I was coached: “Do exactly as he tells you and you’ll be fine.” My first task was to simply sit directly in front of Harvey during the screening. At one point, fearful that my head was blocking his view, I attempted to shuffle over. “Sit down!” he instantly roared, adding an expletive. I should have known better and left the room (and the job) that very instant. Years later, I realized this was part of the grooming process — a test of how much I would tolerate. Harvey played games of this sort impeccably, testing how far he could go, wielding both the carrot (if you survived working with him, he could make your career) and the stick (if you refused his advances, he would do his best to ensure you never again worked in the movie industry). I’ve had many years to ruminate on how I fell into Harvey’s trap, and the best way to understand it is through the four power dynamics of gender, race, seniority and wealth. The first power imbalance — that of man versus woman — was obvious. I was a woman in an industry in which women still struggle to be taken seriously. Harvey was a man in an industry in which men dominate, and he often used that dominance to claim sexual favors. The second power imbalance was around race — the fact that Harvey was white and I was a person of color. My ethnicity initially marked me as different and inferior: He assured Zelda that he wouldn’t harass me because he didn’t, as I remember it, “do Chinese or Jewish girls.” Then later, he turned around and defined me in terms of sexual exoticism, telling me, just before he tried to rape me, that he’d never had a Chinese girl. It affected our dynamics in other ways too. The idea of the Asian immigrant “model minority” is a cliché, but at least in my British-Chinese family, we were afraid of standing out. I was taught not to talk back — to aunties and uncles, to my parents, to my teachers, to perfect strangers. I learned the social benefits of being deferential, polite and well behaved. As with many Asian women, this meant that I was visible as a sex object, invisible as a person. Harvey may not have created this imbalance, but he and many others have capitalized on it, knowingly or unknowingly, to abuse women of color. The third power imbalance was around seniority. Harvey was a power player, and I was the lowest person on the totem pole. Assistants are the unseen work force that props Hollywood up, and yet we have zero leverage. I was invisible and inconsequential. Finally, the wealth — Harvey was a multimillionaire, with all the influence money could buy. I was a fresh graduate loaded with student debt. Even during the few months I worked with him, I saw firsthand the influence that money could buy. Later, I was to discover that it could even buy silence. At the Venice Film Festival later that year, these four power imbalances collided in a late-night meeting with Harvey. I had expected to discuss potential film productions and scripts, and we did. But after hours of fending off his chitchat, flattery, requests for massages and a bath, ultimately I found myself pushed back against the bed. I’d worn two pairs of tights for protection, and tried to appease him by taking one of them off and letting him massage me, but it hadn’t worked. He’d taken off the other pair and I was terrified my underwear would be next. Harvey moved in: Please, he told me, just one thrust, and it will all be over. I was terrified and pleaded that we should go back to the scripts, that I had a boyfriend, that Zelda would worry about me. In the end, I was able to wriggle off the bed and leave; I believe this is because Harvey thought there would be another night to play the game, and half the fun was the chase — the opportunity to prolong a situation in which he could exert power. I would be back, he must have thought. The four power asymmetries dictated it would be so. The next day, when I relayed these events to Zelda, we sat on the floor and cried. Our options were painfully few. We were two young women, with limited resources, stranded in a foreign country. Despite this, Zelda bravely confronted Harvey immediately, at least ensuring that I would never be alone in the same room as my predator again. We vowed to seek a resolution upon our return to London. Yet, when we began attempts to report Harvey to his superiors or the police, multiple senior individuals acted to shut us down. Some outright laughed in our faces. The message was always the same: Who would ever believe us over the most powerful man in Hollywood? A senior colleague advised us to hire lawyers, but we had no experience in how to do that, nor did we have Harvey’s deep pockets. We eventually found a small firm that agreed to represent us, but the imbalance of power between our lawyers and his lawyers led to us accepting an outcome we had not sought. We had wanted to report Harvey to his superiors; instead, we were pressured into signing a nondisclosure agreement that prevented us from speaking to family and friends, and made it extremely difficult to work with a therapist or a lawyer, or to aid a criminal investigation. Chillingly, it also required us to identify anyone we had already spoken to. The negotiations were conducted under conditions of extreme duress: We were once kept at the office overnight, from 5 p.m. to 5 a.m., escorted to the bathroom, provided with the barest minimum of food and drink and not permitted pen and paper to keep notes. We were not even allowed to keep a copy of this most egregious of agreements: We had signed our lives away in a complex 30-page document that we could not refer to. But even after the weeks of intense pressure, when I finally signed the nondisclosure document, accepting a settlement of £125,000 (about $213,000) and agreeing to stay silent forever, the trauma was not yet over. Zelda and I were told to consider this period of our lives a “black hole,” never to be mentioned again. We felt we could not see each other again, lest we slip up and accidentally discuss these events — so we would not communicate until almost two decades later. I signed the agreement, thinking it would be easy to find another job; in reality, I spent six months interviewing at dozens of film companies in London. Everyone wanted to meet; no one wanted to employ an assistant who had left Miramax under suspicious circumstances. Unable to find work elsewhere, I ended up in a role in Hong Kong that I suspected Harvey created to keep me in his orbit — dependent on Miramax and yet sidelined in Asia. I was miserable. And the worst was to come. I was embarking upon almost two decades of living with a secret trauma of such magnitude that I would attempt suicide twice before I finally quit Miramax. I lived in constant fear of Harvey’s abuse, control and power; that the story would come back to haunt me; that I would inadvertently slip up on my promise to never speak of this. I suffered, completely isolated from those around me who could have provided the support I needed: a loved one, a trusted pastor, a respected therapist — even the man I would marry. I spent decades grappling with guilt that I took the job, that I hadn’t left the room sooner, that it was somehow my fault, that I hadn’t handled Harvey “robustly” enough, that I was not tough enough to work in the film industry. Other survivors have said things like “I’ve been waiting for this knock on my door for 27 years,” but for me, I lived in terror of that knock. Over the years, various journalists have tracked me down. I always hid. In summer 2017, the New York Times reporter Jodi Kantor finally stood on my driveway in California; it would take 18 months before I dared speak to her. After Ms. Kantor and her colleague Megan Twohey broke the Weinstein story two years ago, I watched from the sidelines as the #MeToo movement unfolded, too afraid to share even a simple #MeToo on Facebook. My four children were young, and I was terrified that journalists would surround the house and that my children would be followed to school. I had been so completely silenced that although I was central to a story that had ignited a global movement, I did not participate. Remaining silent had become integral to my identity, both as a woman and a person of color. Then, in September 2018, I watched another woman, Christine Blasey Ford, speak up about the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Coincidentally, only a few minutes from my house she was living the very existence I’d feared — getting death threats and leaving her home to take refuge in hotel rooms. In January, I had the privilege of sharing my story with Dr. Blasey and other survivors in a group interview conducted by Ms. Kantor and Ms. Twohey. I was still unresolved about going public. But meeting others who’d had similar experiences created a seismic shift within me. It still took several months for me to agree to participate in Ms. Kantor and Ms. Twohey’s book, “She Said.” But it is important to me now that I speak up, that I allow my voice, an Asian voice, an assistant’s voice, to join the array of voices in the #MeToo movement. Since the story broke in October 2017, many actresses, from the relatively unknown to the superstars, have come out with stories about Harvey. Yet the stories of assistants have gotten relatively little attention by comparison, and tragically, even fewer of those voices have been of women of color. Last month, 21 years after Harvey attempted to rape me, I finally stepped out of the shadows to allow the public to know my name. The day after I was interviewed on the “Today” show, Harvey denied my account and threatened to sue me, claiming we had a consensual “six-month physical relationship.” It isn’t true. But muddying the waters is a common tactic of abusers. Saturday was two years to the day that Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey broke the Weinstein story. I don’t know what the path ahead looks like. But for now, I am getting used to being stopped in the street to talk about #MeToo; I am happy that my children can know my secret; I am grateful to be able to be honest with family and friends, who are coming forward in droves to offer support. I can briefly glory in the relief that I am no longer sitting on a sickening secret that has — finally and ultimately — come to light. Rowena Chiu is a former assistant to Harvey Weinstein.

2019,‘He Was Loved by All’: Friends in Baltimore Mourn Elijah Cummings,"The veteran congressman became a symbol of hope and stability in a city that sometimes sorely lacked it. BALTIMORE — A tall man in a winter coat took off his hat and bowed his head just outside the office of Representative Elijah E. Cummings on Thursday. He stood for a minute, eyes closed, then turned and walked away. A bouquet of white tulips lay on the ground near the door. Four musicians from the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra came to play some music, including an improvisation of “Amazing Grace,” one of Mr. Cummings’s favorites. They were small, quiet gestures in the early hours after Mr. Cummings’s death on Thursday morning — a kind of calm before the storm of formal mourning ceremonies to come. But they were also a testament to the power of the feeling that the people of Baltimore had for Mr. Cummings, a man who walked in the shoes of this city for much of his life. “When I got the news this morning, tears were just streaming,” said the Rev. Alvin Hathaway, who with Mr. Cummings were black graduates from a mostly white high school in Baltimore in 1969. Mr. Hathaway was more interested in sports in those years, but Mr. Cummings pushed him to excel academically, telling him there was more at stake than his own school record. “He kept us focused,” Mr. Hathaway said. “People don’t talk like that now. But he’d say, ‘We are leaders of our race. We are leaders of our community. We have to do the right thing.’” He added, through tears: “That’s why everybody knew him, because he lived our journey. He was not apart from our journey. He lived our journey and he challenged us to excel in our journey.” On a windy afternoon, residents recalled Mr. Cummings’s friendliness and enthusiasm for local haunts. “He loved the meatballs,” said Sammy Curreri, owner of Sammy’s Trattoria on North Charles Street. Mr. Curreri said Mr. Cummings would often come in during the week. “It would be early,” he said. “He would usually just shoot me a text around 5 p.m.” He was famous in Baltimore, but he never acted like it, Mr. Curreri added. Mr. Cummings was also a symbol of stability in a city that sometimes sorely lacked it. He served in Maryland’s House of Representatives from 1983 to 1996, the year he was elected to Congress from Maryland’s Seventh District, which includes part of Baltimore. He was trained as a lawyer, but his passion was politics. In the late 1960s, during the tumult of the civil rights movement, Mr. Cummings, still a teenager, got involved in helping elect the first African-American judge in Baltimore. “He was involved early on with our political growth, even before he graduated from Howard and went to law school,” Mr. Hathaway said. He would go on to become a political powerhouse in Congress, where he stood out for his bipartisan inclinations. Ralph Moore Jr., a veteran activist in Baltimore who teaches classes for adults getting their G.E.D. at Baltimore City Community College, said Mr. Cummings’s unflappable optimism sometimes frustrated him. “He was a moderating influence,” Mr. Moore said. “He wanted this system to work. He believed in it. I guess from the vantage point of a congressman that makes sense. But he was mindful that from our vantage point in a city like Baltimore, you have to keep wondering how is this going to work.” One example was Mr. Cummings’s response to President Trump’s attack on Twitter this summer in which the president called his district a “rodent infested mess.” Mr. Cummings replied calmly: “Mr. President, I go home to my district daily. Each morning, I wake up, and I go and fight for my neighbors.” “He was being nice to him,” Mr. Moore said, “and I didn’t agree with him being nice to him.” But that spirit is what made Mr. Cummings unique, his friends in Baltimore said on Thursday. He was “so much larger than who he was,” said Bishop Walter Thomas, the pastor of New Psalmist Baptist Church, a sprawling, cream-colored building in West Baltimore, where Mr. Cummings was a member and had attended services most Sundays for decades. “He was something so different,” Mr. Thomas said. “He was not the angry protester. He was not the passive peacemaker. He was the deliberate man who stood for right and wrestled wrong until right became the natural winner.” Even after Mr. Cummings faced health challenges, he never lost his drive as a community activist, Mr. Thomas said. Mr. Thomas remembered walking arm in arm with Mr. Cummings, trying to calm the crowds, during the riots after the funeral of Freddie Gray, who had died in police custody in 2015. “He was sick that night, really sick, but he came out because he did not want to see a disruption in our city,” Mr. Thomas said. “He came out night after night after night until the city was at peace. That is who he was. That’s what he lived for. He was the underdog’s hero and the overlord’s threat. He was loved by all.” He added, “In his own inimitable way, living in Baltimore in the Seventh Congressional District, he touched lives all over the world.” Ray Kelly, the lead community liaison for the court-appointed monitoring team that is overseeing Baltimore’s compliance with mandated police reforms, said it was Mr. Cummings’s moral leadership in the era of Mr. Trump’s presidency that he will most remember. “As this Trump administration came in, he kind of moved into the position for all black urban communities against those kinds of oppressive types of governance,” he said. “I think that will be his legacy.” “I’m going to miss that champion,” he said. “It gives me pause to think who will step into that role with the passion and the vigor that Elijah Cummings had.” An earlier version of this article misquoted Bishop Walter Thomas, the pastor of New Psalmist Baptist Church in Baltimore. He said Representative Elijah E. Cummings touched lives all over the world “in his own inimitable way,” not “in his own inimical way.”",The New York Times
2019,‘He’s Given Everything’: C.C. Sabathia’s Career Ends in Pain,"Sabathia, one of the Yankees’ most respected veterans, walked off the mound for the final time in less-than-ideal circumstances: with an injured arm during a dreary postseason loss. As the 2019 season wound down and C.C. Sabathia approached the finish line of a 19-year career, he often imagined what his final appearance in Yankee Stadium would look and sound like: a long, loving ovation from the crowd as he strode off the mound. It would be the proper show of appreciation not just for Sabathia’s 251 career wins and 3,000-plus strikeouts, but for the good will he has generated throughout the big leagues. Loved by his teammates, admired by his opponents, Sabathia indeed got that ovation Thursday night in the Bronx, even from the Houston Astros in the visitors’ dugout and George Springer in the on-deck circle — but not for the reasons he had hoped. Nothing, in fact, went according to plan. Sabathia entered in the eighth inning, relieving Adam Ottavino as the Yankees were being throttled in Game 4 of the American League Championship Series. After throwing 16 pitches, feeling some twinges along the way, Sabathia was done in by the 17th, wincing in pain as he walked in a dazed circle behind the rubber. Yankees Manager Aaron Boone and the trainer Steve Donohue rushed to the mound, as did the Yankees infielders. Sabathia tried one more practice pitch before the verdict was cemented: the beloved left-hander’s career had just abruptly ended. On Friday, the day after their dreary 8-3 loss to the Astros, the Yankees announced Sabathia had sustained a subluxation, or partial dislocation, of his left shoulder and would be replaced on the roster by the right-hander Ben Heller. But even before the move, Boone’s postgame prognosis had made the situation clear: “We’ve got to see more about it, but not good,” he said. Sabathia did not speak to reporters after the game; he waited until a Friday afternoon news conference to reflect on the night. His arm in a sling and still tender, Sabathia seemed at peace. Rather than wondering what went wrong or how he could have prevented the injury, he instead accepted his fate. “This is the best way it could end for me,” Sabathia said. “I threw until I couldn’t anymore.” His teammates were just as open about their feelings. One by one, they spoke of Sabathia’s courage in continuing to pitch in pain over the final weeks of the regular season. Even though he had struggled with chronic arthritis in his right knee, it was the left shoulder that proved to be the problem. Sabathia received a cortisone shot two weeks ago and was left off the roster during the Yankees’ division series against Minnesota. Sabathia was added to the roster for the A.L.C.S., with Boone hoping to bolster the pitching staff to help hold down the Astros and their A.L.-leading offense. The plan was to use Sabathia as a one-out specialist against left-handed hitters who would be vulnerable to his cut fastball. But Boone was looking for more than just corner strikes from Sabathia: He was hoping the veteran’s leadership would make a difference in this high-pressured series. His status as a clubhouse leader added to the difficulty of watching Sabathia struggle, and many of his teammates were emotional as they paid tribute to him. “To see it firsthand, the stuff he goes through to be able to pitch to help us win a World Series, it’s heartbreaking,” said reliever Zack Britton. “I know how much pain he was in, even coming in and talking to him just a second ago. He was in a lot of pain.” Added D.J. LeMahieu: “You feel for C. This year in particular he’s given everything he’s got. I know he pitched through a lot. It was tough to watch.” Aaron Judge expressed the same sentiment, almost word-for-word, before emphasizing how much Sabathia would be missed in 2020; Sabathia has been with the Yankees since 2009, after starting his career with seven-plus seasons in Cleveland and a brief stint in Milwaukee. Although Judge, 27, has already evolved into one of the faces of the team, he deferred to Sabathia, whom he called “a warrior” and “our leader.” The storybook version of Sabathia’s closing act might have seen him catalyze a Yankees comeback against Houston, not unlike the injured Willis Reed hobbling onto the court moments before Game 7 of the 1970 N.B.A. finals, spurring the Knicks to a championship over the Los Angeles Lakers. But the Yankees’ reality on Thursday was much grimmer: They left the diamond just nine innings away from elimination by Houston, hoping James Paxton could somehow match Justin Verlander in Game 5 to send the series back to Houston this weekend. But even in that scenario, another monster roadblock awaits — Gerrit Cole, who would pitch Game 7, if necessary, on full rest. The task seemed so daunting that Boone felt it necessary to address his players after their miserable performance in Game 5. He told them to “flush it” — forget everything that’d just happened — and focus solely on Verlander Friday night. Easier said than done. The Yankees committed four errors, stranded seven runners in scoring position and disappointed scores of hometown fans in the process. By the eighth inning, there were large swaths of empty seats in the stadium. Those who stayed got a chance to say goodbye to the pitcher who just might end up in Cooperstown. But it was a bittersweet farewell. Of all the ways Sabathia wanted to leave the game, surely this wasn’t one of them.",The New York Times
2019,‘I Am Fearless Again’: New Veterans’ Group Gives Women a Sense of Belonging,"At War In a hotel conference room in Arlington, Va., seated around an oval table with a large window view of the Potomac River, roughly 15 women had gathered for a training seminar to learn how to lead small networking groups of women like themselves. Coming from all over the country, these women, who ranged in age from their mid-30s to mid-50s, all shared one important characteristic: They had all served in the United States military, and now as civilians they were learning to adjust to life out of the uniform. During one session, a woman spoke up in a soft but clear voice about how difficult the years after leaving the service had been for her. She was homeless, often living in her car, and thought that her life would never get better. Even though she had since found housing, she said that until this point, talking with the other women in the room, she had not felt sisterhood and a sense of belonging since leaving the service. Tara Galovski is co-founder of Women Veterans Network (WoVeN), the group that brought these women together; this was not the first time she had heard this kind of story. In her research and clinical work as director of the Women’s Health Sciences Division of the National Center for PTSD at the Department of Veterans Affairs, she repeatedly heard from veterans how difficult it was to transition from military service to civilian life, especially for servicewomen. “There are unique challenges,” Galovski says, “like even just finding each other after service, because there are simply fewer women than men who serve.” [Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive stories about duty, conflict and consequence.] In 2017, Galovski and Amy Street, both clinical psychologists in Boston, started WoVeN as a series of weekly 90-minute meetings for groups of six to 12 women in dozens of cities around the country. Over two months, each cohort meets to discuss particular themes, like building self-esteem and improving personal relationships, in workshops led by two peer leaders. WoVeN members also have access to a national online social network of other members around the country. More than a third of women leaving the military report “loss of income” as a challenge — a higher rate than reported by their male counterparts — and they take an average of three months longer to find civilian employment, according to research by Syracuse University’s Institute for Veterans and Military Families. Transitioning servicewomen are also more likely to be single parents than their male counterparts, and they face the additional complication of finding affordable child care as they return to civilian life or try to attend medical appointments at the V.A. Veterans have also told Galovski that some civilians assume that women can’t serve in the military, and as a result, many who have worn the uniform do not self-identify as veterans after leaving the service. Making up a larger part of the military than ever before, women are 18 percent of all officers and 16 percent of enlisted service members as of July, according to Pentagon data — but still many say they feel invisible in a society that is conditioned to think primarily of soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and Coast Guard members as men. In addition to that lack of public recognition, Galovski says that many women in WoVeN report having suffered sexual trauma while in uniform; some are also dealing with symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. For those women, WoVeN also offers them a place to process these issues. “What we’ve seen over and over again is that having supportive people in your life is good for recovery,” she says. More generally, the WoVeN program helps veterans meet people in their communities. It also informs them of various services and programs designed for women that they may not have known about before, including health care, job training and entrepreneurial support. After securing initial funding two years ago from the Walmart Foundation through Boston University, WoVeN expanded from pilot programs in San Antonio, Pittsburgh and Charlotte, N.C, to 45 cities. By the end of October 2020, the group plans to be active in an additional 90 cities. For women who live in remote areas or who have mobility or transportation challenges, WoVeN will soon begin a pilot program for online group meetings through a teleconferencing service. More than 1,000 women have joined, and hundreds of them have completed the eight-week program so far, according to Galovski. Women who have completed the workshops describe WoVeN as a lifeline after years of feeling isolated or misunderstood. Tracie Rosado, who left the Army in 2003 after serving in Iraq, says she found it difficult to reconnect with old friends once she re-entered civilian life. “The girlfriends I had before I joined the military, I couldn’t relate to them anymore,” Rosado says. “I always felt like ‘Oh, I said too much,’ or ‘Oh, I’m talking about what happened over there.’ I just didn’t fit in anymore.” Rosado tried to join various veterans’ groups at V.A. centers but never found one that felt right. After searching online, she came across WoVeN and sent an email asking to join. A group was forming near her in San Antonio and needed a second peer leader before it could begin; Rosado was asked not only to join the group but to help lead it as well. The experience was transformative for her. “It was the first time since I had separated that I felt like I was someplace I was supposed to be,” Rosado says of her leadership training with WoVeN. “Everywhere else I felt like an outsider.” Nobody in the group cared about what rank she had held, how long she had served or what she did on active duty. The women were able to talk on a level on which they could all relate. “We still have this bond, and it’s something you miss when you separate,” Rosado explains. “I feel like I am fearless again. It’s something you can’t buy, and you can’t go to school to learn it. I can only get this from my sister veterans.” An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a peer leader for WoVeN in San Antonio. Her name is Tracie Rosado, not Rosario.",The New York Times
2019,‘I Don’t Need Lessons From You on Courage’: Pete Buttigieg Makes His Case,"On the Democratic debate stage Tuesday night, Mr. Buttigieg didn’t brag about his military service, but he did outflank his rivals. The last time a Democratic presidential nominee was trying to unseat a Republican incumbent, he arrived at the podium at the Democratic National Convention to tout his military service, his strongest credential: “I’m John Kerry and I’m reporting for duty.” Now, Pete Buttigieg, a former Navy intelligence officer who served in Afghanistan, is taking a notably more modulated and targeted approach as he seeks his party’s nomination, reflecting both the experiences of a post-9/11 generation of veterans and the sensibilities of a nation that largely reveres them, even as it is increasingly wary of military adventures abroad. In the Democratic debate Tuesday night, Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., did not so much brag about his military experience as leverage it to outflank his rivals in a heated exchange over President Trump’s decision to abandon the Kurds in northern Syria. He listened as Beto O’Rourke praised his military service — and later told the former Texas congressman not to lecture him on gun control, a subject he often discusses in the context of the weapons he carried in Afghanistan. “I don’t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal,” Mr. Buttigieg said. The strong showing in the Ohio debate was in no small part reliant on Mr. Buttigieg’s background as a service member and his ability to unpack questions about foreign policy and military intervention better than his opponents that night. His experience as a veteran, paired with his criticism of American conflicts over the last two decades, has the potential to appeal to a broad cross section of moderates and liberals alike. “Kerry’s generation had difficulty in separating policies from the troops,” Mr. Buttigieg said in an interview this summer, referring to the 2004 Democratic nominee and Vietnam veteran. “He was an antiwar vet and in some ways I am too. For my generation, it makes total sense that he would be against that war and serve. For his generation, you had to choose a side.” Mr. Buttigieg’s campaign seems to have these two generations — his, and Mr. Kerry’s — in mind as he tries to distinguish himself from liberal rivals like Senator Elizabeth Warren and moderates like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. His military record is just one facet of how he is drawing distinctions. At 37, roughly half the age of those other two Democrats, Mr. Buttigieg is running on a message of generational change and arguing that he would bring fresh thinking to economic problems facing middle-class and working-class people. He holds a mix of moderate and liberal views, making him harder to caricature as a leftist candidate. As a Midwesterner, he is trying to appeal to rural white Americans, voters who backed both Barack Obama and Mr. Trump for president. And he would make history as the nation’s first openly gay president. With significant financial resources due to robust fund-raising, Mr. Buttigieg has the money for advertising to highlight his biography as he seeks to become better known among voters and improve his poll numbers, which are still modest. His service as a Naval Reserve officer — he decided to join the military after a 2008 campaign trip to Iowa for Barack Obama — is one part of that biography that he is weaving into a larger political narrative concerned broadly with public service, America’s inherent inequities and the toxic bifurcation of the nation’s politics. In many ways, he is the supersized version of the Democratic veterans who prevailed in the 2018 midterm elections. They campaigned as sensible, moderate antidotes to both Republican incumbents and more liberal Democrats, unburdened by the past foreign policy mistakes of either party. Representatives Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Jason Crow of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania and Elaine Luria of Virginia — who were among the new veterans in Congress who wrote an influential op-ed in The Washington Post advocating Mr. Trump’s impeachment over Ukraine matters — all ran in part on their military history. “We shared many of the same values,” Ms. Sherrill said in an interview, “since we worked in the same types of places and environments and we served the country in similar ways.” While veterans voted disproportionately for Mr. Trump in 2016 and have generally approved of his performance more than the general population, some support from prominent Republican veterans has cracked in recent days over the Syria policy. And in the debate Tuesday night, Mr. Buttigieg hammered Mr. Trump for pulling troops out of the country and exposing America’s Kurdish allies to an attack by Turkey. “When I was deployed, I knew one of the things keeping me safe was the fact that the flag on my shoulder represented a country known to keep its word,” he said. Mr. Buttigieg’s military service has been a ballast for his candidacy, an essential addition to a biography that, in addition to training on assault weapons, includes a Harvard degree, a Rhodes scholarship, a stint at a fancy consulting firm and marriage to another man. It’s a part of his résumé he refers to often, casually but artfully dropping it into conversations on a wide range of policies, generally avoiding the battle bravado of previous veteran candidates and bristling at the suggestion that he had higher office in mind when he signed up. “I began to feel that I was part of a problem if I didn’t serve,” said Mr. Buttigieg, who has frequently recounted how during his trip to Iowa, he became acutely aware that the burdens of military service were falling too heavily on too small a slice of the population. “It’s something that I want people to know. It’s an important part of my story and how I come at the world. I also don’t want people to think I am flogging it, presenting myself as a Navy Seal or career war hero. My turn came and I did my part.” Mr. Buttigieg was accepted into the Navy Reserve’s direct commission officer program in September 2009. The program, which was developed during the Cold War to attract applicants with special expertise, draws accomplished private-sector civilians who want to serve and keep their day jobs, and fast-tracks them to officer status. “It was the most stable moment of my life to date,” said Mr. Buttigieg, who joined when he was working as a consultant for McKinsey & Company. He was elected mayor of his hometown in 2011 while still in the Reserve, and took an unpaid seven-month leave in 2014 to deploy to Afghanistan, where he served as a counterintelligence officer. “His deployment probably gave him a wake up,” said David W. Barno, a retired Army lieutenant general and former top commander in Afghanistan. “It is a unique place in society where you have a white male who works for someone African-American 10 years older than you from a very different cultural background. He talks about the leveling experience of being in the military.” It was a theme that would stick, even after Mr. Buttigieg was honorably discharged in 2017. While in Afghanistan, Mr. Buttigieg spent many days gingerly making his way through Kabul on convoy security in a heavily armed Land Cruiser. “I thought I was sent to Kabul for my experience in bureaucratic politics,” he said, “but because I was rifle qualified, it was my ability to drive a vehicle with two long guns” that got him that assignment, he said. “At the end of the day my usefulness was as a driver more than an elected officer.” Thomas Gary, a senior petty officer at Naval Station Great Lakes near Chicago, who worked with Mr. Buttigieg before he became mayor, said he kept his politics low key. “I didn’t even know he was a Democrat until he won his primary for mayor,” he said. “That wasn’t something he advertised. I do remember when he was sworn in, I wanted to make sure we from the unit showed a little love for this accomplishment.” Mr. Buttigieg spent his down time in Kabul tooling around the base’s cigar club, playing in a joint division fantasy football league and visiting Afghan orphanages. He would retreat back to his barracks late at night to make calls back to South Bend. “I wanted to be a good enough officer so even my roommate had no idea what my day job was,” Mr. Buttigieg said. Google made this wish unattainable. “When I got there, I may have had more to prove to demonstrate that I was there to get the job done,” he said. As a candidate, Mr. Buttigieg does not lead with his veteran status, but rather sprinkles it through his conversation, a hint of flavor that is meant to be noticed, and the result of careful mental spade work meant to extrapolate his experiences into his political identity. In a January television interview shortly after dipping his toe in the 2020 waters, he referred to himself as “a millennial, Episcopalian Maltese-American gay veteran mayor.” Asked if he was worried about being targeted by conservatives over his sexual orientation, he responded: “I’ve been deployed in a war zone. I am used to dealing with attacks.” Mr. Buttigieg began his military service before the Clinton-era policy of “don’t ask don’t tell” was repealed and gay men and lesbians were allowed to serve openly in the armed forces. He refers to the experience of serving without telling as informing his views on the Trump administration’s current ban on transgender service members. In a Democratic debate last month, Mr. Buttigieg said he had feared that coming out would be a “career-ending professional setback,” but that his deployment had reinforced the notion “that you only get to live one life, and I was not interested in not knowing what it was like to be in love any longer.” “A big part of being in the military is the social side,” he said in an interview. “Knowing that as we sat around talking about life off base, there was so much I had to filter with people I was learning to trust in some deep ways. There were times I wish I could have kicked back and talked about my personal life in a fuller way.” “That, I think, creates a level of stress that service people don’t need,” he added. Some of his policy positions stem directly from his time in the military. His national service plan, for example, would expand voluntary public service programs like AmeriCorps and the Peace Corps, and add new ones focused on combating climate change, addressing mental health and addiction, and providing caregiving for older people, especially in low-income communities. He makes clear connections between his time in Afghanistan and his views on American policy in the Middle East, which include support for pulling troops out of Afghanistan but criticism of Mr. Trump’s desire to withdraw from Syria. His service background “lets us get out of this framework that one party is focused on national security,” Mr. Buttigieg said. “I think even progressive Democrats are excited about the idea of people who have served.” At the same time, Mr. Buttigieg is well attuned to potential criticism that his service was not steeped enough in conflict. “He spent at least 100 trips outside the wire,” said General Barno. “He was not a guy who sat behind a computer. He was out of the vehicle. He took some pretty interesting lessons from that. You can say he was not in direct combat, but he was out there where 99 percent of Americans weren’t.” An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the timing of the repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell."" It was repealed after Pete Buttigieg began his military service, not after he was discharged.",The New York Times
2019,‘I Gave the Other Guy a Shot’,"After taking a chance on Donald Trump in 2016, a swing county in western Pennsylvania is up for grabs again. ERIE, Pa. — Mark Graham, a real estate appraiser in this faded manufacturing hub, sat with friends at a gym named FitnessU on the morning after the Democratic debate in mid-September. He had voted for Barack Obama, but in 2016 he took a gamble on Donald Trump. Although he called the president’s conduct in office “a joke,” he was unwilling to commit to voting Democratic in 2020, unconvinced by the 10 party hopefuls the night before. Jump ahead to October and Democrats in Congress are investigating evidence of President Trump’s possible abuse of power. Mr. Graham has had an electoral conversion. “Things have changed in the last couple weeks: More stupidity has come out,’’ Mr. Graham, 69, said in a telephone interview last week. He hopes Democrats nominate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., but he is not particular. “I’d vote for the Democratic nominee no matter who it is at this point,” he said. “If Mr. Trump gets into another four years, where he’s a lame duck, it’s going to be like adding gasoline to the fire.” [How did ‘never Trump’ Republicans become some of the president’s strongest defenders?] Heading into 2020, there is intense focus among campaign strategists on the weakest element of the Trump coalition: the millions of voters who disapproved of both major candidates in 2016 but took a chance on Mr. Trump. Whether an impeachment inquiry moves Obama-Trump voters like Mr. Graham off the fence, one way or the other, is a major narrative arc in the 2020 script that is rapidly unfolding and updating. Erie County in western Pennsylvania holds a wealth of these conflicted voters. That much was clear in interviews conducted in the days after the 2016 election, and it’s clear now. Mr. Trump won an upset national victory by carrying places just like Erie County, long a blue-collar Democratic stronghold; he won here thanks to a 17-point swing from Mr. Obama’s margin of victory in 2012. The area’s flip from blue to red was a microcosm of how Mr. Trump pulled off narrow victories in this state as well as in Michigan and Wisconsin. In interviews in Erie last month, before the impeachment inquiry began, many of the Trump voters from 2016 were either supportive of the president or unpersuaded by the Democratic alternatives. But reached by phone after the inquiry was announced, some of these voters had changed their minds. Outright conversions like Mr. Graham’s, while still rare, were reflected in an uptick of support for impeachment by independent voters in recent national polls. “I don’t know which way the impeachment issue is going to cause public opinion to move,” said Joseph Morris, a political scientist at Mercyhurst University in Erie, who was polling local voters when news of the impeachment inquiry broke. “Undoubtedly a majority of voters that voted for Trump will vote for him again in 2020,” Mr. Morris said. “But I think the jury is still out when it comes to those independents or any Democrats who chose to vote for Trump in 2016.” Two strong predictors of a president’s re-election odds — support for his handling of the economy and voters’ overall approval — are pulling in opposite directions in Mr. Morris’s latest survey of Erie County, which suggests a close election in this battleground county in a battleground state. Approval of Mr. Trump overall is dismal at 38 percent, but 52 percent approve of the way he’s handling the economy. [Keep up with the 2020 field with our candidate tracker.] Obama-Trump voters like Mr. Graham totaled some 6.7 million people in 2016, according to the results of the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, a large survey conducted before and after elections. Of the nearly one in five voters who disapproved of both major 2016 candidates, Mr. Trump won by a 17-point margin. Another large study of nearly 7,000 voters in January 2019 found that Obama-Trump voters were the only slice of the electorate whose approval of Mr. Trump has significantly eroded. “Even small movement among these voters — who represented 5 percent of voters in 2016 — may prove significant heading into the 2020 presidential election,” wrote one of the election scholars behind the study. Mark Miller, the third-generation owner of Miller Brothers’ lawn and garden supply store in Erie, is a longtime Republican who cast a grudging vote for Mr. Trump. We met last month for breakfast at Dominick’s, the same 24-hour restaurant downtown where I interviewed him in 2016. Mr. Miller said at the time the likelihood he would vote Democratic in 2020 was “50-50.” And he was still “50-50” when we spoke this month. Among the Democratic candidates he could potentially support, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey impressed him as a happy warrior on the campaign trail. He liked Mr. Biden because he was not promising the moon. “I gave the other guy a shot,” Mr. Miller said of the president. “I don’t like the way he talks to people. I don’t like what he’s doing internally with the cabinet. I don’t think anybody feels comfortable that we have anything cohesive at the top right now.” A small-business owner with about 20 employees, Mr. Miller, 55, calls himself “a really conservative family guy,” who sent four children to Catholic schools. He was not ready in September to say he would vote Democratic, and the impeachment inquiry has not changed his mind. “Talking to people coming through the doors daily, there’s information overload and they’re not sure what to believe,” he said last week, speaking from his store after closing hours. He said it was wrong for the president to ask a foreign country, Ukraine, to investigate a political rival, Mr. Biden. But he added, “I don’t know if that’s egregious enough to warrant full impeachment.” He continued, “I’d like to see everybody get back to work on the business of the country.” Lyne Daniels, a 52-year-old Obama-Trump voter in Erie, said congressional Democrats should be working with the president on issues like health care and immigration. “All they’re doing is, Get Trump, Get Trump, Get Trump,” she said of the impeachment inquiry. Ms. Daniels, who works both as a municipal secretary and for a clothing store, knows exactly who she’ll vote for in 2020: Mr. Trump. She said the president had fulfilled his promises to put “America First” by avoiding foreign wars and ending decades of what she called open borders. [Trump’s unfounded allegations about Biden and his son have been the biggest campaign challenge to the former vice president yet.] Ms. Daniels said she voted for Mr. Obama twice because he faced Republicans she disliked and regarded as members of the establishment. She called Senator John McCain, the 2008 nominee, “a traitor to this country,” adding, “I’ve done my own research.” Even fans of Mr. Trump often say they wish he would lay off Twitter. Not Ms. Daniels, who called it a “brilliant” diversionary tactic. “He plays you, the press, like a fiddle, and you fall for it every time,” she said. “He gets everybody talking and it sucks up airtime for days. Meanwhile over in the corner, we’re working on this thing nobody knows about.” Asked about Mr. Trump’s thousands of documented falsehoods in office, Ms. Daniels pushed back. “Based on whose sources?” she demanded. “Just because the news tells me that his claims are false is a little hypocritical because we had to listen about Russia, Russia, Russia for two years, and they were wrong. Who are they to say what’s coming out of his mouth is wrong?” In the 2018 midterms, Democrats did well in the three Pennsylvania counties that Mr. Trump had flipped: Erie, Luzerne and Northampton. Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, carried all three. Ron DiNicola, a Democrat running for Congress, won Erie County by 20 points, though he lost the race because rural counties in the district voted Republican. “I feel like our country has been more divided than ever,’’ said Stephanie Johnson, 38, a substitute teacher and registered Libertarian in Erie County. “I see it just being a mom, being out and about, at the grocery store, after school. I feel like people are so angry nowadays.” Ms. Johnson worries that a decline in attendance at her family’s church is related to the divisiveness of America under Mr. Trump, whom she has no interest in voting for in 2020. “I feel like there are a lot of people who aren’t putting their full trust and faith in God, and are sort of scared and angry about what’s going on in the world,” she said. A president with no self-restraint on how he speaks about others has spread coarseness, Ms. Johnson said. “Like, it’s just gotten to the point where nobody has any compassion for each other.” Still, Ryan Bizzarro, a Democratic state representative from Erie County, said, “If this economy holds on,” Mr. Trump “is going to be tough to beat.” Republicans “have been able to hijack our narrative because we’re so focused on a lot of the social issues — which are important, but people are voting again with their wallets,” Mr. Bizzarro said last month. Once a city reliant on heavy industry, Erie is moving past the stereotype of Rust Belt decrepitude. Its largest employer was once a General Electric plant making locomotives but is now Erie Insurance. Lost manufacturing jobs are being replaced by start-ups making computer and electronic parts. Mr. Bizzarro, 33, was skeptical that Mr. Biden would end up as the nominee. If Democrats nominate one of his two closest current rivals, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts or Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mr. Bizzarro sounded leery of their ability to carry Erie County without a surge of voters from his own generation. Millennials, whose turnout continues to lag older voters, “damn well better show up for the election,” he said. An earlier version of article misstated the year that Senator John McCain was the Republican presidential nominee. It was 2008, not 2012.",The New York Times
2019,‘I Have to Get That’: How Henry Chalfant Became a Graffiti Ambassador,"The artist’s photographs, a major act of urban historical preservation, are on view at the Bronx Museum of the Arts. When Henry Chalfant arrived in New York City from suburban Pittsburgh in 1973, as an aspiring sculptor, he found a place teetering on the verge of bankruptcy. This was “Ford to City: Drop Dead” New York. But amid the turmoil a new form of art making was taking shape — one that took up space where it could, which was mostly everywhere. As a typographical language, graffiti was still raw, a new kind of American expressionism rooted in the volatility of street life, largely done by kids living on the city’s margins. The urgent scrawls of names, crowding one another for visual dominance, was a form of branding as self-determination. Within a few years, styles became increasingly baroque, entire flanks of subway cars sheathed in florid top-down murals, hurtling the city’s overlooked periphery into its pulsing center. Mr. Chalfant, now 79, credits one such piece, a Lee Quiñones burner from 1977, for permanently shifting his attention. “I came up to the Bronx, and I saw two cars painted by Lee and the Fabulous Five crew,” Mr. Chalfant said in a recent interview. “And I thought, Oh my god, I have to get that.” And he did, though it took 10 pictures. “From there I knew I was going to see this out,” he added. “I found the contrast between what I was doing as a solitary studio artist and what I clearly needed in my life, which was more engagement in the world, and this is how I found it.” For the next seven years, Mr. Chalfant photographed the trains. And by the time he stopped shooting, around 1984, he had amassed a body of work considered to be the definitive document of graffiti culture in New York. Now those photographs are the subject of the exhibition “Henry Chalfant: Art vs. Transit, 1977-1987,” at the Bronx Museum of the Arts. His train panoramas, some blown up to train car-size, have been assembled here alongside his street photography of park jams and wall works, and a collection of archives and black books that recreate his SoHo studio. It’s an apt homecoming for Mr. Chalfant’s first United States retrospective — the site of much of New York graffiti’s innovation, where many graffiti artists lived and where the bulk of Mr. Chalfant’s imagery was produced. The show’s title, “Art vs. Transit,” is a reference to the open hostility of the city’s officials toward what they deemed to be vandalism as well as the sometimes combative stance graffiti writers took among themselves. Graffiti’s parameters developed with serious stakes, a kind of one-upmanship expressed through art. It was also the original title, Mr. Chalfant said, of his influential 1984 photography book, “Subway Art,” which he published with Martha Cooper, who was also documenting the early stages of hip-hop culture from street level. Up to that point, galleries had expressed only a trickling interest in graffiti art — even less in the photography of it. “It was hard for us to get the book published,” Mr. Chalfant recalled at the museum recently. “We both tried separately and competed, and failed, and tried together and failed. We went to all these publishers and none were interested. They said, ‘Well, there’s been one,’ referring to the one in 1974 [“The Faith of Graffiti”] that Norman Mailer wrote the introduction to. So we went to Europe and right away Thames & Hudson said this is wonderful.” As an art form, graffiti was, and in many ways remains, better received in Europe. Mr. Quiñones had his first gallery exhibition, in 1979, in Rome. “Subway Art,” along with the 1984 PBS documentary “Style Wars,” which Mr. Chalfant produced with Tony Silver, is credited with propelling graffiti’s global reach. It’s not uncommon, in Barcelona or Berlin or Copenhagen, to see trains adorned with freshly painted pieces. The Bronx show was first exhibited in 2018 in Madrid, conceived by the Spanish graffiti artist SUSO33, who has called Mr. Chalfant “the most important ambassador of graffiti culture in the world.” During its run, over a thousand people visited it every day. “I think Europe has always been receptive to American popular culture in general, and to American art forms very enthusiastically,” Mr. Chalfant said. “African-American writers and artists went there and discovered the racial atmosphere was different, and they felt more comfortable. I know a number of Americans who followed in their footsteps: Sharp, Jon One, Core. Europeans in general consider art a profession like any other, where Americans still have a kind of romantic idea about it.” To make his pictures, Mr. Chalfant would find a perch on the outdoor subway platforms that afforded him the best light, usually Intervale Avenue and East Tremont on the 2 and 5 lines. He would shoot the painted cars as they shuttled past, taking multiple exposures in rapid succession and later collaging them to create perfect panoramic records. He approached his subject anthropologically, stalking the uptown platforms in the mornings and the downtown side in the afternoons, sometimes waiting hours for a particular train to loop around. Mr. Chalfant’s photography froze the trains in place, but not the kinetic energy of the art. By isolating each work, he confirmed its individualism. Graffiti writers appreciated this, and Mr. Chalfant befriended many of them, eventually. He may have felt “alienated from my own privileged, white life in a country club community outside Pittsburgh,” Mr. Chalfant said, but he was still viewed as an outsider by the mostly black and Latin graffiti artists in the Bronx. “We didn’t really know what to make of him, if he was a police officer or why anyone else would be interested in documenting the work we were doing,” said Chris Ellis, the graffiti artist who works as Daze. He was 17 when he met Mr. Chalfant in 1979. “He invited us to his studio and he had these portfolios of photos. It was really incredible for us to see, in 35 millimeter format, our work.” Soon, writers began to call Mr. Chalfant the night they finished a piece so he would know where to look come morning. He has since endeared himself to residents of the Bronx, and has devoted his professional career to telling their stories. “When I was shooting in the Bronx I spent a lot of time just hanging out in the stations, and you could hear the sound of the street and smell the aroma of coffee and cuchifritos coming up. I felt comfortable here.” Outside of their artfulness, Mr. Chalfant’s pictures stand as a major act of urban historical preservation. Graffiti, which was ephemeral to begin with, liable to be whitewashed, buffed, or defaced, was mostly obliterated by the mid-1980s. The city has changed considerably in the intervening years. Graffiti persists on the odd box truck and pull-down gate, but has otherwise completely vanished from the subway. Graffiti’s outlaw tint has also dissipated, its day colored by nostalgia and its stylistic cues long since co-opted by advertising. The influential works of the ’70s and ’80s — the genesis of a wholly original American art form — largely survive now only in Mr. Chalfant’s archives. “His body of work is indispensable,” Mr. Ellis said. “He’s enabled future generations to be able to experience this work. If it wasn’t for Henry, it would only exist in memories.” Henry Chalfant: Art vs. Transit, 1977-1987 Through March 8 at the Bronx Museum of the Arts, 1040 Grand Concourse; 718-681-6000, bronxmuseum.org.",The New York Times
2019,‘I Know the Struggle’: Why a Pizza Mogul Left Pies at Memorials to 4 Homeless Men,"Hakki Akdeniz built a pizza chain and has 3.5 million followers on Instagram. But he was once homeless, and returned to the streets this week. Candles, flowers and handwritten tributes flow onto the sidewalk like surf filling a void in the sand, replacing the body just taken away. Memorials in Chinatown this week marked the spots where four homeless men were killed on Saturday, their heads smashed while they slept by an attacker wielding a metal bar. But something else was left at the sites. Fresh boxes of hot pizza were stacked at each memorial. And with them, a note. “I wish with all my heart,” it read, “that I could have been there at that very moment to protect all of you guys.” The author added, “you know me as the pizza guy.” Then he revealed something from his own past: “As a former homeless man, I know the struggle that all of you guys went through every day.” The pizzas and notes came from Hakki Akdeniz, a 39-year-old immigrant who has built a small chain of pizza shops in the city and, with it, something of an unofficial, but solid, support network for the homeless in Manhattan. His visits to the memorials this week, each time lugging a stack of pizzas that reached his chin, follow a remarkable journey even in a city built on rags-to-riches tales. Mr. Akdeniz is Kurdish, was raised in Turkey and emigrated to Canada as a young man. Back in Turkey, he had worked in cafes making lahmacun, flattened dough topped with spiced meat, and he aspired to make its Western cousin, pizza, in the United States. He arrived by bus in New York in 2001 with $240 in his pocket and a promise of a bed at a friend’s apartment. When the friend changed his mind, Mr. Akdeniz moved into a dingy motel on 42nd Street and watched his meager savings dribble away at $30 a night. Broke, he spent a few nights huddled with his bags in Grand Central Terminal. Someone pointed him to the Bowery Mission, one of the city’s most well-known homeless shelters, in the heart of the city’s skid row. “I stayed there for 96 nights,” Mr. Akdeniz said. He busied himself in the kitchen, chopping onions and washing dishes, and he looked for work making pizza. His English was poor. He noticed a woman at the mission reading a Turkish language newspaper, and she helped him find a listing for a job at a Mediterranean pizza shop in Hoboken, N.J., near the PATH station. He showed up in New Jersey in unwashed clothes. The owner was skeptical. “He thought I was so dirty, unclean,” recalled Mr. Akdeniz. Desperate, he asked, “Can I make a pizza?” “I was shaking, so nervous,” he said. “It came out no good. I said, ‘Can I make another one?’” After a few failed attempts, the owner hired him — to wash dishes. That night Mr. Akdeniz slept on a bench across from the restaurant, returning early the next day. The next night, he slept in the basement of the pizza shop’s building. Later that week, the cook gave him a tip. There was a building in Sunnyside, Queens, where the super had an assistant who did odd jobs and lived rent-free in the basement. The assistant was looking for an assistant — same perks. “The boiler room, you can sleep in the corner,” Mr. Akdeniz was told. A year later, he had saved enough to move into an apartment with a roommate. He got a new job in early 2003 washing dishes at a restaurant on Ninth Avenue in Hell’s Kitchen. On St. Patrick’s Day, the regular pizza maker didn’t show up to work, and Mr. Akdeniz was promoted on the spot. He spent five years there, improving his skills. In 2009, he found a tiny pizza shop in the Lower East Side that was for sale. He had saved up $40,000 by then, and the shop — just an oven with a counter in front of it — cost twice that, but the owner agreed to sell, setting up monthly payments. Mr. Akdeniz immediately fell behind in his first month, then his second and third. The man he owed told him, “Pay me, or I’ll put you in the oven.” Little did the man know that, to save money, Mr. Akdeniz was already sleeping under that oven, locked inside the shop every night until another worker opened a padlocked gate the next day. Then, a breakthrough. Mr. Akdeniz entered a pizza-making contest in 2010 at the Javits Center. To stand out, he threw and spun his pizza dough after setting it on fire. He won first place. He was featured in a cover article in PMQ Pizza Magazine, which gave him thousands of copies that he handed out outside schools in the neighborhood near his shop. The teenagers laughed and called him “Champ,” but they bought slices, too. “It became just busy — busy, busy, busy,” he said. He paid off the shop. He heard of another one for sale nearby, on Rivington Street, and he made an offer that was accepted. Now with two places, he figured he needed a brand name, and he thought of the nickname the teenagers had given him. He named his two shops Champion Pizza. He bought a third place, then a fourth. He improved his ingredients, making his dough extra light and importing organic sauce from Naples. He bought a fifth place, then a sixth, stretching out to Soho, Union Square and Columbus Circle. His seventh, which opened last year, is near the building in Queens and his old corner in the basement. Along the way, he became something of a pizza celebrity, known for his flashy acrobatics in tossing and twirling dough, flaming or otherwise, and for building giant pizzas. He has won international pizza making competitions, and his Instagram account has 3.5 million followers. While building this small pizza empire, Mr. Akdeniz never forgot his time among the homeless. He passed out free slices to street people who came around asking. Eventually he started a weekly food and clothing handout on a stretch of sidewalk on West 34th Street. His outreach extended beyond pizza. He found a nearby barbershop that agreed to cut homeless men’s hair, and a gymnasium that was willing to let them use its showers. He paid both for their services. He also regularly distributed pizzas to the homeless in Chinatown and the Lower East Side, becoming known among them as the “pizza guy.” Last weekend, he was having a meal with friends when he learned that four men had been bludgeoned to death in Chinatown and that the police believed the killer was another homeless man. Deeply shaken, he had to excuse himself. “How could you?” he asked in the interview. He pointed to a man sleeping on the sidewalk nearby. “That guy over there, how could you kill him?” On Wednesday, Mr. Akdeniz and one of his employees carried 16 small boxes of pizza to a waiting Uber, and placed them in the trunk, before making the short journey to 2 Bowery, where one of the victims was killed. He placed several boxes on the ground next to a row of candles, removing the empty ones from his previous visits. A passing man pushing a shopping cart stopped, and Mr. Akdeniz handed him a pizza box. In large letters, its cover read “Champion Pizza,” and below, in smaller print, “Made in New York With Love.”",The New York Times
2019,‘I Sat and Sketched Matisse’s Sculpture of a Woman Named Jeannette’,"METROPOLITAN DIARY Skipping school to go to Manhattan, help with untied laces and more reader tales of New York City in this week’s Metropolitan Diary. Dear Diary: Fifty-one years ago, I cut my high school classes and took the commuter train from Peekskill to Manhattan by myself for the first time. I was wearing my favorite mini-dress and floppy hat, and I had a large tasseled leather bag and a sketchbook. I went to the Museum of Modern Art, where I sat and sketched Matisse’s sculpture of a woman named Jeannette. I felt uneasy and confident at the same time. From there, I headed to Greenwich Village. I walked around Washington Square Park listening to the guitar players on the sidewalks. I was entranced by the flower children wading in the fountain. I wandered past head shops that smelled of patchouli and sandalwood. I bought a handmade silver ring with a narrow green stone for my index finger. I moved away from New York not long after that, but my son lives in Brooklyn now. When I visited him last year, I asked him to take me to Washington Square Park. And I gave him the silver ring I bought back then. — Kerry Workman Dear Diary: As I walked home on Seventh Avenue one morning, my pink sneaker laces became untied. Having a bad back and an injured foot, I was unable to retie them. A young man wearing earbuds and a hoodie came up beside me. “Your laces are untied, he said. “I know,“ I answered. “I can’t bend to retie them. Bad back.” He took a knee and proceeded to tie my laces into a neat bow. “Oh, my,” I said. “You are so kind.” “Just didn’t want you to fall,” he said before going on his way. — Linda Tsakonas Dear Diary: I was in Greenpoint walking to the G train from my guitar lesson. I had my ax slung over my back in a gig bag. I passed a group of burly construction workers in dust masks. They were going into a hardware store. The biggest, burliest one in the group pulled down his mask. “Whaddya got?” he bellowed. “Sorry?” I said “Whaddya got?” “Oh, Epiphone electric, hollow body archtop” “Six?” “Yeah.” “You in a band?” “Hah, no such luck.” “It’ll happen!” And with that, he disappeared into the store with his co-workers. — Steve Stankiewicz Dear Diary: Scrumptious, lovely, dreamed of,Boiled, fried or steamed, love,Those tender, little pockets made of dough.New York noshers chew ’em,And you mustn’t misconstrue ’em,Since a dumpling’s like a person, did you know — Everybody’s a dumpling,Doodle-ee-oop-boop-boop.Everybody’s a dumpling,In luck or in the soup.

One day, as I stood in the long line, I noticed a large brown dog on the sidewalk. He seemed to be alone. He was staring up the street. Then, I saw him walk off in the direction he had been looking. I worried about him, all alone on the street. I got the baker’s attention. “There was a big brown dog outside on the sidewalk,” I said. “He seemed to be alone, and now he’s walked off up the street.” “Oh, don’t worry,” the baker said. “That’s our dog and he knows the neighborhood well. He has walked off to meet my brother who went on an errand up the street. The dog’s going to meet him.” I was relieved, bought my baguettes and was about to leave when a man standing behind me spoke to me quietly. “That was a very kind thing you did,” he said. For some reason, I was stunned by the unexpected compliment. I walked out the door, unable to speak. I fumbled for my sunglasses to cover up the tears running down my cheeks. I have no idea why I cried. Thirty years later, I still don’t know why. — Carole Wendt Read all recent entries and our submissions guidelines.

2019,"‘In My Room’ Review: Alone Again, Unnaturally","Critic’s Pick A mass extinction forces a miserable man to dramatically reshape his life in Ulrich Köhler’s uncommonly subtle character study. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “In My Room” is a movie about emptiness, yet it clamors with ideas. In a series of tight, perfectly composed opening scenes, the German filmmaker Ulrich Köhler introduces us to the misery of Armin (Hans Löw), an inept news cameraman in Berlin. Armin’s unloved apartment, unenthusiastic hookup style and seemingly unwanted career paint a life exhausted before it’s halfway through. Pressing that bruise, a visit back home to his dying grandmother and unhappy father prompts a botched suicide attempt. For Armin, the only direction is up. Then, overnight, humans disappear, and this unsettling survival story finds its groove. As does Armin: Instead of freaking out, he embraces his depopulated world, making a home outside his childhood village and gathering livestock. Time leaps forward between scenes, marked only by Armin’s tightening physique and increasing self-sufficiency as he harnesses hydroelectric power and tills his soil. For perhaps the first time, he seems content. Envisioning an uncannily serene apocalypse, “In My Room” studies a man who finds liberation in isolation, the absence of others freeing him from expectation and obligation. Presenting him, and us, with a blank canvas of possibility, Köhler suggests we might transform from passive receptacles to active agents of our fate, but wonders if we remain bound to our basic nature. Armin, originally a man going nowhere, now has the whole world to play in, yet chooses to stay exactly where he is. This stasis gains prominence with the arrival of Kirsi (Elena Radonicich) — an independent, adventurous Eve to Armin’s Adam. Kirsi would much rather explore than shelter in place. As the two settle into a gently abrasive relationship, “In My Room” adamantly refuses to swerve into romance or clearly establish the couple’s feelings. Instead, Köhler cleverly illuminates the disjunction between them. As Kirsi weeps quietly over a laptop playing Clint Eastwood’s soggy 1995 opus, “The Bridges of Madison County,” we see that for her, some emotions must be recalled and replayed, or the ability to express them be lost forever. But when we watch Armin dancing ecstatically in a van’s headlamps, it’s clear that nothing in his memory can match the happiness of the here-and-now. “I love this world,” he tells her, as Jochen Dehn and Silke Fischer’s richly melancholic production design shows rusting vehicles and modernity itself gradually returning to nature. Abetted by Patrick Orth’s careful, almost obsessively calm camerawork, Köhler has concocted an uncommonly subtle and deliberately ambiguous work, one that’s delicately rewarding, if you meet it halfway. By withholding any explanation for the mass disappearance, he forces us to grapple with far weightier issues. After all, when everyone but you is gone, does it really matter why?

2019,"‘In the Tall Grass’ Review: In the Heartland, a Field of Screams","Streaming Movie Review Based on a novella by Stephen King and Joe Hill, this Netflix adaptation turns rural Kansas into an inescapable nightmare. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Originally published in two parts in Esquire, the novella “In the Tall Grass,” by Stephen King and his son Joe Hill, turns the uniform expanse of rural Kansas into a field that stretches to the horizon in every direction. The field itself has a malevolent presence, like the sentient vines in Scott Smith’s novel “The Ruins,” but just the idea of getting trapped in a sea of green, with the sticky heat and the buzzing flies and the six-foot-tall cuts of grass, is suffocating enough for a short-form shocker. King and Hill sustain the premise for Part 1 before surrendering to abstraction. In the Netflix adaptation, written and directed by Vincenzo Natali, that part lasts only 12 minutes of 102. The rest is a fevered mishmash of spiritual and supernatural nonsense that feels like a trap of another kind, a metaphysical zone defined by arbitrary laws and by characters who are constantly screaming each other’s names. Natali wastes no time parking Cal (Avery Whitted) and his pregnant sister, Becky (Laysla De Oliveira), outside a field in Kansas, where they respond to the cries of a little boy who is lost in the grass. He seems close to the road, but the farther the siblings walk into the green, the farther they seem to get from him — and from each other. As the situation grows more desperate, other figures emerge from the cut, including the boy’s father, played by Patrick Wilson, who tries a clear a pathway by devouring all the scenery he can. Natali whips up an atmospheric frenzy in kind, but every new addition is a subtraction. Two characters condemned to an eternal game of “Marco Polo” is scary enough on its own.

2019,‘It’s Hard’: Prince Harry and Meghan Speak of Strain of Royal Life in New Documentary,"During a recent trip to Africa, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex offered a candid look into the struggles of dealing with the tabloid spotlight. LONDON — Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, have spoken of their struggle in coping with the spotlight and offered an unusually intimate look inside the British royal family in a series of interviews for a new documentary. In the interviews, Prince Harry addressed questions about a rift with his brother and spoke about how the death of their mother made him protective of his wife and son, while Meghan acknowledged her difficulty in dealing with the intense scrutiny. “It’s hard,” Meghan said in one interview with the British broadcaster ITV for the documentary, which was filmed during the couple’s recent tour of Africa. “I don’t think anybody can understand.” The candid interviews come just weeks after the couple started to hit back against the British tabloid press, filing a series of lawsuits against journalists’ invasive tactics. On Oct. 1, Prince Harry issued a rare statement in which he denounced “relentless propaganda” and described a “ruthless campaign” against Meghan by certain news outlets. The pair, who married last May and whose first son, Archie, was born this year, have found themselves under constant scrutiny from a relentless British tabloid press. Meghan in particular — a mixed race, divorced American actress — has often been the focus. But in recent weeks, the couple seem to have decided to combat that narrative, and the documentary is the latest part of their effort to push back. “I never thought that this would be easy, but I thought it would be fair, and that’s the part that’s really hard to reconcile,” Meghan said. She described being warned by British friends that “the British tabloids will destroy your life” when she first met Prince Harry, but she said she had not expected the true extent of the pressure. “I didn’t get it,” she said. “So it's, yeah, it’s been complicated.” Prince Harry also addressed the relationship with his brother, Prince William. For months, the British tabloids have splashed tales of a deep divide between the two — and their wives — across the front pages. Prince Harry, in an especially frank moment, seemed to acknowledge that there were occasional disagreements, but he maintained that their relationship had a strong foundation that would outlast any temporary tensions. “Inevitably stuff happens, but we’re brothers, we will always be brothers,” he said. “We are certainly on different paths at the moment, but I will always be there for him and I know he will always be there for me.” “We don’t see each other as much as we used to because we’re so busy, but I love him dearly,” he added. The documentary about the duke and duchess aired on Sunday night in Britain and further revealed the couple’s willingness to share their emotions in a bid for a greater understanding of the pressures of their position. They are especially known to desire more respect for their privacy, particularly after the birth of Archie. Meghan recently filed a lawsuit against The Mail on Sunday, and while an accompanying statement explaining the action did not identify which article had prompted the move, the tabloid published a story in February that included a letter Meghan had sent to her estranged father, Thomas Markle. Prince Harry also began separate legal proceedings this month against the owners of two other tabloids, The Sun and The Daily Mirror, accusing them of hacking his phone’s voice mail messages going back as far as the early 2000s. During another interview for the documentary, Prince Harry explained how the death of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, shaped the way he felt about the news media and made him determined to make things easier on his wife and son. Diana was followed by paparazzi relentlessly for years and was killed in a car crash in Paris in 1997 as her driver sped from photographers. “For me, and for my wife of course, there is a lot of stuff that hurts, of course when a majority of it is untrue,” Harry said. “I will not be bullied into playing a game that killed my mum.” Reaction to the interviews was swift, particularly from the tabloids that the couple denounced in the documentary. News outlets, including those that the royals have taken to court, reported on the interviews, analyzing the body language of the pair and splashing photographs and videos across their web pages on Monday morning. The Daily Mail said readers had expressed an “overwhelmingly negative response.” But comments on social media suggested a good deal of sympathy. Many seemed to empathize with the couple and were especially touched by Meghan’s description of a need to “not just survive” but to thrive and feel happy after initial attempts to try to “adopt this British sensibility of a stiff upper lip.” The duchess explained that, “I’ve tried, I’ve really tried, but I think that what that does internally is probably really damaging.” Emma Kenny, a TV personality in Britain, welcomed Meghan’s openness in a post on Twitter. “She had NO IDEA what she would face and the criticism she would endure,” Ms. Kenny wrote. “That’s not acting, that’s absolute transparency! Bless her, bless Harry!!” Twitter users also backed Harry’s refusal to bow to the tabloids’ tactics. One of the most poignant moments in the documentary came when Meghan was asked how she was dealing with the newfound scrutiny. She detailed feeling “vulnerable” during her pregnancy and in the months since giving birth. “Thank you for asking because not many people have asked if I’m O.K.,” she said, her voice thick with emotion. “But it’s a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.” The reporter, Tom Bradby, continued: “And the answer is, would it be fair to say, not really O.K.? That it’s really been a struggle?” Meghan replied: “Yes.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘It’s the Only Way to Get Paid’: A Struggle for Citgo, Venezuela’s U.S. Oil Company","HOUSTON — Citgo has long been a mainstay of the American oil industry, with three major refineries, 4,500 gasoline stations and an iconic sign looming over Fenway Park’s left field wall. Now, the company could be splintered into pieces, a casualty of the turmoil in Venezuela. As the American subsidiary of the Venezuelan national oil company, Citgo is the object of international political scheming, legal maneuvering and financial gamesmanship. Unless Venezuela’s national oil company makes a $913 million payment on its 2020 bonds that is due Oct. 28, creditors and other businesses that have claims against Venezuela’s socialist government could try to seize Citgo. “Everyone wants the Citgo assets because it’s the only way to get paid,” said Francisco Monaldi, a fellow in Latin American energy policy at Rice University. The situation has pitted various groups against one another and set off a flurry of negotiations. Bondholders want assurance that they will be repaid. Citgo and Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader whom the United States, the European Union and other governments consider Venezuela’s legitimate head of state, want to avert a breakup of the company, and they are urging the Trump administration to act on their behalf. Several Republican lawmakers are pressing President Trump to prevent a splitting up of Citgo, which they argue could pose a security threat to the United States. The lawmakers assert that Rosneft, an oil giant controlled by the Russian government, could pick up some of the pieces because Citgo shares are collateral for a Russian loan to Venezuela — an outcome that experts say is unlikely. Valued at around $10 billion, Citgo is by far Venezuela’s most valuable overseas asset. More than that, it has long been the gateway for the South American country’s heavy oil into the United States, its most important market by far. With an economy in tatters and an estimated $150 billion in debts, Venezuela desperately needs Citgo. But for the moment Citgo is a pawn in a struggle between the Trump administration and the government of President Nicolás Maduro, and its principal allies, Cuba and Russia. American sanctions against the Maduro government have blocked fuel shipments between Citgo and Venezuela since January. And the company is now controlled by a board appointed by Mr. Guaidó, the National Assembly leader, who declared himself interim president on the grounds that Mr. Maduro had won a 2018 presidential election through fraud. Since the Guaidó-appointed board took control, Citgo has replaced its crude imports from Venezuela with oil from other Latin American countries and Africa. Mr. Maduro has asserted that American sanctions are designed to steal Citgo from Venezuela and that Mr. Guaidó is a puppet of the Trump administration. Struggling to pay for imported food and medicine, Mr. Maduro’s government has stopped making payments on most of its debts. Trying to protect Citgo from dismemberment, the board appointed by Mr. Guaidó has already made one small payment on the debts of the national oil company, best known by its acronym, PDVSA. “What Citgo is needed for is to support the recovery of Venezuela once PDVSA is under the full control of Guaidó,” said Lisa Viscidi, a specialist on Latin American energy issues at the Inter-American Dialogue, a think tank in Washington. But Mr. Guaidó’s position has weakened in recent months after he made several unsuccessful attempts to push Mr. Maduro out of power with mass demonstrations and calls on the military to remove him. Mr. Guaidó does not control the country’s cash flow from its oil sales and therefore does not have the money to make the Oct. 28 payment. He, Citgo executives and several prominent members of Congress have lobbied the Trump administration to prevent a breakup of the company, which would be another blow to Mr. Guaidó and his claim to be the lawful president of Venezuela. President Trump could reverse a narrow sanctions exemption issued by the Treasury Department that gave investors who own PDVSA’s 2020 bonds an exception from rules that prohibit United States businesses from conducting financial transactions involving Venezuelan assets. The exemption was put in place last year to prevent Mr. Maduro from citing American sanctions as a reason not to pay bondholders. But now the exemption, which gives bondholders the right to acquire Citgo shares as payment, would end up hurting Mr. Guaidó, not Mr. Maduro. Citgo is a profitable company and can pay the interest due on its own debt, but it would struggle to shoulder PDVSA’s debt. Members of a committee of Venezuela bondholders, led by Greylock Capital Management and T. Rowe Price, have proposed to the administration and Mr. Guaidó that they allow the creditors to lend more money to forestall a default. The investors have not defined the form of that loan, but it presumably would add to PDVSA’s debts. “No one wants to see them unnecessarily default,” said Ajata Mediratta, Greylock’s managing partner, president and portfolio manager. “A number of creditors have explicitly offered to assist the Guaidó administration in making this payment. But the quid pro quo is that creditors would like the Guaidó administration to work with creditors to nudge the U.S. Treasury to amend the trading sanctions.” A Treasury Department spokesman declined to comment on Thursday. The opposition-controlled National Assembly declared this week that the 2020 bonds were not valid because the assembly had not approved them. Bondholders say that argument might not hold up in an American court. Exacerbating Citgo’s jeopardy, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia ruled last month that Crystallex International, a Canadian gold-mining company, could lay claim to shares of Citgo. In 2011, the Venezuelan government, then led by Hugo Chávez, nationalized Crystallex’s share of a mining project. Mr. Maduro’s government paid the company $500 million toward a $1.4 billion debt last year, but neglected to pay other installments agreed upon in arbitration. Other potential claimants include ConocoPhillips, which has been awarded over $10 billion by international tribunals for its Venezuelan projects expropriated by Mr. Chávez, who died in 2013. That Houston-based oil company has so far not sought to acquire Citgo, attempting to be paid directly through an arbitration with PDVSA and the Venezuelan government. Financial analysts expect that holders of the PDVSA bonds would be first in line to receive shares in Citgo, since the $3.4 billion in 2020 bonds are secured by 50.1 percent of Citgo shares. Ashmore Group, a London investment firm, has the largest bond holding, and other creditors could initiate legal proceedings to auction off Citgo to the highest bidder to recoup the money they are owed. The remaining 49.9 percent has been used to secure loans to PDVSA by Rosneft, the Russian oil company, which is active in Venezuelan oil fields. Several American lawmakers, including Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas, have called on the administration to protect Citgo’s 5,300 employees and keep the company from falling under Russian control. ”The potential for Rosneft to have any control of a U.S. company poses a major threat and exposes critical infrastructure to national security threats,” the two Republican senators, who have allied themselves with Mr. Trump on numerous issues, and five other lawmakers wrote to the president this month. But experts say a takeover by Rosneft is highly unlikely. In recent months, a Panamanian affiliate of Rosneft has taken control of marketing Venezuelan oil internationally. Rosneft has received accelerated payments on its loans, and Venezuela’s debts to Rosneft may be completely paid off by the end of the year.",The New York Times
2019,‘Je T’Aime Moi Non Plus’ Review: Serge Gainsbourg’s Oddball Directorial Debut,"The 1976 film, which features a young Jane Birkin and Joe Dallesandro, debuts in New York in a new restoration this week. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The French singer-songwriter Serge Gainsbourg, who died in 1991, contained multitudes. He wrote and performed melodic ditties in a variety of subgenres, with lyrics full of provocative wordplay. His contrary nature and his alcoholism fueled bad behavior, like when he drunkenly propositioned Whitney Houston on French television. His first film as a director, “Je T’Aime Moi Non Plus” in 1976, debuts in New York in a new restoration this week. It shares its title — roughly translated to “I Love You, Me Neither” — with one of Gainsbourg’s most famous (if not best) hits. Its premise is a tad out of left field, even for him. Set in a near-desert region dressed to look like a De Chirico vision of the American West, it features Joe Dallesandro — fairly fresh off his long stint as a Warhol Factory hunk — as Krassky (nicknamed Krass), a garbage hauler who tools around with his lover Padovan, a lunk who likes to carry an empty plastic bag around with him. At a truck stop Krass meets Johnny, a waifish, boyish-looking hash-slinger played by Jane Birkin, Gainsbourg’s wife at the time. Johnny is held in a kind of indentured servitude by the joint’s flatulent owner. She and Krass fall in love, but his sexual orientation, or preference — the movie is not too interested in the distinction — renders lovemaking a challenge. Gainsbourg, like Prince after him, came from music to filmmaking with a strong cinematic sense. Save for some silly whip-panning in a sequence leading up to an auto accident, he doesn’t put a foot wrong. His style is languorous, though, and while the movie is peppered with raw humor, he’s serious to a fault in depicting his couple’s predicament. The picture, praised at the time of its French release by no less a titan than François Truffaut, is not for everybody. But it’s genuinely, eccentrically Gainsbourgian. Je T’Aime Moi Non Plus Rated R for, well, you can probably guess. In French, with subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 29 minutes.

2019,‘Jexi’ Review: When a Smartphone Calls You Dumb,"Rose Byrne voices a very aggressive virtual phone assistant who roasts Adam Devine in this comedy from the writers of “The Hangover.” When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “Jexi,” a comedy written and directed by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, does not explicitly position itself as a parody of “Her,” the poignant 2013 love story of a man and a very empathetic piece of software. But this movie’s clear play on the premise helps it get off to a fast start. Adam Devine’s Phil is a socially challenged wannabe journalist in San Francisco, working at a website that’s both listicle farm and hard news outlet. (He’s a listicle guy.) When he ruins his smartphone in a meet-cute with a bike shop owner named Cate (Alexandra Shipp), he buys a new one from a remarkably hostile saleswoman (Wanda Sykes). She’s nothing, though, compared to this phone’s virtual assistant, Jexi (voiced by Rose Byrne). After announcing that she’s here to make his life better, she calls him stupid for accepting the phone’s terms and conditions without reading them, and later blurts, “I’m ashamed to be your phone.” For a good half-hour, watching and listening to Phil get roasted by Jexi is solid amusement. Her nastiness is soon revealed as a form of tough love, at least until the device becomes genuinely jealous. “Jexi” was not screened for critics, which is odd. The movie looks like “Moonstruck” next to many of the stinkers gladly offered for reviewing assessment in recent weeks. It’s also, despite some predictably raw sex humor, more amiable than you’d expect from a movie by the writers of “The Hangover.” And while its mode of argumentation gets weaker as the standard-issue boy-meets-girl-meets-carpe-diem plot progresses, the appealing cast and brisk running time help “Jexi” not wear out its welcome. Jexi Rated R for language, drug use, predictably raw sex humor. Running time: 1 hour 24 minutes.

2019,‘Jojo Rabbit’ Review: The Third Reich Wasn’t All Fun and Games,"Taika Waititi’s new film mixes farce, fantasy and drama in a Nazi-era coming-of-age story. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. According to a child psychologist cited in a recent article in The Atlantic, “little boys’ imaginary friends are frequently characters who are more competent than they are, such as superheroes or beings with powers.” That more or less describes the case of 10-year-old Johannes (Roman Griffin Davis), who has dreamed up a powerful pal to boost his confidence at anxious moments, always ready with a fist pump or a shout of “you got this!” Perfectly normal, and even kind of adorable, even though Johannes’s imaginary friend is Adolf Hitler. The make-believe Hitler is somehow both the most outlandish and the most realistic thing about “Jojo Rabbit,” Taika Waititi’s new film. Based on the novel “Caging Skies” by Christine Leunens — and featuring Waititi himself as Johannes’s goofball fantasy-Führer — the movie filters the banality and evil of the Third Reich through the consciousness of a smart, sensitive, basically ordinary German child. Veering from farce to sentimentality, infused throughout with the anarchic pop humanism Waititi has brought to projects as various as “Hunt for the Wilderpeople” and “Thor: Ragnarok,” it risks going wrong in a dozen different ways and manages to avoid at least half of them. Johannes, raised in a small town in Germany on a diet of propaganda and official Nazi youth culture, has turned Hitler into an emotional support figure, a confidant whose silliness is partly the mirror of the boy’s own insecurities. There are the serial humiliations of Hitler Youth day camp to contend with. Runty and timid, with halfhearted dreams of growing into an Aryan warrior, Johannes is bullied and teased. His nickname, Jojo Rabbit, isn’t meant affectionately. The buffoons who run the camp, an unhinged Valkyrie (Rebel Wilson) and a washed-out storm trooper (Sam Rockwell), are hardly ideal role models, and not only for the obvious ideological reasons. They are less terrifying than the ghoulish local Gestapo man, played by Stephen Merchant. Luckily, Johannes has a kindhearted mother, Rosie (Scarlett Johansson), who is immune to the seductions of National Socialism. (He also has a nonimaginary friend, Yorki, played by a scene-stealing young comic dynamo named Archie Yates.) The extent of Rosie’s opposition reveals itself slowly to Johannes and the viewer, whose point of view remains anchored in the bright colors and magical thinking of the child’s perspective. Still, we know more about what’s happening than he does, not only because we’re aware of the history he is living in, but also because we’re familiar with the contours of his type of coming-of-age story. At stake are Jojo’s innocence and his decency, and how one is purchased at the cost of the other. He needs to outgrow his selfishness and acquire the resources of empathy. Rosie can teach him a little, but his real education comes through his relationship with Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie), a Jewish teenage girl with artistic inclinations whom Rosie has hidden in a crawl space in their house. In Elsa’s presence Jojo is by turns resentful, afraid, infatuated and possessive. The tumult of his feelings, beautifully realized by the 11-year-old Davis, gives the film sweetness and charm as well as a sense of ethical urgency. Sweetness and charm may not be the notes you want or expect in a movie about genocide and fascism, and there are times when the mood turns sticky and soft, straying a bit too close to the cloying kitsch of Roberto Benigni’s “Life Is Beautiful.” Waititi is trying for a tricky blend of tones, and “Jojo Rabbit” is sharpest when it dares to be funny. Laughter is inherently violent as well as potentially soothing, and the most farcical aspects of Jojo’s world are also the most terrifying. Without resorting to graphic imagery or replicating the sadism of its villains, the movie paints a credible, if unabashedly cartoonish, picture of the workings of an evil system. The particulars of the evil can seem curiously abstract, and the portrayal of goodness can feel a bit false, and forced. The outlandishness of anti-Semitism is emphasized — the idea that Jews have horns, for instance — to the exclusion of its less superstitious manifestations. And Elsa’s Jewishness has no real content. She exists mainly as a teaching moment for Johannes. Her plight is a chance for him to prove his bravery. This isn’t offensive, exactly — the spirit of the movie is too warm and the filmmaking intelligence too invigorating to provoke a strong objection — but it is a little disappointing. The humor is so audacious and the psychological insight at times so startling that it’s hard not to be dismayed when an easy and familiar dose of comfort is supplied at the end.

2019,"The ‘Joker’ Movie Is a Risk, but a Calculated One, for Warner Bros.","LOS ANGELES — Hollywood’s latest comic book movie, “Joker,” arrives in multiplexes on Thursday night, and it has all the makings of a juggernaut. The R-rated film, which portrays the DC Comics villain as sharing the psychological traits of real-life mass shooters, is expected to collect at least $80 million in the United States and Canada by Sunday. If the film reaches that total, it would give Warner Bros. its biggest non-sequel opening in two years. “Joker” has artistic legitimacy, having won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival last month. Its star, Joaquin Phoenix, has been singled out as a surefire Oscar nominee. But “Joker” is also causing deep unease. Some people, including a few rank-and-file employees on the Warner Bros. lot, worry that the violent, hyper-realistic movie is potentially dangerous — that rather than critiquing the societal failings that have given rise to America’s mass-shooter crisis, the film legitimizes such atrocities and could provoke more of them. Amid the critical praise are scorching reviews that use words like “irresponsible.” The F.B.I. has warned about ugly online chatter surrounding “Joker,” prompting the police in cities including New York and Los Angeles to step up theater security and reigniting the debate over First Amendment rights versus Hollywood accountability. Relatives and friends of those killed during the 2012 movie theater massacre in Aurora, Colo., sent a letter to Warner Bros. expressing disquiet over “Joker” and its empathetic depiction of the character. Warner Bros. has gone on the defensive. “It is not the intention of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to hold this character up as a hero,” the studio said in a statement. It was very much the intention, however, to make an audacious, boundary-pushing movie — one that could cut through the deluge of Netflix-Amazon-YouTube streaming content and get people out to movie theaters to buy tickets. When in doubt, sharpen the edges: “Joker” will be followed on Oct. 18 by “Jojo Rabbit,” a Holocaust dramedy with slapstick Nazis from Fox Searchlight, and on Nov. 27 by “Queen & Slim,” a searing Universal drama that depicts racially charged police violence. “The Hunt,” about a group of “globalist elites” killing people for sport, would be in theaters now, but Universal canceled its release after mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio. [Read A.O. Scott’s review of the much-anticipated “Joker.”] “Joker” got its start in 2016, when Todd Phillips, who had directed men-behaving-badly comedies for Warner Bros. like “The Hangover” and “Old School,” told Greg Silverman, then the studio’s president of creative development and production, that he had a wild idea. Mr. Phillips wanted to make a gritty character study of the Joker in the mold of “Taxi Driver,” dispensing with the cartoon, buildings-imploding fantasy of most superhero movies and placing the story more squarely in the real world. “A way to sneak a real movie in the studio system under the guise of a comic book film,” as Mr. Phillips recently recalled in an interview with The Wrap, an entertainment news site. In particular, Mr. Phillips wanted to give the Joker a new back story, one that ended up making the character strikingly similar to disturbed young men who were perpetrating mass killings in real life, including the one who carried out the Aurora massacre. (In the comics, the villain falls into a vat of chemicals and comes out a disfigured maniac.) As the violence escalates in “Joker,” the character becomes a hero to the disenfranchised. Mr. Silverman and Kevin Tsujihara, then the studio’s chairman, were stunned. It had been widely reported at the time of the Aurora massacre that the gunman, whose hair was dyed reddish orange, had told the police that he was the Joker. That account was later debunked, but the character was still associated with the episode in the public consciousness. How did Mr. Phillips possibly expect the studio to buy into his idea? Warner Bros., after all, sold Joker pajamas at Walmart. But they gave him permission to proceed with a script. The discussion with Mr. Phillips came as Warner Bros., once the dominant studio in Hollywood, had begun to sputter. Trying to compete with Disney with films like “Pan” was proving disastrous. Marvel was soaring by using a lighthearted formula while Warner Bros. had seemed to lose its superhero touch, most recently delivering the critically reviled “Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice.” The rise of Netflix, and the overreliance by studios on bloated sequels and reboots, were starting to keep ticket buyers on their living room sofas. In the past, some of Warner’s most lasting hits came by leaning into risk and producing films that wowed audiences while saying something sharp about the broader culture. Warner Bros. was the studio that made “Natural Born Killers” (1994), about the media’s egging on a couple on a murderous spree, and had backed “A Clockwork Orange,” Stanley Kubrick’s 1971 movie about violent young sociopaths. Maybe part of the way forward for Warner Bros. was to embrace its rabble-rousing past. “Original visions, strange visions — that’s why a lot of us fell in love with the movies in the ’70s,” said Marty Kaplan, the Norman Lear professor of entertainment, media and society at the University of Southern California. “There’s starting to be a bit of a return to that as some of the studios look for different, noticeable, sharp. Who has a bold take on the world that speaks to the part of our psyche that we ourselves don’t understand?” Warner Bros. agreed in March 2018 to make “Joker,” with the studio’s new marketing chief, Blair Rich, emerging as a vocal proponent and Toby Emmerich, the new chairman of the movie division, judging the script as too good to pass up, according to four people involved in the project, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to maintain relationships. Still, there was division among the ranks, the people said. Other senior executives were disconcerted by the level of violence and ultra-bleak tone. They were also dealing with an unhappy Jared Leto, who plays the Joker in the studio’s ensemble “Suicide Squad” series and was not keen to have a competing performance. But the company did take measures to mitigate the risk. Warner Bros. brought on two co-financiers, Bron Studios and Village Roadshow, reducing the studio’s exposure — and its potential profits. The movie cost $55 million to make, a modest amount for a major production. By the time Warner Bros. began revving up its marketing engines for “Joker” in late August, however, the cultural and political landscape in the United States had grown even more heated, making Mr. Phillips’s nihilistic movie feel even more on the nose. Fears about safety in public spaces had increased after a rash of mass shootings, including one at a California agricultural festival and one at a Walmart that left 22 dead. “Joker” also arrives at a time of heightened tension at Warner Bros. The studio has a new owner (AT&T completed its takeover of WarnerMedia last year) and a new chairman: Ann Sarnoff, a Hollywood outsider, took over in August. Mr. Tsujihara resigned under pressure in March, leaving some executives in the movie division reeling. AT&T has new mandates for the studio, which is expected to begin shifting some production away from theatrical distribution and toward a new streaming service. Warner Bros. has also struggled at the box office in recent months. Misfires include “The Goldfinch,” “Shaft” and “The Kitchen.” “It: Chapter Two” is a success, with ticket sales of about $423 million to date. But the first “It” film took in $700 million. The “Joker” publicity campaign has been tumultuous. When a film critic for a British newspaper asked Mr. Phoenix an uncomfortable question at a press junket — was he worried the film might “perversely end up inspiring exactly the kind of people it’s about, with potentially tragic results”? — the star walked out of the interview. The critic, Robbie Collin, said it took “an hour’s peace-brokering” with a Warner Bros. publicist to resume the conversation. In other interviews, Mr. Phoenix appeared more at ease with the topic. “If you have somebody that has that level of emotional disturbance, they can find fuel anywhere,” he told IGN, a video game and entertainment news site. Warner Bros. was forced to address the matter when the Aurora parents went public with their letter, even though the missive made clear that it supported the studio’s right to free speech. Other Aurora parents told reporters they were O.K. with “Joker.” “Make no mistake: Neither the fictional character Joker nor the film is an endorsement of real-world violence of any kind,” the studio said in its statement. “At the same time, Warner Bros. believes that one of the functions of storytelling is to provoke difficult conversations around complex issues.” The studio then barred reporters from the red carpet at a premiere for the movie on Saturday in Los Angeles. “I think it’s time to let the film speak for itself,” Mr. Phillips said in a brief introduction inside the theater. Most theater chains have declined to comment, as has the National Association of Theater Owners. AMC, the nation’s largest theater owner, declined to speak directly about “Joker,” instead releasing a statement that said, “Working with law enforcement, AMC has a number of safety and security protocols in place at all of its theaters.” The Alamo Drafthouse chain bluntly reminded its customers that “Joker” is not a typical comic book movie. “There’s lots of very, very rough language, brutal violence and overall bad vibes,” Alamo said on social media on Tuesday. “It’s not for kids, and they won’t like it anyway. (There’s no Batman.)”",The New York Times
2019,"‘Joker’ Opens Strong at Box Office, Despite Controversy","The supervillain story has been the subject of intense debate. That didn’t stop it from bringing in about $93.5 million at domestic theaters this weekend. With some cheering it on and others anxiously holding their breath, Hollywood’s latest comic book movie, “Joker,” laughed its way to the bank this weekend, opening to robust ticket sales and signaling to Warner Bros. that a risky move had paid off. “Joker” sold about $93.5 million in domestic tickets this weekend. The movie made an additional $140.5 million overseas, according to Warner Bros. “This is a very strong opening,” David A. Gross, a movie consultant, wrote in a report this weekend. Moviegoers’ embrace of “Joker” came amid a heated debate over whether Warner Bros. was being irresponsible by releasing it. The R-rated film starring Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker, the DC Comics villain, tells an origin story for the character, showing how his homicidal anger grew out of intense isolation and rejection. Some worried that the movie, rather than critiquing societal issues, might instead be painting an overly sympathetic portrait of a man whose descent into brutal villainy echoes the back stories of actual mass shooters. The film’s bleak tone and artsy look are pointedly atypical for a comic-book movie; its director, Todd Phillips, envisioned it as a gritty character study in the mold of “Taxi Driver.” (Phillips is best known for “The Hangover.”) The film won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival last month, which helped lend it artistic legitimacy. Phoenix, better known for working with auteurs like Paul Thomas Anderson and Lynne Ramsay than for starring in superhero moneymakers, is widely anticipated to net an Oscar nomination for his performance. But as the release date for “Joker” inched closer, criticism intensified. Undergirding it was the memory of the 2012 shooting in Aurora, Colo., which occurred during a midnight showing of the Warner Bros. superhero movie “The Dark Knight Rises,” also based on characters from DC Comics. Last month, relatives and friends of those killed in that shooting sent a letter to Warner Bros. expressing disquiet over “Joker.” “When we learned that Warner Bros. was releasing a movie called ‘Joker’ that presents the character as a protagonist with a sympathetic origin story, it gave us pause,” the letter said. In its own statement, Warner Bros. wrote that “it is not the intention of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to hold this character up as a hero.” [Read our critic’s review of “Joker.”] In the lead-up to the release of “Joker,” the F.B.I. warned of online threats, adding to fears that screenings of the movie might be targeted with violence. That prompted the police in cities including New York and Los Angeles to step up theater security. The movie opened without incident, though signs of audiences’ anxiety were apparent. According to The Associated Press, a number of moviegoers left a screening in midtown Manhattan on Friday night after a man cheered and applauded on-screen murders. Consuming what appeared to be alcohol, he reportedly spat on patrons as they left the theater. “All the nervousness built around the film” made the experience particularly unsettling, one moviegoer, Etai Benson, wrote in an online exchange with the news agency. Warner Bros. made a bet that audiences would respond to an edgy, artsy, boundary-pushing movie — and this weekend proved them right. While opening sales for “Joker” were not as high as they were for “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” ($166 million in 2016) or “The Dark Knight Rises” (about $161 million in 2012), Gross, the movie consultant, noted in his report that character spinoffs typically make less money than the original movies. “Joker” was able to perform roughly in line with other spinoffs relative to their main series counterpart. “The Batman franchise, including this spinoff, is playing at an extremely high level,” Gross added. Reinforcing that success is the fact that “Joker” cost $55 million to make, a modest amount for a major production. “The Dark Knight Rises,” by comparison, cost an reported $250 million to bring to life. “Joker” didn’t have much serious competition this weekend. The next-highest grossing movie on domestic screens was Universal’s “Abominable,” an animated family movie that opened last weekend and brought in an additional $12 million domestically this weekend. “Downton Abbey,” distributed by Focus Features, came in third place, selling $8 million in tickets during what was its third weekend in theaters.",The New York Times
2019,‘Joker’ Review: Are You Kidding Me?,"Todd Phillips’s supervillain origin story starring Joaquin Phoenix is stirring up a fierce debate, but it’s not interesting enough to argue about. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Since its debut a few weeks ago at the Venice Film Festival, where it won the top prize, Todd Phillips’s “Joker” has stirred up quite a tempest. Hands have been wrung about the movie’s supposed potential to inspire acts of real-life violence, and criticism of its brutal nihilism has been met with a counter-backlash, including from Phillips himself, who has been sounding off about the “far left” and “woke culture” and other threats to the ability of a murderous clown to make money unmolested. Meanwhile, the usual armies of skeptics and fans have squared off with ready-made accusations of bad faith, hypersensitivity and quasi-fascist groupthink. We are now at the phase of the argument cycle when actual ticket buyers have a chance to see what all the fuss is about, which means that it’s also time for me to say my piece. And what I have to say is: Are you kidding me? To be worth arguing about, a movie must first of all be interesting: it must have, if not a coherent point of view, at least a worked-out, thought-provoking set of themes, some kind of imaginative contact with the world as we know it. “Joker,” an empty, foggy exercise in second-hand style and second-rate philosophizing, has none of that. Besotted with the notion of its own audacity — as if willful unpleasantness were a form of artistic courage — the film turns out to be afraid of its own shadow, or at least of the faintest shadow of any actual relevance. It barely even works within the confines of its own genre, the comic-book movie. “Joker” is a supervillain origin story, involving a character whose big-screen résumé already includes three Oscar winners (two for other roles, but still). It’s not hard to see the appeal. The Joker, an embodiment of pure anarchy, can be played light or heavy, scary or fun or all at once. He can sneer like Jack Nicholson, snarl like Heath Ledger or … I’m still not sure what Jared Leto was doing, but never mind. As embodied by Joaquin Phoenix, he laughs a lot — enough to ensure that no one else will. The hallmark of this “Joker” is its solemn witlessness. You might wonder how this could be the work of the same Todd Phillips who directed “The Hangover” and “Road Trip,” which have at least a reputation for being funny. The cleverest bit here is casting Robert De Niro as a late-night, Carsonesque talk-show host similar to the one played by Jerry Lewis in Martin Scorsese’s “The King of Comedy.” In that movie, De Niro was the crazy stalker, a talentless wannabe presuming to breathe the same air as his idol and quarry. This time out, he’s in the big chair, feeding the celebrity obsessions of Arthur Fleck. That’s the Joker’s alter ego: a lonely, damaged man eking out an abject living as a clown-for-hire and living in a drab apartment with his mother (Frances Conroy). Phillips, who wrote the script with Scott Silver, takes us back to the bad old days of Gotham City, when work was scarce, rats were rampant and a garbage strike fouled the streets. Fleck is bullied by thieving poor kids and drunken rich guys, goaded to the point of murder by the meanness of the world. He has a crush on a neighbor (Zazie Beetz) that he thinks might be reciprocated. He keeps a notebook full of stand-up material and works up the nerve to go onstage at a nightclub open-mic night. There’s nothing wrong with any of these plot points, or with the details that knit “Joker” into the familiar Batman world. Arthur has a connection to the Wayne family — we meet Alfred the butler and young Bruce — and also to Arkham Asylum. The problems arise when the film revs its allegorical engine and Phoenix tries to assemble a character from the tics and tropes he has been given. Skinny, twitchy and at times startlingly graceful — Phoenix is one of the modern screen’s underrated dancers — Arthur has a physical and psychological resemblance to Freddie Quell, the misfit drifter Phoenix played in “The Master.” But he also carries the burden of being a victimized Everyman in a parable that can’t get its story straight. Arthur’s uncontrollable laughter arises from a medical condition that is possibly the result of childhood abuse. His profound alienation also arises from social inequality, the decline of civility, political corruption, television, government bureaucracy and a slew of other causes. Rich people are awful. Poor people are awful. Joker’s embrace of radical evil becomes a kind of integrity. Or something. It’s hard to say if the muddle “Joker” makes of itself arises from confusion or cowardice, but the result is less a depiction of nihilism than a story about nothing. The look and the sound — cinematography by Lawrence Sher, cello-heavy score by Hildur Gudnadottir — connote gravity and depth, but the movie is weightless and shallow. It isn’t any fun, and it can’t be taken seriously. Is that the joke? Joker Rated R. Killer clown stuff. Running time: 2 hours 2 minutes.

2019,‘Joker’: A Dance Critic Reviews Joaquin Phoenix’s Moves,"Critic’s Notebook Mr. Phoenix’s remarkable performance puts two characters in one moving, sinewy body. This article contains spoilers for “Joker.” The title character in “Joker” comes of age not in the way you might imagine — with a litany of wisecracks — but through the silent language of dance. It’s in that nonverbal place that Joaquin Phoenix’s performance, along with Hildur Gudnadottir’s melancholy score, wraps the film in unmanageable sorrow. You can’t completely banish your true self when you dance; Arthur Fleck is still somewhere inside of Mr. Phoenix, even after Arthur transforms himself into the Joker. What makes Mr. Phoenix’s performance so confusingly poignant — and not just a tale of good vs. evil — is the way in which he has essentially placed two characters within one dancing body. Just as the Joker takes control with strutting, confident steps — his ultra-erect posture makes it seem as if he’s looking down on the rest of the world — dance allows Arthur, brittle with tension, to relax. To melt a little. To float in space. “Joker” has divided critics, but there’s one thing they agree on: Mr. Phoenix is a great dancer. They’re right. It’s not just the way he moves, with uncultivated finesse — dreamily, animalistic, like a rock star. Or how, when he stretches his arms out side to side, he evokes the ghosts of Jim Morrison or Brandon Lee in “The Crow.” It has more to do with the nuanced way his body can express emotion; you see the mind at work, and because of that the dancing enters another realm. In the film, directed by Todd Phillips with choreography by Michael Arnold, Arthur, who suffers from mental illness and is damaged from abuse and bullying, works as a party clown. An aspiring stand-up comedian, he finds comfort in watching a talk show hosted by Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). But Murray turns out to be a bully, too. Dance is Arthur’s escape, his life force. The first time he dances isn’t in the pivotal scene in a grimy public bathroom, after he’s committed his first murders. It’s in the apartment he shares with his mother as “Shall We Dance,” the 1937 Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers film, plays on the television. The number is “Slap That Bass”: “The world is in a mess/with politics and taxes/and people grinding axes/there’s no happiness.” Arthur, shirtless and in jeans that hang loosely around his hips, has little joy. But as he starts to move, gun in hand, his arms drift above his head. He seems more confident. He sways from side to side and holds a conversation with himself as if on a talk show. “Hey, what’s your name?” “Arthur.” “Hey, Arthur, you’re a really good dancer.” His arms float overhead to form something like a diamond crown. “I know.” “You know who’s not? Him.” He aims his gun and fires at the imaginary him. The bullet hits a wall and in that moment, Arthur is both alarmed and exhilarated: Dance is his path to bravery, something he’s never known. As Arthur recedes and the Joker takes over, the choreography becomes more drawn out. In the transformative bathroom scene, panic morphs into an eerie power. Mr. Phoenix softly crosses one foot over the other and twists, curling his arms overhead and around his torso. His shoulders hike up and his elbows jut out dangerously as his body ripples and swells until, in the final moment, his arms extend to either side. This is the Joker’s power pose. Sometimes Mr. Phoenix, who lost a great deal of weight for “Joker,” has the look of a ballet dancer on a break from rehearsals. Pale and gaunt with wavy hair pasted to the sides of his face, his appearance, at times, has a touch of Rudolf Nureyev or Sergei Polunin — two Russians with attitude. His skin stretches tautly over muscles and protruding ribs. But it’s not just a cosmetic transformation. Nor is what he does ballet. Mr. Phoenix has the sinewy ability to turn his body — particularly his back — into a Butoh horror show of odd, freakish angles. But more than Butoh — the postwar Japanese form known, in part, for its dark, slow-motion movement — his dancing embraces vaudeville. That makes sense. Growing up, Mr. Phoenix spent time busking with his brothers and sisters in Los Angeles; vaudeville is in his body’s history, too. And while he told The Associated Press that Ray Bolger’s “The Old Soft Shoe” was an inspiration for the hubris of the Joker, there’s also something of Astaire in his movement, especially in the way he creates lightness and space in his upper body. Yet Mr. Phoenix’s dancing also feels fueled by sensation, as if he were delving into Gaga, the movement language created by the Israeli choreographer Ohad Naharin. That vocabulary is driven by imagery. In a Gaga class, participants respond to physical instructions, like moving while imagining that their spine is made of seaweed — if you’re embarrassed or holding back, it doesn’t work. (There are no mirrors in class.) Mr. Phoenix may not be practicing Gaga, but he seems to understand the difference between skin and flesh. It’s subtle, but different. Gaga can veer from bizarre to sensuous to tactile, and is about, as Mr. Naharin has said, finding a connection to groove. As the Joker, Mr. Phoenix nails that when dancing down a steep outdoor staircase, kicking his legs on each step in full-body revelry. Instead of being kicked, he’s the one doing the kicking. It’s a dance of empowerment. “Joker,” which continually blurs reality, seems less a linear tale than a sequence of dances knitted together with dialogue. In the end, Arthur, though handcuffed, has a song in his head and a spring to his step. As he disappears down a pristine white hallway, he uses what mobility he has — his shoulders, which creep up and down to Frank Sinatra’s “That’s Life.” His feet leave bloody tracks behind, like the footprints in an Arthur Murray diagram. Are the names in the film — Mr. Phoenix’s Arthur and Mr. DeNiro’s Murray — a coincidence? In any case, the last dance is one of liberation: As long as he can move, he’s free. And Mr. Phoenix knows how to move. His dancing is no joke.",The New York Times
2019,‘Joker’: What to Read About the Divisive New Film,"The movie earned roughly a quarter of a billion dollars its opening weekend. It also earned some polarized reviews and an F.B.I. warning. Here’s what people are saying. Is “Joker” a definitive movie of our time? Is it incel propaganda? Might it even be dangerous? The film arrived in theaters last week accompanied by F.B.I. warnings about the threat of related gun violence, but by Monday its international box office had already reached about a quarter of a billion dollars. Meanwhile, the debates over its politics and artistic merit raged on. Here are some of the many reviews, interviews and features that have been prompted by this dark and divisive movie. ‘Joker’ Review: Are You Kidding Me? [The New York Times] “To be worth arguing about, a movie must first of all be interesting,” A.O. Scott writes in his review for The Times. “It must have, if not a coherent point of view, at least a worked-out, thought-provoking set of themes, some kind of imaginative contact with the world as we know it. ‘Joker,’ an empty, foggy exercise in secondhand style and second-rate philosophizing, has none of that. Besotted with the notion of its own audacity — as if willful unpleasantness were a form of artistic courage — the film turns out to be afraid of its own shadow, or at least of the faintest shadow of any actual relevance.” ‘“Joker” Is a Viewing Experience of Rare, Numbing Emptiness’ [The New Yorker] “What results is more than the strenuous effort to contrive a story with resonant incidents and alluring details,” Richard Brody writes in his review. “‘Joker’ reflects political cowardice on the part of a filmmaker, and perhaps of a studio, in emptying out the specifics of the city’s modern history and current American politics so that the movie can be released as mere entertainment to viewers who are exasperated with the idea of movies being discussed in political terms — i.e., to Republicans.” ‘Brilliant and Unforgettable, “Joker” Borders on Genius’ [Observer] “Even if you hate it, it’s unlike anything you’ve ever seen before — like waking up next to a poisonous snake nestled on your blanket, poised and ready to strike,” writes Rex Reed. And although he admits to having mixed feelings, he adds, “I think it’s the best film about the psychological effect of violence as pop art since Stanley Kubrick’s ‘A Clockwork Orange.’” ‘“I [Expletive] Love My Life”: Joaquin Phoenix on Joker, Why River Is His Rosebud, His Rooney Research, and His “Prenatal” Gift for Dark Characters’ [Vanity Fair] Actor Joaquin Phoenix anticipated a mixed reaction to the film’s moral ambiguity. “It’s a difficult film,” he acknowledges. “We want the simple answers, we want to vilify people. It allows us to feel good if we can identify that as evil. ‘Well, I’m not racist ‘cause I don’t have a Confederate flag or go with this protest.’ It allows us to feel that way, but that’s not healthy because we’re not really examining our inherent racism that most white people have, certainly. Or whatever it may be.” The movie isn’t a “call to action,” he insists, but “a call to self-reflection to society.” ‘“Joker” Director Todd Phillips Rebuffs Criticism of Dark Tone: “We Didn’t Make the Movie to Push Buttons”’ [The Wrap] The director Todd Phillips explains his motivation to make the film — “a way to sneak a real movie in the studio system under the guise of a comic book film” — and expresses his surprise at the reaction. “What’s outstanding to me in this discourse in this movie is how easily the far left can sound like the far right when it suits their agenda. It’s really been eye opening for me.” ‘What’s the Panic Over “Joker” Really About?’ [The New York Times Magazine] Dan Brooks writes that the panic about “Joker” is really a panic about moral ambiguity: “Legitimate movies are about complicated protagonists who combine good and bad qualities; superhero movies are about two guys, one good and one evil. By combining them into a single guy, won’t this movie cause dummies to think the Joker is good? To ask the question is to argue that nuance is dangerous. By fretting over Arthur Fleck’s sympathetic qualities, progressive-minded critics are demanding the same sort of bright line between good and evil that makes comic-book movies so boring.” ‘Variety Critics Debate “Joker”’ [Variety] Two critics — Peter Debruge and Owen Gleiberman — debate the nuances on both sides of the argument. Debruge is rankled by “Joker” “because it takes a fictive pop-culture icon and reinvents him as a cruelly misunderstood incel underdog.” (He does concede it would be a “big mistake to banish toxic white men from the movies,” though.) Gleiberman counters that critics are treating a movie “as if it were a two-hour advertisement for the toxic white male,” “a violation of the New Woke Rules,” adding: “But they’re trying to wish away something that can’t be wished away.” ‘The Joker Is Simply a Clown Who Loves Crime’ [The Outline] Alex Nichols, after debunking a popular misconception about the 2012 Aurora shooter James Holmes (“he was not outwardly Jokerlike and did not tell police that he was the Joker after the shooting”), questions the repeated refrain that “violent media breeds violent behavior.” “It’s odd to hear this refrain from liberals, given that Donald Trump and the N.R.A. routinely blame video games and violent movies for mass shootings in order to steer the debate away from gun control,” Nichols writes. “But this idea has been a mainstay of both parties for decades.” ‘“Joker” — A Political Parable for Our Times’ [CNN] “This isn’t the first time Phillips’ and Trump’s worlds have collided,” Jeff Yang notes. “Imagine Fleck as Trump,” he suggests. “Phillips may not have intended for his film to be a political parable — or maybe he did — but it’s hard to imagine a darker ending for our real-world horror-comedy than that.” “Commentary: How “Joker” Mirrors Our Fascination With Monsters, Now in the Trump Years” [Chicago Tribune] Christopher Borreli connects Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker to “S.N.L.” sketches and likens the film to a sketch “written the morning after the 2016 presidential election, when journalism seemed intent on understanding why so many Americans turned to a man they didn’t fully understand.” This, he writes, is why the Joker is all motives: “mental illness, bad jobs, alienation, misunderstandings, nihilism, devious co-workers, social-service cutbacks.” The Joker is what happens “when our social contract is shattered and no one — not politicians, not the rich (who are targeted in film) — are held accountable to anyone anymore.” Jokers at Every Turn at Comic Con, but They Were on Their Best Behavior [The New York Times] Cosplay Jokers at New York Comic Con discuss the methods behind their “madness,” including Mei Velasco who “girl-ified” her Heath Ledger Joker while her husband dressed up as Harley Quinn. She also weighed in on the latest film Joker: “I feel like what he’s trying to say is that our society looks like it’s going toward that way, so this is like a warning. It’s like, ‘Hello, everybody, wake up!’” Why the ‘Joker’ Movie Was a Risk Warner Bros. Wanted to Take [The New York Times] “‘Joker’ got its start in 2016,” report Brooks Barnes and Nicole Sperling, “when Todd Phillips, who had directed men-behaving-badly comedies for Warner Bros. like ‘The Hangover’ and ‘Old School,’ told Greg Silverman, then the studio’s president of creative development and production, that he had a wild idea. Mr. Phillips wanted to make a gritty character study of the Joker in the mold of ‘Taxi Driver,’ dispensing with the cartoon, buildings-imploding fantasy of most superhero movies and placing the story more squarely in the real world.” Getting the Joker’s Laugh Just Right [The New York Times] It’s not easy to develop paroxysms of laughter, as Steve Knopper discovered during this examination of how actors have voiced the Joker over the decades. “It was rare that someone would come in to do the Joker voice for more than 20 minutes who didn’t end up bathed in sweat,” director Andrea Romano said. “It requires a tremendous amount of energy.” The Jokers, Ranked [The New York Times] Who laughed best? From Lego cacklers to “Suicide Squad” scene-stealers, the various Jokers are appraised for their theatricality and psychopathy. Only one can achieve the distinction of being, as Jason Bailey notes, “truly, a Joker for our time.” How Well Do You Know the Joker’s Laugh? [The New York Times] Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, Mark Hamill, Jared Leto and now Joaquin Phoenix have all cracked up as the Joker, but which of them is which?

2019,‘Junior’ Guzman Verdict: 5 Trinitarios Sentenced to Life in Hacking of Teen,"Captured on video, the grisly killing of the 15-year-old boy last year outside a Bronx bodega in a case of mistaken identity shocked the city. The killing, captured on video, rattled New Yorkers like few in recent memory: A 15-year-old boy frantically ran into a deli and begged a clerk to let him hide behind the counter. Members of the Trinitarios gang charged in and dragged the teenager out onto the sidewalk, where they hacked him with knives. The boy ran toward a nearby hospital, but collapsed and bled to death before he could get help. The police later determined that the gang members had mistaken the teenager for someone else. On Friday, five of the men seen on the video attacking the youth, Lesandro Guzman-Feliz, known as Junior, were sentenced to life in prison in a Bronx courtroom, after being convicted of murder and gang assault in June. Justice Robert A. Neary called the killing “senseless,” “savage” and “cowardly” as he sentenced the first defendant, Jonaiki Martinez Estrella, 25, who prosecutors said had struck the fatal blow. “Why?” the judge said. “To be held as a big shot in a gang? I am not sure you sense the magnitude of what you’ve done.” Before Justice Neary handed down the sentences, Lesandro’s parents gave emotional speeches describing their loss. “That night, there were two deaths: Junior and I, who was left dead inside,” his mother, Leandra Feliz, said. “If it were up to me, I would sentence these murderers to 300 years in prison.” Lesandro was walking alone at about 11:40 p.m. on June 20, 2018, in the Belmont section of the Bronx, looking at his phone, when he was accosted by several members of the Los Surés faction of the Trinitarios. The gang had been hunting for enemies and thought Lesandro was a member of a rival group, according to trial testimony. The men chased Lesandro for blocks, catching up to him as he tried to hide inside the Cruz and Chiky Grocery, a bodega at East 183rd Street and Bathgate Avenue. The gruesome murder a few minutes later prompted outrage on social media and calls for justice from elected officials and celebrities, including the rapper Cardi B and the Yankees pitcher C. C. Sabathia. Hundreds of people attended Lesandro’s funeral. The police later arrested 14 people and charged them with taking part in Lesandro’s murder. Two became cooperating witnesses. The five men sentenced on Friday were found guilty of murder and gang assault in June after a five-week trial in State Supreme Court in the Bronx that provided a look inside the workings of the Trinitarios, a highly organized and brutally violent gang. The jury took two days to reach a guilty verdict for the defendants: Mr. Martinez Estrella, 25; Antonio Rodriguez Hernandez Santiago, 25; Jose Muniz, 23; Manuel Rivera, 19; and Elvin Garcia, 25. Eight others are awaiting trial. Mr. Martinez, who prosecutors said struck the fatal blow, was sentenced to life without parole. Mr. Muniz, Mr. Garcia and Mr. Rodriguez Hernandez Santiago will be eligible for parole after 25 years, and Mr. Rivera after 23 years. This week the authorities announced the indictment of 15 more members of the same gang, accusing them of carrying out attacks with machetes, knives and fists in Upper Manhattan. Lesandro’s father, Lisandro Guzman, told the court that since his son’s murder he has struggled to sleep. Weekends have become a “battle to stay busy” for him because those were the days he used to spend with his son. “You will never have the ability to understand the pain you have caused,” Mr. Guzman told the convicted men. Before his sentencing, Mr. Martinez apologized to Leandro’s family in Spanish. “It was not my intention to cause the death of this kid, but that day I was under the influence of alcohol and drugs, and I did not know what I was doing,” he said. Justice Neary, however, was unmoved and gave him the maximum penalty. “Certain words come to mind when I think about your involvement,” he said. “Senseless is one of these words. Savage is another word. But the one that often comes to my mind is cowardly.” “You and your fellow gang members chased down and slaughtered a 15-year-old, defenseless boy in the most gruesome manner, and we in this courtroom had the misfortune of witnessing it on tape,” the judge said. Arguing for leniency, the defense lawyers described the mesmerizing pull of gang life for young men like their clients, who they said came from troubled families and had found in the Trinitarios a group in which they felt valued and protected for the first time. The gang has provided the men with money, status and protection in return for their unflinching loyalty in carrying out orders from their superiors. Mr. Rivera’s lawyer, Toni Messina, said her client was too young to fully comprehend what he was doing. “He was 18 years old and was seduced by the cult,” she said. But the lead prosecutor, Morgan Dolan, argued for life sentences, pointing out that none of the defendants had shown remorse before the sentencing. She also argued that the defendants had gone out that night planning to kill someone and knew precisely what they were doing. Mr. Rodriguez Hernandez Santiago refused to speak before his sentencing, offering no apology nor a plea for mercy. When Justice Neary sentenced him to life, his mother moaned in the gallery and stood up. “My son did not kill him,” she shouted. Mr. Muniz, who at his last court appearance had shouted out that he was a Trinitario “until death,” also said that he felt no remorse for Lesandro’s death, though he offered an apology to the Dominican community and his family for “staining” their reputations. Speaking Spanish, he described the attack as “something that got out of hand, something that wasn’t justifiable.” “I did not kill him,” Mr. Muniz said. “That’s why my conscience is clean. I do not care about you believing me.” Justice Neary told Mr. Muniz he was a disgrace to his family. “You should be a poster boy for any young man contemplating to join a gang,” the judge said.

2019,‘Just Give Us a Country’: Thousands in Iraq Protest Corruption,"BAGHDAD — Violent protests have erupted across much of Iraq as demonstrators poured into the streets, embittered about poor public services, corruption and unemployment. By early Thursday, 14 people were confirmed dead by the Health Ministry and by hospitals: five in Baghdad and nine in Nasiriya, in southern Iraq. Hundreds of others were wounded, primarily by rubber bullets and tear gas, and in some cases by live ammunition. The ministry said on Wednesday that 100 to 200 demonstrators were being treated for injuries at Baghdad hospitals. Counterterrorism police officers were deployed near the city’s airport to prevent protesters from storming it. The situation remained tense overnight in Baghdad and in several southern provinces, as the government took strict measures to bring mass demonstrations under control: A curfew was imposed in the affected areas and the internet was shut down to make it more difficult for protesters to organize on social media. Despite the measures, two rockets were fired early Thursday at the Green Zone, the heavily protected area that covers about four square miles of Baghdad, though there were no reports of injuries. The unrest, now in its third day, amounted to the largest display of public anger at the government of Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi since it took office a year ago. Iraqis have held mass demonstrations for the last several years over a lack of basic services as well as government corruption. However, the demonstrations usually happen in summer, when electricity outages cause the greatest suffering from Iraq’s extreme heat, which routinely exceeds 115 degrees in the southern provinces. The latest demonstrations, in much cooler temperatures, suggest the underlying grievances are as much about frustration with the government and unemployment as they are about the lack of services. In Dhi Qar, a province in southern Iraq, where demonstrators briefly seized provincial government buildings, one demonstrator, Mushtaq Radhi Salih, said that all people wanted was to express their opinions and to end the government’s seeming disregard for their needs. “There is corruption and for 14 years there has been no electricity and no services and no water,” he said. “We do not want the political parties, we want nothing from them. Just give us a country, we just want a country to live in,” he beseeched anyone who would listen. Baghdad’s Tahrir Square, the chief gathering place used by demonstrators on Tuesday, was mostly cordoned off by the police on Wednesday. The largest, most fervent and violent Baghdad protests on Wednesday were in the poor and working class neighborhoods of Sadr City and Al Amal City. Mr. Mahdi convened a national security meeting after making a statement early Wednesday underscoring both his support for the protesters’ “legitimate concerns” and for the security forces who were trying to keep order. He blamed “aggressive attackers” for turning the demonstrations into a face-off between security forces and protesters. And he accused violent demonstrators of attacking security forces with knives and hand grenades, saying that they “threaten the general order and civil peace.” After three demonstrators were killed on Tuesday by riot police officers who resorted to live fire, Mr. Mahdi ordered the security forces to refrain from the use of bullets. By nightfall on Wednesday, however, it seemed that some police officers may have ignored his instructions as more people were reported shot. The protests have veered from furious attacks on government property to peaceful, even ecumenical, pleas for the government to respond to citizens’ needs. At dusk in Baghdad, some Sunni and Shia Muslims joined together in prayer. Some demonstrators carried banners that seemed in keeping with Mr. Mahdi’s statement that both the police and the demonstrators were sons of Iraq. But some banners also appeared aimed at rallying the police to the side of the protesters. One banner read: “Oh you soldier, do not open fire. I am your brother. Your mother and my mother cry the same tears. You fight for me and I demonstrate for you.” In the central-southern city of Najaf, a man who worked as a government employee attributed the protests to “suffering from a shortage of everything.” The police initially used tear gas and rubber bullets in Baghdad on Tuesday when the crowds began marching toward the international zone, which is the seat of government, but then officers resorted to live fire, killing three people. Many more were treated in Baghdad hospitals for injuries from rubber bullets and tear gas.",The New York Times
2019,‘Kinetta’ Review: Cryptic Seeds of Yorgos Lanthimos’s Imagery,"Set around a Greek seaside resort, the now-acclaimed director’s 2005 movie bears inklings of ideas he would explore more fully later. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Before he directed Olivia Colman to an Oscar in “The Favourite” (2018), even before “Dogtooth” won an award at Cannes in 2009 and cemented his reputation as a filmmaker to watch, the Greek-born director Yorgos Lanthimos made “Kinetta,” his solo debut feature. The movie has made scattered appearances in the United States since it premiered in 2005 but is only now receiving its first weeklong run in New York, at the Museum of the Moving Image. This semi-plotless film, set around a Greek seaside resort, involves three characters who appear to be making a movie, of sorts. The amateur film, shot by a bearded man (Aris Servatelis) who runs a photo shop, stars a hotel maid (Evangelia Randou) in the leading role. She is directed by a third man (Costas Xikominos) in scenes of abuse or humiliation. His bizarrely specific instructions on how to pose and move tend to result in actual injuries. Viewing “Kinetta” with the benefit of hindsight, you can see inklings of visual and staging ideas that Lanthimos would explore more fully later on. Clearly, he had already developed his interest in tableaus of near-mute characters making spastic, dancelike movements — a motif that resurfaced in “Dogtooth” and his 2012 film “Alps” (showing back-to-back with “Kinetta” at the museum at select screenings). But time hasn’t made it more than a cryptic curiosity. Dialogue is sparse, and it takes some time for the threesome’s dynamic to come into focus, to the extent that it ever does. Lanthimos shot much of the film with a hand-held camera, a device more irritating than purposeful. But we know from later films that he would soon develop a smoother, more controlled sense of craft.

2019,‘Lakota America’ Puts the Tribe of Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse Front and Center,"Books of The Times When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. At first glance, “Lakota America” is every inch a sober, stately work of scholarship — and one long overdue. It is purportedly the first complete history of the Lakotas, the tribe of Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse, the regime that long dominated the American interior, thwarting Western expansion with charm, shrewd diplomacy and sheer might. Look again, however, and you’ll catch something roiling beneath that professional composure: a lively truculence that gives this book its pulse, and its purpose. Pekka Hamalainen’s impressive history is also a quarrel with the field, with how history — especially the history of indigenous Americans — has been told and sold. Hamalainen’s previous book, “The Comanche Empire” (2009), awarded the prestigious Bancroft Prize, resurrected the lost stories of a prosperous and sophisticated people of the American Southwest. The new book also responds to the long legacy of erasing and suppressing the history of indigenous America, or reducing it to a backdrop. That distorted perspective lives on in the language we still use. The word “Sioux” refers to a coalition of seven allied and related nations, including the Lakotas, but the word itself is a French corruption of “Nadouessioux,” an Ojibwe word meaning “snake” — or enemy. Hamalainen renders the Lakotas as full protagonists. This is an American story with their contribution, influence and version of events at the center — and to build that story, there is a rich, idiosyncratic archive to draw on. The Lakotas marked time with pictographs, called waniyetu iyawapi (“winter counts”), originally painted onto the hide of a buffalo. Each year was depicted by the image of a signal event: plentiful bison to hunt, war. When colonists brought the devastating smallpox virus to the Americas, decimating indigenous populations who had no immunity, the winter count documented a small face so covered with marks that only tiny eyes were visible. In retrospect, history often seems preordained; vulnerabilities seem garishly announced, outcomes a matter of course. Winter counts, however, illustrate sudden, pitiless twists of fortune. In writing “Lakota America,” Hamalainen seeks to do the same, to infuse a sense of chance and contingency in the narrative, to remain “alive to the ever-present possibility that events could have turned out differently.” He sows this feeling of uncertainty into the composition of the book, replacing a traditional arc with “a more unpredictable narrative structure that is full of triumphs, twists, reversals, victories, lulls and low points, big and small. If the book’s Lakotas — haughty and imperial at one moment, fearful and vulnerable the next, prudent and accommodating the third — seem strange and unfamiliar, this portrayal has succeeded.” All nations deserve to have their stories told with this degree of attentiveness, but the Lakotas might have a special claim. Their political philosophy and social organizations were distinguished by a flexibility that allowed them to maneuver among rival colonial powers and hostile neighboring tribes. One of their mythical heroes is the shape-shifting spider-trickster figure Iktomi. The Lakotas’ malleability aided their countless transformations — from foragers to farmers to nomads to hunters on horseback, from an isolated society to the most dominant indigenous nation in the Americas, controlling territory across the Great Plains, and into the Rocky Mountains and Canada. “Lakota America” takes us from the 16th century to the present, with painstaking, carefully marshaled detail, but its real feat is in threading how the Lakota philosophy and vision of the world guided their reinventions and their dealings with colonial powers. “Lakotas were fighting for survival,” Hamalainen writes, “but they were also fighting to keep alive a broader vision of America where coexistence through right thoughts and acts might be possible.” Theirs was a capacious notion of kinship, in which competitors and even enemies could be brought into the fold. (Lewis and Clark make a spectacularly bumbling appearance in the book as the perfect foils for the Lakotas, marked by an utter inability “to see, learn and adapt.” They were bewildered that Native Americans welcomed American trade but not their “paternal embrace.”) Hamalainen has the novelist’s relish for the strange, pungent detail, and he conjures early America in swift strokes: fur-trading posts reeking with the scent of entrails; the 17th-century world of cross-cultural diplomacy that relied on semaphore, kisses and tears. In one dreamlike scene, he describes a frozen lake full of the preserved bodies of a thousand bison, “halted in mid-motion.” They had been trapped under a layer of ice and became “a huge natural refrigerator of meat” that sustained the Lakotas for a year. The Americans and Lakotas — two expansionist powers, as Hamalainen describes them — were occasional allies, oddly compatible for parts of their shared history. Colonial incursions were constant and inventive, however, and the railroad powered “a new kind of arrogance toward the continent’s indigenous peoples.” The sovereignty of the Lakotas depended on bison, and the American government embarked on a program of extermination. In a three-year period, hunting squads killed more than three million bison, close to 3,000 animals a day. The challenge of writing this history, Hamalainen notes, was making iconic events and figures unfamiliar again, which is never more necessary than at the twilight of the Lakota empire. At the Battle of the Little Bighorn, the Lakotas dealt the Americans a humiliating defeat, and the American Army responded with a campaign of terror, beginning with the Wounded Knee massacre, in which soldiers slaughtered hundreds of Indians. Missionaries and social reformers began their work in zeal; children were taken from families and sent to boarding schools whose explicit mission was to annihilate the Lakotas’ language, religion and culture. Nearly every aspect of Lakota life became subject to surveillance and control. The winter counts are few from these years, reflecting the trauma, the ravages of dispossession and suicide — “colonialism working exactly as intended.” Hamalainen finds notes of optimism in recent years, however, in the protests around the Dakota Access pipeline, which attracted global attention, and the Lakotas’ unflagging efforts to recover the Black Hills. “Lakotas will endure because they are Iktomi’s people, supple, accommodating and absolutely certain of their essence even when becoming something new,” he writes. “They will always find a place in the world because they know how to be fully in it, adapting to its shape while remaking it, again and again, after their own image.” It’s tempting to dismiss such a sentiment as unforgivably glib — and a disappointing moment in such an accomplished, and subtle, study. I did at first; how easy it is to appeal to resilience at a comfortable distance, I groused, as if the obligation to endure weren’t itself a brutal burden. When I went to poetry to ward off cliché, I was chastened. In Layli Long Soldier’s spellbinding “Whereas,” a finalist for the National Book Award in 2017, she investigates the wording of treaties and other government communications with Native Americans, noting the violence coiled in official language. In the midst of this muck of doublespeak and prevarication, her own words rise, anthemic. “I am a citizen of the United States and an enrolled member of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, meaning I am a citizen of the Oglala Lakota Nation,” she writes in the book’s introduction. “In this dual citizenship, I must work, I must eat, I must art, I must mother” — notice the double meaning of “must,” which describes both what she is forced to endure but also how she goads herself forward. “I must friend, I must listen, I must observe, constantly I must live.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Let’s Flush It’: How Boone’s Calm Kept the Yankees’ Season Alive,"After a Game 4 loss, the players thought they might be berated by Manager Aaron Boone. But he maintained his typical anxiety-free demeanor. Game 4 of the American League Championship Series had been over for only a few minutes, but Yankees Manager Aaron Boone already knew he needed to perform triage on his team. The Yankees had played terribly in an 8-3 loss to the Houston Astros on Thursday night, leaving them on the brink of being eliminated from the postseason and falling short of a championship after a hard-fought 103-win season. Boone rarely calls meetings in such situations — he mostly lets the players police themselves — but a performance like that in such a high-stakes game warranted intervention. Boone made the short walk from his office to the middle of the clubhouse. The Yankees snapped to attention. “You could hear a pin drop” as Boone started speaking, outfielder Aaron Judge recalled. Some in the room were half-expecting Boone to berate them for their carelessness on the field — they had committed four errors in the loses — and for allowing the Astros to so thoroughly outplay them on national television, and in their own stadium. Even more damning was how badly the Yankees had unraveled, making mental errors as the game slipped away. It was the type of situation in which many major league managers might have lost their temper amid the October pressure. “He could have ripped us and we would have deserved it,” Judge said. “But he didn’t.” Boone instead maintained his typical anxiety-free demeanor, speaking calmly to the Yankees about what had just happened — but not for too long. He did not dwell on the game, he did not overanalyze or ask the players to relive the low point of the 2019 season. Boone merely said, “Let’s flush it,” and directed the conversation to Game 5 and how to beat Justin Verlander. The Yankees, rejuvenated by Boone’s Zen, responded the following night by scoring four runs off Verlander in the first inning, then holding on for a 4-1 victory and sending the series back to Houston for Game 6 Saturday night. Boone refused to take credit for the turnaround, but his players insisted he was responsible for their remarkable calm. “No one walked on the field during batting practice thinking, ‘Our season could be over,’” said reliever Zack Britton, who personally repaid Boone with one and two-thirds innings of scoreless pitching. “Boonie showed a lot of faith in us. He doesn’t like to have meetings, so he picks his spots. He kind of knows when we need to hear from him.” Boone smiled when asked about the specifics of his message. “I honestly don’t remember, it was no big deal,” he said, before adding, “It came from the heart.” This is just Boone’s second postseason as the Yankees’ manager, but as the son (and grandson) of an All-Star, he has been well-steeped in the pressures and demands of October baseball since childhood. He has his own postseason experience as a player, of course, having delivered one of the Yankees’ more memorable playoff moments with his walk-off home run in Game 7 of the 2003 A.L.C.S. Now, as manager, Boone was able to convince his Yankees that a comeback in the A.L.C.S. was still possible without making it sound like a mere cliché. He had been just as successful during the regular season instilling the next-man-up mantra when the Yankees were crippled by a run of injuries to some of their most important players. “He made us believe that everyone mattered, which made it easier to wait your turn,” said the backup catcher Austin Romine. “The thing about Boonie is that he’s the manager for all 25 guys, not just the stars. And not every manager can say that.” Boone has not been perfect this postseason: He has maintained a stubborn loyalty to Gary Sanchez throughout the playoffs, even when the catcher’s struggles with the bat and behind the plate have frustrated many fans. Boone has also been unwilling to demote reliever Adam Ottavino to lower-leverage situations, even after the right-hander had lost command of his signature slider and allowed crushing hits in the series. Still, Boone has nevertheless proved to be more relatable than his predecessor, Joe Girardi, who was let go after 10 years in the job. Then again, Girardi never suffered a losing season in the Bronx, and he remains the only Yankees manager to win a World Series after the 2000 season. For all the legitimacy Boone brings to the job, he knows the only currency that matters are those championships. The Yankees’ ability to adapt to all their setbacks this year — including setting a record for the most players to go on the injured list — will most likely earn Boone votes for Manager of the Year, despite the Yankees’ wealth. No Yankees manager has won the award since Joe Torre in 1998, despite 12 division titles since then. Their performances are often dismissed with the cynical rejoinder: Who wouldn’t win with that much talent? Boone, though, is the only manager in history to win at least 100 games in each of his first two seasons — no small achievement considering he had no prior managing experience at any level. His counterparts around the majors, including Houston’s A.J. Hinch, have noticed the competence from across the way. “He’s been able to maintain the balance that’s needed to get through all the peaks and valleys,” Hinch said of Boone. “Whether it’s injuries, whether it’s a bad three-game stretch, whether it’s a blown game here or there. And he’s done a really good job of getting his guys all on the same page.” But late Friday, as the Yankees were getting ready to board a plane to Houston needing two more wins over their October rivals, Boone pointed out, “There’s a long way to go.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Linda Vista’ Review: A Womanizer Who Devastates as He Charms,"critic’s pick Tracy Letts, the author of “August: Osage County,” reinvents the midlife crisis play with a hilarity that scalds in this Steppenwolf production. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed play or musical through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The everyday poison known as toxic masculinity becomes dangerously easy to swallow in “Linda Vista,” Tracy Letts’s inspired, ruthless take on the classic midlife-crisis comedy. In the sunny opening scenes of this very funny, equally unsettling Steppenwolf Theater production — which opened on Thursday at the Hayes Theater — you’ll probably feel like cozying up to that sheepish, disheveled big guy who rules the stage with his outspoken wit. Played with immense, shaggy charm — and anger to match — by Ian Barford in a performance that reminds you of how brilliantly bruising Steppenwolf acting can be, this charismatic loser is named Wheeler. Actually, it’s Dick Wheeler, but he prefers to dispense with the first name, perhaps on the theory that it’s better not to provide too many clues to your essential nature. When we first see Wheeler, he’s moving into new digs in San Diego, with the help of his best friend, Paul (Jim True-Frost), schlepping boxes and overstuffed bags with the sloppy casualness of college boys returning to campus. Never mind that Wheeler is 50. Their conversation, too, has a sophomoric ring, as they debate the right word for big breasts, like the pair on one of Wheeler’s co-workers. And there’s a hilarious riff on their teenage crush on Ali MacGraw, who, Paul says, confessed to being a sex addict in her memoir. Is this talk too sexist for comfort? Wheeler might argue that he and Paul are just goofing (sort of), that they’re also enlightened 21st-century men who understand that some kinds of behavior regarding the opposite sex are no longer cool. You can sense that kind of self-consciousness at work when he’s talking to women. Anyway, Wheeler — a word snob who has a gift for stating home truths that nobody else dares utter — soon has the audience in the palm of his 11 ½-sized hand. And when discussing a group of possible Trump voters, he declaims, “you cannot be friends with these people,” the theater bursts into applause. Now cut to a scene early in the second act when Wheeler, on a date in a restaurant, ends a promising relationship with a brusque, simple sentence that lands like a lethal karate chop. This time, the audience gasps in something like horror. It won’t be the last time it does so. This gasp-inducing moment was exactly when I decided that Mr. Letts’s latest play, directed with astutely varied pacing and room for rage by Dexter Bullard, was going to be a lot more interesting than I had thought. Up to that point, I had worried that the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of “August: Osage County” was simply reanimating a tired literary formula. By that, I mean the tale of the clever, existentially challenged womanizer staring down the second half of his life. Traditionally, he’s a man we can’t help enjoying no matter how badly he behaves because he wallows so eloquently in his own pain. And as he keeps racking up the sexual conquests, a part of us is meant to cheer him on. My dad had shelves of novels about such men — written by Kingsley Amis, John Updike and Philip Roth. Similar types regularly stalked Broadway and the West End, in plays by dramatists as different as Simon Gray (“Butley,” “Otherwise Engaged”), Alan Ayckbourn (“The Norman Conquests”) and Neil Simon (“Jake’s Women”). Letts, for the record, has already explored this much-tilled territory in his Pulitzer-shortlisted “Man From Nebraska,” seen here in 2017 (and, like “Linda Vista,” a Second Stage presentation.) That, though, was a lyrical and oblique work that heard the abyss of nonexistence roaring within long silences. “Linda Vista” is as packed with nasty zingers as an HBO sitcom. And in the production’s first half I worried that Letts might be hoping to fill the vacuum left by the death of Simon, the lucrative master of the breezy comedy of anxiety. Before Letts swam into the mainstream with “August,” he was a master of pitch-dark comedies that measured the grisliest depths of human behavior (“Killer Joe,” “Bug”). I am happy to report that this side of him is alive and squirming in “Linda Vista.” Here are the bare bones of its familiar-sounding plot: Wheeler, in the midst of a protracted divorce and estranged from (and seemingly uninterested in) his 13-year-old son, moves into his own place, an apartment complex (as squalidly sterile as such environments can be, in Todd Rosenthal’s set, lighted without mercy by Marcus Doshi). Wheeler was once a photographer for a Chicago newspaper, but now repairs cameras in a storefront shop. He presents himself picturesquely as a born loser and is delighted when a young woman in a bar offers this quick-sketch character portrait: “Let me guess. You’re a deadbeat, work a dead-end job, married — no wait, divorced — hate your wife and kids, hate everybody, depressed, can’t get laid, your body’s breaking down, the only thing that still runs is your mouth.” Pretty accurate. Except it turns out Wheeler can get laid. There are four female characters in “Linda Vista,” and you suspect that he has either bedded, or will bed, every one of them. And that despite his failing hip and fatuous flippancy during emotional crises, he’ll always find women who want him. And oh, the pity of it. The women we meet in “Linda Vista” (and though that’s what Wheeler’s neighborhood is called, doesn’t it sound like the ultimate girlfriend?) are a diverse lot. And they are blessed with a self-preserving intelligence that always keeps them this side of social caricature. They are beautifully portrayed by Sally Murphy (as Margaret, Paul’s wife); Cora Vander Broek (Jules, a professional life coach and Margaret’s good friend); Caroline Neff (Anita, who works in the shop with Wheeler); and Chantal Thuy (Minnie, a 20-something American-Vietnamese rockabilly chick). Two of them, I should warn you, appear with Barford in stark-naked, tragicomic sex scenes that elicit the awkwardness and loneliness of human erotic congress. It feels fitting that the women outnumber the men here, who are rounded out by Wheeler’s boss, Michael (Troy West), who is so creepily sexist he makes Wheeler look saintly. And each female character, in her own way, has learned how to navigate an environment that has been polluted by misogyny. Such an attitude is atmospheric in “Linda Vista,” and it manifests in an assortment of casual cultural references: to a true crime television show (about a sex slave in a basement); comic book superhero movies; humiliation porn; and that monumental work of navel gazing, “My Struggle” by Karl Ove Knausgaard. Wheeler, it must be said, has plenty of acidic comments to make about such phenomena. Sure, he’s a perpetually randy man, but he gives great lip service to the more reasonable forms of political correctness. And though he can be lacerating to others, he’s hardest of all on himself. How could you not fall for this self-flagellating, frustrated artist, who looks, as one woman puts, it “like a turtle who doesn’t know he’s lost his shell”? But don’t make the mistake of equating vulnerability with harmlessness. The play, you see, memorably includes several gut-wrenching occasions when Barford’s Wheeler flips his appealingly grouchy persona to reveal a black hole of ugly, flailing, desperate narcissism. As it ends, he is making a passive-aggressive pitch to yet another woman, to whom he has acted as a sort of white knight. And even with us knowing what we know, he remains as charming as ever. I asked the woman with whom I saw the play if she thought Wheeler would make a conquest of this last character. “Oh, absolutely,” she responded. She sounded angry.

2019,‘Little Monsters’ Review: Zombies Hunger Down Under,"Streaming Movie Review Lupita Nyong’o saves kindergartners from zombies — and the movie from total schlock — in this wan Australian horror comedy. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. When Lupita Nyong’o tells a bunch of kindergartners, “One, two, three, eyes on me,” viewers of “Little Monsters” jolt to attention, too. The charismatic Nyong’o is easily the best part of this feeble Australian horror comedy, arriving Friday to Hulu, as Miss Caroline, a Taylor Swift-crooning, ukulele-strumming teacher who turns fierce when her class is attacked by zombies while on a field trip to a petting farm. Unfortunately, the film’s nominal lead is Dave (Alexander England), a rude, selfish would-be rocker whom the writer-director Abe Forsythe sets on a collision course with utterly predictable redemption: Crushing on a dedicated educator and battling ravenous corpses will do that to the most terminally irritating man-child. When zombies — spawned by an experiment gone wrong at a nearby American military outpost — descend on the koalas and the sheep and the kids, Dave, who tagged along as a chaperone, initially sputters. Faring even worse is Teddy McGiggle (Josh Gad), a superstar children’s entertainer who just happened to be shooting his show at Pleasant Valley Farm. While he reveals himself to be a foul-mouthed mega-jerk, he also lands the film’s single best line, so he is almost (almost) forgiven. In contrast to the hapless men, Miss Caroline never loses her cool and steadfastly dispatches the lurching attackers. By the end, she looks like Mary Poppins after a post-apocalyptic Tough Mudder race — and Nyong’o slays both registers. To Forsythe’s credit, his movie takes place in a universe where people are at least aware of pop culture’s zombie obsession: Dave’s young nephew, Felix (Diesel La Torraca), knows how to stop them, having successfully destroyed them in video games. But “Little Monsters” does not move the needle for the comic-zombie genre, which has not progressed much in the 15 years since “Shaun of the Dead” and the 10 since “Zombieland.” Little Monsters Rated R for profanity and graphic consumption of human flesh.

2019,‘Little Shop of Horrors’ Review: Jonathan Groff Feeds the Beast,"critic’s pick Michael Mayer’s revitalizing revival of this genially gruesome classic becomes a sly morality tale for the age of universal celebrity. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed play or musical through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. A certain carnivorous plant has been repotted in Hell’s Kitchen, and I am delighted to report that it’s thriving there. This hot showbiz shrub of yesteryear, which goes by the name of Audrey II, has found a new dance partner, a performer who can coax the tendril-stretching star quality out of a freakish botanical specimen. That would be Jonathan Groff, who is generating major nerd charisma in Michael Mayer’s delicious revival of “Little Shop of Horrors,” which opened Thursday at the Westside Theater/Upstairs. A bouncy, wide-eyed veteran of Broadway musicals (“Spring Awakening,” “Hamilton”), Groff has more recently found streaming celebrity as an impressionable, serial-killer-stalking F.B.I. agent in “Mindhunter” on Netflix. As Seymour, the dorky hero of “Little Shop,” the 1982 musical by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, he scents his ingratiating persona as a song-and-dance kid with a creepy whiff of rankly corruptible innocence. This Seymour — a flower shop assistant catapulted to fame as the caretaker of the man-eating Audrey II — is sweeter and scarier than earlier incarnations. As such, Groff is of a piece with a production, which also features a winningly cast Tammy Blanchard and Christian Borle, that understands that camp is most successful when it’s played with straight-faced sincerity, instead of a wink and a smirk. “Little Shop” has been around the block since it first became an Off Broadway hit, with a cast led by Lee Wilkof and the divine Ellen Greene. Inspired by Roger Corman’s gritty 1960 cult film “The Little Shop of Horrors,” the musical adaptation was itself recycled as a 1986 movie, and there are current rumors (sigh) of a cinematic remake. Onstage, the show has been a deathless favorite of high school and community theaters. And Audrey II and company made their Broadway debut in an overscale, anodyne 2003 production. There was also an emotionally resonant 2015 Encores! concert version, in which Greene re-created her original role opposite Jake Gyllenhaal. With that, I felt I was ready to say goodbye for a while to this lovable little show from my youth. Yet against expectation, Mayer’s interpretation, staged in a 270-seat theater, summons the shivery elation I felt seeing “Shop” at the East Village’s Orpheum nearly four decades earlier. It restores the show to its original scale and sensibility, reminding us of the special potency of grisly things that come in small, impeccably wrapped packages. It’s not an exact facsimile of the 1982 production, which was directed by Ashman. Working with an ace design team, Mayer heightens the show’s classic pulp elements, its aura of low-rent noir splashed with flecks of blood-red. Julian Crouch’s Skid Row set — in which sooty door stoops frame the dingy shop of the title — is an urban-legend rhapsody in grime, lighted to chill by Bradley King. It is here that Groff’s Seymour toils thanklessly as the klutzy assistant of its owner, Mushnik (an agreeably unsympathetic Tom Alan Robbins). His fellow employee, Audrey (Blanchard), is a masochistic sweetheart who is dating a sadistic dentist. (The indefatigably vivid Borle, a two-time Tony winner, makes antic hay out of this and other roles.) She is also the girl of Seymour’s dreams, and in her honor he bestows the name Audrey II on that strange and sickly plant he picked up in Chinatown during a solar eclipse. Audrey II, it turns out, has a voice, a rolling, soulful, irresistibly imperious bass provided by Kingsley Leggs, sounding like a hybrid of Chuck Berry and Barry White. And it demands that Seymour feed it with human blood. As the plant keeps growing, Seymour becomes a star by association with this outsize creature. But maintaining fame requires sacrifice, and human sacrifice, at that. Ashman (book and lyrics) and Menken (music) — who would go on to collaborate on beloved scores for animated Disney musicals like “The Little Mermaid” — had the felicitous idea of setting this story to the cadences and close harmonies of Brill Building-style pop. The plot here is annotated by a Greek chorus of street Urchins. (Will Van Dyke is the deft arranger and orchestrator.) Their stylistic provenance is indicated by their names: Ronnette, Crystal and Chiffon, the smartly synchronized yet spikily individualistic team of Ari Groover, Salome Smith and Joy Woods. (One caveat: the band-heavy sound balance sometimes makes their witty lyrics incomprehensible.) Blanchard’s singing voice tends to leap gung-ho onto notes, like an anxious but enthusiastic sky diver who never knows where she might land. This turns out to perfectly match her confidence-challenged character, whose past is checkered with abusive Mr. Wrongs. (The actress’s conviction enhances our discomfort at seeing Audrey show up at work bruised and battered from her love life, a visual joke that now registers uneasily.) Wearing bandage-tight, cleavage-framing dresses (Tom Broecker did the spot on costumes) and striking gracefully ungainly poses of distress, this Audrey brings to mind those imperiled dames on the covers of vintage crime paperbacks. In contrast, the bespectacled, schlubby Seymour is nearly invisible when we first meet him. But like Audrey II — whose ever-larger, ever-hungrier incarnations are embodied by Nicholas Mahon’s fab puppets — Seymour continues to grow in presence. Watch the expression on Groff’s face as he sidles across the stage, cradling an early, snapping hand puppet version of his truest soul mate, which tries to nibble on the front row. Attention is new to Seymour; he likes it. And when, surrounded by frisky Urchins, he does an involuntary hip bump, his face glows with a subtle, gratified surprise. “Hey, this feels good,” he seems to be saying. And without ever entirely abandoning Seymour’s initial deadpan mien or milquetoast voice, Groff charts a precise evolution of a man becoming drunk on the prospect of world renown. Which, this being a musical comedy, happily parallels a performer unbending into the liberation of good old, show-off showbiz. The Corman film of “Shop” was, like many horror and sci-fi flicks of the Eisenhower years, a fable of the atomic age, playing to a nation’s fears of science run amok. This triumphantly revitalized musical has its own sly message for an era in which celebrity is regarded as a constitutional right: Embrace fame at your peril. It’s a killer.

2019,‘Low Tide’ Review: Jersey Boys to Jersey Men,"A long summer on the New Jersey shore swerves disappointingly from coming-of-age drama to implausible crime caper. In the small beach town on the New Jersey shore where “Low Tide” plays out, there’s not much for teenage boys to do except loiter at the fairground and pick fights with the summer visitors whose money is both needed and resented. From time to time, Alan (Keean Johnson) and his friends Red (Alex Neustaedter) and Smitty (Daniel Zolghadri) break into vacation homes and steal what they can. Yet we get the sense that these amateur raids are conducted as much to alleviate boredom as provide pocket money. The laid-back sheriff (Shea Whigham) is on to them, but is most concerned about the volatile Red — the kind of kid whose rough, menacing glamour goes quickly to seed. Red’s flares of rage are already alienating his friends, especially Alan, whose attention has strayed to a cute vacationer (Kristine Froseth). Even so, he agrees to participate in a final burglary, reluctantly conscripting his younger, smarter brother (Jaeden Martell) as a lookout. What happens next will yank the film from observant coming-of-age drama to trite crime caper — a disappointing swerve into snitching, double-crossing and discordant violence. Claiming no specific time period, but with a vaguely nostalgic, late 1980s mood, “Low Tide” shows childhood friendships unraveling as characters mature and perceptions shift. Andrew Ellmaker’s soft, beach-and-boardwalk images are perfectly in sync with Brooke and Will Blair’s fully integrated score. Yet McMullin’s implausible script, which relies on buried treasure and an unconvincing personality switch, never comes close to matching the talents of the young actors charged with bringing it to life. Low Tide Rated R for a fired gun and a weaponized baseball bat. Running time: 1 hour 24 minutes.",The New York Times
2019,‘Lucky Day’ Review: A Revenge Film That Won’t Grow Up,"Roger Avary’s new movie doesn’t add up to much more than scenes of breathtaking violence sprinkled with tasteless sexual humor. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “Lucky Day,” directed by Roger Avary, begins in a prison cell, but rather than hearing from the bearded fellow in that cell, the voice-over is of a young girl. She’s Beatrice, daughter of prisoner Red, bemoaning the fact that her dad has missed two years of her growth. Red (an undistinguished Luke Bracey), a safecracker, leaves prison and is reunited with his quirky family, including his conspicuously cutesy conceptual-artist wife, Chloe; daughter Beatrice; and their housekeeper, who’s been working for free in exchange for French lessons. Like Avary’s directorial debut, 1993’s “Killing Zoe,” this movie has a thing for Frenchness, including a hit man, Luc, played by Crispin Glover, who speaks with an outrageous accent and wants Red dead to avenge his own departed frère. Most of the other plot points of the picture are just as tired as this one. Indeed, this is a bloody crime film that could have been made in the mid-1990s, as a Quentin Tarantino homage. (Avary was once a key collaborator of that filmmaker — he co-wrote the screenplay to “Pulp Fiction.”) Luc’s relentless pursuit of Red is raucously violent and ostentatiously grotesque. For reasons perhaps explicable only to himself, Avary adds touches of magic realism to the mix. These include a dancing headless corpse and a child who can make herself disappear. Such flourishes might have added up to something more amusing had Luc’s rape and murder of a black woman not also been played for a laugh. (The film portrays her as enjoying the sex, too.) If you’re one of those people who believes the Tarantino of today still needs to “grow up,” this movie will provide an oblique but vivid insight into how much worse things might have been.

2019,"‘Lucy in the Sky’ Review: Bad Romance, Astronaut Edition","A story that captured the public imagination (it’s the one with the diapers) makes for a messy movie. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. It’s hard to know why anyone thought “Lucy in the Sky,” a drama about an astronaut’s fall, would make a good movie. Was it the appeal of outer space, with its beauties, mysteries and infinite possibilities? Or was it the faintly exotic if rather basic romance that blows up so many lives? Was it the diapers? Inspired by real events, as movies like to say, “Lucy” selectively draws on the bleak story of Capt. Lisa M. Nowak, an astronaut who earned national notoriety in 2007 when she was arrested after attacking Colleen Shipman, an Air Force captain she saw as a romantic rival. Nowak was charged on several counts, including attempted kidnapping; later, she was charged with attempted murder. It was wild and weird. She had gone full-on Jason Bourne for the attack, dressed in a wig and a trench coat, and armed with a BB gun, a steel mallet and a buck knife. But all that anyone cared about were the diapers she said she wore on a long, futile drive the night of the assault. Some of this makes it into “Lucy in the Sky,” which takes curious liberties (no diapers) with the real story to not much point. Its main draws are Natalie Portman, who plays a sympathetic variation on Nowak called Lucy Cola; and Jon Hamm as her swaggering heartbreaker, Mark Goodwin, another astronaut. In their shared and individual scenes, these nicely synced performers create an emotional and psychological foundation for the story that holds your attention even as the rest of the movie collapses around them. It’s a dispiriting mess and waste of talent, sunk by a lack of focus, misguided choices and insistently unproductive, at times incoherent clashing tones. Directed by Noah Hawley, who shares script credit with Brian C Brown and Elliott DiGuiseppi, the movie tracks Lucy from her greatest triumph to her desperate breakdown, all while toggling between outer and inner space. She’s soaring when you first see her, tethered to a shuttle high above the Earth. (A mission specialist, Nowak flew on Space Shuttle Discovery in 2006.) Enveloped by the immensity that folds her in its arms, Lucy looks small and vulnerable. But she’s ecstatic. Flooded with light and complicated feelings that she never manages to articulate, she brings to mind a saint in religious reverie, her eyes and smile as shining, bright and wide as the world. She soon falls to Earth, of course. Reality is a bummer, and so is her dreary life. With its winter browns and crepuscular lighting, her house couldn’t be more uninviting; with his smiles and smothering love, her husband, Drew (Dan Stevens), couldn’t be more absurd. He’s kind and dull, a beatific cipher in a mustache who seems closely modeled on Ned Flanders, the maddeningly decent, cheery neighbor on “The Simpsons.” It’s almost a surprise that Drew doesn’t say “Hi-Diddly-Ho!” at the breakfast table; it’s entirely unsurprising when the lost, drifting Lucy romantically fixes on Mark, a hotshot who seems to take his lifestyle cues from 1960s-era Playboy and soon starts eyeballing another (Zazie Beetz). Hawley throws a lot at the screen, including a gun, a distraction (Pearl Amanda Dickson), a little piquant showboating (from Ellen Burstyn as Lucy’s grandmother) and some reductive ideas about women and power. He tries hard to obscure that this is little more than a sad, small story about a mental health crisis. Mostly, though, he keeps shifting from serious to satirical while restlessly toying with the visuals. In a misguided bid at Expressionism, he dramatically shrinks and expands the aspect ratio, pulling it like taffy, and blurs the inner edges of the frame. All this shape-shifting is mildly diverting at first, but what initially looks like aesthetic adventurousness soon registers as confusion, suggesting that he is finally as unmoored as his heroine. Lucy in the Sky Rated R for a gun, language and attempted crime. Running time: 2 hours 4 minutes.

2019,‘Magical Chemistry’ Quick-Brewed in a Coffee Shop,"Mini-Vows Michelle Angulo and Staff Sgt. Maxamillian Alexander Dutton were married Oct. 2 at Waterfront Park in Alexandria, Va. The Rev. Jeffrey L. Maszal, a United Church of Christ minister, officiated. The bride, 29, is a foreign service officer at the State Department in Washington. She is serving at the United States Embassy in Cairo. She graduated from the University of Chicago and received a master’s degree in law and diplomacy from Tufts. She also received a master’s degree in refugee and forced migration Studies from the University of Oxford, England. She is a daughter of Doris Angulo and Jose Angulo of East Stroudsburg, Pa. The groom, 26, is a staff sergeant in charge of the Marine Corps Base Ceremonial Platoon in Quantico, Va, where, on Oct. 1, he received a Navy Commendation Medal. He joined the Marine Corps Band as a drummer upon high school graduation and in January 2020 is to become a Marine recruiter in South Florida. He is a son of Colleen A. Hamlet and Keith D. Dutton of Philadelphia. The couple met in a small coffee shop in Arlington, Va., in August 2018. She had just finished foreign service duty in Shanghai and was on her way back to the State Department in Washington to study the Arabic language in advance of her next assignment, in Cairo. He was then a color sergeant for the Marines, and already stationed in Quantico. Both were sitting alone when he walked over to her table and complimented her hair style. She looked up. “He was so handsome, it was love at first sight,” she said. “We just had an immediate and magical chemistry together.” They were soon involved in a whirlwind romance, and within a month, Sergeant Dutton, who lived in Woodbridge, Va., moved in to Ms. Angulo’s apartment in Arlington. “She was this small person who spoke to me as if she were 10 feet tall,” he said. “She just had this high level of confidence and an incredible amount of energy that created a kind of aura about her.” They lived together for one year before their careers pulled them in different directions, Ms. Angulo to Cairo, and Sergeant Dutton to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to begin recruitment training for the Marines. “I grew up in a rough life in Philadelphia,” Sergeant Dutton said. “But in the short time that Michelle and I have been together, she has taught me how to be a kinder and more thoughtful person. She has been my best friend.” During a long-distance romance that ensued, “there wasn’t a day that went by when we didn’t talk to each other,” Ms. Angulo said. “Throughout the entire time, Max remained my biggest cheerleader, and the most loyal, genuine and considerate person I have ever met, and our inevitable separation has only strengthened our love for one another.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘Maleficent: Mistress of Evil’ Review: Sleep, Sleep, My Lovelies","Angelina Jolie returns as the powerful, dangerous fairy in this tame, disappointing follow-up to the 2014 revisionist hit. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The happily ever after delivered by Disney’s “Maleficent” has vanished like a puff of bilious smoke, as its unhappy, reactionary sequel makes depressingly clear. Released in 2014, the first movie is a satisfying rethink of “Sleeping Beauty” — both Disney’s and Charles Perrault’s — that showed how intelligent intervention could upend centuries of oppressive ideas about women. In its revisionist take, the titular dark, dangerous fairy played by Angelina Jolie isn’t naturally evil or merely spiteful in bestowing a curse, but exerting her power with a vengeance. Played by Jolie with slinky verve, voluminous wings and two magnificently crowning horns, Maleficent is the earlier movie’s greatest special effect. She’s also its most inspired disruptive stroke, having been wronged once upon a time by a suitor, the type who usually bails damsels out of distress. Instead, he secures the throne by seducing and drugging Maleficent, and then clipping her wings, a startling metaphor of violation. The most bracing thing about the original “Maleficent,” though, is that it shifts the narrative weight from the love between a sleeping princess and a rescuing prince to that between the princess and her fairy godmother. Maleficent is back and so is Jolie, who, with her augmented cheekbones and perfectly calibrated hauteur, remains the only reason to bother with it. Much else has changed and not for the better, whatever this hash insists. At the end of the last installment, Maleficent enthroned her adored surrogate daughter, Aurora (Elle Fanning) — who had grown up to become the cursed and liberated beauty — and given her the Moors, a computer-generated peaceable and enchanted wonderland. Aurora rules benevolently from her flower throne, smiling over a menagerie of flowery, floofy and leathery creatures great and small, cutesy and stately. The sequel’s problems are tipped by its title, “Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,” which sounds as if our great horned one had landed a gig as a dominatrix. More worryingly, it suggests that, contrary to what you learned last time, Maleficent is, yes, very bad, a gambit that’s presumably meant to keep new viewers guessing about her character. But if she is evil, as this sequel promises, it makes you wonder about all the other dismal, stubbornly enduring clichés that the first movie jettisoned, specifically that reliably sexist duo: the wicked female usurper whose power inherently challenges ye olde patriarchy and the innocent maiden who needs a prince to rescue her. You don’t wait long to be disappointed. Generic from start to finish, the sequel was directed by Joachim Roenning, whose credits include the forgettable sea adventure “Kon-Tiki” (I had to look it up, and I reviewed it), which is probably what got him the job heading up the most recent “Pirates of the Caribbean” installment. It made a mint and that may explain why he was tapped for “Mistress of Evil,” though he does little but move stuff around, leaving the heavy lifting to Jolie and armies of special-effects workers. (The writers are Linda Woolverton, who wrote the original movie — and whose voice is scarcely heard — Noah Harpster and Micah Fitzerman-Blue.) If “Mistress of Evil” had any of its predecessor’s flashes of self-aware humor, embellished beauty or basic filmmaking intelligence, it might be easier to take or at least ignore. But it’s a clotted mess. It’s also dispiriting because it has traded a fairy tale about female solidarity for a war movie about what happens when women assume power. It opens with a bent knee and ends with an ever-after kiss, but much of the rest is a convoluted brawl filled with noise and computer minions who are tossed like darts. At center is a grasping, malignant queen (Michelle Pfeiffer), the very stereotype that the first movie rejected. She even comes with an awful mini-me (Jenn Murray). Female villains have long been useful scapegoats, repositories for social and cultural anxieties about men, women and power. The original “Maleficent” pushes against that stereotype with a protagonist who’s at once hero and villain, which means that she’s finally neither. Much like “Frozen,” it insists that women can be complex and that even a princess doesn’t need a prince to justify her life. Women can work together, love one another, find their own way. In 2014, when Maleficent — rather than the prince — delivered the kiss that roused Aurora, it felt like an awakening. This new flick doesn’t just feel like a retreat, it also feels like a poisoned, candied invitation to sleep. Maleficent: Mistress of Evil Rated PG for bloodless war violence.

2019,‘Maleficent’ Sequel Disappoints at Box Office,"While Disney’s “Maleficent: Mistress of Evil” led in ticket sales, its earnings didn’t do much to offset its considerable costs. Though Disney’s fantasy sequel “Maleficent: Mistress of Evil” claimed the top spot at the box office this weekend, it fell below expectations. Initially projected to make close to $45 million domestically, the movie instead opened to an estimated $36 million in domestic ticket sales Friday through Sunday. It brought in an additional $117 million overseas, according to the studio. These figures did relatively little to offset the movie’s hefty price tag, however: It cost roughly $185 million to produce and at least $100 million to market worldwide. The original “Maleficent” was a rethink of the fairy tale “Sleeping Beauty,” from which the titular character, played by Angelina Jolie, was plucked. The sequel, set several years later, revolves around a war between fairy creatures and humans, also featuring Elle Fanning, Michelle Pfeiffer and Chiwetel Ejiofor. The opening-weekend misfire calls into question both the star power of Jolie — who has been largely absent from screens since the 2014 original — and the risky decision of Disney to release a sequel this long after that first movie, which opened to around $69.4 million in domestic ticket sales during its first weekend. Plus, reviews for “Maleficent: Mistress of Evil” were generally weak: It currently holds a 41 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. [Read our critic’s review of “Maleficent: Mistress of Evil”.] So while the new “Maleficent” led ticket sales, it was a different sequel that had this weekend’s most applause-worthy start. “Zombieland 2: Double Tap,” from Sony Pictures, opened to around $26.7 million in domestic ticket sales, coming in ahead of both the studio’s projection ($23 million) and the original “Zombieland,” which sold about $24.7 million in tickets during its opening weekend in 2009. The sequel cost $42 million to make. “Zombieland 2: Double Tap” is the sequel to the 2009 horror spoof “Zombieland.” The original movies’s zombie-slaying stars — Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, Jesse Eisenberg and Abigail Breslin — return in the sequel to fight for survival in a post-apocalyptic world. They do so alongside a handful of newcomers, played by Rosario Dawson, Luke Wilson and Avan Jogia, to name a few. “Zombieland 2: Double Tap” received lukewarm reviews, with a current Rotten Tomatoes score of 68. The movie landed in third place overall, behind Warner Bros.’s “Joker.” That supervillain character study, which has been in theaters since the beginning of the month, sold $29.2 million in tickets this weekend and landed in second place. Fourth place at this weekend’s box office went to “The Addams Family,” an animated family movie based on the macabre comics. It brought in around $16 million according to Comscore, which compiles box office data. That movie, distributed in the United States by United Artists Releasing, was in its second weekend in theaters. In fifth place was Paramount’s Will Smith vehicle “Gemini Man,” also in its second weekend, which sold an additional $8.5 million in tickets.",The New York Times
2019,‘Mary’ Review: Death and the Maiden (Voyage),"Recycled scares and a slew of visual clichés trap Emily Mortimer and Gary Oldman in this standard-issue possession tale. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. In Michael Goi’s watery ghost story, “Mary,” the British actors Emily Mortimer and Gary Oldman are dumped on a haunted sailboat, saddled with American accents and subjected to a series of recycled, yawn-inducing scares. Not helping matters is a tension-sucking script (by Anthony Jaswinski) that reveals almost immediately who among the tiny cast will survive to see the end credits. Flashbacks fill in the blanks as a bedraggled Sarah (Mortimer) is found floating on what remains of the vessel and is interrogated by a suspicious police detective (Jennifer Esposito) on what happened to her family and crew. It’s a tale of supernatural shenanigans undergirded by a shaky marriage, beginning when Sarah’s husband (Oldman), tired of being a captain-for-hire, impulsively buys the mysteriously abandoned boat to start his own charter business. Though maybe a trip through the Bermuda Triangle wasn’t the best idea for a maiden voyage. Narrative ellipses and a slew of visual clichés — like vague shapes, ghostly footprints and disorienting flashes of light — make “Mary” (the name shared by the ship and the couple’s younger daughter) a particularly unsatisfying possession yarn. Records of the ship’s deadly history, inexplicably overlooked during its extensive refurbishment, show up too late to matter. Standard-issue nightmares, an imaginary friend and flares of violence dog the sailors as an evil entity gets down to business, starting, of course, with the lowliest supporting character before working its way upward. With few places to hide and nowhere to go except down, a boat can be an ideal stage for terror. (Look no further than Phillip Noyce’s deliciously nasty 1989 thriller, “Dead Calm.”) Instead of a floating hell, however, this Mary feels more like a barnacle-encrusted prison. Mary Rated R.

2019,‘Medicare for All’: Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg Clash at Debate,"Pete Buttigieg directly criticized Elizabeth Warren over health care at Tuesday night’s debate, saying that she had not been forthcoming about whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to help finance “Medicare for all.” Ms. Warren, the Massachusetts senator, was asked if she would raise taxes on the middle class, and she responded by focusing on the costs that middle-class families would face. “I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families,” she said. Mr. Buttigieg, who last month called Ms. Warren “extremely evasive” on the issue, criticized Ms. Warren for not directly answering the question. “We heard it tonight,” Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., said. “A yes-or-no question that didn’t get a yes-or-no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this.” The two candidates went on to argue over the merits of their preferred approaches on health care. Mr. Buttigieg favors what he calls “Medicare for all who want it,” and Ms. Warren took issue with that concept. “Understand what that really means: It’s ‘Medicare for all who can afford it,’” she said. Ms. Warren favors abolishing private health insurance, and Mr. Buttigieg questioned why she wanted to “obliterate” private health plans. “Why unnecessarily divide this country over health care when there’s a better way to deliver coverage for all?” he asked. Mr. Buttigieg’s campaign continued pressing the issue after the exchange onstage, sending an email to reporters with the subject line: “FACT CHECK: Elizabeth Warren Just Dodged Questions on Middle Class Taxes Again.” Ms. Warren has repeatedly faced questions about how she would pay for Medicare for all. In particular, she has consistently declined to specify whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to help finance such a system. Instead, Ms. Warren has tried to reframe the issue around the total costs that families would face under Medicare for all. She has said that costs would increase for the wealthy and for big corporations, but they would go down for middle-class families — an explanation she repeated on the debate stage on Tuesday night. She has also said “I’m with Bernie on Medicare for all,” referring to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has championed single-payer health care. But unlike Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders has provided a direct answer to the question of whether taxes on the middle class would rise. “Yes, they will pay more in taxes, but less in health care for what they get,” he said in the first series of primary debates, in June. At the debate on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders offered a similar acknowledgment that taxes would go up. “For virtually everybody,” he said, “the tax increase they pay will be substantially less — substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.” Mr. Buttigieg found that response to be an improvement over Ms. Warren’s. “Well, at least that’s a straightforward answer,” he said, “but there’s a better way.”",The New York Times

2019,‘Mike’s Candyshop’: Behind the Overdose Death of HQ Trivia’s Colin Kroll,"Six men were charged with running a cocaine-and-heroin delivery operation that was linked to the tech executive’s death in December. When police officers entered Colin Kroll’s apartment in SoHo last December, they found the 34-year-old tech entrepreneur known for grinding out 100-hour work weeks, facedown on his bed. Nearby were the telltale signs of drug use: empty vials, glassine envelopes and a powdery mixture. Later, officials confirmed what seemed apparent: Mr. Kroll had accidentally overdosed on a lethal mixture of, among other things, heroin, cocaine and fentanyl. At the scene, the indictment said, officers found something unusual. On Mr. Kroll’s phone were a series of recent text messages requesting, of all things, a “shirt” and a “book.” The number Mr. Kroll was messaging would eventually lead law enforcement agencies to a drug-delivery operation that ran like a food delivery app. On Wednesday, six men accused of running the operation were arrested and charged with conspiring to distribute heroin and cocaine. If convicted, each could face a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison, federal officials said. The drug operation — which went by the official-sounding name Mike’s Candyshop — took orders electronically from “approved customers” via text message, according to an indictment from the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan. And buyers were even kept up-to-date about the status and location of the couriers carrying the drugs, officials said. The members of the ring worked in shifts, usually from 6 p.m. to midnight. They worked seven days a week, but took off on major holidays, like Thanksgiving, New Year’s Eve and Labor Day. They had defined roles, like the operator who took orders and arranged deliveries; couriers who took the orders into the field, and relayed their whereabouts to the operator, who kept customers updated; and a manager, who oversaw the day-to-day logistics, supplies and cash flow. Customers ordered drugs “with the same convenience as if they were ordering a pizza,” Peter C. Fitzhugh, the special agent in charge of the New York Field Office of Homeland Security Investigations, said in a statement. Federal officials appeared to have tracked the drug ring since the death of Mr. Kroll. An indictment unsealed this week did not name Mr. Kroll. But an official with knowledge of the case said a drug overdose victim identified as Victim-1 in the document was the tech executive, who was discovered in his Manhattan apartment on December 16. After Mr. Kroll’s death, the Candyshop changed its phone number, twice, to avoid detection by law enforcement, officials said. But it did not change its business. Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said that although “they realized the potency of the drugs they were distributing and selling, the defendants continued to sell their poison.” After Mr. Kroll’s death, the New York Police Department linked up with the New York Field Office of Homeland Security Investigations, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan, according to a person with knowledge of the investigation. The leader of the ring, officials said, was Ariel Tavarez, 38, of Pennsylvania, who often acted as the operator, taking orders and arranging couriers. Christian Baez, 33, Luis Meson, 31, Kevin Grullon, 25 and Joiffrey Urena, 27 — all of Manhattan — worked as the couriers, and Gregoris Martinez, 34, managed the day-to-day drug supply and cash, officials said. Lawyers for Mr. Baez, Mr. Martinez and Mr. Urena declined to comment. Lawyers for the other men did not respond to messages seeking comment. As for Mr. Kroll, he had been a fixture in the tech start-up scene. He rose to prominence as one of the co-founders of the popular short-video app, Vine, which was later acquired by Twitter. He later admitted that he was let go from Twitter shortly afterward for “poor management.” He had also been accused of inappropriate behavior in the workplace toward women. He said he had never sexually harassed anyone. But Mr. Kroll rebounded, and found success when he helped to create another popular app, HQ Trivia, which live-streams 15-minute trivia shows typically twice a day to tens of thousands of mobile users. Mr. Kroll’s father, Alan, said last year after his son’s death that he was proud of him but had warned him about working to excess. “He worked too many hours and too hard. I think New York City got to him a little bit,” the elder Mr. Kroll said, adding, “All of that leads to getting too much drugs or bad drugs and overdosing.” “It truly is a waste,” he continued. “At 34, imagine the things he’d done and the skills he had. It would have been really fun to watch him at 50.” William Rashbaum contributed reporting.",The New York Times

2019,‘Mr. Robot’ Season 4 Premiere Recap: E for Vendetta,"Mr. Robot The final season premiere opened with a bang — and was a return to form after some strange misfires last season. It starts with the death of a main character. It seems, at first, to end with the death of the main character. In between, it plays out like an eerie paranoid thriller against a backdrop of international corruption and capitalism run amok. Written and directed by the series’s creator, Sam Esmail, the fourth and final season premiere of “Mr. Robot” plays to all the show’s strengths and none of its weaknesses. While it’s good to have the show return, it’s worth noting that this is also a return to form after the strange misfires of the Season 3 finale. That episode, in which the hacker Elliot Alderson (Rami Malek) undid the “5/9” hack that wiped millions of credit records clean and accidentally unleashed a tide of chaos and violence, appeared to be an act of creative retrenchment for a show that has historically been at its best when it pushed the narrative envelope. How can you trust a show about revolution when the revolutionary wants to pull the plug? With vows of vengeance, that’s how. This episode opens with one such declaration of vendetta. Angela Moss (Portia Doubleday) tells Phillip Price (Michael Cristofer), the chief executive of the global conglomerate E Corp — and, she has just learned, her father — that she will stop at nothing to get “retribution” against the architect of the terrorist bombings for which she was an unwitting cat’s paw. That architect is Whiterose (B.D. Wong), the trans woman general of the violent hacker collective called the Dark Army — and, under her male-presenting secret identity, a powerful minister in the Chinese government. Unfortunately for Angela, Price is wearing a wire, so her threats are piped directly to her intended target. Watching the two realize that Angela has signed her own death warrant is some of the show’s most emotionally affecting work; Doubleday plays Angela as raw but resigned, while Cristofer’s Price visibly, almost physically struggles to keep himself together as assassins appear to snuff out his daughter’s life. With the ruthless Dark Army lurking around every corner, every subsequent sequence plays out like a matter of life and death, because all of them are. In the first, Elliot and his alternate personality, Mr. Robot (Christian Slater), blackmail the low-rent lawyer and pedophile Freddy Lomax (an impressively sleazy and sweaty Jake Busey, appearing as a guest star) into a meet-up in Grand Central Station. Lomax is the signatory for many of Whiterose’s shell companies; by searching through his files, Elliot discovers the bank where his enemy’s cash is stored. His next move is simple enough: Steal the money, win the war. But there’s no place for Lomax in this plan, and the shady lawyer quickly realizes that his blackmailer has no exit strategy in place for him. Dreading both exposure of his crimes and what might happen if the Dark Army got its hands on him, he commits suicide by shooting himself on the crowded streets of New York City at Christmastime — but not before providing Elliot with a name and address for his Dark Army contact. We then briefly catch up with the other players in Mr. Robot and Whiterose’s great game. Once the prime suspect in the 5/9 hack, the E Corp chief technology officer, Tyrell Wellick, (Martin Wallstrom) is now hailed as a hero, credited with undoing the hack and masterminding a loan program involving the company’s proprietary “ECoin” currency. Having witnessed the ax murder of her crooked boss last season, the F.B.I. agent Dom DiPierro (Grace Gummer) is holed up in her childhood bedroom, where her paranoia about the Dark Army has grown so severe that she pulls a gun on an innocent plumber. (When the woman whom her mom tries to set her up with later in the episode proves to be a Dark Army operative, Dom’s paranoia looks a little more reasonable.) Finally, Elliot’s sister and comrade-in-hacking, Darlene (Carly Chaikin), has developed a serious cocaine habit, which feeds into her conviction that Angela is still alive. Elliot, who has been sent pictures of Angela’s corpse, won’t use them to shake Darlene out of her delusions because he fears they’ll “break her heart.” In his own hunger for revenge against Whiterose, however, Elliot falls for a whopper himself. The contact provided to him by Lomax was bogus, and his obviously uninhabited apartment is a trap that leads Elliot directly into the hands of the enemy. These men in black drag him kicking and screaming right past the apartment building’s complicit doorman, who eats Fruity Pebbles cereal and listens to Bobby McFerrin’s “Don’t Worry, Be Happy” as if nothing were wrong. Forced back to his own apartment, Elliot is held in place as an agent (played by Sam Esmail) spikes his vein with a fatal overdose of heroin. As Elliot struggles to reach his phone to call for help, he sees a vision of his father (a.k.a. Mr. Robot), his abusive mother and himself as a child, all of whom are preparing to fade from existence along with the mind that has conjured them up. Elliot dies. Cut to black. And cut right back, as the agents return and revive Elliot with naloxone. We then learn that they’re not with the Dark Army at all: They work for Phillip Price, who appears to want Elliot to join his quest to defeat Whiterose. Finally, something everyone can agree on. Despite its abundance of plot, the episode moves with a taut and sinuous rhythm. Esmail knows how to block, shoot and cut scenes for maximum audience unease, with his unusual habit of “shortsighting” characters by placing them in the extreme lower corners of the frame being foremost among his techniques. He has an eye for bursts of lurid color, like the reds of the DiPierro’s Christmas decorations and those Fruity Pebbles. And by killing off Angela, one of the series’s main characters since the start, in the very first scene, he makes Elliot’s “death” that much easier to believe. Yes, I was bamboozled into thinking Esmail was killing off his Academy Award-winning leading man in the season premiere, and I’m not ashamed to say it. All of this played out against a steady drumbeat of grim news from the real world, lending added oomph to the thrills and chills onscreen. Like the song says, just because you’re paranoid don’t mean they’re not after you. Random Data: Joining the cereal-eating attendant in that apartment lobby is some guy loudly conducting a FaceTime phone call in a foreign language — with one exception. When Elliot tells the doorman which room he would like to visit, the guy clearly says “Pied Piper.” It’s a creepy, almost subliminal detail that gets more unnerving the more you think about it. Pour one out for Doubleday, whose eyes would have conveyed the way her character had been hollowed out by grief and guilt even if she hadn’t said a word.

2019,‘Mr. Robot’ Season 4 Premiere Recap: E for Vendetta,"Mr. Robot The final season premiere opened with a bang — and was a return to form after some strange misfires last season. It starts with the death of a main character. It seems, at first, to end with the death of the main character. In between, it plays out like an eerie paranoid thriller against a backdrop of international corruption and capitalism run amok. Written and directed by the series’s creator, Sam Esmail, the fourth and final season premiere of “Mr. Robot” plays to all the show’s strengths and none of its weaknesses. While it’s good to have the show return, it’s worth noting that this is also a return to form after the strange misfires of the Season 3 finale. That episode, in which the hacker Elliot Alderson (Rami Malek) undid the “5/9” hack that wiped millions of credit records clean and accidentally unleashed a tide of chaos and violence, appeared to be an act of creative retrenchment for a show that has historically been at its best when it pushed the narrative envelope. How can you trust a show about revolution when the revolutionary wants to pull the plug? With vows of vengeance, that’s how. This episode opens with one such declaration of vendetta. Angela Moss (Portia Doubleday) tells Phillip Price (Michael Cristofer), the chief executive of the global conglomerate E Corp — and, she has just learned, her father — that she will stop at nothing to get “retribution” against the architect of the terrorist bombings for which she was an unwitting cat’s paw. That architect is Whiterose (B.D. Wong), the trans woman general of the violent hacker collective called the Dark Army — and, under her male-presenting secret identity, a powerful minister in the Chinese government. Unfortunately for Angela, Price is wearing a wire, so her threats are piped directly to her intended target. Watching the two realize that Angela has signed her own death warrant is some of the show’s most emotionally affecting work; Doubleday plays Angela as raw but resigned, while Cristofer’s Price visibly, almost physically struggles to keep himself together as assassins appear to snuff out his daughter’s life. With the ruthless Dark Army lurking around every corner, every subsequent sequence plays out like a matter of life and death, because all of them are. In the first, Elliot and his alternate personality, Mr. Robot (Christian Slater), blackmail the low-rent lawyer and pedophile Freddy Lomax (an impressively sleazy and sweaty Jake Busey, appearing as a guest star) into a meet-up in Grand Central Station. Lomax is the signatory for many of Whiterose’s shell companies; by searching through his files, Elliot discovers the bank where his enemy’s cash is stored. His next move is simple enough: Steal the money, win the war. But there’s no place for Lomax in this plan, and the shady lawyer quickly realizes that his blackmailer has no exit strategy in place for him. Dreading both exposure of his crimes and what might happen if the Dark Army got its hands on him, he commits suicide by shooting himself on the crowded streets of New York City at Christmastime — but not before providing Elliot with a name and address for his Dark Army contact. We then briefly catch up with the other players in Mr. Robot and Whiterose’s great game.

2019,"‘Mr. Robot’ Season 4, Episode 2 Recap: Deus Ex Machina","Mr. Robot Elliot and Mr. Robot get a lesson about who’s really running the show. “There’s a powerful group of people out there that are secretly running the world. I’m talking about the guys no one knows about. The guys that are invisible. The top 1 percent of the top 1 percent. The guys that play God without permission.” In the very first episode of “Mr. Robot,” the brilliant hacker Elliot Alderson described his quarry in memorable terms. Only now, in the series’s final season, does it appear he’s truly on their trail — and in their cross-hairs. In the latest installment of Sam Esmail’s techno-thriller, Elliot and his alternate personality Mr. Robot (modeled after his father; that’s important, as we’ll soon see) hold a meeting in their secret base with one of those guys: Phillip Price. The figurehead chief executive of the giant conglomerate E Corp, Price has just saved Elliot’s life after Elliot fell into a trap set by the nefarious hacker-terrorist collective the Dark Army. Now he’s ready to tell Elliot whom he’s really up against. Over a dazzling montage of real-world news footage and shiny happy stock advertising imagery, Price tells Elliot and Mr. Robot the story of the real guys behind the guys behind the guys: the Deus Group. Founded after the fall of the Berlin Wall by the ambitious Chinese bureaucrat Zhi Zhang — better known by her hacker alias, Whiterose — this elite organization took advantage of the collapse of Communism by putting the whole world up for sale. The first gulf war, the internet, the rise of authoritarianism, the depredations of late capitalism — all of it was the Deus Group’s doing. What Deus members like Price didn’t realize until it was too late is that it was all a means to an end. Every world-shaking event and paradigm shift brought Whiterose one step closer to the fruition of her secret billion-dollar project beneath the nuclear power plant in Washington Township, where Elliot and his family used to live. Now that project, whatever it may be, is being packed up and shipped off to Chinese-controlled Congo. After that, patsies and flunkies like Price and Elliot are superfluous to Whiterose’s needs. In other words, they’re dead men walking. It’s a lot to digest, even for a conspiratorially minded audience. Fortunately, it’s also entertaining to digest, thanks to Esmail’s flair for striking imagery. His news footage montage seamlessly splices B.D. Wong’s character, Zhang, into meetings with everyone from Fidel Castro to Vladimir Putin to the Queen of England, “Forrest Gump” style. And when the scene cuts back to Price, Elliot and Mr. Robot, the contrast between Whiterose’s world of power and influence and their own shabby surroundings — they’re holed up in the shuttered offices of Elliot’s former cybersecurity employer, staring at Post-it notes with names and clues written on them as the sun filters in through dingy windows — is striking. It communicates just how outclassed Elliot is against these godlike opponents. He’s not the only badly overmatched character in the episode. The F.B.I. agent Dom DiPierro dutifully follows the orders of the Dark Army operatives threatening her family and outs her slain supervisor, Agent Santiago, as a double agent — for a drug cartel, rather than for his true employer, the Dark Army. But because she is unable to say for certain whether the agent investigating the case believed her cover story, the Dark Army takes matters into its own hands and tosses him from a building, making it look like a suicide. In a show with no shortage of bottomed-out, depressive performances, Grace Gummer is a standout as Agent DiPierro. She looks completely, utterly exhausted by her situation, able to put one foot in front of the other only because the Dark Army will torture her loved ones to death if she stops moving. By contrast, Elliot has two thin strands of hope to cling to. First, he needs Whiterose to convene a meeting of the Deus Group; Price forces her hand by announcing his plans to resign as E Corp’s chief executive, which necessitates an in-person gathering to choose his successor. Second, he needs to hack Price’s go-between with the group, the E Corp attorney Susan Jacobs; unfortunately, his sister, Darlene, killed her for her role in the Jefferson Township chemical leak that killed her and Elliot’s father. Darlene reveals that dark secret after she and Elliot get together following the sudden death of their abusive mother. This, too, is a striking contrast: To see our daring hacker heroes attend to painfully ordinary business like arranging a cremation, grieving in a chapel, and going through their mother’s personal effects is to see a whole new side of them both. Neither Elliot nor Darlene really care about the death of their mom, but her passing enables them to process their grief over the murder of their childhood friend Angela, which they had never been properly able to do until now. It’s then that another group of shadowy figures emerges from hiding, at least to us in the audience. In passing, Darlene mentions the return of Vera, the drug dealer who murdered Elliot’s girlfriend Shayla back in Season 1. Furious, Elliot demands to know why Darlene never told him; she insists that she did. But even Elliot’s Mr. Robot persona denies having been told. Then the show cuts to the high-rise boardroom where Elliot had his first encounter with E Corp’s inner circle in the pilot — “the guys no one knows about,” as he called them at the time. In this interior limbo lurk Elliot’s mother and his child self, two other alternate personalities. They’re waiting for someone, his mother says. Not for Elliot, not even for Mr. Robot: “For the other one.” So there’s another personality buried in Elliot somewhere — an echo of the Deus Group, a true power behind it all. Adding additional layers to an already complicated plot is tricky business, of course. But the mysteries are so intriguing, and Esmail’s command of his craft so sure, that the investment seems sound as a pound. Random Data: As he did in the season premiere, Mr. Robot narrates the episode rather than Elliot. It’s a sign of how single-minded Elliot has become in his pursuit of vengeance that he no longer has the time or the inclination to talk to his “friend” in the audience. Surreal sight gag of the night: A man in a full-body snowman costume, offering his condolences to Elliot and Darlene as they argue about their dead mother on a subway platform. Bets on Elliot’s secret persona? My best guess is the horror-film slasher who first wore the money-man mask that Elliot’s collective fsociety adopted as a symbol, but I’m perfectly happy to have no real idea until the show reveals it. Darlene can’t quite bring herself to say aloud that she murdered Susan Jacobs; her guilt and self-loathing forces Elliot to complete the puzzle on his own. As an inveterate adolescent Walkman user, I found its use as an ersatz Proustian madeleine for Elliot’s, Darlene’s and Angela’s childhoods to be astutely observed. That creepy taxidermist who serves as Darlene’s Dark Army handler returns, issuing threats with a smile in a shop called “La Mort Heureuse.” I’m not sure Camus would approve. An earlier version of this article misidentified the township where Elliot and his family used to live. It is Washington township, not Jefferson.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Mr. Robot’ Season 4, Episode 3: ’Twas the Night Before Christmas","Mr. Robot This week’s episode offered a whole new level of insight into Whiterose. It was also extremely sexy. Risk is the essence of romance. A wise woman told me that once; I live with her now, so I’m inclined to believe she knew what she was talking about. Exposed and vulnerable, we reach out to another person and hope they’ll reach back. We put ourselves at their mercy in hopes of connection. In some cases, we put ourselves at the mercy of a world that will punish us for that connection should it be discovered. There is some pain we suffer gladly because it’s the vessel in which pleasure comes. Titled “403 Forbidden” — like every episode title so far, it’s both an internet error message and a signpost for the story — this installment of “Mr. Robot” has both the series’s protagonist and antagonist putting themselves at risk in romance’s name. In one case, it leads to disaster. In another … well, the season isn’t over yet. The episode begins with an extended and fascinating flashback sequence. It’s 1982, and a young Zhi Zhang (Ross Kurt Le) is a Chinese bureaucrat meeting with IBM executives about their exciting new technology. What they don’t know is that Zhang has no intention whatsoever of setting them up with a lucrative government contract — not when the technology can simply be swiped. (“I look forward to stealing your intellectual property,” Zhang tells the oblivious executives in her native language.) What no one knows is that Zhang, better known to us as Whiterose, is a trans woman, trapped in her male-presenting persona. But not for long. Zhang and her assistant, Peng Chen (Eugene Shaw), are lovers, and they enjoy their time in America where they’re more able to be themselves; their hope is that Zhang will be made ambassador to the United States based on their success there. But while they cuddle in their hotel room, Zhang eyes a music video featuring the gender-nonconforming pop star Boy George with barely disguised envy and awe. When her boyfriend returns to the room later that night after a drink-up with his associates, Zhang presents herself to him wearing a wig and one of her mother’s dresses. “You’re — —” stammers the boyfriend. “A woman,” Zheng finishes for him. “I was going to say, ‘You’re beautiful,’” he corrects her. They kiss. The camera zooms in. It’s one of the loveliest, sexiest moments in the history of the show. But it doesn’t last. In a subsequent flashback, Zhang shows up for Peng’s arranged wedding — to a woman who isn’t transgender, of course. As a joke, Zhang has sent him white roses, “the funeral flower.” But Peng is in no mood to laugh, and grows only more despondent when he hears that Zhang has accepted the job of Minister of State Security instead of the United States ambassadorship. “You’re the only one who knows everything about me,” Zhang reassures him. “I trusted you with that. Now I’m asking you to trust me. I promise I’ll find a way to make this world better, for us.” “This world will never be good enough,” Peng replies before slitting his own throat. Blood stains the white roses. It’s a moment as morbidly grandiose as the earlier one was rapturous. And it says a lot about Zhang that she chose “Whiterose” as her nom de guerre. In the present day, Elliot Alderson makes an unexpected love connection of his own. With the help of his sister, Darlene — whom he’s trying to keep at arm’s length, as he’s done with everyone else in his life — he identifies the female bank employee who handles the Dark Army’s account, most likely never realizing who she is actually working for. Her name is Olivia Cortez (Dominik García-Lorido), she is a single mother with a history of addiction, and wouldn’t you know it, she has an OK Cupid date with a stranger on Christmas Eve. Elliot and his alternate personality cum sidekick, Mr. Robot, decide to crash the date in order to get a key fob they’ll need for their assault on the Dark Army’s treasury. Elliot steels himself to threaten her custody arrangement if she refuses to cooperate. But when the date appears to have stood her up, Mr. Robot calls an audible and, on Elliot’s behalf, offers to buy her a drink instead. She finds Elliot’s off-kilter personality (ahem, personalities) charming, at least until the original date shows up and ruins the mood. Olivia is about to catch a ride home when Elliot races to the street and kisses her, with the beautiful lights of a New York City Christmas glowing as if for their express benefit. If you’ve ever had the good fortune of kissing someone beautiful on a December night in Manhattan, you’ll appreciate the power of the moment. A Christmas Eve one-night stand ensues. Waking before she does, Elliot sneaks into Olivia’s bathroom with his stolen MacGuffin and discovers that Whiterose has set the all-important meeting of the Deus Group for mere hours from now in an effort to thwart the Elliot and Philip Price’s schemes. He also sees that she has some OxyContin on hand. But when Olivia follows him into the bathroom, she opens the bottle and reveals not pills but a razor blade. It’s there as a reminder of how awful her life as an addict was: “If I hate myself enough to start using again, I might as well kill myself,” she says. Elliot, an addict himself, can relate. The two rest their heads on each other as Mr. Robot’s voice-over says that letting people into your life doesn’t have to hurt. The risk is worth taking. It depends on who you’re letting in, though. Vera, the vicious drug dealer who killed Elliot’s girlfriend in Season 1, appears poised to threaten his therapist, Krista (Gloria Reuben), to secure Elliot’s help in building his empire. And the mercurial Tyrell Wellick (Martin Wallstrom) has broken into his apartment with news that he is to be named the new chief executive of E Corp, potentially giving away the secret of their alliance to anyone listening. Some risks are more romantic than others. Random Data: I love the furtive, skulking way in which the director Sam Esmail and the cinematographer Tod Campbell move their camera: zooming in and out, slowly tracking and swooping around, as if it were a groping tentacle searching for something to latch on to. Maybe I’m reading too much into it, but the titles of some of the song’s on this week’s soundtrack — “Sick of Myself” by Matthew Sweet, “Flesh Without Blood” by Grimes — feel like dark-comedy commentary on Elliot and Mr. Robot’s relationship. Tinfoil hat time: If, as it once seemed, Whiterose’s top-secret project is a time machine, is her goal to go back and undo her decision to choose the security ministry over the United States ambassadorship, thus saving the love of her life? “My mom died yesterday.” “Oh my god, I’m so sorry.” “For what?” Never change, Elliot.",The New York Times
2019,‘Mrs. Doubtfire’ Musical Is Coming to Broadway,"The 1993 comedy has a Broadway-friendly family plot, but filling one of Robin Williams’s most memorable roles could be risky. Coming soon to Broadway: a new musical, adapted from an Oscar-winning film, about a struggling actor who masquerades as a woman to get what he wants. No, not that one. This season, it’s “Mrs. Doubtfire,” based on the 1993 comedy starring Robin Williams, about an estranged husband posing as a Scottish nanny to spend time with his kids. The show will begin previews at the Stephen Sondheim Theater in March 2020 for an April 5 opening, after an out-of-town run in Seattle later this year. The producer, Kevin McCollum, is no stranger to bringing films to the stage. He signed a deal in 2013 with 20th Century Fox, the studio behind “Mrs. Doubtfire,” to develop nine to a dozen new musicals based on the company’s films. “The Devil Wears Prada” and several others are on his docket. (While Disney purchased 20th Century Fox earlier this year and holds the rights to the film, the company’s theatrical branch is not a producer, a spokesperson for the musical said.) McCollum is also working on “The Notebook,” from Warner Bros. But film-inspired musicals are still tricky on Broadway, where the appeal of recognizable stories is at odds with audience members’ lofty expectations for adaptations that live up to the originals. “Moulin Rouge! The Musical,” “Beetlejuice” and “Mean Girls” — not to mention Disney’s catalog — are still playing to packed houses this season, but other recent adaptations, like “Pretty Woman” and “Groundhog Day,” have found less success. And then, of course, there’s “Tootsie,” which opened to good reviews but has seen only average ticket sales. “Mrs. Doubtfire” will walk the same tightrope. The family-focused plot is ideal for a Broadway stint, McCollum told The New York Times in 2013, but there is a risk to playing such a memorable title role in the shadow of someone like Williams. Stepping into Euphegenia Doubtfire’s pumps this time around is Rob McClure, whose previous Broadway appearances include “Beetlejuice” and “Something Rotten!” The creative team behind “Something Rotten!” is at work here as well: Karey Kirkpatrick and John O’Farrell wrote the book, and Wayne Kirkpatrick and Karey Kirkpatrick wrote the score. The director will be Jerry Zaks, whose most recent project was the “Hello, Dolly!” revival. Alan Menken said in a 2015 interview that he, David Zippel and Harvey Fierstein — all Disney musical veterans — were working on writing “Mrs. Doubtfire.” Menken later said that the show was on “creative hiatus,” citing other projects. A spokesperson for the musical said there had been an earlier but unannounced “exploration of other creatives,” but that the Kirkpatricks and O’Farrell had been working on the show since 2016. “Mrs. Doubtfire” will follow the clown-filled holiday offering “Slava’s Snowshow” at the Sondheim after “Beautiful,” the Carole King musical, closes at the end of this month. An earlier version of this article misidentified the film studio behind “The Notebook,” which is being adapted into a musical by Kevin McCollum. It was released by New Line Cinema/Warner Bros., not 20th Century Fox.",The New York Times
2019,‘No Excuse’: Fellow Officers Condemn Police Shooting of Fort Worth Woman,"Atatiana Jefferson pointed a gun at her window before being shot from outside by a police officer, her young nephew said. But the police chief said she was entitled to defend herself. FORT WORTH — When James Smith called a nonemergency police number at 2:23 a.m. on Saturday, he opened with a note of concern: “I’m calling about my neighbor.” He had noticed that his neighbor’s doors were open, the lights on in the middle of the night, and he was worried. “It’s not normal for them,” he said. But when the information was relayed to two police officers who responded, it was classified as an “open structure” call, a vague term that can mean anything from an abandoned house to a burglary. The officers parked about a block away, spoke in low voices as they crept through the yard and did not knock on the door to announce themselves as the police. This sequence of events, explained in more detail on Tuesday, offered one potential explanation of what happened in the confusing moments before a white Fort Worth police officer abruptly shot through a bedroom window on Saturday and killed the 28-year-old black woman who lived inside. But exactly what the officer saw when he fired the single fatal shot was still in question, even as officials condemned his actions as inexcusable and pursued a rare murder charge against a police officer. The woman, Atatiana Jefferson, had been up late playing video games with her 8-year-old nephew when she heard noises outside. Her nephew told the authorities that she had pulled a handgun from her purse and pointed it at the window, according to an arrest warrant released on Tuesday. But it was unclear what the officer, Aaron Y. Dean, saw when he looked into the window, which was obscured by the reflection of his flashlight on the glass, at least according to the body camera video released by the police. Mr. Dean has declined to give an interview to investigators, according to the arrest warrant, and his partner on the call said that she saw only Ms. Jefferson’s face in the window at the time of the shooting. Mr. Dean, 34, resigned from the department on Monday and was arrested later that day. He was charged with murder. Prosecutors will present the evidence to a grand jury, which will decide whether or not to issue an indictment. At a news conference on Tuesday, Ms. Jefferson’s brother, Adarius Carr, said the problems in the Fort Worth Police Department extended beyond the actions of a single officer. “This rookie cop is not going to be the scapegoat for what happened,” he said. “Yes, he is going to take his punishment, but the system failed him. Whoever senior who was with him failed him. Whoever sent him out failed him. The training failed him. There is a lot that has to get fixed.” Community leaders have complained that the shooting exacerbated a mistrust of the police department, particularly among black residents. Six people, of various races, have died in police shootings in Fort Worth since June. Mr. Dean graduated from the police academy in March 2018, according to state records. He joined the Fort Worth Police Department the next month. He had previously taken classes at the University of Texas at Arlington, chipping away at his degree from the spring of 2003 through the spring of 2011. He graduated with a degree in physics, a university spokesman said. A lawyer for Mr. Dean could not be reached on Tuesday. He appeared to live with relatives in nearby Arlington, on a quiet street of tan-brick houses about 12 miles east of where Ms. Jefferson was shot. No one answered the door at the Dean family residence, a low-slung home with a neatly trimmed lawn. Officers with the Arlington Police Department kept watch on the house throughout the afternoon. Manny Ramirez, the president of the Fort Worth Police Officers Association, said that police officers approach open structure calls prepared for any number of situations: a burglar in the house, doors left open by residents, abandonment. Still, Officer Ramirez said that everyone he had spoken to within the department was dumbfounded as to why Mr. Dean opened fire. “He’s such a young officer, not in age, but just young in tenure,” Officer Ramirez said. “It’s one of those things where we’re all at a loss and there’s no way to explain it. We can’t understand how this happened.” Mr. Smith, the neighbor who called the police early on Saturday, was distraught after learning that Ms. Jefferson had been killed. “I’m shaken. I’m mad. I’m upset. And I feel it’s partly my fault,” he told The Fort Worth Star-Telegram later that day. “If I had never dialed the police department, she’d still be alive.” At a news conference on Tuesday, Ed Kraus, the interim police chief, said that the department was investigating how information about the neighbor’s call was relayed to the responding officers. “The information came from the neighbor to the call-takers and while it was relayed to the dispatch, it was determined to be an open structure call,” Chief Kraus said, adding that officers probably would have acted differently if they believed they were called to simply check on the well-being of a family. Police response protocols vary, but Officer Steve Grammas, the president of the Las Vegas Police Protective Association, said that in most cases a call from someone concerned about a neighbor not answering the phone would most likely result in a door-knock from officers. If someone called about two doors open in the middle of the night, however, officers might immediately consider that the house was being burglarized, Officer Grammas said. “It’s definitely more than just, ‘I’ll go see if the homeowners are O.K.,” he said. “You’re thinking maybe a break-in, maybe worse.” The calls that result in an open structure dispatch may sound similar to those that result in a welfare check, but the classification matters, Officer Grammas said. “They’re two different frames of mind for the officer,” he said. Chief Kraus said he could not speculate on Mr. Dean’s mind-set at the time of the shooting, and a police spokesman declined to comment on whether Ms. Jefferson was holding the gun, as her young nephew told the police, or had anything else in her hands at the moment she was shot. Chief Kraus has defended Ms. Jefferson’s right to have a gun in her own home and said there was “no excuse” for Mr. Dean’s response. He grew emotional on Tuesday as he described the reaction from other officers in the department, who he said had overwhelmingly thanked him for taking action against Mr. Dean. He praised officers who he said worked hard to build relationships in the community — and would have to pay the price in lost trust. “I likened it to a bunch of ants building an ant hill, and somebody comes with a hose and washes it away,” he said. “They just have to start from scratch.” Manny Fernandez reported from Fort Worth, and Sarah Mervosh and Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs from New York.

2019,Opinion | ‘Not a Commander-in-Chief’,"A former Trump official speaks out. More should. Opinion Columnist This article is part of David Leonhardt’s newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday. Gen. James Mattis, the former defense secretary, has so far said nothing about President Trump’s reckless decision to abandon the Kurds, longtime allies of the United States, to a threatened military assault by Turkey. Rex Tillerson, the former secretary of state, has also said nothing. And Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the former national security adviser, has said nothing. They’re all making a mistake. With their silence, they are showing greater loyalty to one man — Trump — than to the national interest. [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] Brett McGurk yesterday showed how to speak up, clearly and courageously. McGurk is no liberal firebrand. He clerked for William Rehnquist, the conservative Supreme Court justice, before joining George W. Bush’s administration as a foreign-policy official, and then serving in Barack Obama’s administration and later Trump’s. In late 2018, McGurk resigned on principle, shortly after Mattis did, in protest of Trump’s decision to withdraw American troops from Syria. Here’s what McGurk wrote yesterday: “Donald Trump is not a Commander-in-Chief. He makes impulsive decisions with no knowledge or deliberation. He sends military personnel into harm’s way with no backing. He blusters and then leaves our allies exposed when adversaries call his bluff or he confronts a hard phone call.” And in response to a tweet from Trump he added: “Mr. President: With all due respect, none of this is true. I’d recommend having meetings with your experts and policy team before making historic life-and-death decisions. Making such decisions after a one-off call from a foreign leader is malpractice.” General Mattis; Mr. Tillerson; General McMaster: It’s past time to say what you think. For more … Republican leaders — including frequent defenders of the president like senators Mitch McConnell, Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio, as well as Nikki Haley, Trump’s former ambassador to the United Nations — harshly criticized Trump’s decision. So did some of his usual media allies, including Fox News and the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal. “A lot of [Republicans] who held back criticism of the president on Ukraine grift are unleashing at him over Syria,” tweeted Tamara Cofman Wittes of the Brookings Institution. “It is very clear that [Republicans] with aspirations to national leadership now see an imperative to show their independence from Trump. And that’s a big change.” Bloomberg Opinion’s Jonathan Bernstein asks whether the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, may have politically damaging information on Trump — like knowledge of another unseemly phone call — or whether Trump’s business investment in Turkey may be affecting his actions. “In normal cases, I’d caution people against getting carried away with such speculation. With Trump, it’s difficult,” Bernstein writes. “When Trump personally and inexplicably reverses U.S. policy immediately after a conversation with a foreign leader, it’s hard not to wonder exactly what motivations are at work.” If you are not a subscriber to this newsletter, you can subscribe here.

2019,‘On the President’s Orders’ Review: Police Unleashed on the Philippines,"In roundabout fashion, a documentary examines the sources of the wave of extrajudicial killings under President Rodrigo Duterte. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The documentary “On the President’s Orders” opens with a clip of President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines saying in 2016 that he would be “happy to slaughter” the country’s drug addicts. He approvingly compares taking that action to Hitler’s genocide of Jews. A title card tells us that a year later, Duterte, bowing to outside pressure, promised to cut down on extrajudicial killings of suspected drug users, actions that human rights groups have attributed to police and vigilantes. Enter Jemar Modequillo, a new police chief said to have been brought in to change the situation in Caloocan, a district of Manila that the film identifies as the epicenter of violence. His goal, a captain in his unit tells us, is to decrease killings and increase arrests. For a while, “On the President’s Orders,” directed by James Jones and Olivier Sarbil, comes uncomfortably close to being an endorsement of his tough tactics. Modequillo warns officers that he wants “finger discipline” with triggers. One official says that it’s good that, under Duterte, officers are no longer afraid to confront drug dealers. But as the film proceeds — the overall arc is faintly dialectical, moving from cops to the impoverished Manila residents they investigate, and circling back to a killing captured on a security camera — the implication is that any reform is nominal or meaningless. A police captain seems to suggest that any killings by law enforcement are legitimate in the eyes of the law. The thesis of “On the President’s Orders” isn’t terribly original, but in a needlessly roundabout way, it makes its case that these killings are not the work of isolated individuals, but the product of a top-down culture that stems from Duterte's assent.

2019,‘Orlando’ Awkwardly Transitions to the Stage,"Theater Review Katie Mitchell’s adaptation of the 1928 novel is consistently one step behind Virginia Woolf’s mercurial prose. PARIS — When gender starts to feel like a battleground, there’s comfort in going back to Virginia Woolf’s 1928 novel, “Orlando.” The book’s central sex change — midway, a young nobleman seamlessly becomes a “she” — is a playful event, full of fantastical possibilities. It’s easy to see why artists like the British director Katie Mitchell are turning to it again for inspiration, but the text’s leaps of imagination aren’t easily replicated onstage. In a recent interview with The Financial Times, Ms. Mitchell called Woolf’s parody of a biography, inspired by her intimate relationship with the author and aristocrat Vita Sackville-West, an “unstageable monster.” Undeterred, she staged it at the Schaubühne in Berlin, with Alice Birch as her co-adapter. After its September premiere, their “Orlando” traveled to Paris for guest performances at the Théâtre de l’Odéon. There, it proved the director right: While Ms. Mitchell has poured impressive craft and experience into her reimagining, it is consistently one step behind Woolf’s mercurial prose. Ms. Mitchell applies to “Orlando” the live filming technique she has been honing for over a decade. The actors move around the stage with cameramen and wardrobe and makeup artists, recording scenes that are shown live on a large screen. Prerecorded footage is inserted as needed, while a narrator ties the story together. Onstage filming has become so commonplace that it’s easy to take its complexity for granted, and Orlando’s time-traveling adventures and long list of characters up the ante further. The eight actors from the Schaubühne company play dozens of roles; the costume and set changes are minutely choreographed and, at times, frenetic, as a grand reception room gives way to an airplane cabin, Constantinople or a 21st-century interior, since Ms. Mitchell brings the end point of “Orlando” from 1929 to the present. There is no denying the sheer virtuosity of the result, but the cast spend much of “Orlando” galloping from one set to the next, leaving the characters little room to breathe and project a sense of atmosphere. Similarly, the technical constraints appear at times to limit Ms. Mitchell to a literal reading of a highly metaphorical work. “It is like being alone in a dark room with a treasure chest full of rubies and nuggets and brocades,” Sackville-West marveled in a letter to Woolf after reading the novel; this version lacks that sense of giddy extravagance. When Orlando writes poetry, we merely see the character pen in hand. When the text mentions birds and trees, prerecorded birds and trees dutifully appear onscreen. I was left wishing Ms. Mitchell had broken her rules as regularly as Woolf does, because her “Orlando” delights when it embraces the witty absurdity of some scenes. The queen who falls in love with Orlando early on appears wearing a ruff and an elaborate hairdo — but she is topless, as the camera shortly reveals. When Orlando becomes a woman, Jenny König, who plays the role, dons a green dress with oversize side hoops that force her to navigate the sets sideways — a situation both farcical and visually revealing, showing Orlando’s frustration with the new restrictions she faces as a woman. As both the male and female Orlandos, Ms. König proves beautifully artless, keeping the sex change low-key. In that sense, she embodies Woolf’s presciently fluid character, invented long before gender fluidity reached the mainstream. Throughout, including in “Fleabag”-style, wide-eyed asides to the camera, Ms. König cuts through the technical wizardry to get to the fantasy. If confirmation was needed that Woolf’s works often resist adaptation, a new French production of “The Waves” sank without a trace at the Théâtre de Belleville in September. Its young director, Georgia Azoulay, attempted to craft coherent story lines out of Woolf’s allusive, stream-of-consciousness novel. It’s a tall order, and although Ms. Azoulay picked a simple setting, with just a table and a few chairs, she directed her actors to overwrought extremes. Drinks were thrown in people’s faces, and the characters veered between hysterical antics and ominous pauses, as if “The Waves” were a soap opera. Ms. Mitchell started her journey with Woolf by adapting “The Waves” in 2006; let’s hope this young cast can write off their version as an early-career experiment and move on to the next step. Elsewhere, “Orlando”-style gender fluidity is seeping into the French theater scene. The country has been slower to adopt gender-swapping in classic plays than has Britain or the United States, but even its most venerable company, the Comédie-Française, is now experimenting with it. In a new production of Shakespeare’s male-dominated “Julius Caesar,” at the smaller Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier, Rodolphe Dana has allotted over half of the main roles to women. That turns out to be the production’s one inspired move. As in Ms. Mitchell’s “Orlando,” Mr. Dana doesn’t strive for realism where cross-dressing is involved. The names and pronouns of the male characters remain the same, and the women aren’t required to drag up. Actors of both genders wear nondescript black suits, with the exception of Martine Chevallier, who plays Caesar in an embroidered tunic. Ms. Chevallier, one of the Comédie-Française’s most experienced performers, is a natural leader at this point in her career, and directs the proceedings with more authority when she is onstage than Mr. Dana does elsewhere. The performance might as well end with her slow, masterfully understated death scene — by a thousand silent cuts, as actor after actor smears red paint over her costume. Unhappily, though the play has been heavily truncated to accommodate a cast of just 10, there is another hour to go before the curtain falls. Georgia Scalliet at least provides a sense of Mark Antony’s inner conflict after the death of his protector, but Nâzim Boudjenah, as Brutus, is undone by the lack of tension. The traverse stage is oddly empty throughout: The design budget must have been sacrificed for the often lavish productions performed in the bigger Salle Richelieu, the Comédie-Française’s main stage. “Julius Caesar” isn’t the strongest offering in the Comédie-Française’s repertoire this season, but it is stimulating. It opens up horizons that the company’s women are ready for, and shifts traditional depictions of power. In that sense, gender fluidity does what theater has always done best: exercise the imagination. Orlando. Directed by Katie Mitchell. In repertoire at the Schaubühne, Berlin.Les Vagues.

2019,‘Our River Was Like a God’: How Dams and China’s Might Imperil the Mekong,"ON THE MEKONG RIVER — When the Chinese came to the village of Lat Thahae, perched on a muddy bend of a Mekong River tributary, they scrawled a Chinese character on the walls of homes, schools and Buddhist temples. No one in this isolated hamlet in northern Laos could read what it said. But the character means “demolish” — the fate of hundreds of communities along Asia’s great river reduced to a single foreign word. This year, a dam will begin transforming this stretch of jagged hills and pristine jungle in one of the world’s most remote countries, part of a broader effort to propel some of Asia’s least-developed economies. It is one of seven Chinese-built hydropower projects on the Nam Ou River. To make way for the dams, Lat Thahae and dozens more villages are being demolished. A Lat Thahae resident who goes by one name, See, said she was not satisfied with the offer from Sinohydro Corporation, China’s largest builder of dams overseas, to build her a bamboo shack miles away in return for destroying her spacious riverside home. But what power, she asked, does an illiterate farmer like her have in the face of China’s might? “I have to move because they tell me to move,” she said as an excavator with a Chinese driver and a Chinese license plate tore at the earth by her doorstep. “Our life on the river is finished.” CHINA MYANMAR VIETNAM Nam Ou River Mekong River Hanoi Chiang Mai LAOS Nam Ngum Reservoir South China Sea Vientiane Udon Thani Ubol Ratana Reservoir Khon Kaen THAILAND Banghiang River Nakhon Ratchasima Ubon Ratchathani LAOS Da Nang Mun River Bangkok Tonle Kong River CAMBODIA Tonle San River Tonle Sap Lake Mekong River Tonle Srepok River Phnom Penh VIETNAM Gulf of Thailand Ho Chi Minh City Mekong Delta CHINA MYANMAR VIETNAM Mekong River Hanoi Nam Ou River Chiang Mai LAOS South China Sea Vientiane Udon Thani Khon Kaen THAILAND Nakhon Ratchasima Ubon Ratchathani LAOS Da Nang Mun River Bangkok CAMBODIA Mekong River Tonle Sap Lake Phnom Penh VIETNAM Gulf of Thailand Ho Chi Minh City Mekong Delta CHINA VIETNAM Mekong River Hanoi Nam Ou River LAOS South China Sea Vientiane Udon Thani Khon Kaen THAILAND Nakhon Ratchasima Ubon Ratchathani LAOS Mun River CAMBODIA Mekong River Tonle Sap Lake Phnom Penh VIETNAM Ho Chi Minh City Mekong Delta CHINA LAOS Mekong River Nam Ou River VIETNAM Vientiane Udon Thani THAILAND Khon Kaen Ubon Ratchathani Mun River LAOS CAMBODIA Tonle Sap Lake Mekong River Phnom Penh VIETNAM Ho Chi Minh City Mekong Delta CHINA MYANMAR VIETNAM Dots are planned or constructed dams in the Mekong Basin.

Because construction and financing details are not always disclosed, China may have been involved with more dams than the map shows. Data from the CGIAR Mekong Dams Observatory, WorldPop and OpenStreetMap. Map by Derek Watkins. For the region’s governments, the dams are supposed to deliver economic salvation by bringing hundreds of them to the lower Mekong and its tributaries, along with accompanying infrastructure. Chinese officials and companies hope that building new dams, as well as roads and other development, will offset slackening growth back home and provide countries with a model for lifting themselves out of poverty. As plans for damming the lower Mekong gathered force in the early 2000s, the Mekong River Commission predicted that its four members — Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam — would reap $30 billion in benefits. But a reassessment years later by the same commission, which China has refused to join, produced a far different forecast: The economies of the lower Mekong countries will take a $7 billion hit if the planned hydropower projects go ahead. Already, water levels this July reached their lowest recorded height, according to the commission. With water flows shifting as new dams start their turbines, fishers, farmers and local ecosystems are suffering. A survey by the commission found that if all the dams planned for the Mekong network go forward, 97 percent of the sediment that once flowed to the river’s mouth could be blocked by 2040, starving the land of nutrients needed for agriculture. In Laos, the collapse last year of a dam that killed dozens of people and swept away thousands of homes in two countries highlighted the dangers of building in remote places with little oversight. Despite the Laotian government’s conclusion that the accident was caused by man-made factors, no one has been held responsible. [A day before a dam in Laos failed, builders saw trouble.] Environmental activists were alarmed last year when a Chinese company report on the cross-border impact of a major dam project in Laos, supposedly the product of months of rigorous research, turned out to have passages that were lifted from an earlier report about another Chinese project. “The people who depend most on the Mekong have the least control over what happens to the river,” said Bruce Shoemaker, a researcher on natural resource conflict in the region. Critics worry that the cost of these dams is being borne by governments ill equipped to afford it. “Are these dams for the good of the Mekong downstream countries, or are they for the good of a country like China that’s trying to gain economic influence and offload excess capacity?” said Maureen Harris, Southeast Asia program director at International Rivers, an environmental watchdog. “Dams aren’t something that can be easily undone,” she added. “We have to think of the consequences.” Poor and landlocked, Laos is betting that hydropower will become its largest moneymaker by 2025. The government, one of the world’s few remaining communist regimes, has signed off on more than 140 dams for the Mekong and its tributaries. The Laotian government is relying on money borrowed from China to fund many of these dams. Yet Laos is among the eight nations most vulnerable to being overwhelmed by debt to China, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Laos is also one of Asia’s most corrupt countries, according to Transparency International, and the bidding for hydropower projects is notoriously opaque. “Transparency and accountability?” said Mr. Shoemaker, who co-wrote a book on hydropower in Laos. “Those aren’t words I’d used to describe Laos.” Critics worry that Laos’s plan for vaulting out of the least-developed country bracket through dams will instead widen income disparity. “I have not seen a single case in which people have been compensated fairly for the disruptions to their lives caused by dams,” said Ian Baird, a Southeast Asia expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who studies the social effects of dams. “If governments are arguing that these projects aren’t viable without underpaying compensation, then maybe these projects aren’t right for the country.” The damming of the Mekong comes as mega-infrastructure projects are on the wane worldwide. In the United States, where hydropower was once celebrated as man’s triumph over nature, dams are being dismantled to let rivers flow unimpeded again. Scientists in the West now consider solar and wind possibly more sustainable sources of power. Even international financial institutions like the World Bank, which once spread the hydropower gospel across the developing world, are warning about the long-term consequences of dams. But for Laos’s planners, some of whom studied engineering in the Soviet Union, dams still represent the pinnacle of socialist progress. “The problem is that you’ve got people sitting in government ministries who aren’t going to give up their dreams of modernizing through hydropower,” Mr. Baird said. “Their whole development model is based on this.” Yet scientists are doubtful the region can consume all the energy that Laos hopes to harness. The country’s seven million people will never need all that power, and neighboring Thailand already has a glut of energy. The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, which planned to buy power from the $2.4 billion Pak Beng project in Laos, is rethinking its decision. That hasn’t stopped Chinese engineers, entrepreneurs and construction workers from flooding Laos. At the Sinohydro construction sites for the Nam Ou cascade dams, giant red banners hang off rock faces, proclaiming the importance of Chinese-Laotian socialist brotherhood. The signs are only in Chinese. There are few Laotian workers. Wei Jun, a Sinohydro supervisor at a rock-crushing facility, shrugged at the fact that villagers were being forced to move with paltry compensation. When China built the Xiaowan Dam on the upper reaches of the Mekong, 35,000 Chinese were moved, he said. “Progress,” he said, using a Chinese idiom, “means eating bitterness.” The Mekong’s headwaters spring forth high in the Tibetan plateau, but in China the river holds little utility for humans. The Lancang, as the Mekong is known there — a name that means “turbulent” — is too fast and steep to do much more than power turbines. Seven dams have been built on the Mekong’s upper reaches since 2000. But for the downriver nations, the Mekong is a lifeblood. Like the Nile, the Tigris and the Yangtze, the Mekong watered empires. Two capitals, Vientiane of Laos and Phnom Penh of Cambodia, stand on its banks. The world’s most productive rice growers, in Thailand and Vietnam, depend on the Mekong’s generosity in depositing rich alluvial soil during the rainy season. The river network is the world’s largest inland fishery. More than any other country, Cambodia is nourished by the Mekong. The country’s 16 million people get about 80 percent of their protein intake from its system, which includes a tributary that is the only river in the world that changes course seasonally. Cambodia also depends on China, now its largest trading partner and benefactor. Prime Minister Hun Sen, Asia’s longest serving leader, has turned his back on Western patrons whose aid has failed to catalyze democratic overhauls. A single Mekong dam proposed for Cambodia, the Sambor, could produce more electricity than all of what Cambodia currently consumes. This year, the country has suffered outages that have idled factories and left millions without power. But a Chinese-built dam at Sambor could “literally kill the Mekong River and devastate Cambodia’s economy,” according to a Cambodian government-commissioned report by the Natural Heritage Institute, an American watchdog that monitors the world’s major river basins. Sixty percent of the sediment needed to nourish Vietnam’s rice paddies in the Mekong Delta could be blocked by the Sambor, the report warned, and “would create a complete barrier to migratory fish.” Instead, the institute recommended floating solar panels in an existing reservoir as a better solution to Cambodia’s electricity shortage. Cambodia’s largest dam to date is the $800 million Lower Sesan 2, on a feeder of the Mekong. Its Chinese-built turbines began turning last December, flooding five villages as the reservoir filled. Today, the spire of a Buddhist pagoda protrudes from waters that have inundated the village of Srekor. Former residents travel by boat to rescue belongings from flooded homes, where stalled clocks mark when the waters arrived. Srekor’s villagers have been moved, but their new homes are far from the river that once supported them. There is a high school with no teachers, a clinic with no doctors. Electricity is expensive, galling given that they were evicted for a power project, residents said. No clean water is available. Mr. Hun Sen, who presided over the dam’s inauguration, called complaining villagers “radicals.” In the resettlement community, villagers mourned the loss of a river that sustained them for generations. “Our river was like a god to us,” said In Chin, a resident. “It makes me sad that we killed it.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Pain and Glory’ Review: Almodóvar’s Dazzling Art of Self-Creation,"Critic’s Pick Antonio Banderas plays a filmmaker in crisis in Pedro Almodóvar’s movie about loss, love, imagination and memory. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Every so often in Pedro Almodóvar’s sublime “Pain and Glory,” Salvador Mallo (Antonio Banderas) closes his eyes and drifts away. A celebrated Spanish filmmaker, Salvador has lost his bearings. He’s gravely depressed, and his body seems to have permanently surrendered to his maladies, to his bad back, migraines, asthma and fits of terrifying, mysterious choking. When a friend offers him some heroin to smoke, Salvador readily lights up and disappears. His nagging pains suddenly give way to images from his childhood, idylls that brighten the screen like beacons in a fog. A story of memory and creation, youth and its loss, “Pain and Glory” circles around the idea of art as self-creation. The precipitating event — the thing that nudges Salvador and the movie forward — is the screening of an early triumph, a 1980s film called “Sabor.” (Its poster is suitably Almodóvarian: a strawberry-like tongue licking its luscious red lips.) Uneasy about the screening, Salvador reaches out to one of its actors, Alberto (Asier Etxeandia), a debauched looker with dangerous habits and a thing for skulls. The men haven’t spoken for years, but slip into a thorny intimacy that’s almost domestic, pushing and pulling at each other while picking at old scabs. The screening turns into a mild farce, but it stirs something in Salvador, lighting a small fire. The grinning face of death hangs over “Pain and Glory,” but it soon emerges that Salvador’s most debilitating issue is that he is a man without desire. He’s alone and hasn’t made movie in a while, and a new one doesn’t seem on the horizon. Yet even as he idles, his will to create — to dream, share stories, make drama — remains intact. He may not be shooting a film, but it’s telling how much his life seems like a melodrama or a comedy or even, as in a gritty scene with slashing knives and blood, a thriller. One of Almodóvar’s talents is his transformational, near-alchemical use of blunt ideas, how he marshals crude gestures, gaudy flourishes and melodramatic entanglements. The emotions still sting here, and the colors glow like traffic lights — there are eye-popping bursts of stop-sign red and go-go green — and the movie is as visually striking as any Almodóvar has made. But the narrative is elegantly structured rather than clotted, and its tone is contemplative as opposed to frantic, as if he had turned down the volume. A great deal happens in “Pain and Glory,” just not ritualistically and not at top volume. Its agonies are tempered, its regrets hushed, its restraint powerful. All that said, the first time you see Salvador he’s at the bottom of a cerulean-blue swimming pool in a seated position, as still and heavy as a dropped anchor. He looks like he’s meditating, but then again he might be drowning. Whatever the case, the shot and its uncomfortable duration (you may find yourself nervously counting off the seconds) create a sense of mounting unease. Salvador looks so vulnerable with his near-nakedness and arms akimbo, a vivid scar slashed across his torso. Keep looking, and he brings to mind iconographic images of Jesus as the man of sorrows. This introduction could sink a less gifted director, but Almodóvar is a virtuoso of quicksilver changes and soon cuts to a young boy at a river where women wash clothes and break into melodious song. Light and bright and shimmering with beauty, it is the first in a series of scenes from Salvador’s childhood scattered throughout the movie. Taken together, they create a wistful, emotionally vibrant counterpoint to the adult Salvador’s lonely, austere odyssey. Yet while they look like flashbacks, they’re closer to idealized reveries than to raw memories. (Asier Flores plays Salvador when he’s around 9; Penélope Cruz lights up the screen as his mother, Jacinta.) A genre unto himself, Almodóvar has long drawn from his own history for his movies, most obviously with protagonists who are filmmakers. (He calls “Pain and Glory” the final installment in a triptych that includes “Law of Desire” and “Bad Education.”) In “Pain and Glory,” Almodóvar’s home doubles for Salvador’s; Banderas wears some of the director’s clothes and has similarly styled hair and beard. These teasing biographical gestures blur the line between reality and representation, but to see this movie as confessional would miss the point. The point is the blur, that in-between space where art blooms. Banderas’s melancholic presence and subtle, intricate performance add depth and intensities of feeling both because he draws so flawlessly from Almodóvar and looks wrung out, with little of the feverish intensity evident in even their recent collaborations. (This is the eighth movie they’ve made together in the last four decades.) With his downcast eyes, sagging posture, silences and self-imposed isolation, Salvador looks like a man in retreat. He would be a figure of pure pathos if it weren’t clear that Salvador also suffers from acute vanity. When a friend asks what he will do if he doesn’t make movies, he says, “live, I suppose,” quickly lowering and raising his eyes, like an actor (or coquet) checking the reaction to a killer line. Salvador’s crisis is real, but its performative quality is a relief; it lightens the heaviness and gives you permission to laugh. “Pain and Glory” can be achingly sad, but its pleasures, rainbow hues and humor keep it (and you) aloft. For a depressed man, Salvador still puts on a lively show, wearing splashes of color. Like his exquisitely appointed house, his clothing reminds you — as does Almodóvar’s staging of many conversations — how we turn ourselves into performers, our homes into theaters, the world into our audience. The problem with Salvador is that somewhere along the line, as a visitor suggests, his home became a museum. It might as well be his mausoleum. How do you come back from the dead? For Salvador, the answer comes in fits and starts, in the burnished images of his childhood, in an old lover’s passion, in the power of art. It also comes in his love for Jacinta, who as an older woman (Julieta Serrano) nearing death, voices distaste for autobiographical fiction, telling Salvador he wasn’t a good son. It’s clear why: He grew up, lived his life, fell in love with a man, became an artist. His choices were as unforgivable as they were inescapable. But Salvador listens, and he apologizes. And then he takes the messiness, the vibrancy and the sensuous pleasures of life as he remembers it and turns his pain — and hers — into glory.

2019,"‘Paradise Hills’ Review: Caged Birds Singing, Maybe Escaping","In this dystopian tale, a private treatment center turns privileged young women into smilingly compliant stereotypes. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. By turns puckish and grim, “Paradise Hills” is just the latest female-driven dystopian story to hit screens. Maybe it’s the times, and these chronicles of peril and resistance represent a mood (or a game plan). Whatever the reason, the bad times keep coming for women, who have battled odds, other people and sometimes monsters in modest fairy tales like “Endzeit” and “Into the Forest” as well as in larger-scaled apocalyptic fictions like “The Hunger Games,” “Divergent” and “The Handmaid’s Tale.” The name “Paradise Hills” refers to a rehabilitation center on a verdant island. Its isolation is an early clue that something isn’t right on this putative Shangri-La where a young woman, Uma (Emma Roberts), is yelling to be let out of a locked room. It’s a pretty prison, with a grassy carpet and a painted landscape spreading across the walls. Sun streams in from overhead, a taunting promise of the larger, lighter open world, and a resonant image in a movie filled with telegraphing visuals. Warmth proves as elusive as escape does. Uma soon discovers that Paradise Hills is a rehab center for privileged young women who don’t conform to their family’s antediluvian norms of femininity. Overseen by the Duchess (an amusing Milla Jovovich), the women undergo various treatments, some more willingly than others. In flouncy old-fashioned uniforms, they cavort and submit, though some eye the exit. When they exercise, they don’t break a sweat; at dinner, they eat enforced meager rations. Like exotic birds in gilded cages, they are at once pampered and imprisoned. The director Alice Waddington sets the look and mood swiftly, most successfully through the costumes and the production design, both adorned with dollops of color and witty, texture-enriching filigree. While the Duchess floats through the orderly grounds like a Stepford Scarlett O’Hara — straw hats, cascading gowns, blank smiles — the inmates are pointedly dressed in girlish outfits, virginal white from their neck ruffs to their high-button boots. They sleep in identical beds in identical billowy nighties and wander around in dresses with Elizabethan-style bodices that flatten their breasts, as if to retard (and deny) their maturity and independence. Waddington appears to have drawn visual and narrative inspiration from a range of sources, with a tasty pinch of Lewis Carroll, an acid splash of Stanley Kubrick, a smattering of Giorgio de Chirico. The white costumes summon up “Picnic at Hanging Rock,” while the fastidiously manicured grounds bring to mind those in “Last Year at Marienbad.” Uma at times seems like an Alice in Un-wonderland, an intruder-inmate in a curiouser and curiouser realm. She meets friends — Danielle Macdonald, Awkwafina and Eiza González play other patients (detainees) — who come with their own teary tales. Together, the women bond and endure until something at last gives. Set in a vague future that’s clearly in the grip of the past, “Paradise Hills” is very much a movie about the present. At its center is the familiar fight over women’s bodies, a battle that seems already lost when the story opens. Despite Uma’s stated unhappiness, the hovering male guards and her attempts to push back, she never seems really alarmed enough. If anything, she can seem almost resigned, which indicates that the world beyond the island is more terrifying than suggested. At times, though, Uma’s lack of urgency feels more like an oversight, as if Waddington had spent so much time polishing the gears that she overlooked the machinery. Despite her shaky handle on the movie’s ideas and the appealing if uneven performances, Waddington holds your attention with visual beauty and humor. As the mood and tone darken, the narrative grows more baroque, creepier, and this speculative fiction turns into a freakout, or at least tries to. Alas, Roberts makes an unproductively wan center for this feminist allegory, which could have used more of the oomph that Awkwafina and Macdonald bring. A late revelation about less privileged women shows a thematic road not taken even as it suggests that Waddington may have more to say about women and their seemingly never-ending escape.

2019,‘Parasite’ Review: The Lower Depths Rise With a Vengeance,"Critic’s Pick In Bong Joon Ho’s new film, a destitute family occupies a wealthy household in an elaborate scheme that goes comically — then horribly — wrong. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Midway through the brilliant and deeply unsettling “Parasite,” a destitute man voices empathy for a family that has shown him none. “They’re rich but still nice,” he says, aglow with good will. His wife has her doubts. “They’re nice because they’re rich,” she counters. With their two adult children, they have insinuated themselves into the lives of their pampered counterparts. It’s all going so very well until their worlds spectacularly collide, erupting with annihilating force. Comedy turns to tragedy and smiles twist into grimaces as the real world splatters across the manicured lawn. The story takes place in South Korea but could easily unfold in Los Angeles or London. The director Bong Joon Ho (“Okja”) creates specific spaces and faces — outer seamlessly meets inner here — that are in service to universal ideas about human dignity, class, life itself. With its open plan and geometric shapes, the modernist home that becomes the movie’s stage (and its house of horrors) looks as familiar as the cover of a shelter magazine. It’s the kind of clean, bright space that once expressed faith and optimism about the world but now whispers big-ticket taste and privilege. “Space and light and order,” Le Corbusier said, are as necessary as “bread or a place to sleep.” That’s a good way of telegraphing the larger catastrophe represented by the cramped, gloomy and altogether disordered basement apartment where Kim Ki-taek (the great Song Kang Ho) benignly reigns. A sedentary lump (he looks as if he’s taken root), Ki-taek doesn’t have a lot obviously going for him. But he has a home and the affection of his wife and children, and together they squeeze out a meager living assembling pizza boxes for a delivery company. They’re lousy at it, but that scarcely matters as much as the petty humiliations that come with even the humblest job. The Kims’ fortunes change after the son, Ki-woo (Choi Woo Shik), lands a lucrative job as an English-language tutor for the teenage daughter, Da-hye (Jung Ziso), of the wealthy Park family. The moment that he walks up the quiet, eerily depopulated street looking for the Park house it’s obvious we’re not idling in the lower depths anymore. Ki-woo crosses the threshold into another world, one of cultivated sensitivities and warmly polished surfaces that are at once signifiers of bourgeois success and blunt reproaches to his own family’s deprivation. For him, the house looks like a dream, one that his younger sister and parents soon join by taking other jobs in the Park home. Take being the operative word. The other Kims don’t secure their positions as art tutor, housekeeper and chauffeur, they seize them, using lies and charm to get rid of the Parks’ other employees — including a longtime housekeeper (a terrifically vivid Lee Jung Eun) — in a guerrilla incursion executed with fawning smiles. The Parks make it easy (no background checks). Yet they’re not gullible, as Ki-taek believes, but are instead defined by cultivated helplessness, the near-infantilization that money affords. In outsourcing their lives, all the cooking and cleaning and caring for their children, the Parks are as parasitical as their humorously opportunistic interlopers. Bong’s command of the medium is thrilling. He likes to move the camera, sometimes just to nudge your attention from where you think it should be, but always in concert with his restlessly inventive staging. When, in an early scene, the Kims crowd their superior from the pizza company, their bodies nearly spilling out of the frame, the image both underscores the family’s closeness and foreshadows their collective assault on the Parks. Nothing if not a rigorous dialectician, Bong refuses to sentimentalize the Kims’ togetherness or their poverty. But he does pointedly set it against the relative isolation of the Parks, who don’t often share the same shot much less the same room. Bong has some ideas in “Parasite,” but the movie’s greatness isn’t a matter of his apparent ethics or ethos — he’s on the side of decency — but of how he delivers truths, often perversely and without an iota of self-serving cant. (He likes to get under your skin, not wag his finger.) He accents the rude comedy of the Kims’ struggle with slyness and precision timing, encouraging your laughter. When the son and daughter can’t locate a Wi-Fi signal — the family has been tapping a neighbor’s — they find one near the toilet (an apt tribute to the internet). And when a cloud of fumigation billows in from outside, an excited Ki-taek insists on keeping the windows open to take advantage of the free insecticide. They choke, you laugh. You also squirm. The lightly comic tone continues after the Kims begin working for the Parks, despite ripples of unease that develop into riptides. Some of this disquiet is expressed in the dialogue, including through the Kims’ performative subservience, with its studied courtesies and strategic hedging. (Bong shares script credit with Han Jin Won.) The poor family quickly learns what the rich family wants to hear. For their part, Mr. and Mrs. Park (Lee Sun Kyun and Cho Yeo Jeong) speak the language of brutal respectability each time they ask for something (a meal, say) or deploy a metaphor, as when he gripes about people who “cross the line” and smell like “old radishes.” The turning point comes midway through when the Parks leave on a camping trip, packing up their Range Rover, outdoor projector included. In their absence, the Kims bring out the booze, kick back and take over the house, a break that’s cut short when the old housekeeper returns, bringing a surprise with her. The slapstick becomes more violent, the stakes more naked, the laughs more terrifying and cruel. By that point, you are as comfortably settled in as the Kims; the house is so very pleasant, after all. But the cost of that comfort and those pretty rooms — and the eager acquiescence to the unfairness and meanness they signify — comes at a terrible price.

2019,‘Parasite’ and South Korea’s Income Gap: Call It Dirt Spoon Cinema,"Bong Joon Ho’s latest film joins a growing list of movies criticizing South Korean inequality — a problem so pervasive it has given birth to its own slang. The title of the scathing new South Korean film “Parasite” refers to the Kim family, destitute basement dwellers who try to climb the social ladder by leeching off the wealthy Park family. While the Kims worry about money, the extravagant Parks worry about poor people’s unpleasant smell. The families’ lifestyles couldn’t be more different. The Kims’ tiny dining room window looks into a street that doubles as a urinal for drunks. The Parks’ giant panes have a view of their meticulously mowed lawn surrounded by manicured hedges. The Kims eat cheap pizza. The Parks’ favorite casual meal involves premium beef. The movie is the latest South Korean film to pit the haves against the have-nots: see this year’s No. 1 movie there, “Extreme Job,” as well as recent titles like “Burning” and 2013’s “Snowpiercer.” It’s no coincidence that income inequality is a recurring theme in the nation’s cinema. Experts say the films, for the most part big hits at home, capture the essence of Korean sentiments at a time when the country’s income gap continues to widen. While such inequality afflicts the United States and many other countries, South Korea’s income distribution is remarkably lopsided. In 2015, the top 10 percent of South Koreans held 66 percent of the nation’s wealth, while the poorer half of the population held only 2 percent, according to figures cited by Kyung Hyun Kim, a professor of East Asian studies at the University of California, Irvine, and an author of several books on Korean cinema. In addition, large numbers of South Korea’s elite inherited their wealth. That inequity, combined with scandals involving corruption among the privileged, have bred so much bitterness and frustration among Koreans that new slang phrases have emerged in recent years, like “gold spoons” and “dirt spoons.” “People who are born with a gold spoon are the ones who have made it,” the professor said. “The have-nots are dirt spoons. They will always be given a dirt spoon, and it will always be a struggle.” The lack of social mobility for dirt spoons is at the heart of “Parasite,” directed by Bong Joon Ho. The Kims are each smart and talented in their own ways. Yet they are so poor — they crouch next to a toilet just to steal a neighbor’s Wi-Fi — that there is no clear path for them to succeed. Though economically disadvantaged Americans face a similar plight, in South Korea, job prospects can be tied to family background, as when employers ask about applicants’ parents, a practice that could favor the privileged, Kim, the professor, said. Furthermore, investigations have uncovered nepotistic practices, like private schools’ preference for installing family members in teaching positions. So why not fake it till you make it? In “Parasite,” the Kims’ son, Ki-woo, fluent in English, uses a referral from a privileged friend and counterfeit college credentials to trick the Parks into giving him a job as a language tutor for their teenage daughter. Ki-woo’s sister, Ki-jung, pretends to be an art therapist and gets hired to work with the Parks’ disturbed little boy. Dad and Mom soon join the subterfuge by posing as a professional driver and a housemaid for the Parks, who are as gullible as they are neurotic about cleanliness. Last year’s “Burning,” from the director Lee Chang-dong, also portrayed the social divide in a dark story, in that case an awkward love triangle. Jongsu, a farmer’s son who dreams of being a writer, and Ben, an inexplicably wealthy man who drives a Porsche, both lust after the quirky Haemi. Even though Jongsu has a fling with Haemi, it becomes clear that this dirt spoon is no match for Ben, who offers Haemi entry into the gold-spoon club. In “Snowpiercer,” another Bong film, the gap between the privileged and the disadvantaged couldn’t be more apparent. The postapocalyptic thriller puts Earth’s only human survivors on a train in perpetual motion, with the haves occupying luxurious cars toward the front, where they enjoy sushi, and the have-nots living in the tail end, where they feed on gelatinous protein blocks composed of cockroaches. The only way for the dirt spoons to improve their situation is to fight and kill their way to the front of the train. (Spoiler: Nobody wins.) Some Korean films give social inequality a lighter parody treatment. “Extreme Job,” from the director Lee Byeong-heon, centers on a team of broke police officers who open a fried chicken restaurant as part of a sting operation to catch drug dealers. The restaurant becomes a booming success, and the officers quickly become distracted by their lucrative side hustle. Frustration over social injustice in South Korea spilled over in 2016 largely because of corruption. That year, the country’s president, Park Geun-hye, was impeached over accusations of bribery, extortion and abuse of power. Central to Park’s ouster was the revelation that she had worked closely with Choi Soon-sil, who was convicted of conspiring with university officials and professors to help her daughter, Chung Yoo-ra, a student getting high marks despite rarely attending lectures or completing assignments. For many Koreans, the scandals epitomized the dirty behavior and unfair advantages of the rich and powerful. “Parasite” may resonate with South Koreans because it contains many references to current events there. One viewer, NaYeon Yang, a psychology student at the University of Maryland who moved to the United States from South Korea when she was a teenager, spotted several examples, like Ki-woo’s fake college credentials — an allusion to the Choi scandal. Chung, Choi’s daughter, used falsified records to graduate from high school. More recently, crowds of protesters have called for the ouster of Cho Kuk, South Korea’s justice minister, who faces accusations of, among other things, pulling strings to help his daughter. Cho’s wife was indicted on a charge of forging a certificate to help their daughter get into medical school. In another scene in “Parasite,” the wealthy father recoils from the stench of an impoverished man who is his loyal supporter. This may be a reference to the impeached president, who was seen on TV news hiding her hands behind her back when a supporter reached out to shake her hand. The incident went viral. “I’m just fascinated by how he shrank all the things that recently happened in Korea and instilled that in his film,” Yang said about Bong. “Snowpiercer,” “Burning” and “Parasite” all conclude on notes of nearly unbridled cynicism — doubt that things will get better for the disadvantaged. That may be a reflection of South Korea’s diminishing faith in its economy. In his campaign pledge, Park’s successor, Moon Jae-in, promised to narrow the income gap by creating opportunities for the working class. As part of that effort, he raised taxes and increased the minimum wage. But the strategy isn’t working: The gap is continuing to widen, economic growth has slowed, and unemployment is on the rise. Moon’s approval rating plummeted from 84 percent in 2017 to 40 percent last month, according to a Gallup poll. “They’re losing hope,” said Kim, the professor of East Asian studies.",The New York Times
2019,‘People Were Bleeding All Over’: America’s Most Dangerous Amusement Park,"Action Park was infamous for bruises, scars, broken bones — even death. Now it is the subject of a documentary. Amusement parks are designed to deliver thrills. They are places for splashing and screaming and laughing, often on rides that defy common sense, not to mention the laws of physics. But a park in New Jersey routinely delivered a lot worse — bloody noses, bruises, broken teeth and bones, concussions and even death. People who spent a day at Action Park in its prime, in the 1980s and 1990s, often left with something to show for it: scars. “People were bleeding all over the place,” said Susie McKeown, who is now 52 and remembers going to Action Park after she graduated from high school more than 30 years ago. “People were walking around the park with scraped elbows or knees.’’ She went home with her own badge of honor, having broken one of her front teeth on a ride that ended with a 15- or 20-foot plunge into a chilly pond. “You went so fast that if your chin hit the water at the wrong angle, you chipped your teeth,” she said. She is hardly alone, as far as injuries go — or memories. Sports Illustrated recently published a 3,300-word article under the headline, “Remembering Action Park, America’s Most Dangerous, Daring Water Park.” And in 2014, Cory Booker, a United States senator from New Jersey and a Democratic presidential candidate, wrote on Twitter, “I’ve got stories 2 tell.” Now a documentary is on the way. Its title is “Class Action Park,” a reference to one of the many nicknames for Action Park. The park, about 50 miles northwest of New York City in Vernon, N.J., was long ago replaced by a far tamer destination, with different owners and a new name, Mountain Creek Water Park. Action Park “was funny, it was weird, it was hysterical, but there was a darkness to it,” said Seth Porges, who made the documentary with Chris Charles Scott. “People got hurt there. The hardest part of making this movie was: How do you portray that? A lot of people look back fondly on it as a coming-of-age experience. How do you reconcile the fun of it with the human toll?” Mr. Porges’s parents put Action Park on their vacation itinerary when he was a teenager growing up in Bethesda, Md. “I have these memories of impossible machines, water slides that seemed like they came from a Looney Tunes cartoon and this crazed atmosphere of chaos,” he said. He also remembers the way Action Park promoted itself in the 80s and 90s. “The ads portrayed the place as a family-friendly, wholesome, great place to bring your kids,” he said. “You’d get there and realize the reality of the situation was anything but.” The website WeirdNJ said two of the touchstones of growing up in New Jersey were being able to name all the places in the opening montage of “The Sopranos” and being seriously injured at Action Park. At least 14 broken bones and 26 head injuries were reported in 1984 and 1985. Action Park eventually bought the town new ambulances to handle trips to hospitals. “Even the Action Park employees jokingly refer to the place as ‘Traction Park,’” as in broken bones, The New York Times said in 1983. But there were deaths at Action Park: six between 1978, when it opened, and 1996, when it closed. (It reopened under different owners a few years later, only to close and reopen again.) Two deaths occurred within a single week in 1982. One victim was a 15-year-old boy who drowned in the notorious Tidal Wave Pool. The other was a 27-year-old man who was electrocuted on a ride called Kayak Experience. “There was virtually no action taken against” Action Park, said Mr. Porges, the filmmaker. “Eventually it shut down, not because of some regulator who said ‘You’re through.’ But because it went bankrupt.” (The state Labor Department found no violations in the kayak case, but said that electric current from an underwater fan could have caused serious bodily injury.) Mr. Porges, a former editor at Maxim and Popular Mechanics magazines who has a degree in journalism, saw Action Park as a good story. “I’m a journalist by trade,” he said. “I realized this is a great opportunity to apply my trade, so we began to dig. The true story of Action Park — it’s weirder and crazier than the legend.” But it is the nostalgia-tinted legend that remains in people’s memories. Alison Becker, 42, an actress and writer best known for a recurring role on the sitcom “Parks and Recreation,” said the risks at Action Park were part of the appeal. She said she had gone to Six Flags Great Adventure, which is also in New Jersey, and nothing equaled the fear factor at Action Park. “You know the scene in ‘Footloose’ where they’re playing a game of chicken with tractors and going at each other?” said Ms. Becker, who grew up about 30 miles from Action Park in Allamuchy Township. “Most people look at that and say, ‘What dumb kids.’ I look at it and say, ‘That’s like a day at Action Park. They could’ve charged an extra five for that, and we would have paid it.” Action Park was so notorious that there are stories about a test dummy that was sent through a ride before it opened. The dummy came out missing something — its head, in some versions; a leg or an arm in others. Andy Mulvihill, 56, the son of Action Park’s longtime owner, said the tale about the dummy’s head was true. He said he knows this because he was there. He was the first person to go on that ride, he said, after the dummy came out decapitated. “I was wearing my hockey equipment when I did it,” he said. Speed was essential. “If you didn’t have enough speed,” Mr. Mulvihill said, “you’d fall and smash your face, and if you smashed hard enough, you could break your nose or knock out some teeth.” He said that ride was open for only a few weeks at a time. “Generally, the rides were very tame,” he said. “But there were some where you controlled the speed and the action, and if you were reckless, you could get hurt.” Action Park was created by Andy Mulvihill’s father Eugene, whom Mr. Porges described as a “showman-huckster businessman, a mixture of P.T. Barnum and Walt Disney, with a little bit of Trump.” Andy Mulvihill said “the intent certainly was not to make it dangerous.” He also said the deaths did not deter his father, who pleaded guilty to fraud charges related to insurance policies in 1984 and whom the Securities and Exchange Commission banned from the securities business in 1986. “He didn’t build Action Park just to make money,” Mr. Porges said. Nor did he “build Action Park just to break rules,” he said. “He really wanted to create an incredibly fun place. He had a vision for the most fun place in the world, unhindered by common sense or safety. A lot of people romanticize it about him and the park. They say there are too many rules now, too much regulation, stuff used to be fun. Yeah, stuff used to be fun — if you survived.” Andy Mulvihill called the deaths at Action Park “devastating to me.” But he added, “three of those deaths were drownings. We pulled out thousands and thousands of people who were people who had no business in the water.’’ And yet, it was exhilarating. For some, the conversation in the car on the way there “was about who’s going to do this, who’s going to do that, who do you think is going to get hurt,” recalled Kris Brennan, who is now 45 and lives in Westfield. “It wasn’t ‘If someone gets hurt,’ it was ‘Who’s going to get hurt?’” Mr. Brennan had “a chunk of skin taken out of my hip” on the 2,700-foot-long Alpine Slide. “Class Action Park” will probably bring on a flood of memories. But Andy Mulvihill is looking to tell the story his way, and next summer Penguin Books will publish “Action Park: Fast Times, Wild Rides and the Untold Story of America’s Most Dangerous Amusement Park.” He said it was “nonfiction for sure,” even if it read like fiction. “When you do something as crazy, as cutting-edge” as Action Park, he said, “and you put it in the metro New York area, where New Yorkers are pretty much crazy anyway, you have stories.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Porgy and Bess’ Can Offend. Now Try Translating It Into Spanish.,"Minefields abound when translating outdated, sometimes derogatory dialect for the Metropolitan Opera’s seatback titles. “Happy dust,” the powdery white drug at the center of George Gershwin’s “Porgy and Bess,” is rendered in Spanish as “perico,” and in German as “Schnee” — both maintaining the slanginess of the original. But “buckra,” a derogatory word for white men, becomes the more straightforward “blanco” and “die Weissen.” And the cagily mispronounced “abdomen” in “It Ain’t Necessarily So,” the one that rhymes with “home in”? That takes a bit more doing to translate properly — if it’s worth doing at all. Ana Méndez-Oliver and David Paul confronted these and dozens of other linguistic puzzles over the summer as they worked on the titles for “Porgy and Bess,” which returned to the Metropolitan Opera’s repertory on Sept. 23. (It continues through Oct. 16, then comes back for another run in January.) The company’s last staging of the opera closed in 1990, five years before the introduction of seatback titles. Unlike more common supertitles, which live above the stage, the Met’s system allows each operagoer to turn his or her screen on or off — or change the channel to another language. (The Met offers titles in English, Spanish, German and sometimes Italian.) This has necessitated a team of translators, and a host of challenges: The screens only hold 72 characters, and the old-fashioned dot-matrix-style, all-caps format makes accents and diacritics difficult, which is one reason the Met doesn’t offer French titles. “Porgy and Bess” brings its own set of obstacles. To depict the black denizens of Catfish Row, the opera’s coastal-Carolinas setting, the librettists, Ira Gershwin and DuBose Heyward, notoriously used an idiomatic English that was long referred to as “Negro dialect,” an especially uncomfortable strategy given that both writers were white. Charges of cultural appropriation have ebbed and flowed since the work’s premiere in 1935. For many, the titles compound this unease: Hearing Bess give soaring voice to her newfound love can feel different than staring at the words “I’S YOUR WOMAN NOW.” When the Spoleto Festival USA in Charleston, S.C., presented the opera in 2016, it initially opted not to use titles for that reason. “The language is so colloquial that it can feel dated,” Nigel Redden, Spoleto’s general director, said in an interview. “And those words become much more prominent with supertitles.” (Two performances in, however, complaints from audience members who had difficulty understanding the words prompted Mr. Redden to change course and add them.) The discomfort over the written titles is part of the reason the Met got permission from the Gershwin estate to use the slightly modified set of English titles employed at the Glimmerglass Festival in Cooperstown, N.Y., in 2017. These titles use what Paul Cremo, the Met’s dramaturg and the man in charge of its English-language titles, called “more standardized forms of words for easier reading.” He and Mr. Redden both described the original lyrics as something of a pronunciation guide. “Todd Duncan and Anne Brown, the original Porgy and Bess, were classical singers and had to be coached to use this dialect,” Mr. Cremo said. As for the other languages, successful translation can be a matter of swapping out one set of colloquialisms for another. For example, Ms. Méndez-Oliver said, “the lack of verb agreement doesn’t translate into Spanish. That’s not an error we make.” Instead, she relied heavily on contractions and abbreviations: OH, I GOT PLENTY O’ NUTTIN’AND NUTTIN’ PLENTY FOR ME. becomes AY, YO TENGO MUCHO DE NA’Y NADA ES SUFICIENTE PA’ MI. The two contractions — “na’” for “nada” (“nothing”) and “pa’” for “para” (“for”) — are designed to maintain the tone of Gershwin’s lyric while still being comprehensible to a Spanish-language audience. Similarly, the rich daddy and good-looking mama of “Summertime” become a “rico pai” and “guapa mai” (contractions for “papi” and “mami”). Mr. Paul faced a different set of challenges. “The number of German words that are vernacular enough that they don’t pull the viewer out of the story is much smaller,” he said. Instead, he used what can be an additional hurdle — the use of formal versus informal address in German — to his advantage. “When a cop addresses one of the Catfish Row citizens, it shows that class difference even more clearly,” Mr. Paul said. “And so do the informal ways the members of the community then speak to the cops.” All three Met Titles writers stressed the importance of being sparing with their text. “You can’t drown people with titles,” Ms. Méndez-Oliver said. “You want them watching and listening to the opera, not reading it.” (Before “Porgy,” she added, one of her biggest challenges was Nico Muhly’s 2013 opera “Two Boys,” whose text-message-laden libretto often gave her no choice on this front.) And what about that droll but linguistically thorny “It Ain’t Necessarily So” lyric, in which the irreverent Sportin’ Life explains the biblical story of Jonah as follows: FO’ HE MADE HIS HOME INTHAT FISH’S ABDOMEN Well, Ms. Méndez-Oliver swapped out “home” for “casa” and “abdomen” for “panza,” which translates as “belly.” And Mr. Paul gave up on the rhyme altogether: ER MACHTE SEIN ZUHAUSEIN DEM BAUCH DIESES FISCHES (In English, “He made his home in the belly of this fish.”) In other words, it can get complicated. But Mr. Paul said these sorts of note-by-note, syllable-by-syllable dilemmas come into play with all opera translations. He described his work as “translation and interpretation and adaptation all at once.” Seventy-two characters at a time.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Pretenders’ Review: A Little New Wave Love, a Lot of Misogyny","Directed by James Franco and featuring James Franco, this film indulges in a distasteful brand of nostalgia. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Remember that Monty Python sketch about the vicious gangsters the Piranha Brothers? It had this great line, “I’ve seen grown men tear their heads off rather than see Doug.” Anyway, there’s a picture out, “Pretenders,” directed by and featuring James Franco. Written by Josh Boone, it begins in 1979, at a movie, where the bespectacled, lank-haired Terry (Jack Kilmer) has a meet-cute with the beguiling Catherine (Jane Levy). She has the same name as the beguiler in “Jules and Jim,” and resembles Anna Karina, from the movie they saw. Observing Terry fumbling after the show, his classmate Phil (Shameik Moore), commiserates. Thus begins the old cherchez la femme. As nostalgic twaddle goes, “Me and Phil and the New Wave Girl” (I mean “Pretenders”) initially feels like an innocuous treatment of the joys and sorrows of cinephilia and young love. The sort of thing concocted by men whose collegiate experience taught them little beyond how to turn self-serving reminiscences into middling indie movies. Soon, though, it descends into several discrete modes of misogyny. Terry moonily elevates Catherine while Phil treats her with an earthier near-contempt. In the view of the movie, the character has earned both objectifications. The conniving heartbreaker is eventually forced to confront the Damage She Has Done. But she proves to have a postmodern trick up her sleeve. Franco plays a glib director who argues that sexual harassment is necessary to cinematic art. (That Franco has faced real-life allegations of exploitative behavior makes these scenes extra discomfiting.) Juno Temple incarnates another feminine cliché, the grasping harpy.

2019,‘Saturday Night Live’ Gives Julián Castro His Moment,"The cold open was a highlight of this week's episode, which got some help from several A-list stars. Cameos! Cameos! Cameos everywhere! Billy Porter, Woody Harrelson and Lin-Manuel Miranda all showed up in this week’s “Saturday Night Live” cold open, which sent up this week’s CNN town hall on gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender issues featuring Democratic presidential candidates. Porter played an M.C. of sorts who introduced the candidates with his typical energy. The first to take the stage was Chris Redd, who portrayed Senator Cory Booker, the Democrat from New Jersey, who told the audience, “My girlfriend was in ‘Rent’ so yeah, I get it,” a reference to Booker’s significant other, the actress Rosario Dawson. The forum went quickly, with each candidate getting a moment or two — the rare merging of speed dating, comedy and politics. The next to get lampooned was Pete Buttigieg, the openly gay mayor of South Bend, Ind. Buttigieg was again played by Colin Jost, who rarely appears in sketches. In response to an audience member who asked about being “gay in the right way,” Jost said, “There’s no wrong way to be gay. Unless you’re Ellen this week.” This reference was to the daytime television host, Ellen DeGeneres, who recently received flak after being spotted at a football game with the former president George W. Bush. The highlight of the sketch came when Kate McKinnon reprised her role as Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Democrat of Massachusetts. She recreated a viral moment from the forum parodying how Warren would handle someone opposed to same-sex marriage. (At the forum, Warren had a snappy answer: “Well, I’m going to assume it’s a guy who said that. And I’m going to say, then just marry one woman. I’m cool with that. Assuming you can find one.” McKinnon had more comebacks at the ready: “I would say, sir, ‘Tell me your bus stop, because I want to know where you get off.’ What else? ‘If someone doesn’t want to serve gay people at their small business, I bet that’s not the only thing that’s small.’” There was more where that came from. Miranda showed up to play Julián Castro, the former mayor of San Antonio. (This came after an outcry over a previous “S.N.L.” sketch about the Democratic field, in which Castro was left out.) Miranda, a former “S.N.L.” host, started his cameo with, “Well, first of all, gracias. As a Democrat, I want to apologize for not being gay, but I promise to do better in the future.” The sketch was capped off by Harrelson returning to play the former vice president Joe Biden, as he did when he hosted the season premiere two weeks ago. Harrelson sent up Biden’s, let’s say, questionable recent attempts at recall on the campaign trail in response to an audience member’s inquiry: “I’m glad you asked that question and let me answer by telling you a false memory.” “S.N.L.” trained its sights on the recent dust up over the new Todd Phillips film, “Joker,” which tells the origin story of Batman’s most famous archnemesis. In this case, the show reimagined Phillips telling the origin story of another beloved misanthrope: Oscar the Grouch, as in, the one from “Sesame Street.” David Harbour, this week’s host and one of the stars of Netflix’s “Stranger Things,” played Oscar, a down-on-his-luck garbage man who just wants to live in a can, man. There were several brilliant details in this digital short: Bowen Yang playing Guy Smiley of “ABCDEFG News.” Mr. Snuffleupagus, portrayed by Kenan Thompson, who apparently runs a prostitution ring on Sesame Street. Bert (Alex Moffat) and Ernie (Mikey Day) being mugged over a rubber duckie. All good stuff. Jost and Michael Che, the hosts of “Weekend Update,” took their usual aim at President Trump, and particularly focused on the arrests of two associates of Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, this week. But they found some time to tee-off on other topics as well. “Giuliani’s two associates are also very successful entrepreneurs. Igor, the handsome one, owns a club in Ukraine that’s called Mafia Rave, which I think counts as a full confession.” — Jost “First of all, bravo to the casting agency that found these two thumb breakers. They look like they use vodka as cologne. These guys have definitely worn track suits to their daughter’s wedding. I know these are easy jokes but I’m surprised these guys were helping the president and not — I don’t know — helping George Costanza get that Frogger machine across the street.” — Che “Trump then explained withdrawing troops from northern Syria, saying that we didn’t need to defend our Kurdish allies because ‘They didn’t help us in World War II.’ But with World War II, it’s kind of hard to know who Trump means by ‘us.’” — Jost “Joe Biden for the first time called for President Trump to be impeached and removed from office after he realized finally that the ‘Joe Biden’ Trump keeps attacking was him.” — Jost “The owner of the Jacksonville Jaguars announced that he will be a majority investor in a new 24-hour news network aimed at African-American viewers. Unfortunately they’ve named it CNN-Word.” — Che Gosh, the last sketch of the night had everything: a solid premise — “Dog Court.” A great lead character with Cecily Strong playing a Judge Judy-type, presiding over a courtroom that adjudicates canine cases. Lots of cute dogs. The works. And finally, unexpected bit of live TV mayhem, when at one point, Strong held on unruly pug in her hands that didn’t seem to want to be held. Somehow Strong stayed in character and did not break. It was some of the most impressive work of the night.",The New York Times
2019,‘Saturday Night Live’: Matthew Broderick Joins the Trump Team,"The actor portrayed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in this week’s episode, which was hosted by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and featured Taylor Swift as musical guest. Given time, “Saturday Night Live” will eventually find a celebrity impersonator to play every member of the Trump administration. This weekend, “S.N.L.” spun its wheel of fortune (a.k.a. Lorne Michaels’s Rolodex) and landed on Matthew Broderick, who appeared as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a sketch about the White House’s ongoing response to the Ukraine affair and the impeachment inquiry into President Trump. The episode, which was hosted by the “Fleabag” creator and star Phoebe Waller-Bridge and featured the musical guest Taylor Swift, began with a sketch set in the office of Vice President Pence (Beck Bennett). Huddled up with Kate McKinnon (as Rudy Giuliani) and Aidy Bryant (as Attorney General William Barr), Bennett told the group they needed to strategize. “We need to get ahead of this story before it spirals out of control,” he said. “Did you see those text messages they uncovered? “They totally exonerate us,” McKinnon said. “Really?” Bennett asked. “What do they say?” Reading off her phone, Bryant replied, “Well, this one says: I think we should stop texting about the crimes and maybe tell the crimes over the phone so that the crimes don’t leave little crime footprints.” Broderick arrived to deliver a few jokes inspired by his role in “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.” When Bennett observed, “If things go bad for Trump, then I’m president,” Broderick replied, “That’s gonna work out just great. I can’t wait for that to happen. Impeachment moves pretty fast. If you don’t stop and look around, you might miss it.” Broderick also told the group, “I’ve been asking around and I think that this whole impeachment thing could be really bad.” Bennett asked him, “Who told you that?” He answered, “Like, America?” Kenan Thompson appeared as Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development (“I’ve been sitting in my empty office for like three years. Does anybody know what my job is supposed to be?”) and Alex Moffat played President Sauli Niinisto of Finland, still shellshocked after participating in a joint news conference with President Trump. The sketch also featured an appearance from the White House adviser Stephen Miller (actually a puppet of a snake) and, for whatever reason, concluded with McKinnon wearing “Joker” makeup. In her opening monologue, Waller-Bridge extended the victory lap that started two weeks ago at the Emmy Awards, where she won the trophies for lead actress in a comedy and writing for a comedy series and “Fleabag” was named outstanding comedy series. Waller-Bridge said that people often ask her if she is like her protagonist on “Fleabag,” whom she described as “sexually depraved, foul-mouthed and dangerous.” She continued, “And I always have to say to them: ‘Yes, you’re absolutely right.’” She went on to say about the series: “Fleabag” came from a very personal place for me. It began as a way to get Andrew Scott to dress up as a priest and tell me that he loved me. It took me six years and two seasons to achieve it but I did it. I don’t care about awards, I just want gay men to love me. I call the character Priest in the script, but everyone started calling him Hot Priest. Obviously Andrew is hot, but this Priest character caused such a horn-storm. Andrew and I were trying to figure out what it was about him that was driving women so mental. And we boiled it down and realized, it was because he was doing this one thing: listening. Really, really listening. Try it, guys. The premise of this sketch, which presents itself as a parody of a midday TV news program, may not be immediately clear. (Though you do get to hear Waller-Bridge try on an American accent.) But give it a moment, when her anchorwoman character details a series of gas-station robberies and points out that the suspect is a white male — and her co-anchors, played by Kenan Thompson and Ego Nwodim, celebrate noticeably in the background. “We’re just glad that we know what the criminal looks like,” Thompson says, adding, under his breath: “And he ain’t one of us.” A battle of sorts escalates between the show’s white anchors and black anchors, and also draws in the show’s meteorologist (Chris Redd), who tries to argue that a hurricane named Chet has “a white man’s name if I’ve ever heard one.” At the “Weekend Update” desk, the anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che continued to riff on the impeachment inquiry into Trump. Jost: As impeachment gains momentum, President Trump said he may stop referring to the media as fake news and start calling them corrupt news. And the media said they may stop referring to him as President Trump, and start calling him former President Trump. Trump then brushed off any concerns about impeachment, saying, I’m used to it, it’s like putting on a suit. Meaning it’s a massive daily struggle that takes up most of his morning. And this week, we started seeing evidence of the White House covering up the Ukraine scandal, like, one not-at-all-suspicious text that said there were no quid pro quos of any kind. Unfortunately, the next text was the wink emoji, cash emoji, crazy wink emoji and then the Giuliani emoji. [actually a vampire emoji] Che: Trump keeps saying there was no quid pro quo, which can only mean there was mad quid pro quo. Whenever a guy with like a 30-word vocabulary starts quoting the law in Latin, it’s because he breaks that law all the time. That’s only something you can learn the hard way. Just like there’s guys who can barely count but can somehow tell you exactly how much cocaine you can get caught with before it’s considered trafficking. That’s three grams, by the way. McKinnon reprised her role as Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator and contender for the Democratic presidential nomination. After being congratulated by Jost for all the money she had raised from small donors, McKinnon replied, “That’s right. That’s grass roots. And guess what, mama loves to garden. That’s why every day I spend four hours taking selfies with every Warby Parker customer in America.” McKinnon also feigned dismay at Jost’s observation that wealthier donors were uncomfortable with her. “The billionaires don’t like me? Oh no,” she said. “I’m going to tell you the same thing my grandson told me when he took me to ‘Avengers: Infinity War’ — this ain’t for you. But then again, taking big checks from Wall Street worked out great for the last lady running for president. Let me just skip Wisconsin and change my name to Emails Benghazi while I’m at it.” Bowen Yang, an “S.N.L.” writer who was promoted to a featured performer this season, made a lasting impression as a Chinese trade representative who was basking in all the attention he was enjoying amid the trade war between his country and the United States. As he explained to Che, “I’m running tariffs, so this is my time,” Yang said. “I’m having my moment. I’m basically the Lizzo of China of now. And it turns out I’m 100 percent that trade daddy.” When Che asked him if he feared a recession, Yang replied, “No, way, Sam. In fact we just waived our tariff on American soybeans so save some of your tempeh for us, Mackenzie.” “Who’s Mackenzie?” Che said. Yang replied, “Probably some sophomore at Vassar who drinks out of a metal straw and it’s such a performance.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Semper Fi’ Review: A Misty-Eyed Ode to Male Bonding,"Henry-Alex Rubin’s film follows five longtime friends who behave like nitwits when one of their number goes to jail. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. In Henry-Alex Rubin’s “Semper Fi,” men are men, women are props and brotherhood — whether literal or figurative — is everything. Virtually sweating testosterone from every frame, the movie follows five longtime friends as they bicker, drink and roughhouse their way through a story that purports to be about honor and is really about stupidity. At its center is Cal (Jai Courtney), a stiff-jawed police officer and, like his friends, a Marine Corps reservist. When not bowling, boozing or playing weekend warrior, Cal is pulling his younger half brother, Oyster (Nat Wolff), out of scrapes. A numbskull with a gigantic chip on his shoulder, Oyster can barely walk the length of himself without picking a fight. When a bar brawl sends Oyster to prison for 25 years, the plot finally kicks into gear as Cal and his friends grapple with a traumatic tour in Iraq. Back home, they learn that Oyster is not doing well in the pokey; obviously, the only solution is to break him out. “Semper Fi” purveys a very specific notion of clichéd, rah-rah masculinity, one in which fidelity to one’s crew supersedes all other obligations — including following the law. Written by Rubin and Sean Mullin, a former Army captain, this misty-eyed ode to male bonding might be heartfelt, but is so preposterously plotted that it’s impossible to take seriously. By contrast, the casual authenticity of a scene in a veterans’ rehab center reminds us that Rubin’s tough little documentary about rugby-playing quadriplegics, “Murderball” (2005), worked in part because it so deftly avoided sentiment. This one, however, feels like one gigantic group hug. Semper Fi Rated R for cursing, fighting and broken limbs. Running time: 1 hour 39 minutes.

When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. After the artist Prune Nourry received a diagnosis of breast cancer in 2016 at age 31, her experiences of treatment began to inform her art. “Serendipity” is both a document and an extension of that process — a self-portrait in which Nourry showcases past projects and explores how her artistic impulses evolved. Nourry draws connections with previous artworks she made on fertility.

Another of Nourry’s projects in recent years, Terracotta Daughters, puts a gender switch on a Chinese tradition of male terra-cotta soldiers. A sculpture army of terra-cotta girls was buried in 2015, with an excavation set for 2030. In the film, Nourry remarks that she wants the pieces to be unearthed in accordance with her wishes if she isn’t around. Nourry likens working in sculpture to a superpower — a way of healing with her hands. Unsurprisingly, “Serendipity” can be an extremely intimate documentary, but there are other times when it is curiously remote in elucidating Nourry’s artistic intentions. This is not a criticism. Too much demystification might spoil the art, and the film makes clear that Nourry often sees purpose in her instincts retrospectively.

2019,"‘Sesame Street,’ With Its Five-Decade Library, Moves to HBO Max","“Sesame Street” is moving to a new streaming home. New episodes of the 50-year-old children’s television franchise will appear first on HBO Max, the streaming app from Warner Media that will debut next year, the company announced on Thursday. And for the first time, much of the enormous back library of “Sesame Street” will also be available to watch on HBO Max. Since 2015, new episodes of “Sesame Street” have appeared first on HBO and the premium cable channel’s streaming platforms. The new five-year deal moves the show to the broader streaming platform, which will include HBO’s programming along with Warner Bros. movies and reruns of classic series like “Friends” and “The Big Bang Theory.” PBS will remain the free, over-the-air outlet for “Sesame Street.” New episodes will appear there roughly nine months after they premiere on HBO Max. Financial terms were not disclosed. Warner Media, which is owned by AT&T, is expected to announce a subscription price for HBO Max this month. Most industry analysts expect it will be at least $15 a month, the current price of HBO. As the so-called streaming wars heat up, children’s programming has become one of the most competitive fronts. Netflix has started production on cartoons, children’s sitcoms and animated movies, to add to its already giant library of original children’s content. Apple has its own arrangement with Sesame Workshop for two series to debut next month. Amazon also licenses plenty of children’s content. And next month will bring Disney Plus, with its enormously popular library of content available for $7 a month. The “Sesame Street” archive available on HBO Max will include more than 4,500 episodes. Steve Youngwood, Sesame Workshop’s chief operating officer, said it was not likely that every episode ever made would be available. “We’re trying to figure out the best way to curate it so people can relive, or live for the first time, with 50 years of ‘Sesame Street’ but not in such an overwhelming way that people can’t navigate it,” he said in an interview. When Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit that makes “Sesame Street,” teamed up with HBO in 2015, some criticized it for putting first-run episodes on a pricey cable channel known for shows with graphic sex and violence. Some children’s organizations have also expressed concern that Sesame Workshop was favoring families that can afford HBO over ones that cannot. “Sadly, HBO is holding hostage underprivileged families from having access to timely first-run episodes of perhaps the single most educational children’s franchise in the history of electronic media,” Tim Winter, the president of the Parents Television Council, said in a statement on Thursday. But the 2015 HBO deal was something of a lifeline to the nonprofit, which was facing difficult funding headwinds. Sesame Workshop will also make new series for HBO, including some specials, animated series and a riff on a late-night talk show hosted by Elmo. All new series will also eventually appear on PBS. For the talk show, Sesame Workshop hopes to appeal to a more adult-oriented audience as well as children, Mr. Youngwood said. “This is the first show we’ve done that is kid appropriate but is putting family appeal first instead of just kids first,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,‘Shame on Him’: Evangelicals Call Out Trump on Syria,"Some of the president’s most ardent supporters worry that troop withdrawal threatens religious minorities, especially Christians. They are pushing back, to a point. One called President Trump’s decision “an egregious act of betrayal.” Another said the policy could be “the biggest mistake of his presidency.” A third said Mr. Trump “is in danger of losing the mandate of heaven.” Conservative Christians have ardently stood by Mr. Trump at most every turn, from allegations of sexual misconduct to his policy of separating migrant families at the border and the Russia investigation. But this week, some of Mr. Trump’s top evangelical supporters broke rank to raise alarms over his move to withdraw troops from Syria, which prompted Turkish forces to launch a ground and air assault against a Kurdish-led militia that has been a crucial ally in the American fight against ISIS. As Turkish warplanes began to bomb Syrian towns on Wednesday, the prominent evangelist Franklin Graham called for Mr. Trump to reconsider his decision, and worried that the Kurds — and the Christian minorities in the region they have defended — could be annihilated. “We have many friends in the Kurdish areas,” said Mr. Graham, whose humanitarian organization, Samaritan’s Purse, has done relief work in the region. “We know people on the ground.” The concern resonated for many conservative evangelicals who have supported Mr. Trump, and called into question his much-touted commitment to religious freedom, a top value for his base. The opposition has arrived at an inopportune time for the president. The administration is weathering a heated battle with Congress, and according to a Fox News poll, more than half of voters now support the president’s impeachment. Tony Perkins, who leads the Family Research Council, is calling on the administration to actively demonstrate its support for persecuted religious minorities in the aftermath of the withdrawal. “This is inconsistent with what the president has done,” he said. Erick Erickson, a well-known conservative evangelical blogger, wrote on Twitter that Mr. Trump had committed “an egregious act of betrayal” to the Kurds. “Shame on him,” he said. Pat Robertson, founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network, said he was “appalled” by the president’s decision, and added that “the president of the United States is in great danger of losing the mandate of heaven if he permits this to happen.” Senator Lindsey Graham, who rarely breaks with the president, said it could be “the biggest mistake of his presidency.” Current disappointment is unlikely to translate into substantial or lasting opposition. And not all evangelical supporters have taken issue with Mr. Trump’s decision. Robert Jeffress, pastor of First Baptist Dallas and a prominent supporter of Mr. Trump, said he “happily” deferred to the commander in chief, and he praised Mr. Trump for carrying through on a campaign promise to end American involvement in Middle Eastern conflicts. “Some evangelicals may disagree with the president’s decision,” Mr. Jeffress said, “but I guarantee you there is not one evangelical supporter of the president who would switch their vote and support Elizabeth Warren or Joe Biden over a Syria decision.” Franklin Graham stopped short of condemning Mr. Trump’s policy outright. The evangelist said he communicated with the president or vice president — he would not specify which leader — about the troop withdrawal within the last 48 hours, and said he ultimately deferred to their determinations. He declined to give specifics of his conversation. “There are so many other issues at stake here,” he said, listing things such as Turkey’s membership in NATO and U.S. military bases in the country. “It is a very hard decision.” Mr. Perkins pointed to the administration’s other efforts for religious freedom, and said that “one incident doesn’t make an administration.” Religious freedom, like anti-abortion policy and conservative judges, has often been a point of pride for many of Mr. Trump’s supporters. At the United Nations last month, Mr. Trump earned praise from supporters for highlighting religious freedom instead of prioritizing a major climate summit. As Mr. Trump’s call with the president of Ukraine roiled Washington last week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, an evangelical who often weaves together Christianity and foreign policy, spoke on religious freedom in Rome. This summer, around the time of the Mueller hearings on Capitol Hill, the State Department convened a celebrated gathering to advance global religious freedom. Conservative Christians can point to the administration’s priority of defending religious freedom, but action and policy are more revealing than words, said Meighan Stone, an evangelical Christian and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “If this administration can’t be good allies to the Kurds in this battle, where is this policy that is supposed to be protecting persecuted religious minorities around the world?” she asked. “It is nonexistent.” When asked about human rights abuses of non-Christian communities, or in regions that are not as tied to biblical history — for example, how China has targeted Uighurs and other largely Muslim minorities in the autonomous region of Xinjiang — Mr. Graham demurred. “I am not familiar with these people,” Mr. Graham said of the Uighurs, noting that he had not visited the region. “I’d certainly condemn China for, it’s not just the Uighurs, they’ve been destroying churches.” Churches across Christian traditions — Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant — often share spiritual and personal ties to congregations in the Middle East, praying for their pastors or families by name, or inviting them to speak when they visit the United States. Many church leaders galvanized support in 2014 when ISIS fighters targeted, killed and raped fleeing religious minorities, including Christians and Yazidis. Now, that fear is remerging and motivating evangelical alarm, explained Jeremy Courtney, who leads a relief effort called Preemptive Love that works in northeastern Syria and in the Al Hol tent camp, which has been described as a growing hotbed of ISIS fighters and their families. “Another way to view it is Christian self-interest, that if ISIS reconstitutes, then there will be another ISIS genocide against Christians, and maybe Arabs get killed, maybe Yazidis will get killed, but the subtle undercurrent is that maybe Christians will get killed,” said Mr. Courtney, who was raised as an evangelical in Texas and has lived north of Baghdad for almost 13 years. “That is a legitimate concern, it is just disturbing to me,” he said. “Christians speaking out on this should be concerned about the Muslims who will lose their lives because of this policy as well.” The troop withdrawal in Syria is likely to be a topic of conversation this weekend at the Values Voter Summit in Washington, where President Trump is scheduled to speak to hundreds of conservative leaders. At the event, the evangelical pastor Andrew Brunson, whom Turkey accused of spying and detained for two years, will receive an award marking the one-year anniversary of his release. For many conservative Christians, Mr. Brunson has become a symbol of the Trump administration’s commitment to protecting persecuted Christians in unfriendly regions. This week, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that America’s relationship with Turkey “has been very good.” In a phone call on Thursday evening, Mr. Brunson said the decision to withdraw troops from Syria and the ensuing Turkish attack have left him “distressed.” He spoke of the refugees he met working in the Syrian-Turkish border region, including friends who had converted to Christianity and who were currently in Kobani, a Syrian town now under Turkish assault. “I don’t think Turkey is a friend of the West anymore,” Mr. Brunson said. “This is a point of great concern to me, obviously.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘She Was Like That,’ by Kate Walbert: An Excerpt","When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Ginny had promised to take the girls to M&M World, that ridiculous place in Times Square they had passed too often in a taxi, Maggie scooting to press her face to the glass to watch the giant smiling M&M scale the Empire State Building on the electronic billboard and wave from the spire, its color dissolving yellow, then blue, then red, then yellow again. She had promised. “Promised,” Olivia said, her face twisted into the expression she reserved for moments of betrayal. “Please,” Olivia whined. “You said ‘spring.’” She had said“spring.” This she remembered, and it was spring, or almost. Spring enough. Spring advancing, the trees newly budded, the air peppery. Regardless, it felt too early to go home when the light shone this strongly, slanting across Central Park in the way of late March, early April; plus, the city had already collectively sprung forward. Spring has sprung, the grass has ris’. “All right,” she found herself saying.“Just once. Today. Just once. This is it.” Breaking her resolution to stop qualifying — five more minutes, this last page, one more bite — and wishing, mid-speech, she would stop. She has tried. Just as she has tried to be more easygoing, but when push comes to shove, as it always will, she is not easygoing. And she qualifies. It’s a verbal tic: first this and then that. A constant negotiation — action then reward, or promise of reward. What is it that the books say? Screw the books. She takes the girls’ hands and holds tight, changing course, crossing Central Park West to Central Park South. The girls suddenly delighted, and delightful, straining ahead, buoyant. They are gorgeous, bright-eyed, brilliant girls: one tall, one short, pant legs dragging, torn leggings, sneakers that glow in the dark or light up with each step, boom boom boom. They break free and race across, bounding onto the sidewalk, their hands rejoined like paper cutouts, zigzagging here, zigzagging there, Maggie clutching Zoom Zoom with her free hand, choking the thing, its dangly legs and arms, its floppy, flattened ears. [ Return to the review of “She was Like That.” ] Ginny follows them quickly, remembering how her heart would literally stop as Olivia — then what? four? five? — would run to this same corner, the light not yet changed. Her daughter had only to step into traffic, to veer off the curb. She never did. Olivia climbed the stone seals at seal park in Chelsea, the bronze bears in the playground outside the Metropolitan Museum; she teetered on their heads and could so easily have slipped — she did slip, once, but it was nothing. Still, Ginny had to wake her every hour that night, shake her out of her sleepy fog. “Who am I?” Ginny had said, Olivia’s blue princess pajamas silky beneath her grip, Olivia’s shoulders so thin.“Mommy?” Olivia said, squinting, pupils the right size, shrinking: constricting or contracting, she never knew which, but, whatever, correctly — she was fine. And then, a bit older, those other sneakers — wheelies? heelies? — and Olivia careering along the sidewalk, wheels where the heels should be, the speed! And downhill, too, with nothing to hold on to, no way to stop. The pediatrician had said the most dangerous thing was trampolines, even with nets. And then the rented house that summer had one, netless, in the backyard. She had watched as the girls bounced higher and higher. She couldn’t get them off, Olivia and now Maggie, just like her big sister. She had stood vigil at the window, or next to the rail in her hat and long sleeves buttoned at the wrist, the girls slathered with sunscreen. The point is, her heart stuck in her throat, always in her throat. Ginny hurries to catch up. One has tripped the other acciden- tally on purpose and now the other howls as if singed with fire. “Stop it,” Ginny hisses.“Right now. Period. Stop it or no M&M World.” They stop, Olivia smiling to clear the air, though the air stinks: they’re near a line of carriages and their horses. “Please,” Maggie’s saying. “Please. Please.” And so they circle around, petting Blackie, petting Whitey, petting Gummie with the drippy nostrils, the one the driver says loves sugar — “Yes, yes, next time we’ll bring a sugar cube” — and Whinny and Happy and the other one, its long yellow teeth reminding her: she needs to bleach. Suddenly everyone’s teeth are whiter than her own; they wear them like necklaces. And their faces, too, seem suspiciously doctored, first one line then another magically evaporating, a whole generation of women paying for erasure. “Ouch,” Maggie says. She holds one hand flat as instructed, the brown carrot there, a gift from the driver. The driver laughs. “No danger,” he says. The horse roots and chews. “You’re fine,” Ginny says. She strokes the soft hair of the horse’s muzzle, the horse nuzzling Maggie’s tiny palm; it wears a hat with a feathered plume, as if it had trotted here from the stables of a fallen tsar. Ginny leans into its solid skull, and the horse stares back at her with a huge watery eye. Where am I? it wonders, or something equivalent, and she thinks of the whale in Patagonia that asked the same thing. This was years ago, before the girls were born, when she and the girls’ father took a trip to Chile. They were there for vacation; there to see animals. Animals had been promised, including whales. A center existed, manned by earnest students, young men and women from all over the world who spoke Spanish beautifully and wore thin silver bracelets with a symbol that meant something. They piloted the boats and explained to the tourists the seriousness of the venture, the need for extra donations. The tourists kept quiet, mostly, standing on the side of the boat where they’d been told to stand, given the radar and various other instruments that would determine the location of the whales — sometimes a female with a calf or two or, rarer, a male on its own. The whales communicated over great distances, as everyone knew, but the students could intercept their communications, or decipher them: regardless, somehow the students knew what the whales were saying, or might be saying, and so could steer the boat in the right direction, where, for a fee, the tourists could take pictures of the whale surfacing or of the plume of water from the blowhole, or sometimes, even, if the tourists were very lucky, of a whale jumping gracefully as if showing off. On this particular voyage, the one Ginny found herself on with the girls’ father, Ginny chose to stay on the side of the boat with more shade. She was hot, she told the girls’ father. He could call her if anything exciting happened. She had opened her book: War and Peace, a paperback edition she had picked up in the paperback exchange in Santiago, where they had stayed for a few days before heading south. She had been at a good part, a really good part, and so perhaps it took some time for the whale to get her attention. She had had, when she later thought about it, the feeling of being watched. And so she had looked up from her place in War and Peace and seen the whale, a female, she would learn, uncharacteristically alone, lolling before her on the surface of the water. She folded the corner of her page and stood, shading her eyes; then she walked to the boat rail to get a better look. She didn’t call the girls’ father; she didn’t call anyone. She looked down at the whale. It lay on its side, staring with one eye straight at Ginny, drifting alone in its disappearing sea, the sun burning both of them, beaming through the torn shreds of the shredded atmosphere. They stayed like that for a while, Ginny convinced that the whale had a message to deliver, something she might translate and convey to the world. But she never figured out what, since too soon someone from the other side saw it and the whale was gone. “Mother!” Maggie’s saying. Ginny pulls away from the solid skull of the horse and turns back to her youngest. “You weren’t listening,” Maggie is saying. “Was so,” Ginny says. “Then can I?” Maggie says. Ginny bends down to kiss Maggie’s head, the part between the plastic barrettes that Maggie repeatedly refastens each morning, wanting to look, she says, “right.” Maggie’s hair smells delicious. “No,” she says. Maggie stomps her foot; she’s pushed Zoom Zoom deep in her pocket, its strange face, not quite rabbit, not quite anything else—“it’s extinct,” Maggie once said—just above the fold. “I love you,” Ginny says. “You’re beautiful.” “What about me?” Olivia says. She has been standing next to Ginny, as quiet as a stone. “You, too, sweetheart,” she says, pulling her oldest in.“You, too.” ————— There are other things to fix, not just her yellow teeth. She needs some spots removed from her skin; she needs to dye her gray roots, the stubborn tuft that refuses to blend. She could use something for her posture — Pilates — and she’s overdue a mammogram, a bone scan, a colonoscopy. She needs a new coat, an elegant one like those she’s seen on other mothers, something stylish to go with the other stylish clothes she means to buy, and the boots, the right boots, not just the galoshes she’s slipped on every morning all winter; it’s spring now, isn’t it? She should pay to have her toes soaked, her feet scrubbed of dead skin. She could choose a bright color of nail polish, a hip color, a dark purple or maybe even that shade of brown. She should take a class — philosophy, religion, vegan cooking — and wear sandals there, the new kind, with the straps that wrap the ankle or twist all the way to midcalf, her brown toenails shiny smooth, as if dipped in oil. There are posters on the subway and numbers to call. She writes down the websites in the notebook she carries for such things: lists, reminders. But she is constantly out of time, losing track, forgetting. Sunday’s Monday evening, then Wednesday vanishes altogether. [ Return to the review of “She was Like That.” ] M&M World looms in the distance, the electronic billboard — m&m’s World — as bright as a beacon. They hurry down Broadway. At Fifty-first, Olivia claims she can see the waving M&M hanging from the spire of the Empire State Building. “It’s blue!” she says. “Where? Where?” Maggie says. “No, it’s green!” she says. “Where?” Maggie says, hopping. She’s suddenly furious. “I can’t see! Lift me!” “Be patient,” Ginny says. She takes Maggie’s hand and pulls her along. Olivia is in front, swimming upstream, parting the crowds. Hallelujah to the end of the hideous winter: blackened snowdrifts and dog shit and lost gloves. The city erupts, oozes, overflows; everyone is outdoors, walking quickly or standing on the corner checking phones, dialing phones, speaking on phones. “Where?” someone is saying. “You’re breaking up.” “Olivia?” she yells; she doesn’t see her. Olivia has stopped in front of a store window: snow globes and hats and luggage on wheels, a rack of I New York T-shirts, electronic gadgets. She is suddenly taller when she turns back around, her face complicated. “I’m here, Mom,” she says. “Don’t scare me.” “It’s the new kind.” “I can’t,” Ginny says. “We’ve got to—” Maggie’s pulling her hand. “Mister Softee!” she’s saying. Christ, already? The truck? “Please?” Maggie says. “Not today,” Ginny says. “Did you see it?” Olivia’s saying. “Just a minute,” she says to Maggie.“What?” she says to Olivia. “Please? It’s a special day, isn’t it?” Maggie’s saying.“It’s spring. You said.” Ginny turns to Maggie. In Maggie’s smile are four missing teeth, each one saved and wrapped in tinfoil in her Tooth Fairy Box. She plans on blowing her wad all at once: fifteen teeth — or are there more? — beneath her pillow, precious little things although three have already been patched for cavities, the dentist wondering how vigilant Ginny has been about flossing, the amount of candy consumed.“Remarkably so and hardly any,” Ginny had said at the last appointment. “It’s a mystery.” “Next time,” she says now to Maggie. “Enough’s enough.” “It’s the new kind,” Olivia is saying. Maggie looks up. “Please,” she says, her teeth tiny pearls. “Mom!” Olivia says. “Oh, all right,” Ginny says. “Just this once. Not again. Only because it’s spring. This is it.” “Thanks, Mom,” Maggie says, smiling. “What?” Olivia says. “Ice cream!” Maggie says. They high-five and dance around Ginny’s knees. —————— Ginny had kept a list of the animals of Patagonia. The ones that interested her. There were the penguins, of course, an entire colony that was completely tame. They had never been hunted and it was as simple as that, the guide had said, she and the girls’ father stooping, squatting to watch them furiously building their nests: the mating season had ended and now they were preparing for eggs. There were some, too, that were not well. Those stood on the outside of the colonies looking in; sometimes small crowds of other penguins gathered around them and nosed them toward the water, a not so subtle suggestion, the guide had said, that they might be better off drowned. Brutal nature, the girls’ father had said. There were the lizards and the guanacos and the numerous birds, the elephant seals they’d watched from a cliff top, the males fighting over a female that lay on its side, clueless or, rather, help- less. Brutal nature, she had said, and the girls’ father had laughed, and in that instant, and this is true, a rainbow had appeared — it was that kind of weather — the arc stretching from one end of the ocean to the other, and she had taken his hand and said,“Yes.” She thought she was ready. Children, she had said. Dozens of them. —————— There are even more people farther on, in Times Square, though the cars have been blocked and so there’s that, at least — one less thing. They’ll finish their ice creams here before turning back toward the store, Ginny says, maneuvering the girls around the tables and chairs, the feet, the flocks of pigeons, the remnants of lunches consumed. Men and women she may or may not recognize — movie stars, rappers, models — loom above them, magnified a thousand percent, their eyes the size of swimming pools, their teeth cliff walls she could hide behind or possibly dwell in, like the Anasazi, chiseling toeholds so she might scale down at night to forage. The movie stars, rappers, and models are invariably smiling, cheerful; some sing or dance, the women with suggestive postures, the men in dark glasses and fur coats. Everyone is moving, gyrating, blinking, flashing. Tourists sit on the new risers watching nothing or everything, looking down, from time to time, to study their guidebooks. The breeze picks up, eddying ticket stubs and wrappers and waxed paper and brown bags and plastic straws and whatever else has been left behind. Shameless, this litter: if she ran the world. Recently, a flock of plastic bags has caught in the spindly sycamore in front of their apartment, empty bags that inflate and deflate with the wind like marooned sailing ships. They are what she sees when she looks out the living room window, which, truth be told, she does more often now than she should. It’s as if she were trying to remember something that she’d forgotten, as if there were someone she was supposed to call. She stands at the window and looks, the plastic bags inflating, deflating. Alive, somehow, mocking her or maybe just reminding her — a cosmological message. From whom? Of what? “Mother!” Olivia yells. Maggie, halfway between Ginny and Olivia, is on the pavement, clutching her knee.“Mister Softee!” she’s saying. “My cone!” Ginny is next to her before she knows it, pushing up Maggie’s ragged leggings to expose the skin, stroking her hair. Strangers gather dumbly.“We’re fine,” Ginny says. “Thank you. She’s fine.” She blows on the scraped place, red and scratched raw but not bleeding — they were racing, they were almost tied, Olivia’s explaining. Maggie’s ice cream is upturned and melting in the street, a ruination. Maggie cannot speak for sobbing. “Sweetheart,” Ginny’s saying, stroking her hair. “It’s okay, sweetheart. We’ll find another truck. We’ll get a new one. We’ll get another.” Olivia licks her cone, listening. “Then I want another one, too,” she says. —————— The place is jammed and loud. There are vats of brightly colored M&M’s everywhere, M&M’s crammed in plastic tubes spiraling to the ceiling. There are M&M T-shirts and M&M mugs and M&M tote bags and stuffed M&M men, or whatever they’re called (M&M guys? M&M characters?), and M&M pillows and M&M beach towels and M&M statues and M&M key rings and M&M snow globes and M&M plates and M&M puzzles and M&M umbrellas. The employees, dressed in M&M colors, dance and sing along — for minimum wage? — to a song Ginny recognizes, a song she’s heard played continuously on the radio station that Olivia listens to in her room now, the door mostly closed. It’s the voice, Olivia pointed out, of one of the men on the billboards, one of the men swathed in fur — or maybe he was the guy in the suit. Ginny can’t remember, her head already clogged, her eyes watering. It is hot in here, the air-conditioning not yet on, the heat remembering winter. The girls stand on either side of her, transfixed. Maggie’s tears have been wiped dry, a Band- Aid found in the deep recesses of Ginny’s purse, the wound, as Maggie called it, cleaned with a hand wipe, then kissed for good luck. Only Big Sister could do that part — wiggling her fingers first to conjure the fairy dust that only Big Sister could conjure. A fairy dust invisible to mothers, its healing powers a mystery, like phoenix tears, Olivia said. Or Zoom Zoom, Maggie said. “Can we, please?” Olivia asks now. She has seen the sign directing customers up, by way of the escalator, to the second floor, where a life-size M&M waits like Santa Claus, available for photographs. “All right,” Ginny says.“Just this once. Because we’re here. But not if there’s a line.” “Yeah!” the girls say. Olivia takes Maggie’s hand and leads the way. Ginny watches them step onto the escalator with their identical ponytails, their small shoulders, their fleeces tied around their waists. From the moment they were born, they looked like her or they looked like their father, or, sometimes, they looked like a combination of both: her hair and his eyes, his mouth and her nose, her chin and his smile. But from behind now they look just like little girls: sisters in a portrait, or Renoir’s beauties in flat black hats, poppies sprung from their ballet shoes. They are timeless, somehow, though too fast growing. “Zoom Zoom is shrinking,” Maggie had said.“Wasn’t Zoom Zoom once bigger?” They ascend and Ginny feels the catch of love unbearable: she never imagined this, she thinks, her heart suddenly thudding, as if stepping down a stair or two, hard, and then a pause and then another thump, or a clump, her heart clumping down the stairs — caffeine, maybe, or nerves. She follows them up but they are already out of sight. The crowds thick, people speaking different languages, laughing, danc- ing with the employees. Where is she? What is this? At the top of the stairs, Olivia waits to show her. “Look!” she says, holding up a green Statue of Liberty M&M. “You pull the torch.” “Cool,” Ginny says. “Are you looking?” Olivia says. “The torch!” “I saw,” Ginny says. “It’s cool.” “And they have purple ones.” “Cool.” “Can we get some?” “Where’s your sister?” “With the guy. Can we get some?” “What?” “The purple ones! They’re grape!” —————— She and the girls’ father had discussed at length how to explain it to them. He had thought it best to be as honest as possible, to sit them down and simply tell them that he was moving out. “They’re old enough,” he had said. They’re too young, she’d said. She could barely look at him. He was all secrets; they slid around beneath his expression like tectonic plates. He was all the things he wouldn’t say to her that she wanted to know, all deception and cunning. It made her crazy to look at him and so she stared at her feet, at her ubiquitous galoshes. At least she should find some more contemporary ones, the ones with the thick matching socks turned down over the top, the ones in strong solid colors that came from the British Isles or somewhere — Brittany? — and suggested other lives, lives spent mucking stalls or milking cows, or even striding with a fishing rod and a rough-hewn basket through streams where the trout still ran as they once had, before, in other places, they grew strange scales and forgot to spawn; lives spent striding and oblivious of the wet, oblivious of the hard stones that would have pierced the soles of lesser girls. Boots that suggested strength or, at the very least, a day’s catch. “It’s not like they don’t get the concept,” he had said. She looked up at his face and squinted, and the girls were there, too: in his eyes, his eyebrows. “Maggie!” Ginny shouts. She can’t see her. The line for a photograph with the M&M is endless, and she can’t see Maggie anywhere. “What guy?” Ginny asks, turning to Olivia. “What do you mean, ‘the guy’?” “I didn’t say that,” Olivia said. “I don’t know. She was here a minute ago.” “Where?” “Right here,” Olivia says, and starts to cry. “Don’t,” Ginny says.“We’ll find her. Please. She wouldn’t just disappear. She’s got to be somewhere. Maggie!” “Maggie!” Olivia says. “Maggie!” Ginny says. —————— There are too many people in M&M World. There should be some requirements, some restrictions. She’s quite sure that numer- ous fire codes are being broken. She plans to write a letter, to get someone’s attention — she’ll call 311. There are hundreds of people, if not thousands, in this place. How can anyone see a thing? She looks around at the racks, the ascending columns of stuff, the stacks and piles beneath the garish lights, and she suddenly thinks she spots Maggie, but it’s not her; it’s another child. She yanks Olivia here and there. “Maggie!” she calls. She is trying to remain calm. She’ll find an employee in a minute; there must be an intercom system.“Maggie!” This must happen all the time, as it does at Disney World and places like that. The store can automatically lock the doors. “Maggie!” She sees an employee, a girl no more than seventeen or eighteen in M&M green with a pierced nose and spiky blond hair.“My daughter,” she says, breathless, flagging her.“She’s gone.” The girl’s name tag says Wendy, Kalamazoo, michigan. Thank God, a midwesterner. “I mean, she was with me. And now I don’t know where she is.” “Was she here?” Wendy says. “Yes, she was. With me. And I can’t—” Ginny breaks away. “Jesus, is there someone else?” “I’ll help you find her,” Wendy says. “Is there a manager?” “Don’t panic,” Wendy says. “I’ve got to—” “Barbara,” Wendy is saying into some kind of apparatus she’s wearing around her neck. —————— She and the girls’ father sat across from each other at the kitchen table, the light above them harsh, the hour late. From time to time, an ambulance sirened by, or someone shouted in the street; it was the weekend. The girls slept in the other room, Olivia with the quilt wrapping her ankles — she tossed and turned — and Maggie with Zoom Zoom and her other animals positioned around her. Zoom Zoom in the doll cradle, perhaps, or tucked in a towel on the floor, its head on a pincushion or a neatly folded Kleenex. [ Return to the review of “She was Like That.” ] He talked and talked. She needed a change in subject; she needed to go to bed. It was all so banal, wasn’t it? So ordinary? Predictable? An intern? A true love? She looked down at her unvarnished nails: in college she had worn leather moccasins and, on occasion, feathers in her ears; she’d won a prize for her dissertation. Most days, she carried a tote bag, black, with the name of her favorite nonprofit in white. She listened for a while, and then she did not. Then she said, “Maybe we could tell them it’s like what happens when they argue about the fort. How they each want to push the other out of the fort, how there’s never enough room in the fort. We could tell them you’re taking a break from the fort,” she said. “All right,” he said. “This, of course, makes me the fort,” she said. “You are not the fort,” he said. “I was joking,” she said. Outside, a bottle shattered. “But they might understand the thing about the fort,” she said. “All right,” he said. “They might,” she said. “That’s good,” he said. —————— “Maggie!” Ginny yells. She feels Wendy touch her arm, right behind her. “Don’t leave,” Wendy says. “That’s the first thing.” “What?” “Don’t go out of sight.” “She’s out of sight,” Ginny says.“My daughter. She’s five years old. Please.” Olivia cries beside her. “I’m sorry,” Olivia says. “It’s my fault.” “It’s not your fault,” Ginny says. “Sweetheart, it’s not your — Maggie!” Now Ginny’s screaming, her voice swallowed by the wall of sound, the same song, the same rapper, repeatedly singing. Customers stop browsing, unsure what to do. They step back and multiply, as if viewing an accident. Wendy is speaking into the gadget around her neck. She looks up. “Barbara’s on her way,” she says, as if delivering good news. “She was in inventory.” After the whale swam away — disappeared, really — Ginny couldn’t quite explain to the girls’ father why she hadn’t called him immediately. He had promised to call her, he said, so why hadn’t she called him? He had been just on the other side of the boat; he had the camera, after all. He hadn’t seen a thing, he said. By the time he heard the other tourists shouting, the hubbub, the whale was gone and Ginny was standing there, red-handed.“You were red-handed,” he teased her afterward. “A whale hoarder.” “Was not a whale hoarder,” she’d said. “Uh-huh,” he said. “Whale hoarder.” And for a while, in the early years of their marriage, when she spent too much time reading, or rose early to walk alone in the park, or drifted off when the two were having dinner in a restaurant, he’d kick her ankle and say it again.“Whale hoarder,” he’d say. And she’d laugh and then she would not. She’d remember the whale’s expression, how it lay on its side and drifted in the current, how it had been so close that she could see the raised scars of its skin, the mottled gray color of it and the sheen of evaporating water, and its massive head, how the whale’s eye, onyx black, had looked directly at her, unblinking, and she had thought, If I can stand here long enough, if I can just look hard enough, I’ll understand. What, she wasn’t sure, but she felt it was something she was meant to know, something beyond the noise of everything else, something as clear as the sounds carried across the ocean. “What?” she had said to the whale. “What?” It is Olivia who spots Zoom Zoom after Barbara has arrived and the doors have been manned, after Ginny has sunk to the floor with her head between her legs, after the tourists, English- speaking and those with no idea, have come forward, rallying around the woman with the missing child and the child that remains, a gorgeous girl, freckled, tall, her hair loosened from its ponytail, her face puffed with tears. It is Olivia who sees Zoom Zoom’s ear, and then Maggie’s shoes, or the bottoms of them, beneath the dressing room curtains, Maggie covered by a heap of discarded M&M wear, an M&M beach towel over her head. She hadn’t heard her mother or her sister, she said, howling. She thought they’d gone, too. “Too?” Ginny says, hugging her youngest to the floor, hugging her small arms and legs, folding her into her own arms as tight as she can bear. “Too?” she says, crying, laughing, pulling Olivia in as well, so that the three form a kind of solid thing, a weight, a substance, as round as a boulder, which, for the moment, fills in the empty space that was there just before. And suddenly everything returns: the buzzy air, the lemony chocolate scent piped through the store, the rapper’s song, the rainbow wall of colors, the crowds. “Let’s go,” Ginny whispers. The girls are sniffling, their faces hot. She stands then, a daughter gripped in each hand. They ride the escalator down in silence, staring out the large windows toward Broadway, toward the familiar thickening rush-hour crowd, until they reach the bottom and step off. Ginny lets go first, leading them, pushing hard on the glass door against the wind, against what has become more than a blustery day, because in truth it is not yet spring, exactly; there is still the possibility of a freeze. She squats to zip the girls’ fleeces to their chins, to kiss their cheeks — their eyes still wet with tears — then pulls them close to her, again. How soon the whale dissolved into its darkening sea. How soon she was left on her own, waiting. [ Return to the review of “She was Like That.” ]",The New York Times
2019,‘Slop It On!’: Unicorn Spit Beguiles the Etsy Crowd,"Ready to go beyond bedazzling? Here’s an iridescent scented paint substance. BONNER SPRINGS, Kan. — “There’s no such thing as perfect,” said Michelle Nicole, wearing a light-up unicorn headband and standing behind a white table with rainbow-colored balloons arching above her. On a balmy morning not long ago, in an art studio about 10 minutes outside Kansas City, 120 attendees from as far away as Canada were gathered. They had each snagged a ticket to the second annual Unicorn Spit Extravaganza. An enthusiastic group stationed at long tables, many wearing matching unicorn headbands and colorful T-shirts, they followed along as Ms. Nicole painted wide stripes on a wooden wine holder and encouraged them to “Slop it on!” Ms. Nicole, 39, is the founder of Unicorn Spit, a nontoxic paint, glaze and stain she created in 2012 while working at an adult day care center. As the activities coordinator, she struggled to find ways to entertain the clients. When she brought a scuffed-up dresser to work, she and the clients brainstormed ways to finish the piece without using harsh chemicals. After experimenting with various nontoxic dyes and stains in her garage, Ms. Nicole developed the product she has been selling for about $9 to $20 per bottle since 2015. Unicorn Spitters are part of a recent vogue for the tentatively creative expressing themselves through attempts at art. The spirited group at the event (mostly women, though a few men attended with their wives) was a small sampling of Ms. Nicole’s rapidly growing online community of over 33,000 “Spitters.” While brushing on color, the Spitters joked, shared pictures of their projects and made plans for the evening. It was a weekend workshop with a set number of projects to complete each day, but also an opportunity for artists, hobbyists and crafting newbies who have interacted online to meet in person. It was also a chance for them to interact with Ms. Nicole. They were curious about whether she is as upbeat in person as she is in her videos (she is), they wanted to know if she is working on new products (always) and if they can make suggestions (they can). “My audience inspires me,” Ms. Nicole said. “They comment, ‘Wouldn’t this be neat?’ and I try it.” Garianne Fuentes, the owner of SW Craft Connection, an art studio in Albuquerque, discovered Unicorn Spit through Ms. Nicole’s videos on Facebook and YouTube. “The product opened up my creative side,” said Ms. Fuentes, who is 49. “The colors are fun and vibrant, especially the sparkling and flats.” Her projects include coasters, jewelry, metal yard art and faux stained glass. Ms. Nicole’s videos draw thousands of views, but word-of-mouth continues to drive sales and attract more Spitters. Evey Alvarez-Flores, 36, from Califon, N.J., features product reviews on her blog, Evey’s Creations. She learned about Unicorn Spit a few years ago through a reader. “I kept seeing the videos and pictures of her doing brilliant things with furniture,” Ms. Alvarez-Flores said. “I did a few sample boards and was blown away by it.” She sells items from her Etsy shop including wooden signs, glass and metal pieces, and uses the product during Make It and Take It workshops she teaches around the country. Ms. Nicole’s showroom (her studio is in the back), in Kansas City, is a homage to her love of color. “Color gives me an optimistic view, she said: “When I see vivid colors, I think of life.” Entering the multihued interior after approaching the plain brick exterior, one feels like Dorothy entering the Land of Oz. A range of colors filled every corner of the space. A wedding dress — the product also works on fabric — with cascading rows of yellow, pink and blue, hung on a dress form. Leaning against the wall was a long, narrow window painted to resemble stained glass. Lampshades, glass end tables, buffets, chairs and iridescent cowboy boots, all with a 3-D effect, are among the flea market and roadside finds Ms. Nicole has rehabilitated. Unicorn Spit is not only infused with color, but also with aromas. “They are all scented with something special to make clients feel creative,” Ms. Nicole said. Sparkling is infused with lemongrass, purportedly to make people feel energized and fearless. The metallics are scented with teakwood and pheromones with the idea that these will make people feel adventurous, daring, confident and empowered. The Original Spit is infused with jasmine, to promote a calming feeling. Mindful that the original inspiration for her product was art therapy, Ms. Nicole often donates her products to nursing homes, disability centers and activity centers. “They can all do art without the fear of making a mess and ruining a project,” she said. “It’s O.K., they can wipe it away and do it again.” Her latest project involves looking for different handles to enable users to hold the brush with their shoulder, elbow, wrist, palm or even their toes. Ms. Nicole and her staff of five are currently working on next year’s event. Their first task is to find a bigger site. She is also searching for a Studio & Spit Retreat House where guests would stay for a week and work with her to refinish furniture they find at a local thrift shop. In a recent post, she updated her followers about a potential property: “It’s awfully cute & simple,” she wrote. “Just needs a bright & cheery paint job.”",The New York Times
2019,‘South Park’ Creators Offer Fake Apology After Show Is Erased in China,"“Like the N.B.A., we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts,” the show’s creators said in a tongue-in-cheek response. “We too love money more than freedom and democracy.” HONG KONG — “South Park,” the long-running Comedy Central cartoon whose mockery has spared few touchy topics, was erased from major platforms in China after an episode last week taunted Chinese censors and the far-reaching effect they often have on American entertainment. The government’s censors, who routinely quash news and commentary deemed undesirable by the ruling Communist Party, wiped out video clips and discussions of the show, which premiered in 1997 and has lasted 23 seasons. Once known mostly for the raunchy humor coming from the mouths of its elementary-school-age main characters, the show has in recent seasons focused on political and cultural satire, without abandoning its boundary-pushing ways. Last week’s episode, called “Band in China,” appeared to cross a new line for the Chinese authorities. On Baidu Tieba, a popular discussion platform, searches for “South Park” on Tuesday returned the following message: “According to the relevant law and regulation, this section is temporarily not open.” Searches for the show were also fruitless on Youku, a video hosting service, which similarly cited “the relevant law and regulation.” On Weibo, the country’s most popular social network, posts mentioning the show could not be found. The censorship occurred as the N.B.A. was unintentionally demonstrating how protecting business interests in China can chill speech back in the United States. The basketball league has scrambled to contain a backlash in China since Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, tweeted support last week for the Hong Kong protests, which are reviled by the Chinese government. Though the league has supported political expression by its players, it was less supportive of Morey, prompting accusations that it valued its business in China more than free speech. Whereas the N.B.A. has struggled to respond to the geopolitical fracas, the creators of “South Park” appeared to relish the fight. The show’s creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, put out a fake apology on Monday, poking fun at the N.B.A. while insulting Xi Jinping, China’s president. “Like the N.B.A., we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts,” the tongue-in-cheek statement read. “We too love money more than freedom and democracy. Xi doesn’t look just like Winnie the Pooh at all.” That last part makes more sense in the context of the episode, which had two plot lines related to China. Spoilers ahead. In one, the character Randy Marsh flies to China hoping to expand his marijuana business there, only to be arrested at the airport. In a work camp, he meets Winnie the Pooh, who, the show explains, was banned after Chinese social media users pointed out his resemblance to Mr. Xi. (The Pooh censorship is real, and reporting on it got John Oliver censored last year.) Meanwhile in Colorado, the South Park children form a band, and a manager wants to make a biopic about them — but insists that their life story be told in a way that will be acceptable to Chinese censors, so they don’t lose access to the market. He instructs the boys to cut references to the Dalai Lama (seen by the Chinese government as a separatist), organ transplants (China has been accused of harvesting prisoners’ organs) and homosexuality (nothing is wrong with that subject “unless you want to make money in China,” he says). Eventually the boys tire of the ordeal. “I want to be proud of who we are, guys, and anyone who would betray their ideals just to make money in China isn’t worth a lick of spit,” says one of them, Stan. (The full episode is available online here, for those with a high tolerance for profanity.) The N.B.A. is hardly the first international business to make concessions to China’s political sensitivities as it seeks access to its lucrative market, or to forcefully apologize after running afoul of them. Movie studios, especially, have worked to ensure that their scripts aren’t at odds with state censors, lest they lose billions in potential business. Disney, for one, earned $858 million for “Avengers: Endgame” in the United States and an additional $614 million from China. Moviegoers in China bought an estimated $8.87 billion in movie tickets last year, according to box office analysts. The “South Park” episode mocked Disney by turning a Mickey Mouse look-alike into a craven profit seeker. On his flight to China, Randy Marsh was surrounded by characters from “Avengers” and “Star Wars,” along with N.B.A. players. The world of e-sports had its own run-in with Chinese politics on Tuesday, when Blizzard Entertainment said it was suspending Chung Ng Wai, a Hong Kong player of the game Hearthstone, for a year and forcing him to forfeit prize money. Mr. Chung, who uses the name Blitzchung, had spoken out in support of the Hong Kong protests during a livestreamed interview. The company said Mr. Chung had broken a rule barring players from engaging in any act that “brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages” Blizzard’s image. In their statement on Monday, the “South Park” creators parodied the apologies that businesses have often made after crossing the Chinese government. “Long live the Great Communist Party of China!” they wrote. “May this autumn’s sorghum harvest be bountiful! We good now China?” Elsie Chen contributed reporting.",The New York Times
2019,Hong Kong Protests Put N.B.A. on Edge in China,"A tweet from the Houston Rockets general manager prompted a backlash in China, making things uncomfortable for a league used to its players and representatives speaking out on politics. HONG KONG — The N.B.A. superstar LeBron James has routinely insulted President Trump. Two of the league’s most successful coaches, Steve Kerr and Gregg Popovich, have repeatedly slammed American lawmakers for inaction on gun legislation. And other basketball stars regularly speak out on social and political issues — police shootings, elections and racism — without fear of retribution from the league. But this weekend, a Houston Rockets executive unwittingly exposed an issue that may have been too much for the National Basketball Association: support for protesters in Hong Kong, which infuriated China. “Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong,” read an image posted on Twitter by Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Rockets. It was quickly deleted. But the damage was done, and the N.B.A. quickly moved to smooth things over in a lucrative market that generates millions of dollars in revenue. The league said it was “regrettable” that many Chinese fans were offended by the comment. On Tuesday, CCTV, China’s state broadcaster, said it would suspend broadcasts of the league’s preseason games played in China. Some initial Chinese reports of the broadcaster’s statement, which left room for uncertainty, indicated that the ban covered all preseason games. Sponsors in China paused their deals with the Rockets, and the country’s main broadcaster said it would remove the team’s games from its schedule. Two exhibition games scheduled for a low-level team affiliated with the Rockets were also canceled. The issue is familiar to Hollywood studios, major companies and individual athletes chasing business in a country with 1.4 billion people, and the N.B.A.’s reaction reflects a corporate sensitivity toward China’s low tolerance for criticism of its political system. The league’s statement, in turn, inflamed supporters of the Hong Kong protests and many fans in the United States, where the protesters are generally seen as battling a repressive government. Democratic and Republican politicians found agreement in calling the league gutless, accusing it of prioritizing money over human rights. Morey’s original tweet, which he later apologized for in a two-part post, was defended by Senator Ted Cruz, who disagreed with the league’s decision to back away from the comments. Speaking ahead of a scheduled preseason game between the Rockets and Toronto Raptors in Japan, the N.B.A.’s commissioner, Adam Silver, acknowledged the fallout but said the league supported Morey’s right to free expression. “There is no doubt, the economic impact is already clear,” Silver told Kyodo News. “There have already been fairly dramatic consequences from that tweet, and I have read some of the media suggesting that we are not supporting Daryl Morey, but in fact we have.” On Tuesday, Silver tried again to limit the impact, saying that the league’s initial statement had left people “angered, confused or unclear on who we are or what the N.B.A. stands for.” “It is inevitable that people around the world — including from America and China — will have different viewpoints over different issues,” he said in a new statement. “It is not the role of the N.B.A. to adjudicate those differences.” He continued: “However, the N.B.A. will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way.” James and the Los Angeles Lakers play two games in China this week against the Brooklyn Nets, a team owned by Joseph Tsai, the billionaire co-founder of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. Tsai said in a statement late Sunday that Hong Kong was a “third-rail issue” in China, calling the efforts by protesters a “separatist movement.” (Most protesters deny they are interested in independence, but the Chinese state media has at times depicted them that way.) Tilman Fertitta, the owner of the Rockets and Morey’s boss, publicly rebuked Morey but said later that the general manager’s job was not in danger. The N.B.A. is far from the first company to find itself forced to choose sides on geopolitical issues it never intended to be involved in, and to ultimately bow to China’s economic might. China is an attractive — and necessary — lure for nearly all global institutions, with an economy that while slowing, continues to grow at a pace that is the envy of many countries. Any threat to an ability to do business in China would have dire financial consequences for many multinational corporations. As a result, many companies have apologized or made concessions after angering China. In many cases, the companies found themselves scrambling to respond to comments or Twitter posts made by executives or other employees that generate unwanted attention on social networks. “Obviously corporations and others perceive that their business interests are at risk, so they are apologizing,” said Shanthi Kalathil, the senior director of the International Forum for Democratic Studies at the National Endowment for Democracy. “But where I would perceive the risks is at the level of reputation. These are well-respected global brands and there is reputational cost to simply going along with the party line.” In an effort to avoid losing access to Chinese airspace, Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong’s flagship airline, fired employees who wrote posts on social media in support of the protests. In August, Rupert Hogg, the airline’s chief executive, resigned. Nike, which endorses James, pulled some shoes after a fashion designer’s support for the Hong Kong protests sparked a social media backlash against the brand. The stakes are particularly high for the N.B.A. in China. Tencent Holdings, a Chinese tech conglomerate, reported that 490 million people watched N.B.A. programming on its platforms last year, including 21 million fans who watched Game 6 of the 2019 N.B.A. finals. By comparison, Nielsen measured 18.3 million viewers for the game on the American network ABC. The league recently announced a five-year extension of its partnership with Tencent to stream its games in China for a reported $1.5 billion. “This is a massive indicator for the perceived value and enormous potential of the China market,” Mailman, a sports digital marketing agency, wrote in a recent report. The N.B.A. has been similarly successful on Chinese social media. The league has 41.8 million followers on Weibo, a popular Chinese social network, compared with 38.6 million followers on Facebook and 28.4 million on Twitter. The involvement of the Rockets is particularly troublesome for the N.B.A., given the franchise’s longtime status as among the most popular team in China. Yao Ming, considered the crown jewel of Chinese basketball, played for the Rockets from 2002 to 2011. Yao is now the president of the Chinese Basketball Association, which suspended its relationship with the Rockets. It also canceled two NBA G League games scheduled for this month between affiliates of the Rockets and the Dallas Mavericks, said a person with knowledge of the decision who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation. Houston was the second-most-popular team in China behind the Golden State Warriors last year, according to Mailman. The team had 7.3 million followers on Weibo, compared with 2.9 million followers on Twitter. James Harden, a Rockets guard and one of the N.B.A.’s biggest stars, directly apologized to Chinese fans on Monday. “We apologize. We love China, we love playing there,” he told reporters in Tokyo, where the Rockets were preparing for their preseason game. “We go there once or twice a year. They show us the most support and love. We appreciate them as a fan base, and we love everything they’re about, and we appreciate the support that they give us,” said Harden, who three years ago spoke out about the shootings of two black men by police. Echoing China’s worldview, especially as it relates to its sovereignty over disputed territories, is considered a cost of doing business there, for both entertainers and companies. Gap was forced to apologize in 2017 after selling a shirt that featured a map of China that did not include Taiwan, a self-governing island off its southern coast. The Marriott International hotel chain apologized in January 2018 for listing Tibet, a region of western China, and Taiwan as countries in a customer survey. In February 2018, the German automaker Daimler apologized for using a quotation from the Dalai Lama, who is widely viewed as a Tibetan separatist in China, in a social media post from its Mercedes-Benz brand. In March 2018, China demanded that international airlines refer to Taiwan as part of China in their online booking systems, a request mocked by the White House as “Orwellian nonsense” but eventually obeyed by all major carriers. Movie studios frequently find themselves at odds with state censors in a country where notions of free expression do not apply but billions of dollars ride on international success. Disney, which has been more successful at navigating these waters than any other American entertainment company, is now in the position of promoting the live-action adaptation of “Mulan” after Crystal Yifei Liu, its Chinese-American star, prompted dueling backlash in the United States and China by supporting a crackdown on protesters by Hong Kong police. Disney, which had no comment, has inched forward in its positioning in China for decades, leading to the opening of Shanghai Disneyland in 2016 and spectacular results for films like the recent “Avengers: Endgame,” which took in $858 million in the United States and $614 million in China earlier this year. Last year, Chinese moviegoers bought an estimated $8.87 billion in movie tickets, up 9 percent from a year earlier, according to box office analysts. For its part, the N.B.A. has weathered outrage in China before. Last year, J.J. Redick, then of the Philadelphia 76ers, recorded a video for the Chinese New Year in which he appeared to use a racial slur for Chinese people, which he later said was an unintentional verbal slip. He apologized, but was roundly booed when he touched the ball during preseason games in Shanghai and Shenzhen. Claire Fu, Sopan Deb, Julie Creswell and Brooks Barnes contributed reporting. An earlier version of this article incorrectly described a Twitter post by Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets. Mr. Morey did not say, “Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong;” instead, he shared an image that read, “Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.”",The New York Times

2019,‘Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker’: The Final Trailer Debuts,"With Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, Oscar Isaac and other stars prominent, the new clip sets the scene for the showdown between the Resistance and the First Order. Perhaps anticipating an early blowout — the Patriots were beating the Jets 17-0 before the end of the first quarter — Disney ensured that viewers wouldn’t tune out “Monday Night Football” too soon by premiering the final trailer for “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” at halftime. The studio has kept the ninth and concluding chapter of the so-called “Skywalker saga” largely under wraps, putting out only an initial trailer in April and then a “Special Look” promo in August that was long on footage previously seen in earlier films. The new clip focuses on the looming showdown between the Resistance, personified by the Jedi warrior Rey (Daisy Ridley), and the First Order, led by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). As in the earlier trailer, Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) is seen riding alongside Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), and another returning character, the villainous Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), is heard only in voice-over. The nearly nonstop action pauses for a nostalgic moment as the droid C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) checks out his fellow crew members and tells the fighter pilot Poe (Oscar Isaac) that he’s “taking one last look, sir, at my friends.” Directed by J.J. Abrams, “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” lands in theaters on Dec. 20.",The New York Times
2019,‘Stranger Things’ Helps Netflix Increase Subscribers,"The streaming giant regained some footing after losing U.S. subscribers this year. But new rivals will make it tough for that growth to continue. Netflix has stemmed the bleeding. The streaming juggernaut overcame its rare moment of weakness from last quarter to add 6.8 million new customers this quarter, the company reported on Wednesday, with 520,000 of them in the United States. The rebound, after a loss of 126,000 customers domestically earlier in the year, helped Netflix recover some investor confidence as it faces an onslaught of new streaming competitors. Still, the results for the September period were slightly lower than the company’s forecast and presage the coming competition in a field it has dominated. Netflix had been expected to add about seven million customers, with 800,000 in the United States. The company also reported a large jump in profit, to $665 million, on $5.2 billion in revenue, handily beating Wall Street’s income estimates of about $470 million. Netflix stock jumped more than 8 percent in after-hours trading Wednesday. The company’s market value had dropped sharply since its last earnings announcement in July, with shares having traded down more than 20 percent before the most recent report. Netflix, led by Reed Hastings as chief executive, forecast steady growth for the rest of the year. The company said it expected to add 7.6 million total new customers in the next quarter, with about 600,000 for the United States. That was below the 9.4 million that Wall Street had expected and hints at the pending competition. Mr. Hastings tamped down the significance of the newer entrants, citing how Netflix has been competing against streaming services like Amazon and YouTube for years, as well as traditional television. “Fundamentally there’s not a big change here,” he said on the earnings call after the announcement. The third-quarter results benefited from Netflix’s best-known series, “Stranger Things,” which introduced its hugely anticipated third season over the Fourth of July weekend. The series drew 64 million households in the first four weeks it was available, the company said. Netflix, which started as a DVD-by-mail service, has become a dominant force in Hollywood, and its disruptive growth has reordered the television landscape. It often outspends its rivals and has forced the industry’s biggest players to embrace streaming as they abandon, albeit slowly, the pay-television model. Netflix is the nation’s largest digital television network, with over 158 million customers around the world, including 60 million in the United States. That audience has become critically important as well-financed rivals wait in the wings. On Nov. 1, Apple plans to unveil its streaming product, Apple TV Plus; 11 days later, the Walt Disney Company intends to start Disney Plus, which will feature Marvel’s biggest franchises, the complete “Star Wars” library and the Disney content vault. In a cheeky marketing stunt, Disney owned Twitter for a few hours on Monday when it promoted its service on an epic thread with a seemingly endless string of titles (both famous and obscure) that will appear on Plus. Not to be outdone, Jennifer Aniston, who stars in Apple’s new signature series, “The Morning Show,” drew Instagram’s attention Tuesday when she finally joined the social platform. Both streamers will come stocked with original films and series, and both will cost about half the price of Netflix. (By early next year, Netflix will face another competitor: AT&T’s HBO Max.) Mr. Hastings took a light jab at both companies. “It is interesting that we see both Apple and Disney launching in the same week, after 12 years of not being in the market,” he said. More seriously, he added, “Disney is going to be a great competitor, Apple is just beginning but it’ll probably have some great shows, too.” Later, he summed it up this way: “We’re all competing against linear television, not really competing against each other.” Still, the new services are likely to hold down Netflix’s trajectory, and the fourth quarter is also traditionally its most lucrative period when it adds the most subscribers. Netflix plans a new line of attack at the end of the year. It will release more than half a dozen high-profile features over the coming months, including Michael Bay’s “6 Underground,” Eddie Murphy’s “Dolemite Is My Name” and perhaps its most ambitious screen effort to date, Martin Scorsese’s “The Irishman,” which cost $159 million. Ted Sarandos, the head of Netflix’s content studio, called the new slate the “theatrically ambitious” movies that can be watched in the home. That could “fundamentally change the economics of how people enjoy films,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,‘Stuffed’ Review: There’s Artistry in That Plumage,"This documentary makes the case for taxidermy as a cuddly profession. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “Stuffed” won’t wrest the title of cinema’s most famous taxidermist from Norman Bates, but this documentary isn’t headed for as ghoulish a destination as the Bates Motel. Rather, the movie, directed by Erin Derham, sets out to explore the creative side of taxidermy, positioning the discipline as combining the eye of an artist with the scientific impulses of a naturalist, to paraphrase Travis C. de Villiers, one of the subjects. We meet taxidermists like Allis Markham, who left a marketing job to start her own studio after a side education at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. The idea that taxidermy can be a form of archiving — a way of recording the poses of vanishing species — resurfaces throughout the film. But not all taxidermists have an interest in lifelike appearances. A Dutch practitioner describes how he and his partner artist added an extra-large jaw to a tiger to emphasize the animal’s greed, something a purist would never have done. More time could have been spent probing the philosophy of the “Rogue Taxidermists,” a group whose experiments include the Frankensteining of multiple animals. In making the case that taxidermy is misunderstood, the movie emphasizes its subjects’ cuddliness, as if dwelling on the craft’s morbid qualities would alienate viewers. (One of the principal interviewees, Daniel Meng, admits that “3-D wildlife artist” makes for a better job description on a first date.) While Derham banks on the surprise factor of seeing taxidermists acting as stealth conservationists, the film leaves the impression that she could have scalpel-dug into deeper layers.

A Dutch practitioner describes how he and his partner artist added an extra-large jaw to a tiger to emphasize the animal’s greed, something a purist would never have done. More time could have been spent probing the philosophy of the “Rogue Taxidermists,” a group whose experiments include the Frankensteining of multiple animals. In making the case that taxidermy is misunderstood, the movie emphasizes its subjects’ cuddliness, as if dwelling on the craft’s morbid qualities would alienate viewers. (One of the principal interviewees, Daniel Meng, admits that “3-D wildlife artist” makes for a better job description on a first date.) While Derham banks on the surprise factor of seeing taxidermists acting as stealth conservationists, the film leaves the impression that she could have scalpel-dug into deeper layers.

2019,"‘Succession’ Season 2 Finale Recap: Sails Out, Nails Out","Succession Logan seems to think he is the only member of the Waystar leadership team who isn’t expendable. Not everyone agrees. For about 10 minutes in the middle of the “Succession” Season 2 finale, the show briefly becomes a bit like the reality series “Survivor.” The Roy family and their top Waystar executives have a kind of tribal council on a super yacht, sitting around a breakfast table with Logan, discussing whom to sacrifice over the scandal in the company’s cruise division. The argument turns into a fascinating study of human nature as these people try to save their jobs — and their senses of self — with a combination of strategic shade-throwing and personal appeals. Then, just when the outcome seems clear, Kendall hits Logan with a classic blindside. In the episode’s closing minutes, Ken pulls an impressively sinister switcheroo, accusing his father of gross malfeasance during a televised news conference in which he was supposed to resign in disgrace. This jaw-dropper ending works because the writer Jesse Armstrong sets it up superbly, beginning with that long scene when everybody debates — with hilariously exaggerated politeness — the matter of whose body might best fit under a bus. Kendall, as we’ve seen throughout the past two seasons, is a master of just this kind of shifty biz-speak. At the big breakfast meeting, he drops the prefatory comment, “If this is just laboratory time, human emotions extracted,” and then rather coldly suggests that Tom could take the hit, sounding completely dispassionate and rational throughout. The rest of the Waystar executives prove just as eager to carve up their colleagues. Soon, everyone is spit-balling aggressively. Is Tom a big enough sacrifice? What about Tom and Shiv together? How about Tom with — as Roman puts it — some Greg sprinkles? (Greg counters by throwing Roman’s name into the hopper, arguing, “You’re widely known as a terrible person.”) Ultimately, this episode becomes about watching these family members and friends lean in for a group hug, only to find a better angle to stab one another in the back. By the time Logan walks away from this circular firing squad, all that’s clear is that Tom is in serious trouble, and that Roman is safe. Logan has a newfound respect for his youngest son, who almost got killed in last week’s episode trying to secure a source of independent wealth in the wilds of Eastern Europe. Having emerged from that fire relatively unscathed, Roman now astutely advises his dad that the Azerbaijani money may end up being more trouble than its worth, if it is even truly an option at all. So Logan turns to Kendall to be a conduit to Stewy Hosseini, for one last shot at brokering peace in the proxy war. Stewy, though, serves up only hard truths, in what may be this season’s most quietly pivotal scene. Logan keeps thinking of himself as the only truly essential component of Waystar’s leadership team because as far as he’s concerned, it’s his instincts, his taste and his opinions that give the brand its value. But Stewy tells him otherwise, noting that most shareholders aren’t that concerned with the missions of the institutions in which they invest. They care only about the returns. By trying to win their hearts and minds, Logan may be fighting on the wrong battlefield altogether. This season finale is titled “This Is Not For Tears,” which appears to be a quote from John Berryman’s poem “Dream Song 29,” which reads: “Ghastly, with open eyes, he attends, blind. All the bells say: too late. This is not for tears; thinking.” These lines describe, in a roundabout, lyrical way, what has become of Logan Roy, who finally wears out Kendall’s patience with his unwillingness to acknowledge the obvious. Early in the episode, one of Waystar’s most powerful shareholders tells Logan privately that he needs to step down. But the old man ignores the advice, defaulting as always to a self-serving sentimentality, insisting that unlike some venerable businesses — the Ford Motor Company, for example — Waystar Royco still means something “because we are a family.” And yet at one point in the episode, in a rare moment of earnestness for Roman, he asks his siblings, “Is there a thing where we, like, talk to each other about stuff … normally?,” and they respond by mocking him. That’s because the family ties Logan always boasts about tend to be pretty loose, so far as his kids are concerned. His children are tied to him — so tightly they can sometimes barely move or breathe. But they’re not always as bound to each other. There are several more minor betrayals scattered throughout this week’s episode. Connor, who is losing a fortune on Willa’s critically reviled play, asks Logan to coax the Waystar media machine into pumping out some better reviews. Instead, his father agrees to cover his losses to the tune of $100 million, so long as Connor abandons the only project he really cares about: his presidential campaign. Tom, meanwhile, is hurt by Siobhan’s unwillingness to stand up for him against the Waystar mob — as well as by her plan to spice up their marriage by inviting another woman into their bed. “I wonder if the sad I’d be without you is less than the sad I get from being with you,” he says, resignedly. But the biggest breaking point comes toward the episode’s end, when Kendall agrees to be his dad’s “blood sacrifice,” then asks outright whether Logan ever had any intention of letting him take over the company someday. “I dunno,” his father says, before admitting that Ken’s big stumbling block is, “You’re not a killer.” Kendall responds by giving his father a kiss — a Judas kiss, as it turns out. In the closing minutes, Logan sits with his guests on the yacht one last time, his back to the camera, just like in the “Succession” opening credits. But the more important mirror image in this episode is between Kendall in the Season 2 premiere and Kendall in the finale. At the start of this season, Ken is so beaten that all he can do is repeat in monotone whatever his dad’s lackeys tell him to say. At the end, no longer the obedient lap dog, he dupes those same handlers and uses Greg’s purloined documents to take a kill-shot at his father. For now at least, he has snapped out of his funk. When “Succession” debuted in the summer of 2018, one of the biggest knocks against the show was that while its primary plot-driver was ostensibly a competition, none of the competitors seemed especially worthy of winning. But Armstrong has fleshed out the characters of Logan’s bickering children a lot more in Season 2, such that they’ve become, if not necessarily “lovable,” then at least more sympathetic, and even relatable. As a result, as this season comes to an end, Roman, Shiv and especially Kendall all finally seem like viable players. And the game, it would seem, is on. The Rich Are Different From You and Me: That’s quite a yacht the Roys sail on, with its helipad, inflatable slides and all. If you’re curious about what goes into making and maintaining such a vessel, The Times ran a story about that very subject just last week. Not much comic relief from Cousin Greg in this episode, though we did get a taste of the overly formal approach in his congressional testimony, featuring such responses as, “I really wish to answer in the affirmative fashion” in lieu of, “Yes.” We also learn that Greg’s not big on the shoeless, “sails out, nails out” yachting lifestyle, because his toes have what he calls “a benign fungus.” How irrelevant is Connor to the Waystar succession planning? When Gerri talks about the symbolism of Kendall’s sacrifice, she mistakenly starts to call Ken the firstborn son, before remembering that Connor exists. Roman, answering Karl’s suggestion that maybe Gerri should be the sacrifice, argues that it wouldn’t be good P.R. to fire a woman during a scandal that involves sexual assault and the unexplained deaths of multiple female victims. “Haven’t we — kidding here — killed enough women already?” he asks. Ah, Roman. Often right. Always inappropriate.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Succession’ Season 2, Episode 9 Recap: Culture of Exploitation","Succession This week revealed a lot about how seriously the megawealthy and the politically connected take government oversight. Given what’s been going on in Washington the past couple of weeks, this latest “Succession” episode isn’t just gripping, it’s fairly illuminating. When the pattern of sexual harassment and cover-ups at Waystar’s cruise division is exposed by a popular network TV news program, the United States Congress gets involved, with Shiv’s old boss Gil Eavis (Eric Bogosian) leading an inquiry. The Roy family sees a legacy-killing scandal expand beyond their capacity to contain it; and Roman’s first reaction — like those of a lot of people in power these days — is to wonder if they can just duck Congress. (But he doesn’t say “duck.”) So the game begins. The traveling Waystar circus rolls into Washington, D.C., with a mission to stall, obfuscate, scapegoat and generally avoid accountability. It’s all high drama, with fresh fires popping up regularly. For a time, “Succession” becomes a kind of procedural, taking viewers inside the machinations of a congressional hearing from the point-of-view of the people being grilled. The hour reveals a lot about how seriously the megawealthy and the politically connected take government oversight. Roman gets to skip the festivities because Logan sends him on a special mission overseas with Laird and Karl, in hopes of helping free Waystar from its shareholders’ demands by tapping Edouard’s family fortune. Roman hesitates because this assignment actually matters, and he knows he’s a goofus. But Logan reassures his son that he’s a likable fellow — which is true, in a perverse way — and so Roman eventually ends up in Turkey, where he does lock down the Azerbaijani money. Sure, Roman also makes potentially dangerously non-fulfillable promises to Edouard’s people while being held at gunpoint in a luxury hotel by lackeys sent by “my president’s daughter’s husband” to seize certain “assets.” But while this deal is almost certain to blow up in the Roys’ faces eventually, for now Roman can take comfort in knowing that he did as he was asked, and he didn’t botch it. Nearly all the Roy siblings acquit themselves well during this crisis — which is surprising, given how badly they’ve performed in recent weeks, at Tern Haven and Argestes. Siobhan, for one, really steps up, drawing on her resources and charm as she does whatever is needed to keep the scandal contained. First, she tries to strike a deal with Gil, threatening to cancel his profile-boosting ATN appearances unless he follows their preferred course of action at the hearing — which is to blame everything on the former cruise division leader Bill Lockhart (Mark Blum) and then move on. Instead, he tips her off that one of “Uncle Mo” Lester McLintock’s victims is ready to go public. Shiv meets with this woman in a public park and disarms her with a combination of empathy, honesty and cynicism. Shiv admits that it’s in the Roys’ best interest if this scheduled testimony gets canceled. But she also points out that Gil has an agenda too. Anyone who plays ball with the Roys can expect financial compensation and a commitment to crush their enemies. Those who don’t will be dragged through the mud. As for Kendall, he’s all but forced to rally when his father stumbles through his appearance (and throws him briefly under the bus) before the congressional committee. Logan knows that “ten bad minutes on camera in D.C., that could be it, the end.” And everyone in the family has been coached that this is “a stage” not a courtroom, and that their goal is to eat up minutes, give up nothing and defend the brand. (“And maybe just try to enjoy it?” Gregory adds.) But Logan comes across as exhausted and foggy, leaving Kendall to give a stirring speech pushing back against Gil’s characterization of Waystar as having “a culture of exploitation.” It’s Ken who speaks up for the freedom of the press, and who forcefully accuses Gil of “bias.” The Roy family’s newcomers don’t come off nearly as well. Tom is completely unprepared for how much documentation the committee has. They raise the matter of his many emails calling Lester “Mo”; They have the logs showing that Greg signed out the boxes of the now-missing files; and they can see from their records that this happened during the one window of time when Tom wasn’t barraging him with emails reading, “You can’t make a Tom-lette without breaking some Gregs.” They even know about “human furniture.” By the end of his testimony, Mr. Wambsgans is being referred to in the press as “a smirking blob of domestic feta.” Rhea, meanwhile, finally realizes she has “agreed to be C.E.O. of a dumpster fire pirate death ship,” and she wants out. She tells Logan, “I don’t know if you believe in anything, and that scares me.” He icily counters, “You know who I am.” And she probably does. The one major weakness of this episode — and perhaps this season — is that Rhea’s real motivations and ideals have never been made clear. (It’s not even absolutely certain that she was sleeping with Logan, even though every one of the Roy kids assumed she was.) But when Rhea wonders what Logan believes, this does get to the meat of what this episode is about. Early on, the family has gathered to watch the big news report about their scandal, and they have fun booing and taunting the whistle-blower. All the while, Logan seethes, insisting that his biggest business rivals are behind this takedown. Something terrible has happened at Waystar, but nobody in the company really wants to get to the bottom of what went wrong, or to own up to their mistakes. They only want to punish the people who are pointing it out. The Rich Are Different From You and Me: Who will be the “blood sacrifice” that Logan ominously demands at the end of this episode? Tom? Greg? Or — most likely, given the overall arc of this season — Kendall? Connor is the one Roy child who doesn’t get the chance to do anything exceptional in this episode, though we do find out at the hearing that his maverick presidential campaign is stirring up a lot of excitement among the “Con-heads.” So that’s nice. Cousin Greg is feeling the pressure this week. Congress has the receipts on his document-destruction, and his grandfather seems to be making good (for now) on his threat to cancel Greg’s $250 million inheritance. He tries to take solace in his mother’s promise that he will at least inherit $5 million, but Connor and Tom let him know that barely being a millionaire is “a nightmare.” He can’t retire, and it’s not worth it to work. This would be the very definition of “rich people problems.” Sure, the prospects for the Roys are looking grim, but remember Roman’s inspiring words to the Heart of Midlothian football club: “When a team is a team, it can’t actually physically be beaten.

2019,‘Succession’: Jesse Armstrong on the Season Finale’s Stunning Twist,"Ask a Showrunner The Emmy-winning creator discussed when he knew how the season would end and his response to early critics who called the characters unsympathetic. This article contains plot details about the second season of “Succession.” In the end it was kill or be killed. Viewers heading into Sunday’s Season 2 finale of the HBO drama “Succession” knew a “blood sacrifice” was coming. But they had to wait until the final scene to learn who got the ax. For a while the choice seemed clear: After days spent pondering who should take the fall for a sexual misconduct scandal that had been rocking shareholders’ confidence, Logan Roy (Brian Cox) finally seemed to decide, coaxing his son Kendall (Jeremy Strong) into being the goat. But in a startling twist ending, Kendall turned the tables on his father, who in making his decision had only just told him: “You’re not a killer. You have to be a killer.” It was another high note for the series’s creator, Jesse Armstrong, a veteran British TV writer who has helped shape some of the sharpest social satires of the past decade, including “Peep Show” and “The Thick of It.” Armstrong won an Emmy last month for his writing on “Succession,” which tells a sprawling story about the battle for control at a right-wing media dynasty, patterned largely after the Murdoch family. It’s his most ambitious project to date, but its final scope is still being written: HBO has already renewed the show for a third season. The morning after the finale, Armstrong spoke with The Times by phone about the finale’s knockout ending, and about how his phenomenal cast has helped steer the series’s direction. He also revealed what he says to people who complain that his characters aren’t “sympathetic.” These are edited excerpts from that conversation. At what point in planning out the season did you know you that Kendall was going to flip? Pretty early on. I remember pitching it to the writers’ room before we started outlining the other episodes. I always like to know where we’re going. It helps to maintain the integrity of the show. When do you think Kendall made his decision to go against Logan? Was it before he kissed his father on the cheek? That’s one where I’m really intrigued by what people make of it. I don’t think there’s a wrong answer. You might even get different replies from me and Jeremy, although I think we’re probably on the same page. But I don’t want to be sitting up on a cloud making readings on that stuff on behalf of the audience. I like people to make their own decisions. You put Jeremy Strong through the wringer this season with Kendall’s arc. Did he at least have the relief of knowing where the character was going to land? You know, me and Jeremy talk a lot, and at a certain point, yeah, he did. Because, you know, his preparation for his performance and his engagement with the character is really extraordinarily deep. It didn’t feel like a dereliction of duty not to lay it all out from the very beginning, but at a certain point it did feel like he should know where he was going. So yeah, we discussed that stuff before the episode was written. When did he learn he was going to get to rap? Right before the read-through! [Laughs.] No, I actually can’t remember when. But we clearly discussed how it should work, and I think we both had the same feeling, that it might be that other people found it ludicrous, but that Kendall himself shouldn’t. Therefore the lyrics, the music, the stuff around it should be as good as someone like him should be able to achieve. Which is pretty decent! Did it surprise you how much the rap took off on social media? Do you pay attention to any of that? A lot of that really isn’t useful to have in your head. But there’s always a few bits in each season where we think, “Well, tonally, I think we got it right.” I remember having the rocket explode in the first season’s finale. Initially I wanted to do it on big screens at Shiv’s wedding, and then one of our writers, Jon Brown, came into the writers’ room having been away for a few days, and was like: “You’ve all gone completely crazy. It’s going to ruin the show.” [Laughs.] We ended up having it on Roman’s phone, which was rather a better way. Similarly, I remember suggesting the rap and there being a certain, like, “Yeah, right … This could be the end of the show that we’ve all worked on so hard.” But if you get those things right, they have that kind of queasy sense we know so well from the world right now. That “Am I seeing what I think I’m seeing?” feeling. What inspired the structure of the show, where you’re in a different location nearly every episode? Maybe it comes a bit from the fact that most of my career in TV has been in situation comedy. I love the breadth and space you get to explore character in so-called serialized TV, the novelistic element of maybe being able to find out who people are. But I also very much like the sitcom discipline of having a self-contained episode that you could conceivably, I hope, be able to enjoy in and of itself. My desire is to have a completeness to each episode. Is there much left on the cutting room floor? It would seem like Matthew Macfadyen alone would give you dozens of hilarious outtakes each episode. Oh yeah. Our writers write long, and we write alternative lines. And then there’s some improvisation. There’s always a lot of warp and weft in the interaction between the writers and the cast. Often I cut the episodes down from an hour and a half or over. We leave some of the comic material out and it’s heartbreaking sometimes. But I think the discipline is good in the end. One of the criticisms of “Succession” when the show debuted was that it was hard to root for any of the characters. This season there seemed to be more of an effort to dig into the roots of the Roy siblings’ psychological and emotional damage, to make them maybe a little more sympathetic. Was that intentional? Without sounding defensive, I would say that sometimes TV critics assume that after a few episodes the writers “finally understand the characters,” and as a writer I often feel that what really has happened is that the viewer has gotten to know the characters. It’s a natural process. I would claim that if you went back and watched something from our first season, there were always hints to the inner lives of these characters. Getting into their psychological makeup has always been intrinsic to the show, along with the interest in how the world of media works. We certainly didn’t come back after Season 1, saying, “Oh [expletive], we’ve made these people horrible!” [Laughs.] We’ve also never said anything like, “Ugh, we’ve made this person so bad, we need to find a redeeming quality.” I think if there is such a balance, that’s only because, I would remind you, there’s also one in life. We have characteristics we’re born with, that are molded by the lives we live. And so to have a psychologically engaged show, our view of human nature is that it doesn’t come from nowhere, it comes from somewhere. So we naturally end up portraying that.",The New York Times
2019,‘Tell Me Who I Am’ Review: Twin Brothers Face an Awful Truth,"This documentary about siblings and irrevocable memory loss is sad and eerie to the extent that you wish it were fiction. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The story of the British twin brothers Alex and Marcus Lewis in the documentary “Tell Me Who I Am” might have been concocted by the novelist Ian McEwan in one of his more unforgiving moods. Indeed, for the sake of the brothers themselves, one wishes their story were a fiction. Alex was in his late teens when a motorcycle accident wiped out his memory, except for one thing: he recognized and knew his twin Marcus. He didn’t know his sprawling house, his odd parents, his nice girlfriend, anything else. He relied on Marcus, who reconstructed his past for him. Or rather, invented a past for him, removed from a horrific reality. The Lewis brothers told their story in a 2013 book, which shares the title of this film directed by Ed Perkins. But the details were too appalling and painful for Marcus to share with Alex, even in that volume. This movie functions as a continuation of the book, and ends in a staggering sequence in which Marcus is finally able to relay the whole truth to his brother. The two, who spend much of the movie directly addressing the camera, are — it seems weird to say this, but it’s true — pleasant cinematic company. They’re intelligent and well-spoken; they come off as more than decent people. Perkins shoots the brothers with low-key intimacy and inserts numerous staged scenes reconstructing events. But when they meet face-to-face for the camera, you may be wanting to know more about the behind-the-scenes process that got them there. Their moment of resolution at the end is very moving, but the movie also testifies that while love and forgiveness can ameliorate suffering, it can’t really wipe it all away.

2019,‘The Addams Family’ Review: A Mostly Snappy Reboot,"This animated film from the directors of “Sausage Party” is pretty much the diversion you would expect. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. In 2019, even the creepiest and kookiest movie characters must have origin stories. The new animated version of “The Addams Family” begins with the wedding of Gomez (Oscar Isaac) and Morticia (Charlize Theron) before they are chased off by angry villagers. Refugees, they wind up in New Jersey and make their home in an abandoned asylum where Thing gives Lurch tips on tickling the ivories. (The pair’s eventual duet on the rock-and-soul standard “Green Onions” is quite the sight.) Although returning the Addamses to illustrated form brings them full circle (Charles Addams’s New Yorker cartoons long predated the 1960s TV series), this movie exists in the shadow of Barry Sonnenfeld’s live-action films from 1991 and 1993. As spot on as the casting of Isaac and Theron may sound, animation spares them from having to match the ingenious physical comedy of Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston. In other respects, the movie — from the “Sausage Party” directors Conrad Vernon and Greg Tiernan — is the diversion you would expect, getting laughs from the disparity between the Addams’ congenital gloominess and the planned community, called Assimilation, that’s being developed near their mansion. (Allison Janney voices the villain, a home makeover guru who is, in her own way, mysterious and spooky.) Pugsley (Finn Wolfhard) nervously prepares for his mazurka, which resembles a bar mitzvah with a saber instead of a Torah portion, while Wednesday (Chloë Grace Moretz) experiences pangs of teenage rebellion, which means adding the “gateway color” pink to her wardrobe. If this installment lays on the moral (all families are freaky in their own ways) a bit thick, it has just enough wit and weirdness to honor its source material. The Addams Family Rated PG.

Refugees, they wind up in New Jersey and make their home in an abandoned asylum where Thing gives Lurch tips on tickling the ivories. (The pair’s eventual duet on the rock-and-soul standard “Green Onions” is quite the sight.) Although returning the Addamses to illustrated form brings them full circle (Charles Addams’s New Yorker cartoons long predated the 1960s TV series), this movie exists in the shadow of Barry Sonnenfeld’s live-action films from 1991 and 1993. As spot on as the casting of Isaac and Theron may sound, animation spares them from having to match the ingenious physical comedy of Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston. In other respects, the movie — from the “Sausage Party” directors Conrad Vernon and Greg Tiernan — is the diversion you would expect, getting laughs from the disparity between the Addams’ congenital gloominess and the planned community, called Assimilation, that’s being developed near their mansion. (Allison Janney voices the villain, a home makeover guru who is, in her own way, mysterious and spooky.) Pugsley (Finn Wolfhard) nervously prepares for his mazurka, which resembles a bar mitzvah with a saber instead of a Torah portion, while Wednesday (Chloë Grace Moretz) experiences pangs of teenage rebellion, which means adding the “gateway color” pink to her wardrobe. If this installment lays on the moral (all families are freaky in their own ways) a bit thick, it has just enough wit and weirdness to honor its source material. The Addams Family Rated PG.

2019,"‘The Affair’ Season 5, Episode 7 Recap: Killer Twist","The Affair Joanie tries to catch her mother’s killer as Noah tries to catch a break. Joanie, Joanie, Joanie. What are we going to do with your share of “The Affair”? The grown-up daughter of Cole and Alison Lockhart dominates this episode — which, given the strength of Noah Solloway’s segment, ought to be a compliment. But when Joanie seeks out and finds her mother’s killer, what happens manages to upend the show’s narrative apple cart so completely that it’s hard to appreciate anything that came before. Which is a real shame, because Noah’s segment of the episode, in which he shares most of his screen time with his daughter Whitney, is one of the season’s high points. He and Whitney travel to Helen’s parents’ house in Montauk to begin planning her wedding to her artist boyfriend, Colin. As usual, Murphy’s Law follows him wherever he goes, whether he is encountering poison ivy while trying to pick flowers for Whitney’s bouquet or receiving a phone call from a Vanity Fair reporter investigating allegations of sexual misconduct. But there’s more to the segment than the Many Trials of Noah Solloway, Chapter 217. He and Whitney directly address many of the vagaries and conundrums of adult life that have animated “The Affair” from the start. The trip gives Noah some surprising opportunities at having heart-to-heart conversations with figures from throughout his life. Take his poignant conversation with Helen’s father, Bruce, for example. An Alzheimer’s patient, Bruce no longer knows who Noah is and doesn’t remember that he, too, was once a writer; thus he’s genuinely impressed when he hears Noah has published several books. It took dementia to undo decades of condescension and hostility and enable Bruce to appreciate Noah’s achievements. Noah and Whitney also pay a visit to the Lobster Roll, the restaurant that has loomed large in the events of “The Affair” since the first season. No longer owned by Cole Lockhart, it’s a garish fast-food-like establishment now, a far cry from the place where the Solloways ate in the pilot. While there, they catch Cole’s estranged wife, Luisa, on her way out, carrying a box full of items from what used to be her office. She’s cordial, but clearly gutted by her separation from Cole, who is moving to Vermont with their daughter. And she has no time for Noah’s attempts to be considerate, seeing him (accurately) as a member of a different class with whom she has no common interests. Together, Whitney and Noah pick away at two of the core conceits of the show. While at the Lobster Roll, Whitney recalls the time her little sister Stacey nearly choked to death before her mother Helen saved her. No, Noah says: It was Alison who intervened. Can two people really remember such a momentous event that differently? Or is the point of the discrepancy that our feelings about people color our recollections of their behavior until, sometimes, they’re distorted beyond recognition? Whitney addresses Noah’s affair with Alison even more directly later on, after trying on her mother’s wedding dress. And why wouldn’t she? She’s having her own doubts about marriage after cheating on Colin with her atrocious ex-boyfriend Furkat — wondering if she should come clean, wondering if she should get married at all. “Marriage is just a decision you have to make,” Noah explains, “and keep on making, to stay.” He’s trying to puncture the institution’s magical aura in order to make the decision less fraught for his daughter. But if that’s true, she wonders, why didn’t Noah make the decision to stay with his family? Weren’t they happy together? Wasn’t he a great dad and husband? “If that wasn’t real, and if that wasn’t good,” she says, “then maybe nothing is.” To the show’s credit, Noah has no easy explanation for why he left Helen and the kids for Alison. In fact, he has no explanation at all. Watching the face of Dominic West as Noah’s mind works overtime to put what moved him into words, and then fails to deliver, is a study in the almost physical effort required to articulate complex emotions. This seems to be the spirt of Joanie’s segment at first. She travels to a post-traumatic stress clinic run by Ben Cruz (now played by Tony Plana), her mother’s murderer, looking for answers. After seeing through the false identity she comes up with as a ruse, he does the most unexpected thing imaginable in that moment: He confesses. He walks her through his version of the events of the evening, which differ in some important ways from what we saw from Alison’s perspective. He explains that he has spent his life trying to make amends for that moment, waiting for Joanie to come looking for him all the while. He even places himself at her mercy, allowing her to report him to the police, leave him be, or even kill him. Staggered, she runs off to think things through. Eventually, she returns with the cops in tow. And that’s when things get goofy. Suddenly, Ben is transformed from a repentant murderer to a comic-book supervillain. He has prepared a raft of forged documents with Joanie’s signature on them to make it look as if she were one of his patients. He has a whole story cooked up in which she suffers from delusions and makes violent threats, backed up by a selectively edited recording he made when she was venting during their conversation. After the cops leave (Ben waves them off, seemingly so he can continue to taunt Joanie on his own), Joanie cracks. She attacks Ben, but he promptly gets the upper hand and begins to choke her. It’s a fate she seems to welcome; realizing this, he stops, refusing to end her misery. “I’ve paid for my sins; I can live with myself,” he says theatrically. “You’re the one who apparently cannot.” What sins are those, exactly? The sin of getting scarred for life by your mother’s murder? Ben doesn’t say. He can’t, really, because it’s the kind of line that sounds great but means less than nothing. I won’t mince words: This is the biggest narrative miscalculation “The Affair” has made since the start. A show that distinguishes itself through its finely observed portraits of difficult people and difficult emotions suddenly feels swept out to sea, with only a few episodes left to swim back to solid ground. Odds and Ends: Noah reminds Luisa in the parking lot that he raised Joanie as his own for two years. The show brings this fact up all too rarely; I can’t imagine raising a baby from infancy and then just sort of forgetting about her the way Noah seems to have since then. There’s some solid class-based comedy in a bridal shop, as two high-pressure salespeople try to make Whitney and Noah purchase a dress they can’t afford. “You know how many clean water wells you can build in Africa for that kind of money?” “No — do you?” The Vanity Fair phone call appears to indicate Noah is about to be #MeToo’d. Given the show’s conflicting-perspective structure, this could be fascinating. It could also be biting off way more than the show can chew with so few episodes remaining. In addition to being outlandish, Ben’s supervillain maneuvering makes no sense. What difference do a bunch of forged papers about Joanie’s being his patient make when she can call everyone from her estranged husband to her employer to prove that she isn’t?",The New York Times
2019,"‘The Affair’ Season 5, Episode 8: He Said, She Said, She Said, She Said","The Affair Noah’s troubled past with women is coming back to haunt him several times over. Whose perspective are we meant to believe? “I work, I write, I see my kids, and I try to be a good person.” That’s Noah Solloway, taking stock of his life as it now stands. “You can’t just invent reality. Certain things happen, other things don’t.” That’s also Noah Solloway, defending his version of many of the events that led to his life as it now stands. Buddy, if you think reality is that clear-cut, you picked the wrong show to star in. Split between the vantage points of its two remaining lead characters, Noah and Helen, this episode of “The Affair” is a return to form after the strange swerve into supervillainy it suffered last week. Or is it? Does the portrait other characters paint of Noah represent reality, or are we to trust his perspective, despite the many shortcomings he has displayed over the course of the series? Noah’s presence is minimal at first. During Helen’s half of the episode he pops up twice: first in the background of a photo of his daughter Whitney wearing Helen’s wedding dress, then in the flesh, arriving at Helen’s doorstep, bearing her traditional birthday lasagna. The latter appearance functions as a sight gag as much as a cameo — it’s just one more unexpected thing to happen at the end of Helen’s very trying day. Her neighbor Sierra is on the verge of losing custody of her child, and possibly of suicide. Sierra’s movie-star mother, Adeline, is preparing to ship her off to rehab instead of simply treating her postpartum depression. Helen’s movie-star boyfriend, Sasha, shows up unannounced to surprise her, then repeatedly butts heads with her 12-year-old daughter, Stacey, over the girl’s obvious preference of her dad over him. Sasha’s own stepdaughter, Christianna (Dana Drori), attempts to enlist Helen in terminating Sasha’s control of her trust fund, which he says he keeps locked down in order to prevent her from libeling him. Uh, happy birthday, Helen? “I just think you fill your life with other people’s problems in order to avoid addressing your own,” Sasha tells Helen. He also suggests that her affection for Sierra is her way of covering up the hate she ought to feel for a woman who slept with her boyfriend. (That Sierra slept with Helen, too, never seems to come up in these discussions.) It’s Sierra herself who goes to bat on Helen’s behalf. In a confrontation with Adeline, she literally shouts the praises of Helen’s unconditional love for her children, a kind of love she never received herself. (Sierra: “I stopped eating because you told me, ‘I’d rather have a dead daughter than a fat one.’” Adeline: “I was kidding!”) Maybe there’s something to Sasha’s theories, but if the end result is being a better person, is that so bad? No one musters a Sierra-style defense of Noah, that’s for sure. Although his segment starts with a pleasant walk with his old friend Ariel (Janel Moloney) and ends with a warm reception at Helen’s, the intervening scenes are a portrait of a man spiraling downward in the face of accusations of misogyny and misconduct from several minor characters spread across the series’s history. The reporter gathering these charges goes so far as to suggest, in one pointed question, that Noah’s hypersexualized portrayal of Alison in his fictionalized account of their affair might have led to her suicide. The more frantically Noah tries to put out these fires, the more he fans the flames. From a certain perspective, “The Affair” is the perfect show to explore accusations of sexual harassment and abuse. So much of the #MeToo movement is about re-examining behaviors too long taken for granted or never properly evaluated as the violations of trust and consent that they are. Noah’s alternately amorous and contentious relationships with many women over the course of the series — to say nothing of the many moments his contact with women was fueled by alcohol or extreme emotional distress — is precisely the kind of conduct that can prove worthy of scrutiny. But I can’t shake the feeling that the show is backfilling a #MeToo payload into a space it was content to leave undeveloped until just now. While individual incidents involving Alison and other women drove the occasional episode or arc, a coherent Noah-as-oblivious-serial-predator narrative is new. Considering how many different vantage points we’ve had into Noah’s life — his own, his ex-wives’, his girlfriends’, his daughter’s, and even that of a guy who once pointed a gun at him in anger — to have these accusations emerge now feels like a narrative cheat. The alternative explanation — that Noah is right, that these accusations are ginned up and bogus, that the appearance of impropriety is all there is to it — doesn’t seem to hold water, not based on how Noah is portrayed in this episode anyway. The guy keeps stampeding into worse and worse situations of his own making, from denigrating a former student as a publicity hound to tracking his ex-publicist to an award ceremony and grabbing her by the arm in front of dozens of witnesses. Noah might see what he’s doing as only accidentally wrong, but the pattern we in the audience can observe is clear. So we’re left with a show that has scant hours to go, turning hard against its own co-protagonist. The last time this happened, King’s Landing burned down. Much of the furor that greeted the conclusion of “Game of Thrones” was, I felt, misplaced, given the very clear and unequivocal signs and behavior displayed by Daenerys up to that point. People were upset because they didn’t want to see their hero turn heel. So I find myself asking, is that what’s upsetting me here? Did Noah pull the wool over my eyes all this time? Or is the show spending its final episodes trying to do so now? The Odds and Ends: There’s probably a whole essay to be written about how in Helen’s point-of-view segments, younger women are almost always either monsters or morons. The two women who interview her for a potential job with a high-powered design firm are cases in point. At one point, Noah describes the night he and his former publicist kissed to the Vanity Fair reporter, noting that it was the same night Alison went into labor in the middle of a hurricane. “That sounds dramatic,” she deadpans. It was! Cameos galore in this one: Richard Schiff as Noah’s attorney, Stephen Kunken as his editor, Tracie Thoms as his publisher’s damage-control specialist and Jennifer Jason Leigh returning as Adeline. Few shows have a deeper bench of quality actors taking on small roles.",The New York Times
2019,"‘The Affair’ Season 5, Episode 9: Wildfire","The Affair Noah’s career is going up in flames, just like parts of California. To borrow a term from the work of Noah Solloway, his career as a writer is experiencing a descent. A calamitously rapid one, in fact, given the years of bad behavior he got away with until now. In the space of a single day, an article ruins his reputation. He has his name removed from the movie based on his book, which gets a new title to create further distance. His publisher is thinking about canceling the release of his new book. Women from his past — his former publicist Eden and his former student Audrey (Sarah Ramos) — are venting years of pent-up shame and anger as they recount what their experience of Noah Solloway, literary bad boy, was really like. But it’s Noah’s daughters, Stacey and Whitney, who provide the episode’s most devastating assessments of him. It’s one of the smartest decisions “The Affair” has made all season. If you believe — as Noah does, and as his ex-wife Helen does, too — that the charges of sexual misconduct and misogyny are ginned up, watching his own daughters tearfully struggle with his actions make them that much harder to dismiss. Stacey’s near-breakdown over Noah occurs during Helen’s half of this extra-long episode. From the moment Vanity Fair publishes its profile-turned-exposé of Noah, Helen is busy putting out fires with only mixed success. The fire analogy is appropriate because the day is complicated by mandatory evacuations over an approaching wildfire. This is California, after all. Helen loses the job she is just about to start because her boss doesn’t want to be associated with the Solloway name. Her son Trevor gets in a fist fight with his boyfriend, Brooklyn, in defense of his father. Trevor and Stacey are glued to the internet and television, where Noah is the topic of the day. The internet is where the 12-yeaer-old Stacey (Abigail Dylan Harrison, doing fine work with difficult material) finds the revelation that hurts her the deepest. Remember the crew member from his movie who had an obvious crush on him, a crush he exploited by relieving her of her bra at a party (a party with children) and planting it in Sasha’s bedroom? That woman has written an account of her humiliation at Noah’s hands — it was indeed a genuinely inexcusable act, one of the sleaziest things he has ever done — and Stacey reads it. Worse, Stacey feels responsible. “I took him to that party,” she tells her mother, sobbing. “Is it true? Is it my fault?” Helen reassures her, of course, but you can all but see the scar tissue forming in the girl’s heart. So what if some of the accusations seem overblown based on what we’ve witnessed throughout the series’s history? For that matter, so what if Sasha Mann helped engineer the exposé in order to hog more credit for Noah’s movie? That makes Sasha a lousy boyfriend to Helen, whose life he had to know would be upended, but it doesn’t make Noah’s conduct any less real. Noah’s other daughter, Whitney, is our point-of-view character for the episode’s second half. Stranded in New York when her flight to Los Angeles gets canceled because of the wildfire, she briefly reunites with her awful ex-boyfriend Furkat, who combines Sasha’s old-world arrogance with Noah’s worst attitudes toward women. He denies ever hitting her — which we saw him do, plain as day, in Season 3 — and boots her from his apartment. It gets worse. When she returns to the airport, Whitney discovers that she has been put on the same flight as Audrey, the ex-student of Noah’s whose new memoir details his emotionally abusive behavior. The two women have an extensive, contentious conversation about Audrey’s accusations. Whitney focuses on the collateral damage done to her and her siblings by Audrey’s book. Audrey flips the script, saying that men have the real power to damage lives and move on without a second thought. It’s that power, Audrey says, that initially attracted her to Noah, and it’s not hard to extrapolate that it attracted Whitney to Furkat. What would happen without that power differential? Wouldn’t the world be better for women like her and Whitney if they didn’t have to conduct mental gymnastics to put men at ease, tending to their own needs and desires only afterward? The conversation seems to tip Whitney toward confronting her fiancé, whom she tells about her one-night stand with Furkat. But when she accuses him of wanting to marry her only for a green card, he explains that it’s the other way around: He needs to stay in “this godforsaken country” because he wants to be with Whitney. And unlike Furkat, he treats her as a legitimate artistic subject, revealing a painting that captures her quiet intensity. The two are in the early moments of makeup sex when Whitney’s entire family shows up at her apartment. Her parents try to convince her that Noah’s conduct was “awkward” and “uncomfortable” but not abusive. Just hours earlier she may have agreed, but her mind has run a gantlet since then. That’s when she drops the bomb I’ve been waiting for since this story line began: She was an eyewitness to Noah’s conduct toward women way back in Season 2, when in a drunken haze he came within a hair’s breadth of putting the moves on her in a hot tub. “You didn’t recognize me, but I saw the way you look at women,” she hisses. “Like they’re prey.” Do I think “The Affair” set out to tell a #MeToo story from the start, before the #MeToo movement existed? No. But the pieces have been there all along. If it took until now for the show to look back and put those pieces together, that doesn’t make the resulting picture any less real. Noah can be a good father, as Helen insists he has been. He can do his best to be a good man, as he has insisted time and time again — going so far as confessing to a crime he didn’t commit in order to protect Helen. He can even be the victim of opportunists like Sasha, who care only about the accusations insofar as they can be exploited for personal gain. But Noah has been a bull in the china shop of women’s lives for a long time. All “The Affair” is doing now is surveying the damage. The Odds and Ends: Furkat’s emphatic “Mazel tov!” when he hears the news of Whitney’s engagement is a hilarious glimpse into his mind. It’s easy to sincerely congratulate a woman who has cheated on her fiancé with you if you have no morals to begin with. The guest star of the week is Busy Philipps, who interviews Noah’s former publicist on her talk show. Her easy charm makes her the right choice for playing this role — and makes Helen’s sense of betrayal when Philipps reads only part of her thoughtful public statement all the more palpable. The turning point in Whitney and Audrey’s conversation? Audrey’s account of men’s “power, and their authority, their agency in the world,” as she describes it, including the ways that they can get the kinds of things done “that you can only dream of and they do it without breaking a sweat because the world just offers itself up to them on a silver platter.” Whitney has witnessed this dynamic in her relationship with Furkat firsthand. Is it so hard to believe that Noah is some other woman’s Furkat?",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | ‘The Beacon Has Gone Out’: What Trump and Giuliani Have Wrought,"Opinion Once upon a time, we spread ideals of democracy and rule of law. Now? We send Rudy. Serhiy Leshchenko, an investigative journalist in Ukraine, has been attacked by Rudolph Giuliani for his role in bringing to light secret payments to the Trump campaign official Paul Manafort.CreditCreditLena Mucha for The New York Times Opinion Columnist KIEV, Ukraine — In 2014, Ukraine’s wildly corrupt president, Viktor Yanukovych, fled to Russia after mass protests on the Maidan, Kiev’s central square. During what Ukrainians call the Revolution of Dignity, police snipers killed dozens of demonstrators. In the revolution’s aftermath, a number of young idealists decided to plunge into politics, hoping to reform their troubled country from the inside. One of them was Serhiy Leshchenko, at the time perhaps the country’s most famous investigative journalist. The American political scientist Francis Fukuyama had encouraged Leshchenko and some of his friends to run for Parliament. He’d met Leshchenko in 2013, when the journalist took part in a three-week summer course run by Fukuyama at Stanford that aims to teach activists from around the world about building democratic institutions. “After the Maidan revolution, I thought that it was particularly important that all these people in civil society actually go into the government,” Fukuyama said. Many of them did. That October, Leshchenko, a lanky, bearded hipster with a passion for rave culture, became part of a cadre of Western-oriented newcomers elected to Parliament, even as he continued to work as a journalist exposing corruption. This year, after Volodymyr Zelensky won the presidential election, Leshchenko advised him during the transition. Then Rudy Giuliani began attacking Leshchenko as a conspirator against America. In 2016, Leshchenko had helped expose the “black ledger,” an accounting book of hundreds of pages found in Yanukovych’s former party headquarters. Among its many entries, it showed $12.7 million in secret payments to Paul Manafort. At the time, Manafort was running Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, but before that, he was one of Yanukovych’s most important advisers. One of the reasons Manafort is in federal prison is that he failed to disclose or pay taxes on millions of dollars from Ukraine. But if you believe Giuliani, the black ledger was part of a plot to damage Trump. During a Fox News appearance on May 10, Giuliani described the ledger as a “falsely created book” and Leshchenko as part of a group of “enemies of the president, in some cases enemies of the United States.” Last month, in an epic, ranting interview on CNN, he accused Ukraine’s leading anti-corruption organization, the Anti-Corruption Action Center, or AntAC, of developing “all of the dirty information that ended up being a false document that was created in order to incriminate Manafort.” In Giuliani’s fevered alternative reality, Ukraine’s most stalwart foes of corruption are actually corruption’s embodiment. Deeply compromised figures with vendettas against the activists — particularly the ex-prosecutors Viktor Shokin and Yuriy Lutsenko — are transformed into heroes. This addled, through-the-looking glass fantasy came to drive American foreign policy in Ukraine. Trump withdrew the American ambassador to the country, Marie Yovanovitch, whom reformers saw as their champion. He withheld military aid that Ukraine desperately needed, while asking Zelensky to do him a “favor” and investigate deranged fictions about Ukrainian interference in American elections, as well as Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Given how much Ukraine depends on American support, Giuliani’s smears made it politically impossible for Leshchenko, who left Parliament in August, to continue advising Zelensky. Now, with Ukraine at the center of a world-historical international scandal, he is stupefied to find himself defamed by powerful forces in the United States, once the world’s strongest backer of those fighting for democracy in his country. “I could imagine that maybe some Ukrainian prosecutors will create a fake case against me, or some criminals will attack me, or I could be attacked by trolls on social media,” Leshchenko told me when I met him in a Kiev cafe. “But I never imagined before that my real problems will appear because of the statement of the personal attorney of the American president.” If America can be said to have a foreign policy at this debased stage of the Trump administration, it mostly consists of sucking up to strongmen while betraying everyone who ever believed in America’s putative ideals. Trump has given Turkey his blessing to assault the Syrian Kurds, America’s crucial allies against ISIS. In June, he reportedly promised China that he wouldn’t speak out in favor of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, some of whom have been carrying American flags, as long as trade talks progressed. Here in Ukraine, a country locked in a proxy war with Russia, coping with a deluge of disinformation and propaganda and struggling to transcend a history of corruption, reformers are trying to figure out what it means when the American president sides against them. [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] Pro-Western reformers, the Ukrainian philosopher Volodymyr Yermolenko told me, had seen the United States as a “a perfect democracy functioning very well,” with an admirable system of checks and balances. “And now this image is crumbling and that’s very dangerous.” The Ukrainians I spoke to aren’t naïve; they understand that America, like any other country, generally acts from self-interest rather than high principle. But there was a time when America at least viewed the projection of democratic values as being in its self-interest. That gave liberals in countries like Ukraine leverage against recalcitrant officials. “The majority of the reforms, especially on anti-corruption, were passed because there was a very strong demand from civil society, and there was the I.M.F. and the U.S. Embassy pushing it hard,” said Oleksandra Ustinova, a former board member of AntAC who was elected to Parliament this year. The U.S. also provided a degree of protection to local activists and journalists. When Lutsenko was prosecutor general in Ukraine — a position roughly equivalent to our attorney general — he would, said Ustinova, harass anti-corruption campaigners with spurious criminal investigations. “The U.S. ambassador and the E.U. ambassador were going out publicly saying you cannot do this,” Ustinova said. Now that’s all changed. As The New York Times reported, after Trump recalled the U.S. ambassador, Lutsenko gloated to the head of AntAC that he had “eliminated your roof,” using Russian mafia slang for guardian. “We’ve been exporting our corruption to them, rather than trying to export good governance,” said Fukuyama. When he said that, Fukuyama may not have known how right he was. A few hours after I met Leshchenko, news broke that two Ukrainian-born clients of Giuliani, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, had been arrested on charges of campaign finance crimes as they were preparing to leave the United States with one-way tickets. According to an indictment, the two “sought to advance their personal financial interests and the political interests of at least one Ukrainian government official with whom they were working.” (In one of those preposterously on-the-nose details that make the Trump era feel like a computer simulation on the fritz, Parnas had a company called Fraud Guarantee.) As soon as news of the indictment broke, I messaged Leshchenko, who guessed that the unnamed Ukrainian official was Lutsenko. It was a natural assumption; it had already been reported that Parnas and Fruman connected Giuliani with Lutsenko, who had been feeding Trump’s lawyer conspiracy theories about the journalist, the former American ambassador and Joe Biden. Sure enough, on Saturday NBC News reported that Lutsenko was the official in the indictment. Yovanovitch might have been referring to Lutsenko when she said, in her Friday congressional testimony, that “individuals who have been named in the press as contacts of Mr. Giuliani may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.” Thanks to Giuliani’s escapades, the domestic grudges of a crooked Ukrainian prosecutor have blossomed into a scandal that’s likely to lead to the impeachment of an American president. Federal prosecutors are now investigating whether Giuliani himself broke the law. Lutsenko has since left Ukraine for London, and Ukrainian authorities have opened a criminal case against him for allegedly abusing his authority in an unrelated matter. In a recent interview, he told reporters for The Times that in speaking to Giuliani, he sought to tell Trump’s lawyer what he wanted to hear. “I understood very well what would interest them,” Lutsenko said, adding, “I have 23 years in politics.” He should be seen as wholly discredited, but in our polarized, frenzied media environment, lies never really go away. Trump’s defenders will continue to take Lutsenko’s stories at face value. Worse, long after America has forgotten them, these slanders, which Trump and Giuliani magnified to gargantuan scale, will linger in Ukraine, undermining the people our country once sought to help. “This smear campaign circulates everywhere: in American media, then in Ukrainian media,” said Leshchenko. Those in Ukraine who want impunity for corruption, he said, can now say, “Look at these anti-corruption activists and journalists and members of Parliament. They are not welcome in the U.S., so don’t listen to them. So it suppresses our reputation here in Ukraine as well.” Ukrainians are no strangers to post-truth politics. The first time I ever heard the term “fake news” was in 2015, when I learned about the Ukrainian fact-checking organization StopFake. It was created by a group of journalists to push back against the torrents of Russian disinformation sowing chaos in the country’s politics. At the time, it would have been hard to imagine that the United States would soon join Russia as a source of weaponized untruth in Ukraine. “This is very new, because now it seems it’s not only Russia influencing Ukrainian politics, but Ukraine is also influencing the U.S., and things happening in the U.S. are greatly influencing Ukraine,” Yevhen Fedchenko, one of StopFake’s founders, told me. “So it becomes much more complicated.” Here’s what’s not complicated. Throughout our history, America has committed many sins against democracy around the world, but we used to be on the right side in Ukraine. Not anymore.

2019,Opinion | ‘The Bob Dylan of Genocide Apologists’,"Peter Handke, the Austrian writer who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, is an apologist for Slobodan Milosevic. Mr. Hemon is a Bosnian-American novelist and essayist. Back in my previous life in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, I read the Austrian writer Peter Handke’s books, was pleasantly baffled by his plays and watched the movies he wrote. I loved the shimmering emptiness of his novel “The Goalie’s Fear of the Penalty Kick.” I loved the beauty of the Wim Wenders’s masterpiece “The Wings of Desire,” which Mr. Handke worked on. In the late 1980s, I was young and invested in the pursuit of the smart and cool. Mr. Handke seemed not only smart and cool but also a writer who was expanding the frontiers of literature. He was the kind of writer I was angling to become. But things changed for Mr. Handke and me in 1991, when Slovenia and Croatia seceded from Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav People’s Army, responding to Slobodan Milosevic, president of Serbia, engaged in a brief war in Slovenia, then in a longer and much bloodier one in Croatia, leveling cities and committing atrocities. Unwilling to stay in Yugoslavia, a majority of the people in Bosnia and Herzegovina decided in a 1992 referendum to declare independence. Mr. Milosevic pounced. His nationalist ambition to create a “Greater Serbia” demanded a genocidal operation against Bosnian Muslims. Radovan Karadzic, one of Mr. Milosevic’s proxies in Bosnia, conducted a campaign of “ethnic cleansing,” which meant rape and murder, mass expulsions, concentration camps and siege. Mr. Milosevic’s state provided full financial and military support. In July 1995, the Serbs entered Srebrenica, a town in eastern Bosnia, that had been declared a safe zone and was supposed to be protected by a Dutch battalion under the United Nations flag. Gen. Ratko Mladic, the commander of the Bosnian Serb Army, was there to celebrate the taking of Srebrenica. He declared that it was the most recent victory in the 500-year war against “the Turks” — a racist term for Bosnian Muslims. A few days later, Mr. Mladic’s soldiers murdered about 8,000 Bosnian Muslims and buried them in unmarked mass graves. I don’t remember how or when I heard that Mr. Handke, whose mother was from Slovenia, had decided that the real victims of the Yugoslav wars were the Serbs, and that the Western governments and journalists lied about them out of hatred. It could be that my initial reaction was mere disbelief — for how could the writer who imagined the angels in the sky over Berlin caring about all its citizens in Mr. Wenders’ movie come to believe that the “Muslims” in the multiethnic Sarajevo were massacring themselves to blame the Serbs, that both sides committed atrocities in Srebrenica. Mr. Handke insisted that the number of Bosnians killed was much exaggerated and that the Serbs were suffering like the Jews under the Nazis. Shortly after the war was over in 1996, he published a book titled “A Journey to the Rivers: Justice for Serbia.” He discovered a kind of purity that was 2,000 years old in Serbia and Republika Srpska (the ethnically cleansed Serb entity in Bosnia established as part of the Dayton Peace Accord) and came to believe that a true Europe still existed only there. Mr. Milosevic was so fond of Mr. Handke, he bestowed upon him the Order of the Serbian Knight for his commitment to the Serbian cause. Even after huge amounts of evidence of Serbian crimes in Croatia and Bosnia (and after 1999, in Kosovo) led to Mr. Milosevic and his proxies being arrested and indicted after the war, Mr. Handke’s support for the butcher of the Balkans went on unabated. Mr. Milosevic called for him to be a witness at his trial in The Hague, which Mr. Handke politely declined, though he visited his trial more than once. After Mr. Milosevic’s death in 2006, Mr. Handke spoke at his funeral to an audience of 20,000 patriotic mourners. In Belgrade, Mr. Handke is deemed to be “the friend the Serbs didn’t have to buy.” Outside the pure Serb lands and Mr. Handke’s head, the responsibility of Mr. Milosevic and his underlings was established beyond reasonable doubt: Mr. Karadzic and Mr. Mladic were sentenced for life for crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide. One might be tempted to think that those crimes have now become undeniable history, but Bosnians learned the hard way that “Never again!” usually means “Never again, until the next time!” We often run into people who don’t know, don’t care to know, think it is too complicated or outright deny what happened in Bosnia and whose responsibility it was. Any survivor of genocide will tell you that disbelieving or dismissing their experience is a continuation of genocide. A genocide denier is an apologist for the next genocide. As for Mr. Handke, when a journalist asked him if he was concerned about the suffering in Bosnia, he retorted, “Stick your concerns up your ass!” Mr. Handke’s immoral delusions could perhaps be related to his literary aesthetics, to his suspicion of language and its ability to represent truth, which ultimately leads to a position that everything is equally true, or untrue. His moral collapse could also be seen in the context of everlasting European Islamophobia, or its cocktail whataboutism which found all parts of former Yugoslavia equally responsible for its demise, all of which went very nicely with knee-jerk dislike of Western imperialism that in the bloody 1990s befogged the lofty minds of many a European salon. But even if one could explain Mr. Handke’s moral derailment with his intellectual skepticism, or with his uncritical sentimentalization of the Balkans, rooted in his family history, it is hard to grasp what could cause him to worship a monster like Mr. Milosevic. A dull apparatchik whose ambition exactly matched his bloodthirst, Mr. Milosevic was reliant on the oppressive machinery of his police, secret service and the paramilitaries. He made a habit of ordering the killings of his political rivals. He turned Serbia into a war-addicted kleptocracy, ruined its economy, lost every war he fought and was deposed by his own people in 2000. To Mr. Handke, he was “a rather tragic man” who did what anyone would do in his position. I haven’t been able to read Mr. Handke’s work since he devoted himself to the lost cause of Mr. Milosevic and Serbia. By virtue of being Bosnian, I am not as European as the wise Swedes on the Nobel Committee, who awarded Mr. Handke the Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday. I am therefore repeatedly failing at not seeking the connection between his writing about, say, a goalie who suffers from penalty-kick anxiety and his belief that the defenders of Sarajevo dropped a shell onto the packed city market only to blame the Serbs for it. Mr. Handke’s politics irreversibly invalidated his aesthetics, his worship of Mr. Milosevic invalidated his ethics. At Mr. Milosevic’s funeral, he said, “The world, the so-called world, knows everything about Yugoslavia, Serbia. The world, the so-called world, knows everything about Slobodan Milosevic. The so-called world knows the truth … I don’t know the truth. But I look. I listen. I feel. This is why I am here today, close to Yugoslavia, close to Serbia, close to Slobodan Milosevic.” The writer who could speak those words can’t have anything of value to say. Evidently, not knowing the truth about Mr. Milosevic and genocide was not a problem for the Nobel Committee, mandated by Alfred Nobel to reward “the person who shall have produced in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction.” Maybe the engaged literature of the great Olga Tokarczuk is to it but one among many aesthetic, ethical options of value equal to Mr. Handke’s. Perhaps the esteemed Nobel Committee is so invested in the preservation of Western civilization that to it a page of Mr. Handke is worth a thousand Muslim lives. Or it could be that in the rarefied chambers in Stockholm, Mr. Handke’s anxious goalie is far more real than a woman from Srebrenica whose family was eradicated in the massacre. The choice of Mr. Handke implies a concept of literature safe from the infelicities of history and actualities of human life and death. War and genocide, Milosevic and Srebrenica, the value of the writer’s words and actions at this moment in history, might be of interest to the unsophisticated plebs once subjected to murder and displacement, but not to those who can appreciate “linguistic ingenuity” that “has explored the periphery and the specificity of human experience.” For them, genocide comes and goes, but literature is forever. In the midst of a global epidemic of Islamophobia and white nationalism, Mr. Handke’s Nobel Prize has validated an aesthetic untroubled by decency, a literary project whose value should dissolve like a body in acid before the magnitude of crimes its author repeatedly denied and thus endorsed. Mr. Handke is the Bob Dylan of genocide apologists. The Nobel Committee has shown us that it knows little about literature and its true place in this so-called world.

2019,"‘The Cave’ Review: Do No Harm, for as Long as Possible","critic’s pick Feras Fayyad’s new documentary takes viewers into a subterranean Syrian hospital, as warplanes rumble overhead and bombings rattle the walls. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Entering theaters at a timely moment, “The Cave” is a frightening immersion in life under siege in Syria that, as difficult as it often is to watch, can’t come close to replicating how harrowing it must have been to film. The setting of the documentary, from the Syrian-born director Feras Fayyad (“Last Men in Aleppo”), is a subterranean hospital on the outskirts of Damascus connected to the world outside by tunnels and basement shelters. (With the site difficult to reach, Fayyad directed remotely for much of the shoot, relying on three cinematographers.) The hospital is managed by Dr. Amani Ballour, a pediatrician who, in a fiercely patriarchal culture, must contend with skepticism from men when not addressing children’s injuries. One of her colleagues is Dr. Salim Namour, who, in a grim motif, cues up his iPhone with classical music before operating. Samaher, a nurse who cooks, comments that even making rice has become dangerous: “Every time there is a bomb, I run to the other side. That’s part of the cooking.” (Food is in short supply and malnutrition is rampant, although there is popcorn for Dr. Ballour’s 30th birthday.) The rumble of warplanes and bombs might make “The Cave” sound overproduced — if this weren’t a documentary. (Additional title cards might have helped to orient the viewer, though.) As medicine runs short or the hospital is rushed with the victims of a chemical attack (doctors must wear masks and discard patients’ clothes), the space feels increasingly claustrophobic. There is no endgame here; the doctors can only do their best as the situation grows worse. The Cave Rated PG-13. In Arabic and English, with subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 42 minutes.

2019,"‘The Daily,’ Washington Edition","THE DAILY NEWSLETTER What does the impeachment inquiry sound like? We went to find out. By midweek, as the breaking news alerts, closed-door testimonies and jaw-dropping leaks piled up around us, producers Rachel Quester and Clare Toeniskoetter and I realized we had chosen the right time to be in Washington. We knew it would be a big week in the impeachment inquiry. But it turned out to be momentous. Our plan was to record a week’s worth of shows from The Times’s D.C. bureau — home to dozens of reporters covering the White House, the intelligence agencies and the federal government — and simultaneously build toward a special Friday episode. We envisioned a documentary that would capture what the impeachment investigation actually sounds like. Nicholas Fandos, a congressional reporter, agreed to let us follow him around the Capitol as he reported on the parade of witnesses testifying before impeachment investigators. Clare and Rachel worked at all hours, meeting up with Nick in the morning and shadowing him late into the night as he staked out the secure chambers of the House Intelligence Committee and chased down lawmakers during rare breaks in testimony. As we worked on Friday’s episode, we debated how to make the rest of the week’s shows capture the energy and personality of the Washington bureau. Rachel had an idea: What if we asked our colleagues to deliver the news summary that I usually say at the end of each show? We gave it a try on Tuesday, showing up at the desk of Eric Schmitt to ask him about news out of Syria. On Wednesday, we tried again, this time with Mike Schmidt. On Thursday, it was Julie Hirschfeld Davis, and on Friday, Sheryl Gay Stolberg. In classic “Daily” fashion, we made the request on the spot. You can hear busy reporters’ genuine reactions: surprise and curiosity, followed by acceptance and, in the end, enthusiasm. By Thursday, Clare and Rachel had gathered all the field tape they needed, and we sat down with Nick for a final 90-minute interview in the Capitol that would help stitch together a week’s worth of audio. We commandeered the only truly quiet room we could find: an empty TV studio, designed for news conferences, featuring a wooden podium that read “U.S. House of Representatives.” On our way out of the Capitol at 10 p.m. on Thursday, Clare had an idea: to read the show’s credits, identifying every member of the “Daily” team, as we walked out of the building through a series of doors and marble hallways. In the final moments of Friday’s episode, if you listen carefully, you can hear Rachel, Clare and me emerging into the cold night air of downtown Washington, marveling at the moon. Talk to Michael on Twitter: @mikiebarb. You heard our National editor, Marc Lacey, at the top of Wednesday’s episode about the biggest presidential primary debate in American history. Marc has been around for many debates during his 20-year tenure at The Times, but Tuesday was his first time moderating one, alongside CNN’s Anderson Cooper and Erin Burnett. We asked him what it was like to be on the other side of the cameras: “Sure, I was somewhat nervous. I’d have been crazy not to have been. But I must say that my two co-moderators were calming. We would glance at one another during breaks in the action — we couldn’t speak, because we were hooked up to mics — and send good vibes. One bit of wisdom that Anderson offered me beforehand: ‘You’re going to feel great when it’s over.’ He was right.” Monday: How did the Kurds come to be seen as allies to the United States and terrorists to Turkey? Ben Hubbard explains. Tuesday: “Generally, we don’t pay that much attention to ambassadors.” Sharon LaFraniere on why we’re paying attention now to the former American ambassador to Ukraine, who found herself at the center of the impeachment inquiry. Wednesday: The fourth Democratic debate showed us who the candidates see as their front-runner. Alex Burns and Maggie Haberman give us the rundown. Thursday: “Sometimes the worst-case scenario is even worse than you can imagine.” David Sanger on how the withdrawal of American troops from Syria led to a crisis that was completely foreseeable and foreseen. Friday: Nick Fandos with the latest from Washington: Congress is back from recess. The impeachment investigation is in full swing. And this week, several diplomats broke their silence.

2019,‘The Doors Remained Open as a Man’s Voice Came Over the Speaker’,"METROPOLITAN DIARY Confusion over where the F will stop next, going to the game and more reader tales of New York City in this week’s Metropolitan Diary. Dear Diary: A Coney Island-bound F train pulled into the Jay Street-Metro Tech station. The doors opened. People got off. People got on. The doors remained open as a man’s voice came over the speaker. “This train will be going express,” he said. “Next stop: Seventh Avenue.” Those who needed the stations being bypassed got off to wait for the next train. A woman’s voice came over the speaker: “This train is not going express,” she said. “Next stop will be Bergen Street.” The people who had gotten off to wait for a local got back on. A few passengers smiled at the mix-up in communication. The man’s voice returned. “This train is going express,” he said. “Express, express, express. Next stop will be Seventh Avenue.” Exasperated, those who needed the local stops knew the drill. Off the train they went. But wait. Here came the woman’s voice. “Local, local, local! We’re going local.” By now, everyone was laughing and shaking their heads. Dear reader, we went local. — Diane Fromharz Dear Diary: I was on a Metro-North train going into the city. At some point, I noticed two boys get on. When the conductor came through to collect tickets, one of the boys asked sheepishly how much it cost. “Where are you going?” the conductor asked. Yankee Stadium, the boy said. It was two stops away. The conductor asked how much money they had. One dollar, the boys said. With a straight face, the conductor said he was not sure that would be enough. He said he might have to stop the train and put the boys off for lack of funds. Then he smiled. “Keep the dollar,” he said. “And buy yourself something at the ballpark.” — Maggie Loewenwarter Dear Diary: I was a child of Chicago’s northern suburbs. In summer 1975, when I was 12, my 23-year-old brother, who had attended New York University, arranged for me to come to Manhattan for a week’s vacation. After I got there, we went to the Other End (a.k.a. the Bitter End). “There’s a cover charge and a two-drink minimum,” the man at the door said. “Your small friend here can have his in hot chocolate.” Michael Urbaniak and Fusion were performing. I had all of their albums. I played in my junior high school jazz band and I got to talk shop with the drummer between sets. A waitress accidentally spilled beer on me during the show. In the taxi on the way back to my hotel, the driver turned around. “It smells like the little man had too much to drink tonight,” he said. — Roger Fortune Dear Diary: There was nothing more restful to me than strolling up Broadway after a day at my advertising job. People thought I was crazy to walk from 16th Street to my apartment on East 83rd. But as long as there was no rush, I found it to be the perfect way to decompress and enjoy the city. Most days I would walk with my best friend, the copywriter at the agency, and shoot the breeze about anything and everything. One time, we somehow got onto the subject of being total losers at sports, specifically in junior high school when teams were being chosen. It had always been a lesson in humiliation for both of us. We both looked athletic, but we both totally lacked coordination or interest. “But I was good at tumbling,” I said. “Seriously?” my colleague said. “Watch this!” I dropped back a few steps and proceeded to do my first cartwheel in 20 years in front of the Rivoli Theater, a movie palace that is now long gone. “Very impressive,” my colleague said. Just then a woman sitting in traffic honked her horn and rolled down her window. “You bent your knees,” she said. I walked back to my starting point and did another one. “Now that,” she said, “is a cartwheel.” — Tom Ickert Dear Diary: For years, I parked my car in the same Upper East Side garage whenever I drove to the neighborhood from my home in Westchester County. I did it about four times a year. The same garage attendant was there every time. He always said he wouldn’t charge me the extra fee required for my S.U.V. because I was a regular. I suspected that he said it to everyone who owned an S.U.V. in hopes of being rewarded with a generous tip — which he was every time. Once I arrived at the garage in a new sedan. The attendant said nothing as he handed me the ticket. Aha!, I thought. I was right. He had no idea who I was. When I returned hours later, the attendant retrieved my car. He didn’t say anything until I handed him the usual tip. “Thank you,” he said. “Did you sell your old car?” — Maralyn Matlick Read all recent entries and our submissions guidelines.

2019,‘The Elephant Queen’ Review: Magnificent Images of Majestic Animals,"Critic’s pick In footage shot over several years, this documentary follows a herd of elephants across the Kenyan savanna. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Gentle and hopeful, “The Elephant Queen” sometimes shies away from tough truths. But this documentary aims to celebrate these creatures rather than stir rage over their peril. Considering its intended young audience, that’s a smart strategy. Narrated by the actor Chiwetel Ejiofor and directed by Mark Deeble and Victoria Stone, “Queen” centers on Athena, the leader of an extended family of wild elephants that roam the Kenyan savanna. In footage shot over several years, we watch the herd congregate at its watering hole, raise its offspring and, during a drought, travel long distances to find a new water source. Time and again we’re shown how curious and perceptive elephants are. (One scene, where the herd seemingly recognizes the bones of a dead member and stops to mourn the animal, is breathtaking.) Other species are also observed: The life cycles of birds, reptiles and insects intertwine with those of the elephants, and are just as fascinating. Deeble’s script spotlights a few daily dramas to raise a bit of tension and humor, and his cinematography is magnificent. Yet the film’s omissions can be glaring — climate change is affecting these animals but is never mentioned. Similarly, rampant poaching kills tens of thousands of elephants every year; if this insanity doesn’t stop, extinction is assured. Only at the very end is the slaughter mentioned, almost in passing. Young viewers could certainly handle a few more harsh facts. Yet “The Elephant Queen” sets out, first and foremost, to use a narrative to build compassion. And here, a good story is as effective as a shout. The Elephant Queen Rated PG. Running time: 1 hour 36 minutes.

2019,‘The Irishman’ Opens the New York Film Festival,"And Timothée Chalamet plays coy at the premiere of “The King.” 10 Photos View Slide Show › Martin Scorsese’s new drama, “The Irishman,” which opened this year’s New York Film Festival, took 12 years to make and three and a half hours to watch. “This film is of substantial duration,” Mr. Scorsese said before its premiere on Friday night at Lincoln Center. The tented red carpet, which occupied a lane of West 65th street, was a veritable perp walk of mob-film actors: Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Harvey Keitel and Al Pacino (in his first Scorsese movie). Other cast members included Anna Paquin, Ray Romano, Jesse Plemons and Bobby Cannavale. Talk among the actors turned to Rao’s, the East Harlem Italian restaurant and former mafia canteen, where reservations are harder to come by than a don’s forgiveness. Bo Dietl, a private investigator who plays a mobster in the film, had a tip for getting a table. “You have to know Bo Dietl,” he said. Daphna Kastner, Mr. Keitel’s wife, had a different idea. “Kill somebody,” she said. Mr. Cannavale was no less helpful. “You got to make buddies with Bo Dietl. Or Woody Allen, or Sonny Grosso,” he said, referring to the New York police detective immortalized in “The French Connection.” “Those are the three guys I’ve been there with.” More than four hours later, the cast arrived at the after-party at Tavern on the Green, where they were joined by Leonardo DiCaprio, Katie Holmes, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Peter Sarsgaard, Spike Lee, Kirsten Dunst, Rose Byrne, David O. Russell, John Turturro and Fran Lebowitz. They were effusive in their praise for the film, which is already an awards-season favorite. Based on the book “I Heard You Paint Houses,” about the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa, the film will stream on Netflix after a limited theatrical release. Does the cast have any advice for cinema-goers who may need to leave their seat during such a long film? “That’s what I was worried about, but I find the movie is so compelling I could not walk away,” Mr. Cannavale said. “Once it comes out on Netflix, you can take a million bathroom breaks if you want.” Perhaps all that good buzz has gone to Netflix’s head. On Tuesday night in Chelsea, Netflix held a star-studded premiere for “The King,” a period drama about England’s King Henry V at the battle of Agincourt in 1415, starring Timothée Chalamet and Lily-Rose Depp. The media covering the after-party at the Box nightclub on the Lower East Side received bizarre instructions: “Netflix are requesting that you refrain from commenting on the cast’s activities.” So much for “Netflix and chill.” Could the cold shoulder have something to do with recent paparazzi pictures of Mr. Chalamet and Ms. Depp smooching on a boat, teasing the media with evidence of a publicity-friendly romance that they coyly refuse to confirm? Journalists were told at the last moment that such questions were also off-limits on the red carpet, where the young actors conspicuously kept their distance from each other before the screening. They were joined by Joel Edgerton, a co-star, and David Michôd, the director. (Mr. Edgerton and Mr. Michôd also wrote the film.) Boldface guests included The Weeknd, Patti Smith, Alysia Reiner and Gina Gershon. Mr. Chalamet, in a black Givenchy suit and yellow mock turtleneck, charmed his legion of shrieking fans with hugs and selfies. He was also generous with reporters, albeit on a narrower range of questions. Did he think his royal character would have supported freedom of the press? “There was no printing press yet, so it’s almost impossible to imagine,” he said. “But if you’re making an allusion to the attack on the press that’s super-contemporaneous, it’s scary, it’s destabilizing, but thankfully it’s instigated a conversation to be aware of it.” And should that freedom extend to reporting on the “activities” of celebrities such as himself? His publicist tapped him on the wrist before he could answer; it was time to move on.",The New York Times
2019,‘The King’ Review: Once More Unto the Breach (but Why?),"In this period drama, Timothée Chalamet plays the prince who becomes King Henry V (with little help from Shakespeare). When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Orson Welles once said that “every single way of playing and staging Shakespeare — as long as the way is effective — is right.” It’s hard to know if Welles would have been as kindly disposed to an effort like “The King.” Directed by David Michôd, the movie is a churn of mud and blood that draws from the Henry plays, history and, in its storytelling approach, Hollywood. In a miscalculated bid at relevancy, it also ditches Shakespeare’s poetry and prose for a generic hero’s journey, one that leans hard on Timothée Chalamet’s droopy charisma as the dissolute prince turned warrior-king. The Henry plays have been adapted to the screen before, including Welles’s dazzling “Chimes at Midnight” (he plays Falstaff) and Gus Van Sant’s liberal appropriation (or bowdlerization) for “My Own Private Idaho.” Straighter in every sense than either, “The King” sets the story on parallel tracks that eventually converge in the royal court. There, King Henry IV (Ben Mendelsohn, making the showy most of a minor role) rules over the usual retinue of toadying courtiers while waging endless war. A greasy, festering mess, he voices displeasure with the young Henry, a.k.a. Hal, preferring the belligerent hero turned rebel, Hotspur (a vibrant Tom Glynn-Carney). Meanwhile back at the inn, Hal and Falstaff (Joel Edgerton) carouse amid a flurry of murky superimposed images. Like much in this movie, Falstaff is at once familiar and scarcely recognizable. He’s more padded than portly and nowhere near the hulk who, in “Henry IV, Part I,” Hal mocks as “this horseback-breaker, this huge hill of flesh.” (That Falstaff gives as good as he gets, calling Hal a “bull’s pizzle,” among other insults.) With a dark rather than snowy beard, Edgerton’s Falstaff also registers as far younger yet less forceful than Shakespeare’s invention, suggesting that someone here worried that too much sagging flesh and adult wit would turn off young viewers. Every era gets its own Shakespeare movies, which invariably hold a mirror up to the audience. In Laurence Olivier’s 1944 film of “Henry V,” the St. Crispin’s Day speech is directed at a country fighting Hitler. Decades later, during the Vietnam War, Welles turned the Henry plays into “Chimes at Midnight,” making Falstaff the story’s fulcrum and stripping Henry’s battle against the French at Agincourt down to a harrowing, unheroic struggle. For its part, “The King” focuses on Hal-Henry, turning his evolution into a predictable journey into self-awareness, with brooding looks and noble intentions. And while this Henry speaks of peace, the filmmakers speak louder by turning Agincourt into their showstopper. “The King” doesn’t preface the battle with the St. Crispin’s Day speech — “we happy few, we band of brothers” — one of Shakespeare’s most soaring and frequently bastardized orations. Instead Michôd and Edgerton, who share script credit, furnish Henry with a big-game pep talk that Chalamet delivers at top volume while he walks among his men, stoking nationalist fires by asking them to kill and think of England. The fight is well staged and at least in its emphasis on the human toll of war — the panting, clanging misery of men in armor dying in one another’s grip — owes a stronger debt to Welles than to Olivier’s antiseptic, politically expedient vision. Chalamet is appealing (bowl haircut or no), but also routinely outperformed by a cast that includes the reliably strong Sean Harris as one of Henry’s advisers. This scarcely seems Chalamet’s fault, but rather a deeper problem of intent. Michôd has a gift for screen violence and is generally good with actors, yet time and again your attention drifts from Hal-Henry to the story’s edges, where the supporting actors nibble at their tasty bits. What Michôd never manages to make clear is what we are to make of this version’s nationalism, its glorification of war, its ambivalence toward corrupting power and its selective, finally misguided attempt to brush off Shakespeare. The King Rated R for ye olde carnage. Running time: 2 hours 13 minutes.

2019,‘The Kominsky Method’: Chuck Lorre’s Second Act,"Ask A Showrunner Ahead of the Season 2 premiere of his Golden Globe-winning Netflix series, the man synonymous with network sitcoms discusses the challenges of trying something new. Chuck Lorre has been called the “angriest man on TV” because of his battles with network executives, actors and critics. He has also been called the “King of Comedy,” having created one hit network sitcom after another since the early ’90s. One title he has only recently grown accustomed to, however, is “old.” “Internally I don’t think of myself that way, but boy, I am,” Lorre, 66, said in a recent phone interview from Los Angeles. “So I’m dealing with it. It’s a universal feeling like, Wait, what’s happening to me?” That experience is one reason he feels so close to his Netflix comedy “The Kominsky Method,” he said, about an aging acting coach named Sandy (played by Michael Douglas) and Sandy’s wisecracking, recently widowed agent, Norman (Alan Arkin). Other than their friendship and professional history, what binds the two men together is their struggles with the often unpleasant problems (dying loved ones, prostate flare-ups) that arrive with age. Before “Kominsky,” Lorre was known best for creating more traditional, so-called multicamera sitcoms like “The Big Bang Theory,” “Cybill,” “Dharma & Greg” and the CBS newcomer “Bob Hearts Abishola.” But “Kominsky,” with its cinematic aesthetic and looser constraints — no studio audience, no commercial breaks, no censorship — offered him a much-sought-after new experience. It also won a Golden Globe for best musical or comedy series. Ahead of the second season of “Kominsky,” which arrives on Netflix Friday, Lorre discussed what he learned from Douglas and Arkin, why the term “sitcom” is a misnomer, and why he still shudders at the memory of Charlie Sheen’s exit from “Two and a Half Men.” These are edited excerpts from that conversation. A half-hour network sitcom has tried-and-true plot structure, but don’t you have far more room to experiment on “Kominsky”? First of all, I don’t really think plot is a driving factor in anything I do. I think character is the primary asset. You don’t remember your favorite half-hour sitcoms because of the plot. You remember them because you love those characters. You love Norm and Cliff and Sam and Woody and Kramer. I think that’s because a character is a combination of writing and great acting. And if you’re lucky enough, you find the right actor for the part. Isn’t there an overarching plot in “Kominsky” about how Sandy comes to terms with aging? What I was interested in exploring was just the minutiae of getting older. There’s not a lot of plot in that; that’s just life. That’s just human entropy. I take it then that this show, perhaps more than others you’ve created, hits especially close to home. That’s true. I don’t have to make this stuff up. On “The Big Bang Theory” we would be regularly talking to our astrophysicist consultant David Saltzberg at U.C.L.A. to make sure we got the math right or the science right. I didn’t need to have a consultant on this one. [Laughs.] So much of the success of “Kominsky” hinged on the chemistry between Douglas and Arkin. What was it like bearing witness to their dynamic? I really like the phrase “bear witness.” Because that’s what it felt like. I had a front-row seat to watch two masters of their craft. They approach the work very differently, but they both arrive at a performance that’s startling and every time surprising. When you write something, you have an image in your mind as to how it’s going to look, how it’s going to sound. And then you go to the stage and actors like Michael Douglas and Alan Arkin read it and have other ideas. And they spin it differently, and the syncopation is different, the tone is different. Inevitably, it’s better. The most inspired moments involve little more than the two of them just exchanging barbs. One of the things I learned in the first season is I could actually write less and do a better job. When we first started this I didn’t understand the kind of power that both of these men have over the camera. A gesture, a look, a raised eyebrow, even a pause on their part communicated more than words. And especially for comedic purposes. A bunch of clever words weren’t needed. “Kominsky” is your first non-network show. Could this show have worked on network TV? Or was the plan always for this to go to a streaming platform like Netflix? Would this have been possible on a major broadcast network? I don’t know. I really never thought of it that way. I wanted from the beginning to have an opportunity to work in a different environment with a different palette. So I could learn. I had a steep learning curve because I had been doing the studio audience, four-camera approach for decades. So you’re saying you welcomed the challenge? I sought it out. I wanted to learn a new trick, says the dog who’s a bit older. How then should we view this in relation to your other work? Or is this the future of what we’ve come to know as sitcoms? Well, let’s break down the word. Because it comes from “Situation Comedy.” There’s no situation here other than the fact we get older. And we deal with health issues, and we deal with the loss of loved ones, and we deal with the feeling of being irrelevant and disenfranchised and to some extent uncomprehending of things as the culture changes. So I think you’re hard-pressed to call those situations. The situation is just life. So is the sitcom as we knew it dead? Well, that word is really just a misnomer. It’s an anomaly. It really doesn’t belong anymore. The word really made a lot of sense when a guy married a witch. Or when an astronaut came back from outer space with a genie. I’m going to call that a situation. [Laughs.] When a Martian is living with you and you have to keep it a secret — that’s a situation. But getting through the day and dealing with people at work, dealing with family, that’s just life. And the comedy of life is not plot driven. It’s just the reality of what we do every day. It’s universal. It doesn’t matter if the characters in “The Big Bang Theory” are quantum physicists. Because loneliness is loneliness. It doesn’t matter what you do for a living. Fear, jealousy. the Seven Deadly Sins: They play for all of us. So that’s what you write about in TV. For me, anyway. When conceiving your shows, have you thought of them as being aimed at different constituencies? Or is the goal always to reach as many people as possible? I’ve always been suspicious of the idea of aiming a show. It comes very close to pandering. And assuming that you know how to play to or manipulate an audience. And I don’t know that. I don’t have that skill. What I do instead is I try and make a show that I find is worth watching. That I think is funny. That I think the characters are interesting. You’ve mostly stayed behind the scenes. Perhaps it’s more of a contemporary model to put the showrunner out front. It’s not something I want. Who would seek that out? The show is the thing. The show, that’s what hopefully has value. My opinions, my perceptions of what’s important — I’m not trying to be self-deprecating, but who cares? Did getting publicly trashed by Charlie Sheen amid his departure from “Two and a Half Men” affect how you view your own celebrity? That whole experience with “Two and a Half Men” was a nightmare. I hated every minute of it. I’m glad it’s in the rearview mirror. I learned a lot from it. Primarily that public ridicule doesn’t kill you. It feels like it might. But it doesn’t. You just go about your business. You go back and you keep working. There’s nothing else to do.

2019,"‘The Lighthouse’ Review: Dark Nights, Troubled Souls, Hairy Men","Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe play antagonistic lighthouse keepers in a twisted tale of men and loneliness. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson have two of the most mesmerizing — and pleasurably unnerving — physiognomies in movies. In “The Lighthouse,” a sly American Gothic set in the late 19th century, the director Robert Eggers lights and frames the actors to emphasize every bony plane, every facial crease, hollow and pinprick of stubble. The stark black-and-white cinematography deepens the film's shadows and unease, but it also throws these grizzled faces into relief, sharpening their cheekbones and revealing the death’s head under each man’s grimace. A horror movie about inner and outer darkness, the film begins with two lighthouse workers, Wake (Dafoe) and Winslow (Pattinson), arriving on a small, desolate island. Over many solitary days and nights, they work, eat, drink and dig at each other, establishing a bristling antagonism born of temperament and boredom or maybe just narrative convenience. Wake likes to yammer, but the men aren’t ready conversationalists. In time, their minds and tongues are loosened by alcohol and perhaps a simple human need for companionship. The wind howls, the camera prowls, the sea roars and Eggers flexes his estimable filmmaking technique as an air of mystery rapidly thickens. Much as he did in his shivery feature debut, “The Witch,” about an isolated family of fundamentalists coming unglued in early 17th-century America, Eggers makes the secluded world in “The Lighthouse” at once recognizable and eerily unfamiliar, a combination that draws you in but makes you feel unsettled. (He shares script credit with Max Eggers, his brother.) The image of the lighthouse evokes visions of high seas and storms as well as the promise of safe passage and harbor. But here, that romantic idea soon sours. Looming against the perennially gray sky this brick tower looks utilitarian and ominous, a twin to the 19th century’s industrial smokestacks. An old salt with alarmed hair and a wedge-shaped beard worthy of Melville, Wake is the veteran keeper of the lighthouse flame, the guardian of its traditions, language and superstitions. (Never ever kill a sea gull, he cautions.) Dafoe’s mercurial movements, his rippling face and spooky smiles, dovetail beautifully, articulating Wake’s moods and adding to the destabilization. He barks orders, sings a shanty, indulges in sentimentality and turns his yowling mouth into an abyss. To Winslow’s mounting irritation, Wake also guards the key to the lantern room, a glowing, near-mystical chamber with a magnificent prism that provides the film with blasts of bright light. With control and precision, expressionist lighting and an old-fashioned square film frame that adds to the claustrophobia, Eggers seamlessly blurs the lines between physical space and head space. The men in “The Lighthouse” don’t use the therapy-speak of contemporary American cinema (or life) with its endless overexplaining. Instead, Wake and Winslow come into focus through guttural exchanges, their physicality (farting, sweating, straining) and their built and natural environments. The sparse grass and rocky outcrops, the cramped rooms and vertiginous stairs speak to the men’s existential condition — the hardness, confinement and downward spiraling — while (as in “The Witch”) a menacing animal suggests a supernatural threat. Early on, Wake strips — as if to bathe in the lighthouse’s radiance — and the story takes a turn for the amusingly perverse as trouble starts creeping around the edges. The men’s antagonism deepens as Wake jabbers and Winslow rages, a fury that Pattinson makes visible with eyes that widen into bulges and tremors of emotion that ping under a masklike vacancy. One man masturbates in a frenzy; at another point, he spies on the other grinding alone. The men’s sloppy, alcohol-saturated time together produces intimacy but also menace. They laugh, descending into riotous drunkenness and finding connection that both they and Eggers skitter around. The film itself doesn’t so much deepen as continue to glide on its seductive surfaces and teasing promise. “The Lighthouse” is largely without women. But their traces are strewn throughout, surfacing in the men’s anecdotes (their stories obscure as much as they reveal) and in a mermaid figurine that Winslow finds. He retrieves the crude statuette through a tear in his mattress, digging it out of the hairy stuffing with probing fingers that Eggers — who has the eye of a miniaturist — shows in close-up. (The scene evokes Harvey Keitel stroking a hole in Holly Hunter’s stocking in “The Piano,” another 19th-century Gothic tale.) For Winslow, the mermaid is a fetish, a replacement for something that remains elusive and that — as a flashback suggests — he can’t fully voice. The story in “The Lighthouse” is thin enough to invite plentiful interpretations about masculinity, homosocial relations and desire, even if its more suggestive theme is Wake’s punishing exploitation of Winslow. (It recalls Leslie Fiedler’s observation that “the proper subject” of the American Gothic is slavery.) The film’s more sustained pleasures, though, are its form and style, its presumptive influences (von Stroheim’s “Greed,” German Expressionism), the frowning curve of Winslow’s mustache, the whites of eyes rolled back in terror. Eggers meticulously sets the scene, adds texture and builds tension and mystery from men locked in battle and sometimes in embrace. He has created a story about an age-old struggle, one that is most satisfyingly expressed in this film’s own tussle between genre and its deviations. The Lighthouse Rated R for nudity, salty language and violence toward animals. Running time: 1 hour 49 minutes.

2019,‘The New Englanders’ Review: Trying Too Hard to Be Special,"Gay dads and their “woke genius” daughter face the limitations of life in a patchy new play by Jeff Augustin. For the characters in Jeff Augustin’s “The New Englanders,” which opened on Wednesday at New York City Center’s Studio at Stage II, “basic” is quite the insult. When someone scrawls the word on Eisa’s locker at school, she is so offended she takes revenge. After all, as the biracial daughter of her New England town’s only gay dads, Eisa is anything but mainstream. She sees herself as the next Lauryn Hill. One of her dads — the white one, Samuel — calls her, with some awe, a “woke genius.” Despite their demographics, the adults are surely the basic ones in the family. A hot night for Samuel involves lasagna followed by “Annie Hall” on TV. He does not know that “black dad,” Aaron, is beginning to feel, with Eisa’s upcoming departure for college, that years of parenting and enforced domesticity have doused whatever wildness he once had within him. If this sounds like the setup for a smart, stinging contemporary comedy, of the imminent-empty-nest subgenus, it very much is. But the setup quickly goes astray, or is deliberately derailed, in this Manhattan Theater Club production directed by Saheem Ali. Startling plot developments halfway through the play’s swift 100 minutes jumble the tone and strain credibility until we no longer know what genre — or even what world — we’re in. Nor can we discern in the aftermath what point the playwright is making. That’s a shame because Mr. Augustin is drawn to complex conflicts. Refreshingly, gay parenting isn’t one of them; Aaron (Teagle F. Bougere) and Samuel (Patrick Breen) might as well be straight, so little does their homosexuality seem to matter to Eisa (Kara Young) or to their neighbors. (It barely matters to them, which proves to be a problem.) And race, too, seems like something Mr. Augustin intends to treat lightly. As the play begins, Aaron, expertly twisting Eisa’s hair for bed, comments disparagingly on the movie they’ve just seen: Whereas white people onscreen get to be sad and “silently live their lives,” he explains, black people “can only teach lessons on race and class.” But that amusing swipe is misleading, because the story Mr. Augustin proceeds to tell does engage race at every turn. Eisa feels, or thinks she feels, alienated in the “godforsaken white oppressive culture” of her community. When a white teacher won’t give her credit for a “vision board” project she didn’t turn in, Eisa blames racism. That Ms. Charpie (Crystal Finn) once lost on “Jeopardy!” by failing to remember the name Zora Neale Hurston is all the proof Eisa needs. If this is satirical, what happens next cannot be; Eisa’s revenge on those who fail to appreciate her nascent greatness is baroque and unfunny. Even her proto-romantic dealings with a boy named Atlas — a classmate who sells pot at the local Chuck E. Cheese — are turned into racial transactions. When Atlas (Adam Langdon) asks Eisa what her favorite music is, she says it’s not her job to educate a white person about black culture. But she’ll do it in exchange for a discount on weed. Even as the story goes haywire, there are powerful moments and hard insights within it. In one subplot, Mr. Augustin, whose earlier play “Little Children Dream of God” was likewise studded with loveliness, has Aaron try to reconnect with his first boyfriend. The scenes between Mr. Bougere and Javier Muñoz as Raul, the “nomad” ex, may seem unlikely in their setup but are full of utterly believable regret as each must recognize the limitations life has put on him. Mr. Ali gives such moments the time and quiet they need; one of the play’s sweetest passages even takes place in silence. When Eisa strikes her deal with Atlas, allowing him to listen to Lauryn Hill through one of her earbuds while she listens through the other, we hear nothing but instead see the bliss passing over and through them. That instances of profound connection are the strength of “The New Englanders” is something of a conundrum; the play originated in the Miami-raised Mr. Augustin’s own feelings of alienation as a college student in Boston. It’s a tipoff to that sense of alienation that he has Aaron describe “Our Town,” the Thornton Wilder classic that takes place in New Hampshire, as a “not that great” play that makes “white suburban people nostalgic.” And yet “Our Town” is the template for whatever is best about “The New Englanders” — including the opportunity for some rich performances by young actors. (Ms. Young, so moving last year in “The Revolving Cycles Truly and Steadily Roll’d,” and Mr. Langdon, a late addition to the “New Englanders” cast, are especially fine.) What they help rescue from the confusion here is an insight Wilder would surely have appreciated: that our lives seem special only from within, and only for a time. It doesn’t get more basic than that, in the good sense. The New Englanders Tickets Through Oct. 20 at Manhattan Theater Club Stage II, Manhattan; 212-581-1212, nycitycenter.org.

2019,‘The Parts You Lose’ Review: Talk to Me,"Aaron Paul plays a violent fugitive whose life is saved by a lonely deaf boy in this downbeat thriller. The central character in Christopher Cantwell’s small-scale thriller, “The Parts You Lose,” is a lonely 10-year-old named Wesley. As played by the deaf British actor Danny Murphy, Wesley is watchful and careful in his movements, as if hoping that the school bully won’t notice him. He always does. At home with his mother (a warm Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and his little sister, Wesley is happier — at least until his gruff father, Ronnie (Scoot McNairy), returns home after an unspecified absence. Depressed and in denial about the extent of his son’s deafness, Ronnie refuses to learn sign language or help the boy to communicate. Despite the brevity of these scenes, the actors establish the family’s strained dynamic so adroitly that when the boy finds a wounded fugitive (Aaron Paul) and decides to nurse him back to health, we don’t need to be told why. Painted in drizzle-gray tones, the movie is driftingly slow, while Darren Lemke’s economical, almost curt script contains barely enough story to hold the screen. Both Winstead and McNairy (who also starred in Cantwell’s terrific AMC drama, “Halt and Catch Fire”) are underfed by their roles, unable to dispel the movie’s wan tone or rev up its flagging energy. As Wesley draws closer to the injured man, the TV news warns of a missing suspect in a violent shooting. But this isn’t a cops-and-criminals tale: it’s a downbeat meditation on disappointment. Most of all, “The Parts You Lose” is concerned with fathers and sons and what it means for one to fail the other. Hovering between two very different men, Wesley is unable to verbalize exactly what he needs — the sole word that escapes him is a wail of abandonment that echoes long after the fugitive has disappeared.

2019,‘The Pout-Pout Fish’ Review: A Grouch Gets Back in the Swim,"Critic’s Pick TheaterWorksUSA has brought a best-selling children’s book series to the stage in a bubbly, puppet-filled musical. Everyone knows a pouter or two. But even if those individuals are cold fish, they probably aren’t the kind that lives in the sea. The title character of “The Pout-Pout Fish,” however, is as sulky and depressive as any human. Swimming onstage in a new musical from TheaterWorksUSA, a venerable producer for young audiences, Mr. Pout-Pout Fish admits that he spreads “the dreary wearies” wherever he goes. He’s the Eeyore of the ocean, the Debbie Downer of the deep. Christopher Anselmo and Jared Corak, the show’s writers and composers, have adapted the script from a best-selling picture book series written by Deborah Diesen and illustrated by Dan Hanna. Now at the New Victory Theater in Manhattan, the production will soon embark on a 28-state national tour. Drawing particularly from the book “The Pout-Pout Fish in the Big-Big Dark,” the plot follows our morose marine hero as he encounters a pearl that Ms. Clam made during her vacation. Unexpectedly beguiled, he thinks he sees a happier self reflected in its surface. But when Pout-Pout goes to view the shiny object again, it floats away. Despite his anxiety, he resolves to follow the pearl and return it to its owner. (You know it’s not going to be easy.) Taking Pout-Pout’s odyssey to the stage required visual punch, and the show’s directors, Matt Acheson and Fergus J Walsh, of AchesonWalsh Studios, have put plenty into the production design. They have created an inventive set — thick strands of fake kelp are draped over rolling clothes racks — and even more imaginative large-scale puppets. (Pout-Pout closely resembles the illustrations of Hanna, who seems to have been inspired by the ocean pout, a perpetually doleful-looking fish species.) But “The Pout-Pout Fish” is more than picturesque. Anselmo and Corak have composed a score with influences including sea chanteys, Latin rhythms and jazz, as well as the upbeat ballad “Stay Afloat,” a tune reminiscent of those on “Sesame Street.” The multitalented Kelly Grago, Leanne Brunn, Emmanuel Elpenord and Mukta Phatak sing the music powerfully, as well as deliver lines, operate the aquatic puppets and occasionally serve as perky narrators. The writers have also furnished a clever script that goes well beyond the simple rhyming adventures of the books. Here, Pout-Pout has to contend with a crafty octopus who has nabbed the pearl and challenges him to — it’s only appropriate — a shell game. As for the misunderstood local shark, he’s just as sad as Pout-Pout: “I wave hi to the folks on shore, I clear the whole beach!” Since this is a show geared toward children under 8, it’s no spoiler to say that all turns out well. What parents may most appreciate, however, is that when Pout-Pout returns, he discovers that his neighbors are far more glad to see him than the shiny bauble he’s rescued. As this happier fish learns, friends are far more precious than a pearl. The Pout-Pout Fish Through Oct. 20 at the New Victory Theater, Manhattan; 646-223-3010, newvictory.org.

2019,‘The Righteous Gemstones’ Season Finale: Danny McBride Testifies,"The creator and star of the HBO comedy talked about the Season 1 finale, struggling with church as a child and an interesting query he received from Kanye West. This interview contains spoilers for the Season 1 finale of “The Righteous Gemstones.” The problem with being a blowhard is there’s usually some kind of blowback. Danny McBride’s characters have a tendency to learn that lesson the hard way, their arcs traversing a kind of warped hero’s journey from cockiness to comeuppance, through chagrin and bodily injury to redemption. (Sort of.) For his character Jesse Gemstone in the HBO comedy “The Righteous Gemstones,” that journey included cocaine, prostitutes, blackmail, multiple attempts at vehicular homicide and, by the end of Sunday’s Season 1 finale, getting shot by his wife — a tough run for any Christian minister. His redemption is still pending. As in his previous HBO series, “Eastbound and Down” and “Vice Principals,” which he cocreated, McBride’s character in “Gemstones” embodies a particular brand of unreconstructed male, less oblivious to his privilege than untroubled by it. In “Gemstones” he follows form, playing the blinged-out heir-apparent in a family of mega-rich Southern megachurch ministers, headed by the cunning and recently widowed patriarch, Eli Gemstone (John Goodman). Near the end of the finale, Jesse’s conniving uncle (Walton Goggins) is struck by lightning and then revived by a stinging bee, in a way that leaves open the possibility of divine intervention. McBride, who with “Gemstones” notched his first credit as a lone creator, said the ambiguity was by design: He was interested in skewering hypocrisy, but not faith per se, even that of the Gemstones. In a phone interview last week, McBride, who was born in Georgia and lives in Charleston, S.C., talked about struggling with church as a child and what he hopes the series can accomplish. (It was renewed for a second season.) He also talked about an interesting query he received from Kanye West. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. That bee in the finale: Was there a reason that you were drawn to that specific image? The idea just came to us that there would maybe be this sign that the family would see, and you don’t really know what that is. When you’re brought up religious, it’s easy sometimes to see things and be like, “That’s the Lord working through that.” But someone who doesn’t agree could just be like, “That’s a [expletive] bee that came in at the wrong time.” So we just tried to keep it vague. The headline of this show is about megachurches, but it feels more than anything like a story about fathers. Did you think of it that way? Yeah, that definitely was at the core. Even the Bible, the New Testament, is just a big story about a father and son, so it felt like that was the right angle to take on this season. In particular, you have Jesse dealing with where he’s failing his youngest son, and how he’s failed his oldest son. Then, you even get that peek back into Jesse’s childhood and how he tries to emulate how his father disciplined them, like smacking people at church lunch. But it just doesn’t have the same effect. Hopefully, if we get a chance to do this show for as long as we want, we’ll get a chance to explore all the different dynamics that arise in a family. Does it feel personal for you in that way? This grappling with the father-son relationship? I think it is for anybody, you know? Once you have a kid, it starts to make you think about everything around you differently, and about how you want to do things, or how things were done when you were a kid. [McBride has a son and a daughter.] I think that’s what was interesting about setting this story with religion. Because in some regards, that is what religion does for a lot of people. It lays out a path: “This should work for you; this should get you what you need.” And the Gemstones, they’re preaching about what people need to do to make it work. But when you see behind the curtain, it’s so obvious that they’re struggling deeply with how to make things work. I’ve read that you grew up going to church but struggled with it once your parents split. When my parents were together, we went to church all the time. And then when they split up, and we tried to stay at that church, people were a little judgmental about my mom getting a divorce. This was in the mid-80s, so it was more of a stigma than it is now. So my mom just kind of stopped going. And then it trickled down to us. She would drop us off at church, me and my sister, and we would go to Sunday school, go to church, and then she would pick us up afterward. After a little while, it just became like: “What are we doing? Why are we going to this place that my mom’s not even comfortable stepping into?” So we just kind of stopped going. Certainly another theme seems to be about how women get shoved constantly into the background. Was there a conscious attempt to engage some of the current discussions about gender equality? Or was it coming more from that personal place? It’s probably a combination. Whenever we’re trying to come up with ideas, I won’t say that we go and look at headlines and try to figure out what is important today. But I think subconsciously it does affect your decisions. We always try, if we can, to stay one step back from exactly what’s happening now because in some regards, you could attach yourself to a story that might not be timeless. But also my own childhood growing up, and being raised by a strong woman, that seemed like a natural fit for Edi Patterson’s character as we were creating her. [Patterson plays Jesse’s sister, Judy.] I’ve heard you were inspired to tackle this subject by your surroundings since moving down to Charleston. When I moved back here, there are so many more churches that it made me think about my own childhood going to church. I really hadn’t thought about church in ages, and yeah, it made me curious about what church is like now. When I started seeing these megachurches, it just felt like the right kind of world to set our story in. Have you gotten any pushback down there personally? I haven’t, really. I’ve got to say, I get messages from people all the time, and they’re like: “I’m a Christian, and I love the show. I think this is hilarious.” I think most people go to church because they do make mistakes, and they’re not perfect human beings. So having that sort of view on the show, in a way, makes it more relatable than if it was something where we’re just railing on believers. To me, that just doesn’t seem interesting. You’ve talked about this show as a critique of hypocrisy. But the finale seems to complete a redemptive arc for Gemstones. Is that what you were going for? They’re not going to stop being hypocrites if they’re still raking in millions, right? They might be moving forward, but at the end of the day, the victory is pretty cheap [laughs]: They got back the money that was stolen from them that they stole from other people. I think ultimately, though, the family suffered this incredible loss and they needed to find a way forward. And they ended up finding that way by relying on each other. I think that’s relatable. Does it redeem a character for what they do? I don’t know. I think there’s a way for characters to be relatable, and you can sympathize with them, but at the same time root for them to get what’s coming to them. We always talk about liking the Sopranos. You don’t need to keep being told that being in the mob is bad. You get it. Judy’s monologue in the finale … I don’t even know how to describe it. How much of that was improv? That was Edi, 100 percent. It was originally a monologue that she wrote for Episode 6, when she was going to kind of have this dark moment where she explained this love story to B.J. [Tim Baltz, who plays Judy’s fiancé], and it didn’t end up working in there. That monologue, when Edi wrote it the first time, just made me die. I was, like, crying when reading it. I always wanted to make sure we captured it on film, so we squeezed it into the finale. We were able just to let the cameras roll, and just let her crush that. You said on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” that Kanye West had approached you about playing him in a movie. Is that happening? I mean, he’s such a busy man, but if he ever found the time or interest in it, I would be interested in doing it. [Laughs.] I think it’s pretty awesome idea.",The New York Times
2019,‘The Sky Is Pink’ Review: A Story Told From the Grave,"A genetic condition steals a child’s life, but before it does, her mother, with grand gestures, ensures her days are packed with happiness. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. In the colorful melodrama “The Sky Is Pink,” a teenager tells the story of her family’s care and sacrifices from an unusual vantage point. Taking a refreshing attitude toward her own mortality, the recently deceased Aisha Chaudhary says, “I’m dead, get over it.” Aisha (Zaira Wasim) provides her lively narration from beyond the grave in flashback form, following her parents, Aditi (Priyanka Chopra Jonas) and Niren (Farhan Akhtar), as they face her long-term illness with humor and tenacity. Though they have a healthy son, they lost their first child to the same genetic illness Aisha inherits, and they are determined her chances will be better. Guided by Aditi, the couple pursues treatments as far away from New Delhi as London. They cannot stop the illness, but they succeed in filling Aisha’s short life with warmth and joy. The writer and director Shonali Bose bounces from tone to tone, livening the somber subject matter with bright hues, quippy dialogue and an ever-jubilant score. She is aided by the broadly appealing performances of her stars, particularly Jonas, whose character grandly strives and sacrifices for her daughter in amusingly high style. Though the story is told from Aisha’s imagined perspective, it is her mother who drives the action, and Jonas accordingly receives the film’s most lavish costumes and close-ups. The fantasy of “The Sky Is Pink” is that Aisha’s death allows her to see her mother with adoring omniscience, and the film is never more pleasing than when it revels in the glamorous melodrama of a superstar performing motherhood.

2019,‘The White Chip’ Review: Day-Drunk and Careening Toward Rock Bottom,"Critic’s pick In Sean Daniels’s grim autobiographical comedy, a charming stage director tries, and tries again, to sober up. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed play or musical through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. It’s the alcohol that almost kills him, but the charisma doesn’t help. Steven, the high-functioning, hard-core alcoholic at the center of Sean Daniels’s harrowing comedy “The White Chip,” is the kind of guy whose abundant scruffy charm allows him to get away with far too much. Well, that and the fact that he’s a stage director, careening his way through a flourishing career, day-drunk on the vodka he mixes into his bottles of Diet Coke in the morning. As long as he keeps delivering the hits, it’s easy enough for his employers to look the other way. And, hey, Steven tells himself, some of the greats of American drama were serious drinkers, too. “You’re an artist,” one of the voices in his head soothes, like a devil on his shoulder. “You’re expected to be eccentric.” Daniels, the artistic director of Arizona Theater Company, knows whereof he speaks. In a fizzily fast-paced production by Sheryl Kaller at 59E59 Theaters, this is an autobiographical play. Dad’s Garage Theater Company in Atlanta, where Daniels spent a decade as artistic director and co-founder, is among the companies that make appearances. “The White Chip” is a tale of a life spinning hideously out of control — of wake-up calls ignored, of seemingly hitting bottom only to discover that there’s lower yet to go. And if you are familiar with addicts’ war stories, you will know that in their broad outlines they’re all the same, each lurching plot twist grimly unsurprising, however shocking the details. Kaller and her excellent cast achieve a delicate equilibrium between laugh-out-loud comedy and gasp-inducing, self-inflicted tragedy. What’s most remarkable, though, is the utter absence of bravado. Steven (Joe Tapper) doesn’t savor the memories of wild times re-enacted. Rather, he shows us the desperation and self-delusion behind his addiction: the scheming and strategizing it takes to disguise how extreme his drinking is. When his father (Genesis Oliver, terrific in multiple roles) gets Parkinson’s disease, Steven uses the pain of his father’s decline as a further excuse to drink, and to distance himself from his parents. But while his father is tenderly drawn, his stalwart mother (Finnerty Steeves) is given a cursing catchphrase that is nowhere near as funny as Daniels means it to be. In an otherwise disciplined script, it’s a grating overindulgence. Steven, who describes himself as “a recovering Mormon,” has no patience with religion. As his life becomes a bonfire of disasters — career, marriage, friendships all in flames — this proves an obstacle to recovery. The play takes its name from the Alcoholics Anonymous sobriety-chip system; each of the many times Steven resolves to stop drinking, he gets a white chip. But he has no religious higher power to which he can surrender, nothing larger than himself in which he can believe. When at last he winds up in rehab, he tells a counselor that he’s “just trying to figure out what happened like a rational smart person.” “Just know that we bury the smart ones all the time,” the counselor says. It’s chilling because it’s true. But this is ultimately a story of recovery, to which Steven finds his way through science, not religion. Which is a happy ending, and a tenuous one, because the temptation to drink never goes away. The White ChipThrough Oct. 26 at 59E59 Theaters, Manhattan; 646-892-7999, 59e59.org.

2019,‘There Could be a War’: Protests Over Elections Roil Bolivia,"Although early vote counts showed close results, President Evo Morales declared himself the outright winner, saying he did not need to face a runoff. President Evo Morales of Bolivia on Wednesday claimed that he won Sunday’s election by a margin wide enough to avoid a runoff, escalating a dispute over a vote marred by allegations of irregularities and by violent clashes. Mr. Morales, who has been in office since 2006, asserted that he would declare a “state of emergency” to fight back against what he characterized as a foreign-backed coup attempt. “I want the world to know that until now we have stood by patiently to avoid violence,” he said during a news conference in La Paz, the seat of the presidency. The outcome of the vote has been in dispute since election officials released preliminary results on Sunday night that pointed to a runoff between Mr. Morales and Carlos Mesa, a former president — only to backtrack within 24 hours. On Monday night, election officials released an updated vote tally showing that Mr. Morales was leading by more than 10 percentage points, the margin required to avoid a runoff. The announcement provoked a wave of huge demonstrations and attacks on election facilities on Monday night. Protesters took to the streets again on Tuesday night in La Paz and other cities. Many chanted “Fraud, fraud, fraud!” Election observers from the Organization of American States, which deployed a large mission to monitor the vote, issued a withering assessment of the integrity on the process on Monday night. The mission said that the trend reversal between Sunday and Monday was at odds with independent tallies of the results and asserted that the outcome warranted a second round. As of Wednesday morning, with nearly 97 percent of the ballots counted, the latest official count showed Mr. Morales with 46.5 percent of the vote, about 9.5 points ahead of Mr. Mesa. Union leaders and activists called for a strike on Wednesday to protest what they regard as Mr. Morales’s attempt to steal the election. The legitimacy of Mr. Morales’s mere candidacy was in dispute well before the vote. The president in 2016 convened a referendum seeking to do away with term limits. Voters narrowly rejected that effort. But a year later, the country’s constitutional court ruled that term limits violated an international human rights treaty from the 1960s, a decision questioned by many experts. As of Wednesday morning, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal had not issued a final comprehensive count of the vote. Concerns about the fairness of the process grew when Antonio Costas, a vice president on the tribunal, resigned in protest over his colleague’s decision to stop issuing periodic vote tally updates on Monday, breaking with what had been the norm in previous elections. A few hours before his resignation was announced, Mr. Costas said in an interview on Tuesday that he had no reason to believe fraud had been committed. The president’s rival, Mr. Mesa, has called for mobilizations across the country, saying he fears that Morales loyalists could be working to rig the vote behind the scenes. “It’s clear there is a gigantic fraud in the works,” said Mr. Mesa. “We will be permanently mobilized, and I will stand with you, until there is recognition that the second round must take place because it is legitimately the vote of the Bolivian people.” Bolivians are bracing for growing violence and unrest as the dispute goes on. Judith Contreras, 57, a currency trader in downtown La Paz, watched Tuesday as security forces barricading a road to the presidential compound held back a group of protesters by lobbing tear gas canisters. “I fear there could be a war,” she said. “They’re going to have to oust him by force.” Ms. Contreras said she voted for Mr. Morales and had high hopes for him when he was first elected in 2005. “The hope was that since he was a humble person, we all felt he would do good things,” she said. But in recent years, Ms. Contreras said, she has come to distrust many of the people Mr. Morales surrounded himself with, seeing them as greedy, corrupt and authoritarian. “We’re essentially stumbling into a democracy,” she said. “They’re not making our votes count, and that is the most painful thing.” Abel Peredo Guerrero, 27, a medical resident who is training to become a surgeon, said many young Bolivians believed that the economy was showing signs of strain — and that Mr. Morales had squandered money on questionable projects, like a new 29-story presidential compound, which he travels to by helicopter. “Most professionals want to leave the country,” Mr. Peredo said, noting that his $580 monthly salary makes it hard to make ends meet. “This country needs a change, and that change will only come with a new government.” He said he had been feeling a mix of hope and fear since Sunday, as critics of Mr. Morales took to the streets in large numbers. “All throughout the country, a spark has been lit for democracy,” he said. But bloodshed, he said seems likely: “The consequences are very serious.”",The New York Times
2019,‘This Creates Fear’: Trump Rally Turns Spotlight on Minnesota’s Somali Community,"After some audience members booed Somalis at President Trump’s rally in Minneapolis, local leaders have tried to assure refugees that they are welcome. MINNEAPOLIS — At a suburban supermarket a few days ago, Warda Abdi, a Somali-American, was approached by a white woman she had never met, who said: “We love you guys. We want you to be here.” A far different message was left on Friday on the voice mail of Mukhtar M. Ibrahim, a journalist in Minnesota who was born in Somalia: “Go back to where you came from,” the caller said, ending the message with a racial slur. It has been nearly a week since President Trump visited Minneapolis for a campaign rally. There, the president boasted to thousands of cheering supporters about curbing the flow of refugees into the country, and labeled Representative Ilhan Omar, a Somali refugee, “a disgrace.” When he described how Somalis had previously come to Minnesota in large numbers, some in the crowd booed. Protesters and supporters who traded angry taunts outside the rally have long since gone home, and the arena has gone back to hosting basketball. Still, the president’s rhetoric about this city’s large Somali-American population has lingered, bringing forth new displays of compassion but also of hostility. “This creates tension, this creates fear, this creates anxiety for many people,” said Mohamud Noor, a Democratic member of the Minnesota House of Representatives who was born in Somalia. The president, Mr. Noor added, had signaled to his supporters that “now it’s O.K. to discriminate against Somalis.” Mr. Trump’s speech in Minneapolis, a liberal stronghold in a politically mixed state, thrust the region’s tens of thousands of Somali residents into an unwanted national spotlight. “For the president of the United States, the most powerful man in the world, to single you out as dangerous hurts,” said Abdisalam Adam, an assistant principal in nearby St. Paul who said he got phone calls on the night of the rally from frustrated fellow Somali-Americans. In the days since, he said, he has urged friends to go out in groups and to report any incidents of harassment to the authorities. Mr. Trump had spoken critically of members of Minnesota’s Somali community before, including on the eve of the 2016 election, when he called them a “disaster.” After narrowly losing the state of Minnesota that year, Mr. Trump has said that he sees an opportunity to flip the state in 2020, and he has suggested that Ms. Omar’s new prominence can help him accomplish that. Jennifer Carnahan, the chairwoman of the Minnesota Republican Party, said she believed that Mr. Trump’s remarks at the rally had been sensationalized and taken out of context. Ms. Carnahan said it was fair game for the president and the crowd to voice their distaste for Ms. Omar, who during her short tenure in Congress has become a hero of the progressive left but has also made remarks that many consider anti-Semitic. “Our party and the people that support the president get a really unfair and bad rap sometimes,” Ms. Carnahan said, adding, “Our party is not against Somalis.” Ms. Carnahan and other Republicans also defended the president’s policy of placing refugees in a city only after consulting with local officials. On Twitter, Paul Gazelka, a Republican state senator, pointed to longstanding tensions over resettlement in St. Cloud, an hour’s drive from Minneapolis, and said “that may be why some booed” at the mention of Somalis. “Trump offered more local control,” Mr. Gazelka wrote. “That is a solution that works.” For his part, Jacob Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis, signed a proclamation on the night of the president’s speech, declaring it “Love Trumps Hate Day.” Mr. Frey said he would gladly take more refugees. “We welcome them,” he said. “In fact, we need them.” Somali refugees began arriving in significant numbers in Minnesota in the early 1990s after fleeing war in their homeland. The community quickly grew, with a steady stream of new arrivals and American-born children. Tensions have emerged over the years, and the Somali community has been targeted at times. In 2017, white supremacists bombed a mosque in suburban Bloomington. A few weeks ago, the Minneapolis police arrested a man on suspicion of vandalizing Somali-owned businesses. Prosecutors filed bias crime charges and said the man had expressed a hatred of Somalis. But mostly, Somali-Americans said this week in a series of interviews, Minnesota has felt like home. At a Roman Catholic church about three miles from where Mr. Trump spoke, a priest took time during Sunday Mass to speak against xenophobia. “Think of the people that are so excluded and put down, like Somalis, Muslims,” the Rev. Jerry Stookey told his parishioners. “But that’s not the way of the Lord. We’re all in this together.” After praying on Sunday at a mosque in Minneapolis, Ms. Abdi said she remained in disbelief at the comments of the president, who she said was “talking like a child” at his rally. But she also recalled how a stranger approached her at the grocery after that rally, offering a hug and words of support. “We are glad that people in Minnesota are better than him,” Ms. Abdi said. Still, some people said they had grown more vigilant and more aware of their surroundings since Mr. Trump’s remarks. Mr. Ibrahim, the editor and executive director of Sahan Journal, a nonprofit publication that covers immigrants and refugees in Minnesota, said he reported the angry voice mail that he received on Friday to the F.B.I. Mr. Ibrahim said he believed that the caller may have targeted him because of an article he wrote after the rally about Somali-Americans pledging to vote against Mr. Trump. He found the call alarming. He added, “I think it’s someone who doesn’t like my presence here and someone who could potentially now carry out the violence if he has the means.”",The New York Times
2019,‘This Did Not Go Well’: Inside PG&E’s Blackout Control Room,"As the utility turned off power to millions of Californians, its website went down and it struggled to communicate with local officials and inform residents. Mill Valley, Calif., last Wednesday. While some areas lost power, others still had light as Pacific Gas & Electric cut power to many Northern California communities to reduce the risk of wildfires.CreditCreditJason Henry for The New York Times SAN FRANCISCO — It was a problem that California had come to dread. Weather models were signaling extreme winds and dry conditions from one end of the state to the other. The risk of wildfires was high. Pacific Gas & Electric, the giant utility whose power lines and transformers have been blamed for a series of disastrous wildfires in recent years, was determined to prevent another one. Just before last weekend, the company informed state officials that it might shut off power to a large area of Northern California, potentially leaving millions of people in the dark — something no United States utility had done in recent memory. It made that news public on Monday. By Tuesday morning, about a hundred utility executives, state officials, meteorologists and others had gathered at an operations center in San Francisco to coordinate the effort. Things quickly began going wrong. PG&E’s communications and computer systems faltered, and its website went down as customers tried to find out whether they would be cut off or spared. As the company struggled to tell people what areas would be affected and when, chaos and confusion unspooled outside. Roads and businesses went dark without warning, nursing homes and other critical services scrambled to find backup power and even government agencies calling the company were put on hold for hours. All told, more than 700,000 homes or businesses — from the state’s northernmost reaches to the outskirts of Silicon Valley — lost electricity beginning early Wednesday morning, and the state’s emergency center usually used for natural disasters was activated. Most residents had power restored by noon on Friday, and just over 12,000 were still without it on Saturday morning. “There were definitely missteps,” said Elizaveta Malashenko, a representative for the state Public Utilities Commission who was in the control center. “It’s pretty much safe in saying, this did not go well.” While California prides itself on its technical prowess and economic might, PG&E had to send crews out into the fields, in a few cases, to manually flip switches to turn off power and then turn it back on, rather than doing it remotely. Residents were left asking why so many people had to lose power and whether rolling blackouts would become routine as climate change makes wildfires more frequent and intense. The company, which is facing $30 billion in liabilities from recent wildfires started by its equipment, has drawn intense scorn from both its customers and state officials. “This current operation is unacceptable,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said Thursday. “The current conditions and circumstances are unacceptable.” Trouble has long dogged PG&E, California’s largest utility and one of the biggest in the country. The company has said one of its transmission lines was probably responsible for the most destructive wildfire in state history, the Camp Fire, which killed more than 80 people and destroyed the town of Paradise last November. About a decade earlier, one of the company’s gas lines south of San Francisco exploded, destroying a neighborhood and killing eight people. This summer, PG&E and its newly appointed chief executive, Bill Johnson, had promised to do better. Blamed for its lax safety practices, the utility submitted a detailed plan to regulators on the protocol it would use to pre-emptively black out parts of its service area to prevent fires. It also promised to step up the trimming of trees along its transmission lines and make other changes. “We did not deliver on this commitment this time,” Mr. Johnson said Thursday evening as hundreds of thousands of his customers sat in the dark. “We were not prepared to manage the operational event.” Catherine Maynes, who handles logistics for Generators Unlimited, which supplies power backup equipment throughout Northern California, said she knew it was going to be a busy week as early as last weekend, when reports of the growing fire hazard started to surface. Monday was a normal day at Generators Unlimited because it was not yet clear when the blackouts would start and who would be affected. It was on Tuesday that everything changed. “First thing in the morning, as we opened the door, the calls started pouring in,” said Ms. Maynes, who works in Brisbane, south of San Francisco. “It never stopped ringing.” While people and companies with means could turn to businesses like Ms. Maynes for backup power, many others did not have that luxury. When they tried to get more information, answers were often not forthcoming. One option was community resource centers, places run by the utility where affected residents were supposed to be able to cool off and charge their phones. But they often got little information or assistance there because PG&E had not adequately staffed the centers, said a senior state official with knowledge of the situation who was not authorized to speak publicly. Meanwhile, state agencies, in charge of services like railways and the water supply, were forced to open the state’s emergency operations center, which is normally used for actual disasters like earthquakes and fires, the official said. The center was running at Level 2, the same level it operated on during the Ridgecrest earthquake over the summer. And the local authorities were forced to bear the cost of additional staffing, including overtime hours for police officers, to deal with the shutdown. This was a big moment for PG&E, which does not have extensive experience using what California officials refer to as a “public safety power shut-off.” Its previous wildfire shut-offs had been limited to tens of thousands of customers — and it was ill prepared for the task. Ms. Malashenko, deputy executive director for safety and enforcement at the California Public Utilities Commission, arrived at 9 a.m. on Tuesday for the first of her two 12-hour shifts at PG&E’s operations center. She said she was stunned by what she saw. PG&E’s website crashed just ahead of the first rounds of power shut-offs that would leave thousands in the dark. In addition, the systems the company uses to alert residents and businesses that they would lose power didn’t work as they were supposed to, Mr. Johnson, the chief executive, later acknowledged. The situation got so bad at one point that Ms. Malashenko called in information technology specialists from the state to help restore PG&E’s systems. (Besides Ms. Malashenko, representatives from the state emergency services and forestry and fire prevention agencies were also at the center to help coordinate the government’s response with the utility and to relay information to state leaders, including Mr. Newsom.) PG&E declined requests for interviews for this article with company officials who were at the emergency center. Communication seemed to improve later on Tuesday before the first round of shut-offs began at 2 a.m. on Wednesday after Ms. Malashenko’s colleagues from the state lent the company a hand. But within four hours after those blackouts began, PG&E’s website crashed again. “It never got to the point where it worked well,” Ms. Malashenko said. At the same time, on Tuesday, the weather forecast was becoming even more dire. PG&E’s team of meteorologists were now identifying 34 counties as under threat from strong winds and dry conditions, up from 30 earlier. Utility executives rely on the meteorology team, along with information from the National Weather Service, to decide what areas will lose power and when conditions are safe enough for crews to restore power. Based on its models, PG&E now anticipated that the winds would reach 40 to 55 miles per hour from Wednesday morning through Thursday morning, with isolated gusts up to 60 to 70 m.p.h. That forecast was off a good bit: Winds reached as high as 77 m.p.h. at Mount St. Helena in Northern California. Wind speeds are important because strong gusts can blow trees into power lines or knock utility equipment into brush, setting off fires. By Thursday evening, as the winds died down, PG&E began dispatching its 44 helicopters and 6,300 employees and contractors to inspect damage and restore power to some areas. While some experts think utilities ought to have better ways to prevent wildfires than cutting off power, the utility industry considers this acceptable in cases of grave weather threats, and other California utilities have used the approach. What was unusual about PG&E’s approach was that other utilities had never targeted as many customers. “Today marks an unprecedented turn in the history of electricity in California,” State Senator Jerry Hill, chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy, Utilities and Communications, said in a letter on Wednesday to the utilities commission. “This situation is not acceptable nor sustainable.” Mr. Hill said PG&E appeared not to have reviewed or learned from the utility that pioneered use of blackouts to prevent wildfires, San Diego Gas & Electric. The San Diego utility was widely criticized when it first used power shut-offs as a wildfire prevention tool in the late 2000s. “Our journey began over a decade ago with the devastating wildfires of 2007,” said Caroline Winn, chief operating officer for SDG&E. “Those fires became a game changer for our company.” Ms. Winn said there was no blueprint that her company could consult when it created its wildfire prevention program. Among the steps it took early on were hiring a large team of meteorologists, including veterans of the National Weather Service; installing devices that measure weather conditions at various locations in its service area; and using technology that allowed the utility to remotely switch off power to designated areas. Even though many fire and energy experts credit the company with being proactive and thoughtful, residents and lawmakers in its service area initially expressed frustration with the utility’s approach. “It was met with fierce opposition,” Ms. Winn said. “Why are you doing it? Nobody else is doing that.” To address those concerns, Ms. Winn said the San Diego utility conducted town hall meetings and adjusted its efforts by, for example, limiting the size of areas that were blacked out. The president of the state utilities commission, Marybel Batjer, said PG&E needed to similarly adapt its approach and learn from its mistakes. “The situation frankly has been unacceptable,” Ms. Batjer said at a commission meeting on Thursday while PG&E was still wrestling with its blackouts. “The impacts to individual communities, to individual people, to the commerce of our state, to the safety of our people, has been less than exemplary. This cannot be the new normal. We can’t accept it as the new normal. And we won’t.”",The New York Times
2019,‘This Is Not Hard’: PG&E Gets an Earful Over Its Blackout,"SAN FRANCISCO — Executives of California’s largest power company received withering criticism from state regulators Friday over a pre-emptive blackout that left millions without power, some for days. The company, Pacific Gas & Electric, was rebuked at an emergency meeting convened by the state’s Public Utilities Commission to examine how decisions were made and carried out in last week’s power shut-off. PG&E acted after weather forecasts pointed to a severe fire risk across much of its territory because of hot, dry conditions and high winds. Its equipment has repeatedly been blamed for deadly wildfires, leaving it facing liability claims that have helped put it into bankruptcy. Whatever the company’s good intentions, the regulators left no doubt on Friday that the execution of the blackout — the largest such operation in the state’s history — was unacceptable. Marybel Batjer, president of the five-member commission, said she was “astonished” at PG&E’s lack of modern technology and services, citing the website crashes and communication system failures that added to last week’s upheaval. “This is not hard,” she told PG&E executives. “You guys have failed on so many levels on pretty simple stuff. You need to get there now. Not at the end of the year. Now.” Bill Johnson, the company’s chief executive, defended the decision to cut off electricity, even as he acknowledged failures in PG&E’s use of the strategy. He told the commission that he looked forward to a future in which the company no longer needed power shut-offs to prevent wildfires, but said it would most likely take a decade to reach that point. “We, I, acknowledge these critical errors,” he said. “I apologize for the hardship.” Many customers lost power without notice. The power shut-offs also forced businesses and schools to close and endangered people with life-threatening health conditions. The hearing, which lasted four and a half hours, provided the fullest look yet at how PG&E came to make the unusually broad move, and who was responsible. Michael Lewis, PG&E’s senior vice president for electrical operations, told the commission that workers in the field had simply carried out his order. “They didn’t make the decision,” Mr. Lewis said. “I did.” But, company officials said, they have been working to correct their failures. They reported an upgrade to the website that repeatedly crashed during the blackout, preventing customers and local governments from getting information. They also said that the utility was stepping up inspections and upgrading its power lines, and that it would ensure that customers had better access to assistance centers in future power shut-offs. Mr. Johnson said alternative ways of delivering electricity needed more consideration to avoid such episodes and to deal with the growing impact of climate change. Microgrids, which generate power for a concentrated area and can be shut on and off independently, are one possibility, he said. “No one ever wants to see anything like that again,” Mr. Johnson said of the power shut-offs. “There is commentary out there that we can’t be trusted to do this. I’m really looking for the best answer here for the public.” Before last week’s shut-offs, PG&E had used the strategy for about 100,000 customers in separate events. “We need to get better at doing it,” said Andrew Vesey, who oversees the company’s utility subsidiary and its operations. “The buck stops with me.” Ms. Batjer said the commission expected PG&E to submit a detailed report about the power shut-offs within the next few days. “I really do believe that we all will be judged by the outcomes, not the plans,” she said. State Senator Jerry Hill, a Bay Area Democrat who has been a frequent critic of PG&E, issued a statement saying the company was “attempting belatedly to rebuild their support services” to protect customers. “It would have been better for PG&E leaders to detail exactly why it’s going to take them 10 years to build the resilient electrical system we should already have, so that power shutdowns are truly a rare, last resort,” he said. PG&E, in bankruptcy since January with tens of billions of dollars in liabilities related to wildfires caused by its equipment, has become known for system failures. These include a gas pipeline explosion that killed eight people and last year’s Camp Fire, which destroyed the town of Paradise and killed 86 people. Gov. Gavin Newsom said this week that PG&E’s use of the power shut-off strategy highlighted how disorganized the utility remained after numerous complaints, court cases and regulatory issues. “The scope and duration of this outage was unacceptable,” Mr. Newsom said. “It was clear from the start that PG&E implemented this extraordinary measure with astounding neglect and lack of preparation.” The governor called on the commission to conduct a comprehensive review of the event, including failures in planning, decision making and execution. And he said he intended to urge Mr. Johnson to give consumers an automatic credit or rebate of $100 for residential customers and $250 for small businesses to compensate them for the blackouts. Mr. Johnson said after Friday’s hearing that the company would consider the request, but that it was concerned about setting a precedent. In addition to its scrutiny of PG&E, the commission has informed the state’s two other investor-owned utilities, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric, to review the orders given to PG&E regarding power shut-offs to ensure that “there is not a repeat of any of last week’s mistakes in any part of the state in the future.” A new look at PG&E’s operations would add to a lengthy list of reviews and investigations past and present. From its fatal safety errors in its electric and gas pipeline business to criminal misdeeds that have led to felony convictions and the utility’s current bankruptcy case, PG&E has been the subject of extensive hand-wringing across California. Mr. Newsom has suggested that serious consideration be given to breaking up PG&E, the state’s largest utility company, which serves 16 million customers through its electricity and natural gas operations. Much of the company’s future rests in the federal courts, which are overseeing its bankruptcy and some of its criminal proceedings, and are reviewing years of the utility’s actions and its finances. PG&E is fighting to emerge from bankruptcy a stronger company but continues to make missteps. Chief among the concerns have been the utility’s wildfire safety program and the handling of victims’ claims after things have gone wrong. Tens of thousands of wildfire victims have until Monday to file claims related to two dozen wildfires caused by PG&E’s equipment, or risk losing out on any potential compensation from the utility. That includes the Camp Fire, the most devastating wildfire in California history, suspected of having been caused by a 100-year-old transmission tower that was a quarter-century past its “useful life” by PG&E’s own standards. Mr. Johnson and his embattled utility argue that improvements are being made, particularly concerning wildfire prevention. PG&E has been carrying out a series of safety measures, modeled after methods pioneered by San Diego Gas & Electric. But some efforts have been stymied by a lack of resources, including a shortage of tree trimmers to clear vegetation around the company’s power lines. And after the troubles with the power shut-off, there were renewed calls from homeowners, regulators and the governor for a fundamental review of PG&E’s operations. Consumer groups like The Utility Reform Network, known as TURN, want the courts to take more control of PG&E’s operations. They argue that the recurring troubles show that despite all of Mr. Johnson’s pronouncements, the utility never seems to make significant changes to run a safe and reliable electric system. “TURN is renewing our call for the judge in PG&E’s criminal case to put the company in receivership, and to ban PG&E from lobbying and making political contributions,” Mark Toney, TURN’s executive director, said in a statement before the Friday hearing. “It has never been clearer that the managers of PG&E are not to be trusted.” An earlier version of this article misstated the timing of Bill Johnson’s arrival at Pacific Gas & Electric. He was hired as chief executive in April, effective May 1; he did not take the job in January.",The New York Times
2019,‘Tread Carefully!’,"wordplay, the crossword column Tracy Gray tries to trip us up. THURSDAY PUZZLE — O.K., I’ll say it: This puzzle is the pits. Just kidding, Tracy Gray. It was a lot of fun, providing you don’t lose your balance and fall in. Also, you solvers might want to have the Acme Co. on speed dial for this one. On second thought, maybe not. 1A: This clue is clever, but it’s no high-wire act. “Acrobat displays” in this puzzle refer to Adobe Acrobat (there’s your veiled capital), and the displays are PDFS. 33A: Interesting clue. “One of two for four” is half (I think), and the answer is SEMI, because I already had the “I” and it was my best guess. 36A: TIL that another word for birds’ bills is NEBS. 1D: A “Sound system?” can be a set of speakers, but in this puzzle, the answer is PHONICS, a method of teaching reading by correlating sounds with letters or groups of letters. 6D: What? I am not sure I have ever heard anyone use O NO as a “cry of horror,” even “quaintly,” but kudos for trying to come up with a fresh clue that doesn’t involve Yoko ONO. 37D: Here we go! I thought I had seen BEER BONG in the puzzle before. In this puzzle, its plural makes its New York Times Crossword debut. Ms. Gray offers us a theme that usually takes more time to explain than it does to figure it out, so please bear with me. Essentially, her puzzle is a study on how dangerous crossword puzzles can be. The grid is booby-trapped, so WATCH YOUR STEP. For solvers who have never seen this type of theme before: The theme entries are going to bend and change direction. Yes, that’s a legitimate thing, and it’s totally fair on a Thursday. Let me throw you some rope. At 18A, the answer to the clue “What margarine has, unlike butter” is NO CHOLESTEROL, which is true, but the entry doesn’t say that, does it? No, the entry as you write it from left to write reads NOCHSTEROL, which makes no sense. At first, I thought this might be a rebus (it is Thursday, after all, the day when rebuses are most likely to appear), but Ms. Gray keeps us off balance. What she wants us to do is fall off each of the four theme entries and into some sort of “hole.” At the H in NO CHOLESTEROL, the entry drops down into a HOLE (which just happens to be 19D), and you have to climb out of it to finish the entry. The rest of the entry, STEROL, is written on the same row as the rest of 18A, like so: As I mentioned above, there are three other traps — a DITCH, PIT and GAP — that all work the same way. The central revealer at 39A reminds us to be careful, but as it only occurs as we are halfway down the DITCH, it’s not much help. Not to worry. I have Icy Hot for anyone who needs it. The email response from the editorial team on this puzzle came as an “Almost Yes!” because of the obscure phrase ALCO(HOLE)NGINE. Except for the fun phrase W(HOLE)TTHEDOGSOUT, which would have required an entire grid redo, I struggled to find another phrase with the letters H-O-L-E spanning two words, and Joel Fagliano agreed that a phrase containing C(HOLE)STEROL would be an acceptable replacement. After a quick revision, my puzzle was accepted on Jan. 22, the same day that John E. Bennett and Jeff Chen had their clever puzzle published with the exact same revealer!

2019,‘Tread Carefully!’,"wordplay, the crossword column Tracy Gray tries to trip us up. THURSDAY PUZZLE — O.K., I’ll say it: This puzzle is the pits. Just kidding, Tracy Gray. It was a lot of fun, providing you don’t lose your balance and fall in. Also, you solvers might want to have the Acme Co. on speed dial for this one. On second thought, maybe not. 1A: This clue is clever, but it’s no high-wire act. “Acrobat displays” in this puzzle refer to Adobe Acrobat (there’s your veiled capital), and the displays are PDFS. 33A: Interesting clue. “One of two for four” is half (I think), and the answer is SEMI, because I already had the “I” and it was my best guess. 36A: TIL that another word for birds’ bills is NEBS. 1D: A “Sound system?” can be a set of speakers, but in this puzzle, the answer is PHONICS, a method of teaching reading by correlating sounds with letters or groups of letters. 6D: What? I am not sure I have ever heard anyone use O NO as a “cry of horror,” even “quaintly,” but kudos for trying to come up with a fresh clue that doesn’t involve Yoko ONO. 37D: Here we go! I thought I had seen BEER BONG in the puzzle before. In this puzzle, its plural makes its New York Times Crossword debut. Ms. Gray offers us a theme that usually takes more time to explain than it does to figure it out, so please bear with me. Essentially, her puzzle is a study on how dangerous crossword puzzles can be. The grid is booby-trapped, so WATCH YOUR STEP. For solvers who have never seen this type of theme before: The theme entries are going to bend and change direction. Yes, that’s a legitimate thing, and it’s totally fair on a Thursday. Let me throw you some rope. At 18A, the answer to the clue “What margarine has, unlike butter” is NO CHOLESTEROL, which is true, but the entry doesn’t say that, does it? No, the entry as you write it from left to write reads NOCHSTEROL, which makes no sense. At first, I thought this might be a rebus (it is Thursday, after all, the day when rebuses are most likely to appear), but Ms. Gray keeps us off balance. What she wants us to do is fall off each of the four theme entries and into some sort of “hole.” At the H in NO CHOLESTEROL, the entry drops down into a HOLE (which just happens to be 19D), and you have to climb out of it to finish the entry. The rest of the entry, STEROL, is written on the same row as the rest of 18A, like so: As I mentioned above, there are three other traps — a DITCH, PIT and GAP — that all work the same way. The central revealer at 39A reminds us to be careful, but as it only occurs as we are halfway down the DITCH, it’s not much help. Not to worry. I have Icy Hot for anyone who needs it. The email response from the editorial team on this puzzle came as an “Almost Yes!” because of the obscure phrase ALCO(HOLE)NGINE. Except for the fun phrase W(HOLE)TTHEDOGSOUT, which would have required an entire grid redo, I struggled to find another phrase with the letters H-O-L-E spanning two words, and Joel Fagliano agreed that a phrase containing C(HOLE)STEROL would be an acceptable replacement.

2019,"‘Vitruvian Man’ Will Be in the Louvre’s Leonardo Show, After All","An Italian court threw out a last-minute appeal to halt the drawing from leaving Italy. Critics fear it is too fragile to travel. ROME — An Italian court ruled on Wednesday that Leonardo’s famous “Vitruvian Man” drawing would be allowed to leave Italy for the much-ballyhooed Leonardo exhibition that opens at the Louvre in Paris on Oct. 24. The drawing, a study of the proportions of the human body that dates to around 1490, will be shown at the Louvre for eight weeks until Dec. 14. The Leonardo exhibition, which commemorates the 500th anniversary of the artist’s death in France, will continue through Feb. 24. The court’s ruling was the latest twist in a drawn out and at times bitter drama that played out over the loan of several Leonardo works from Italian museums to the Louvre. At one point, an Italian deputy minister accused France of trying to culturally appropriate the Italian artist; others raised concerns about the fragility of the works, and about cultural diplomacy trumping scientific merit in deciding the loans. The heritage conservation group Italia Nostra had tried to block the loan, arguing that “Vitruvian Man” was too delicate to leave Italy. The loan, the group argued, violated an Italian law that forbids the loan of any works that form the principal collection of a museum, gallery, archive or library, or any work “susceptible to damage during transportation, or in unfavorable environmental conditions.” In a statement last week, Italia Nostra pointed out that “Vitruvian Man” was one of 16 officially designated works that formed the “principal collection” of the Accademia Galleries in Venice, where the work has been part of the collection since 1822. The curators of the drawing at the Venice museum declined to be interviewed, but in an interview last year, the director of the Accademia Galleries at the time, Paola Marini, said that the curators had not been in favor of the loan. “Vitruvian Man” is rarely lent and is not permanently displayed. On its website, the Accademia Galleries notes that the drawing must be protected from direct light and constantly monitored. Earlier this year, however, the drawing was on show in Venice as part of a Leonardo exhibition. Before that, it was last exhibited in 2013. On Wednesday, an administrative court in Italy’s northern Veneto region wrote that while the drawing was part of the Accademia’s principal collection, other works on that list had been lent in the past. It also noted that technical reports by two of Italy’s most important restoration institutes said that the drawing could travel, as long as it would be shown for a limited number of days and under specific lighting conditions. The drawing was one of several works by Leonardo lent to the Louvre as part of an exchange agreement signed on Sept. 24 by the culture ministers of Italy and France. In its ruling, the Veneto tribunal noted that in return for the loan of “Vitruvian Man” and other works, the Louvre next year will send to Rome two paintings by Raphael, along with several drawings, for an exhibition commemorating the 500th anniversary of Raphael’s death. On Twitter, Italy’s culture minister, Dario Franceschini, said the ruling was vindication that the ministry had acted properly. “Now the great Italo-French cultural operation of the two exhibits on Leonardo in Paris and Raphael in Rome can begin,” he wrote. Italia Nostra was not pleased, saying in a statement, “Today is not a good day for protection in Italy.” The group pledged to fight on, and said that raising the issue of how works of art are lent out was a victory on its own. While the ruling closed one chapter, another opened on Tuesday with a brewing kerfuffle over two other works that have already left Italy for the Louvre’s blockbuster show. Tomaso Montanari, an art historian and member of the scientific committee of the Uffizi Galleries in Florence, raised concerns about the loan of two works in the Uffizi collection to the Louvre: “Study of a Landscape” from 1473, believed to be Leonardo’s earliest known work, and a study for “The Adoration of the Magi,” dated around 1481. Both drawings are on the Uffizi’s list of “immovable works,” so the loan to the Louvre was both “against the law and against good sense,” Mr. Montanari said in a telephone interview. “If something is immovable, you don’t send it to France.” Both drawings were also part of the Sept. 24 exchange agreement signed by the two culture ministers, which Mr. Montanari cited as evidence that Italy’s patrimony was no longer the purview of scientists and technicians, “but in the hands of politicians,” as it had been during the time of Mussolini. “That’s the real issue, scientific knowledge should have priority over politics,” he said. But Eike Schmidt, the director of the Uffizi, said that like all of the drawings in the collection, the two would be shown only once every five years, and that care was taken with travel arrangements and the conditions under which they were displayed. “From a conservation point of view, it made no difference if they are exhibited in Florence, Rome, Venice or Paris,” he said. And Franco Conte, the lawyer for a consumer’s rights group that opposed the Italia Nostra petition during Wednesday’s hearing, said the ruling “recognized the fact that art is something that should be shared.” Otherwise, he added, “It’s like the gold in Fort Knox: beautiful, but no one can see it.”",The New York Times

2019,"‘Watchmen’ Is Coming. (Actually, It Never Left.)","A new adaptation of the graphic novel “Watchmen” is coming to HBO. The original changed superhero tales — and pop culture at large — forever. A man dressed as Rorschach, a character from “Watchmen,” at 2019 New York Comic Con.CreditCreditLandon Nordeman for The New York Times “Watchmen,” a 12-part comic series published in 1986 and 1987, is now universally acclaimed as the greatest superhero comic of all time, but what does that mean, exactly? If I told you that a polka album was considered to be the greatest polka album of all time, it doesn’t tell you much about the music itself or the ways in which it forever altered the course of polka. Now imagine we lived in a world where polka music has come to dominate the Billboard charts, is played exclusively on nearly every streaming channel, generates billions of dollars in profits each year and is produced to the near-exclusion of every other genre of music. Would that change your curiosity about a highly influential, 30-year-old polka classic? The legacy of the original “Watchmen” graphic novel is of renewed interest today thanks to the arrival of a new HBO series of the same name, created by Damon Lindelof. Rather than attempt a straight adaptation — a feat that has proved treacherous if not impossible in the past — Lindelof has described his premise as a contemporary “remix” of the original, akin to the connection of the New Testament to the Old (his analogy, not mine). Having seen the first six episodes, I can report that Lindelof’s series has a complex and uneasy relationship to its source material, just as its source material has a complex and uneasy relationship to the superhero genre as a whole. Yet the “Watchmen” show has tasked itself with the same mission that the graphic novel undertook so successfully 30 years ago: To reinvent a pop mythology that, like it or not, has swallowed the culture whole. Let’s rewind to 1986. If you, like me, spent that decade as a comic-loving teenager you may recall that things were moving pretty quickly. Superhero comics, long considered a popular but critically disregarded juvenile indulgence, were undergoing a stunning artistic renaissance. For most of the century, superhero stories had featured a costumed crusader or team of crusaders battling a villain in similarly fanciful garb, some bam-pow theatrics, and the triumph of good over evil. Superman’s greatest dilemma was keeping his secret identity secret and, on occasion, figuring out how to cut his invulnerable Kryptonian hair. (In one comic, he used a complicated setup of hand mirrors and his own heat vision.) Batman had been cast as more of a brooding loner, but he still existed in the larger popular imagination in the campy incarnation of TV’s Adam West. Storytelling at the two major comic publishers, Marvel and DC, had taken baby steps toward complexity, the pinnacle of which was likely the Dark Phoenix story line from “Uncanny X-Men,” in which one of the heroes obtains unlimited power then sacrifices herself for the greater good. As for other mediums, superheroes were floundering. No one had yet figured out how to put an actual grown adult in head-to-toe spandex and make it look anything but silly. Richard Donner’s 1978 “Superman” movie had been a hit, but largely because it captured the bulletproof purity of America’s flag-clad protector at a time of national insecurity, not because it explored his complexity. On TV, “The Greatest American Hero” premiered in 1981, featuring a hapless high school teacher who stumbles into superpowers via alien intervention. The show lasted for three seasons and won affection from comic-book fans, which speaks less to its quality than to the pent-up appetite for costumed representation onscreen. Hard as it is to believe now, superheroes in pop culture were considered a niche subgenre, and the notion that someone might make a serious-minded TV show or movie about them was, in 1986, a far-fetched fantasy. Then along came “Watchmen.” Written by Alan Moore, illustrated by Dave Gibbons and colored by John Higgins, “Watchmen” didn’t so much improve upon previous superhero comics as it turned them inside out and exposed their gears. In trying to think of a non-comic-book analogy that parallels the comic’s revolutionary impact, the most obvious example I can come up with is — don’t laugh — “Ulysses.” “Watchmen” not only surpassed previous comics books in quality, complexity and ambition, it reimagined what a story about superheroes could aspire to be about. It asked its readers to take superheroes seriously, which both made sense — who takes them more seriously than comic-book readers? — and felt entirely new, given it meant considering heroes as fallible and complex humans, prone to the array of ugly and shameful emotions recognizable from the real world. Previously, we’d been shown that a hero like Superman might feel sad. But we’d rarely been shown that he might feel vengeful, envious or vain. “Watchmen” takes place in 1985 in an alternate American timeline in which the United States won the Vietnam War, Richard Nixon has been president for 17 years and costumed vigilantes have been outlawed, save for a few special government agents. The action centers on a group of now-retired heroes, broken, overweight, and full of regrets. When the story starts, one of these heroes, the Comedian, has been thrown from a high-rise window. His ex-colleague, a violent sociopath named Rorschach, investigates his death, and in doing so uncovers a history of sordid secrets and betrayals including rape, sadism and murder. Through it all, in an atmosphere of classic ’80s paranoia, the Cold War with Russia threatens to unleash Armageddon, the doomsday clock ticks ever closer to midnight and a global catastrophe looms from which no hero in tights can hope to deliver the world. “Watchmen” also arrived during what, in hindsight, was an annus mirabilis for comic books. The year 1986 saw the publication of Art Spiegelman’s “Maus: A Survivor’s Tale,” an allegorical graphic novel about the Holocaust that was later awarded a special-citation Pulitzer Prize, as well as Frank Miller’s series “The Dark Knight Returns,” which imagined an aging Batman in a dystopian Gotham fighting a fascistically inclined Superman. Miller’s vision of Batman as a dark symbol of moral ambiguity birthed every big-screen depiction since, including Christopher Nolan’s trilogy and this year’s box-office-topping “Joker.” In fact, given how much superhero mythology has metastasized in the past 30 years, it’s no stretch to say that 1986 forever altered the course of pop culture writ large. Yet “Watchmen,” for all its laurels, has always had a more muted, or at least less profitable, legacy. Previous efforts to export the comic onto screens have been famously troubled: For years, Terry Gilliam wrestled with a film version that never materialized, and Alan Moore himself once said of the comic, “I tend to think it’s unfilmable.” The director Zack Snyder cashed in the clout he’d earned from “300” to make a “Watchmen” film in 2009, which was criticized both for its excessive fealty to the source material and its inability to capture the ineffable brilliance that made that comic legendary. Yet as we look back from our current, superhero-saturated moment, “Watchmen” stands out as the most influential comic of them all. Its tone and approach has become the de facto language of comic-book narratives. Every costumed-hero tale that takes the motivations and manias of its subjects seriously — and asks us to take them seriously — from “Kick-Ass” to “Avengers: Endgame” to “Joker” to “Arrow” to the Amazon series “The Boys,” owes its existence to “Watchmen.” That comic not only awakened a generation of fans (and future creators) to the grander possibilities of the genre, it provided a template for how to use superhero tropes to tell thorny human stories. “Watchmen” was not bam-pow theater. It radically undermined the foundational premise of superhero comics themselves. It dared to propose that donning a mask or wrapping yourself in the colors of the flag in order to dispense some version of justice is itself a morally problematic, even questionable, act. “Watchmen"" dissected both the characters who did this and the readers — us — who loved them. It challenged, and changed, everything. So it’s funny that we find ourselves 30 years later in a world that’s more besotted by caped crusaders than ever. All those serious-minded movies and shows that once seemed so improbable? They now dominate the culture so thoroughly that they threaten to asphyxiate it. For this we also have “Watchmen” to thank, or to blame. One oft-cited example of how indefatigable comics have become is the success of the “Guardians of the Galaxy” film franchise — a series built around a minor and frankly absurd assemblage of Marvel characters that includes a talking raccoon and a sentient tree. What’s less often noted is that James Gunn, who adapted “Guardians,” was hired by Marvel on the strength of his 2010 indie film, “Super,” a dark and violent comedy about a short-order cook who dons a homemade costume to save his wife from drug dealers. “Super” was not a hit but it paved the way for “Guardians."" And it’s exactly the kind of masks-as-metaphors interrogation of our love for superheroes that could only exist in a post-“Watchmen” world. With HBO’s “Watchmen,” Lindelof, the TV auteur who piloted “Lost” and created “The Leftovers,” has updated the comic’s concerns. Gone are the ’80s-vintage anxieties about mushroom clouds and toxic jingoism, replaced by more contemporary issues like racial reconciliation and shifting identities. The show debuts Sunday, and it’s too early to tell if this “remix” approach will connect; the early episodes feel reminiscent of Noah Hawley’s “Fargo” TV series. They tonally echo the original while creating new story lines and characters from scratch. It’s a tricky recipe that’s likely to either please both “Watchmen” superfans and curious viewers or disappoint them equally for different reasons. What Lindelof’s “Watchmen” does illustrate, though, is the enduring sway of the original. Lindelof is trying to grapple with our monolithic superhero mythology just as the comic book once did. For all its prescience, the “Watchmen” comic could never have envisioned a culture in which the top-grossing entertainment products are nearly all based on comic books, superheroes populate nearly every corner of every screen we watch and pulp villains can plausibly be recast with the gravitas of vintage ’70s cinema. Nevertheless, “Watchmen” made all this possible. It’s not just the inspiration for this new HBO series, it’s the reason that a prestige-TV series that asks us to take people in costumes seriously can exist in the first place. In an interview published not long after “Watchmen"" appeared, Alan Moore was asked about the inherent fascist overtones of superheroes — the link, now much discussed, between Superman and Nietzsche’s Übermensch. He replied that examining fascist politics “wasn’t really our intention. Our intention was to show how superheroes could deform the world just by being there.” By treating superhumans as fully human, as susceptible to a spectrum of flaws and failings, and as the figures around whom, for better and worse, our collective mythology is now constructed, “Watchmen” brilliantly took a hammer to the clay feet of comics’ golden gods. But rather than topple those gods, “Watchmen” ushered in an era in which these golden idols stand taller than ever, astride the entire culture, casting inescapable shadows. We now live in a world deformed by superheroes. It’s both the world that “Watchmen” created and the one that it warned us about. An earlier version of this article misstated how long Richard Nixon was president in the ""Watchmen"" comic book. It was 17 years, not 30.",The New York Times
2019,‘Watchmen’ Opened With the Tulsa Race Riot. Here’s What to Read About It.,"The Tulsa Race Riot of 1921, depicted in Sunday’s series premiere of “Watchmen” on HBO, was one of the worst outbreaks of racial violence in American history. The Tulsa Race Riot of 1921 receives scant mention in most history textbooks and some facts remain hazy — mystery persists about, for example, exactly how many people were killed and where they were buried. But there’s no question that it was one of the worst outbreaks of racial violence in American history: a horrific spree of murder, arson and looting inflicted by white residents upon the prosperous African-American community of Greenwood, followed by a shameless cover-up. The new HBO series “Watchmen,” which debuted Sunday, begins with a depiction of the Tulsa horror and suggests that its aftereffects could be a recurring plot point. In the show’s alternate history, unlike what actually happened, reparations had been paid to the victims and their descendants, and resentment about this lingers among white supremacists. For useful background to all this, here is a collection of eyewitness accounts, official reports and subsequent reporting and commentary on the destruction of the thriving district once known as “Black Wall Street.” ‘Unearthing a Riot’ [The New York Times] A wall of silence surrounded the Tulsa race riot, which was instigated in part by the city itself, reported Brent Staples, by permitting and aiding the looting, arson and murders in Greenwood. The law professor Alfred L. Brophy argued that city officials “made the riot worse” when police deputized hundreds from a lynch mob. The state legislator Don Ross, who had published the exposé “Profile of a Race Riot,” detailing Ku Klux Klan involvement, also found evidence of the mayor and the city commission plotting to “steal black land so that the ‘colored section’ could be pushed farther north,” he said. ‘Oklahoma Was Never Really O.K.’ [New York Magazine] Frank Rich took a hard look at the legacy of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, and wonders about the whitewashing of American history pertaining to the Tulsa race riot, which was “still within recent memory” during its creation. “Or would have been had it not been purged from the record. And I mean literally purged,” he wrote. “The incident was not a part of the Oklahoma public schools’ curriculum until 2000, and only recently entered American-history textbooks.” ‘Timeline: The 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre’ [Tulsa World] Tracking the conditions leading up to, during, and following the 14-hour-period of May 31-June 1, 1921, such as the previous investigation into the corrupt police force and the arrest of a young black teenager for allegedly attacking a white female elevator operator (a case that was later dismissed). As the suspect was held in a courthouse cell, a large crowd gathered outside, leading to armed confrontation and looting. “At dawn, a force of ‘citizens, police and members of the National Guard,’ numbering perhaps 1,500, moved into Greenwood from the south and west, under orders to take into protective custody unarmed blacks and to subdue any who resisted. To people in Greenwood, it looked more like an invading army.” ‘A Long-Lost Manuscript Contains a Searing Eyewitness Account of the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921’ [Smithsonian Magazine] In a 10-page document written in 1931 and found in 2015, an Oklahoma lawyer, Buck Colbert Franklin, bore witness to the riots, including aerial assaults of planes dropping incendiary bombs, contributing to the arson: “Lurid flames roared and belched and licked their forked tongues into the air,” Franklin wrote. “Smoke ascended the sky in thick, black volumes and amid it all, the planes — now a dozen or more in number — still hummed and darted here and there with the agility of natural birds of the air.” ‘Eyewitness to the Desolation of “Black Wall Street”’ [The New York Times] Olivia J. Hooker, one of the last living survivors, remembered the violence that ripped apart her peaceful Greenwood community, when looters broke into her home as she and her siblings hid under the dining table. “I used to scream at night,” she said. “It took me years to get over the shock of seeing people be so horrible to people who had done them no wrong.” ‘The Eruption of Tulsa’ [The Nation] “What is America going to do after such a horrible carnage — one that for sheer brutality and murderous anarchy cannot be surpassed by any of the crimes now being charged to the Bolsheviks in Russia?” journalist and civil rights activist Walter White wrote in 1921. “How much longer will America allow these pogroms to continue unchecked?” ‘A Report by the Oklahoma Commission to Study the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921’ [Oklahoma Historical Society] The Oklahoma Commission report in 2001 detailed damage from the riots and recommends a number of reparations, including direct payment, scholarship funds, economic development, and a memorial, as “a starting place.” “Justice demands closure as it did with Japanese Americans and Holocaust victims of Germany,” wrote the state representative Don Ross, who introduced the bill to the legislature calling for a study of the history of the riot. “It is a moral obligation.” ‘Searching for Graves — and Justice — in Tulsa’ [The New York Times] Estimates for how many died vary partly because not all graves of the riot dead have been found. Brent Staples reported in 1999 on the search for mass graves along the Arkansas River and elsewhere. ‘Coming to Grips With the Unthinkable in Tulsa’ [The New York Times] With no reparations made and the Commission report buried, the survivors filed suit seeking damages, with a legal team including Johnnie Cochran Jr., Willie Gary, and Charles Ogletree. “The arrival of the high-profile legal team sent a shock through sleepy Tulsa,” Brent Staples wrote in 2003. “But the most electric moment came when 88-year-old John Hope Franklin, one of the most important historians of the 20th Century, was found to have joined the suit as a plaintiff.” ‘We lived like we were Wall Street’ [The Washington Post] In 2018, Tulsa’s mayor G.T. Bynum reopened the mass grave investigation, searching three suspected sites: two cemeteries and a former dump identified as possible grave sites, based on accounts from witnesses coming forward. “We owe it to the victims and their family members,” Bynum said. “We will do everything we can to find out what happened in 1921.” The investigation is ongoing. ‘As Survivors Dwindle, Tulsa Confronts Past’ [The New York Times] Commemorating the massacre’s 90th anniversary in 2011, A.G. Sulzberger charted the recognition — and lack thereof — of the massacre. Although small gestures had been made, efforts toward reparations had failed. ‘They was killing black people’ [The Washington Post] All that’s left of the original Greenwood are 14 reconstructed red brick buildings. The rest has been developed into high-end apartments, shopping complexes, and an arts district targeted to Millennials, pushing descendants of the massacre out of the area. ‘Black Wall Street: The African-American Haven That Burned and Then Rose From the Ashes’ [The Ringer] Victor Luckerson examined the hard-won revival of Greenwood as an aspirational symbol of black prominence, even if Hollywood has yet to embrace the historical tale. “Part of the problem is that the story of the massacre, if told accurately, would paint thousands of white people as pillagers and murderers,” Luckerson wrote. “Black historical narratives that make it to the screen tend to incorporate a white savior — think Matthew McConaughey in ‘Armistad’ or Brad Pitt in ’12 Years a Slave.’” John Legend and Oprah Winfrey, however, have had TV shows in development, with varying degrees of success.",The New York Times
2019,‘Watchmen’ Series Premiere Recap: Exhilarating Confusion,"WAtchmen The pilot is a profoundly destabilizing experience for newcomers and fans of the original alike, delivering on ideas and spectacle in equal measure. In the lead-up to “Watchmen,” Damon Lindelof’s “remix,” as he has described it, of the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, the question on many viewers’ minds has been, “Should I read the book?” Judging by the explainers and pocket histories in culture pages across the media — including this excellent one by The Times’s Adam Sternbergh — there’s some agreement that the context is helpful, since the events in that book are fully integrated into the TV show. And yet the pilot for “Watchmen,” which aired Sunday on HBO, stands as a profoundly destabilizing experience for all parties — those with a Talmudic relationship to the book; those who have never experienced it in any form; and those who live in America in 2019, who will recognize parts of their country as reflected off a fun-house mirror. That’s the Damon Lindelof feeling, familiar to anyone who watched his work as a co-creator and showrunner on “Lost” and “The Leftovers,” two puzzle-box shows that sowed confusion and teased out questions they were in no hurry to answer. On balance, it’s probably optimal to have read the comic before seeing “Watchmen,” but only if you’re willing to loosen your grip on it. Lindelof is comfortable playing the heretic. Take the opening sequence alone, which offers a silent movie that seems to exist on its own alternate timeline, before Moore and Gibbons’s masked avengers surfaced in the lead-up to World War II. The black-hat-white-hat dynamic is reversed, with the white hat a cattle-stealing white sheriff on the run from the black hat, a heroic masked stranger who will reveal himself to be Bass Reeves, “the Black Marshal of Oklahoma!” The all-white parishioners demand to know who has roped in the sheriff, but when they call for a lynching, they’re referring to the white sheriff, not the black marshal who has apprehended him. “There will be no mob justice today!” says Reeves. “Trust in the law!” While you’re still busy unpacking the multiple paradoxes of this movie-within-the-show — and perhaps thinking about “The Birth of a Nation” or about how the superhero disguise is the only way a black man could operate like Reeves does — Lindelof and the director Nicole Kassell are recreating the Tulsa race riot of 1921, a two-day massacre in which black residents and businesses were overrun by a violent white mob. With this sequence, “Watchmen” risks the gruesome historical tourism that dogged “Detroit,” a docudrama that devoted more energy to the visceral impact of racial violence than to its significance. That won’t be the case with this show, however Lindelof handles the fistful of dynamite he is intent on carrying around: In the context of his “Watchmen,” which targets racism and white supremacy the way Moore and Gibbons did the Cold War and the nuclear threat, the riot is a foundational event. The exhilarating confusion persists when the episode cuts to the present day, when a white truck driver is pulled over by a black police officer in a yellow mask. (That the driver, a white supremacist, is blasting Future’s hip-hop sensation “Crushed Up” adds still more paradoxical layers.) Everything about this tense encounter raises questions: It reverses the racial dynamic we’re used to seeing between white cops and black drivers. It positions the police as a force against white supremacy. It reveals a gun culture where access to handguns, even by the police, requires a tedious remote protocol. If this is the world that the existence of superheroes have created, then that butterfly must have flapped its wings pretty hard. When the incident ends in a cop’s getting shot up by an assault rifle, the Tulsa police, led by Chief Judd Crawford (Don Johnson), find themselves facing a renewed terrorist threat. The Seventh Kalvary, an organization that parallels those original masked avengers, the Ku Klux Klan, has been waiting in the weeds for a while, but now they’ve resurfaced in homemade Rorschach masks. (Rorschach, the narrator of the graphic novel, operates with a brutal moral certitude that connects with the far right.) Crawford calls on his department to take on the threat, but they have to conceal their identities, too, or risk bloody reprisals on their doorsteps. The cops are both official and clandestine administers of justice, a contradiction that the show has only just begun to explore. One powerful answer to the Seventh Kalvary problem is Detective Angela Abar, a.k.a. Sister Night (Regina King), whose superhero get-up is like a ninja version of the nun costume Zoë Lund wore to shoot up a Halloween party in Abel Ferrara’s “Ms. 45.” Born in Vietnam — which in the “Watchmen” world became the 51st state after the God-like Dr. Manhattan turned the war in America’s favor — Abar has ostensibly retired to run a bakery. But it’s a front for her job on the force and the extracurricular activities that go along with it. Her abduction of a Seventh Kalvary lowlife from a trailer park gives Crawford and the department’s interrogator, Looking Glass (Tim Blake Nelson), the jump on a terrorist enclave at a cattle ranch. The coordinated assault on the cattle ranch, echoing the many real-life showdowns between the government and heavily armed separatists, is a good early example of how this first episode of “Watchmen” delivers on ideas and spectacle in equal measure. It’s a superhero show, after all, and the pitched battle against the Seventh Kalvary counterbalances the Tulsa massacre nicely, suggesting a continuity of racial violence across a century. (It also brings down “Archie,” the owl-eyed ship from the comic, in a blaze of glory.) The final shot ends the episode with more questions: Crawford, hanging from an oak tree, and below him an enfeebled mystery man in a wheelchair (Louis Gossett Jr). In his hand he holds a note, last seen in the episode being carried by a black child who escaped the riot a century before. “Watch Over This Boy,” it reads. What happened to Crawford? Who is this man, who was seen earlier outside Abar’s bakery, asking if she thinks he can lift 200 pounds? What’s the significance of the note, and where has it been? It’s almost enough to make you forget about the biblical rain of squid. Tick Tocks: No superhero origin story more classic than a baby found orphaned in a field. Then again, an all-powerful alien being like Superman doesn’t fit into the world of “Watchmen.” Crawford wants to move the wounded officer to a secure medical facility at the precinct, yet another indication of the dangers faced by the Tulsa police. The show hasn’t begun to suggest how President Robert Redford came to be, though after multiple terms under Richard Nixon, it makes sense that the celebrity-president pendulum would swing left. Unknown is the history of “Redford-ations,” although it’s safe to infer that they’re like reparations, which might account for the racist backlash that followed. The Seventh Kalvary references the regiment that fought under commander George Custer at Little Bighorn, hence the pager code words, Little Bighorn. There are no cell phones in this alternate reality. “American Hero Story” is a clever razzing of the Ryan Murphy-produced limited series “American Crime Story,” which has covered the O.J. Simpson trial and the murder of Gianni Versace. It also seems like an easy pipeline for information on the Minutemen, the dysfunctional superhero group of “Watchmen.” The interrogation pod, with its assault of provocative images, seems like a reference to the classic ’70s political thriller “The Parallax View,” in which Warren Beatty’s reporter tries to infiltrate a covert organization responsible for political assassinations and other extrajudicial activities. The recruitment process involves monitoring his reaction to a series of triggering images and associations. The comics introduced the phenomenon whereby “retired” masked avengers still played a role in meting out justice, after the Keene Act outlawed costumed vigilantes in 1977. While some retired, Dr. Manhattan and the Comedian continued to work with the government while Rorschach ignored the law. Abar reversed the pattern by retiring from the force, then resurfacing as Sister Night. No word yet on what’s happened to the Keene Act 40-plus years later. Jeremy Irons’s role in the story isn’t laid out yet, but his introduction takes full advantage of his district patrician air. Why is he given a horseshoe to cut a cake?

2019,‘Watchmen’: Here’s What to Know From the Comics,"Damon Lindelof’s new HBO series is set roughly 30 years after the original comic book series, but it lives in the same universe. Having a little background helps. Who watches the Watchmen? A lot of people, if HBO has its way. Debuted in 1986 by the writer Alan Moore and the artist Dave Gibbons, the dark and gritty superhero comic “Watchmen” was enormously influential, helping the genre to grow up and get real. For HBO, Damon Lindelof’s new TV adaptation, which premieres on Sunday, is a chance to recreate the runaway success of its last adaptation of a major nerd-culture touchstone: a little show called “Game of Thrones.” The reviews so far are positive, which is more than might be said for the 2009 film. But unlike the movie, this isn’t a straight adaptation: It takes place decades later, when many of the central characters from the original are dead or vanished. The series does, however, exist in the same alternate history, in which Vietnam is the 51st state, Robert Redford is president, and Richard Nixon is on Mount Rushmore. Early episodes are cryptic; it helps to have a little background. Here’s a brief rundown of the most useful things to know before watching. Moore and Gibbons’s Watchmen is a multigenerational saga about a handful of men and women who have donned costumes to fight crime since the late 1930s. These include the wealthy genius Adrian Veidt, known as Ozymandias; the reluctant second-generation heroine Laurie Juspeczyk, a.k.a. Silk Spectre; the inventor Dan Dreiberg, the second crime-fighter to call himself Nite Owl; the government agent and black ops specialist Edward Blake, known as the Comedian; the fanatical street-level vigilante with an inkblot mask, Walter Kovacs, known as Rorschach; and the only true superhero of the bunch, Dr. Jon Osterman, a scientist given godlike powers by an experiment gone awry, which turned him into a cobalt-blue being called Doctor Manhattan. The comic follows several of these characters after the Comedian is murdered, drawing them out of a government-mandated retirement. They uncover a vast conspiracy eventually revealed to be a plot by Ozymandias to engineer a global crisis to end the Cold War. Simply put, he spends a fortune to create an enormous, psychic squid creature, which he warps into the middle of Manhattan as a staged alien invasion. Three million people are killed, and geopolitics realign to fend off future attacks by this faked threat from beyond. The heroes agree to keep the truth hidden in order to preserve the peace — except for Rorschach, whose black-and-white morality leads him to martyr himself: He is killed by Doctor Manhattan for refusing to maintain the hoax. One of the book’s most intriguing premises is the way the presence of these “real-life” superheroes has changed the course of American history. Thanks to the intervention of Dr. Manhattan, for example, America wins the Vietnam War. Dr. Manhattan also has a profound effect on technological advancement, including the creation of economical and accessible airships. It is heavily implied that the Comedian violently suppressed knowledge of the Watergate break-in on President Nixon’s behalf. Add a Constitutional amendment overturning presidential term limits, and Nixon remained president well into the mid-80s, when the original story takes place. The show is set roughly 30 years later; during much of that time, Robert Redford has been president. Vigilantism remains banned except under official government auspices thanks to the Keene Act, a 1977 law named after Senator Joe Keene, whose charismatic son is now challenging Redford for the presidency. And Dr. Manhattan, who despite his near-omniscience was unable to stop Ozymandias’s plot, has fled the planet for Mars, where he has lived alone for decades. Historically and psychically, the TV series roots itself in the 1921 riot in Tulsa, Okla., in which a white mob swarmed the prosperous black part of town, resulting in as many as 300 deaths, with thousands more displaced. In the fictionalized present day, the series pits the Tulsa police force, whose members wear vigilante-style masks to protect their identity, against a militant white supremacist group called the Seventh Kalvary, which has adopted Rorschach’s lethal methods and black-and-white mask. Moore and Gibbons’s meticulously crafted political thriller and murder mystery is reflected by its inventive structure. Each page is based on a strict, rhythmic layout based on a nine-panel grid, with slight fluctuations for timing and emphasis. The issue that reveals the origin of Rorschach is laid out symmetrically — like a Rorschach blot. The craftsmanship of the comic is, in turn, reflected in the narrative. In his detached state, Dr. Manhattan is able to see the workings of the universe as a clockwork mechanism in which every event is predestined. Can free will exist in such a universe? If not, do the actions of the heroes and vigilantes really make a difference, or are they all little windup toys, marching on to their metaphysically predetermined end? And what of vigilantism? Despite being positioned as the heroes of the story, with anti-vigilante forces portrayed as villainous and corrupt, the story’s costumed crime-fighters are a brutal, dysfunctional bunch whose actions are often amoral and always unconstitutional. The show picks up this element of the story and runs with it, hard. Arriving around the same time as Art Spiegelman’s influential comic about the Holocaust, “Maus”; Frank Miller’s dystopian Batman story “The Dark Knight Returns”; and a high point for Gilbert and Jaime Hernandez’s slice-of-life series, “Love and Rockets,” “Watchmen” helped spearhead the movement to see comics recognized as a legitimate art form. In 1987, the series was bound into a single-volume graphic novel that has been immensely popular ever since: Generations of comics writers and cartoonists have emulated its tone and, to a lesser extent, its formal daring and clockwork craftsmanship. In a way, “Watchmen” was a victim of its own success. Moore and Gibbons signed contracts with DC Comics in which the rights to the book and its characters would revert to them once the book was out of print for a year. Because of the book’s megahit status, DC has simply never allowed it to go out of print. This led to a falling-out between Moore and the publisher, and Moore won’t let his name be used in conjunction with any of his story’s many spinoff projects. Gibbons has been more accepting. He is a consultant on the show.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | ‘Watership Down’ and the Crisis of Liberalism,"A classic novel (yes, the one about rabbits) has a political teaching for today. Opinion Columnist When a newspaper columnist wants to write about a novel, the rule is that you’re supposed to have a “hook,” an excuse, a timely reason to bring up the book in question. Maybe an anniversary-of-publication, maybe an authorial death, maybe a Nobel Prize. I have none of those for this column, but I think my hook is better: I’m writing about “Watership Down” because I’m reading Richard Adams’s 1972 novel to my daughters, and in that reading I’ve decided that the book has real relevance to the crisis of the liberal order in the Western world. Comes the reply: You mean the book about the … rabbits? Yes, I do, and that frequency of that reply is another reason for this column. Adams’s novel was a huge best seller in its day, it’s been the basis for an animated movie and a recent Netflix mini-series, and it’s obviously well-regarded and much-loved. But I find that many educated people who pride themselves on being cultural completists (whether that means the whole of Shakespeare or the entirety of Harry Potter) haven’t read the book, and indeed have a mild allergy to the idea: Perhaps because they assume it’s just too childish, too Beatrix Potter or Brambly Hedge, or perhaps because they’ve seen a snatch of one of the adaptations and can’t quite take seriously rabbits arguing with one another in actorly English accents. To these doubters I offer varying suggestions. The anthropologically inclined can approach the book as a portrait of a lost hominid subspecies, complete with its own mythology and linguistic tics, and gradually accustom themselves to the references to hind legs, ears and burrows. The religious can just approach it as an extended parable. The ecologically minded can come for the very English style of environmentalism, the lyrical depiction of the natural world, the evocation of nature’s harsh harmonies and the dissonant cruelty of humankind. But really the reader should just come for an exercise in epic storytelling — Odyssean adventure and Aeneidan dramaturgy — that exceeds most modern imitations of the classics. One of the virtues of reading a narrative aloud, to children or indeed to anyone, is the way that vocalizing a story clarifies its power, especially in the quavering passion that you try to keep from your voice (because you don’t want your kids to think their dear dad is too emotional) but that bleeds through in spite of everything. And with a hundred pages to go I can already tell that when I get to the climax of “Watership Down,” I’m going to be a wreck. So what about the political relevance, you ask? Well — and the spoilers begin here — essentially Adams’s novel offers a portrait of a political founding, the establishment of a new homeland by a band of rabbit adventurers who escape from a doomed warren when one of their number, a mystic named Fiver, has a vision of its destruction at the hands of developers. But that founding doesn’t happen in a vacuum; instead the band of rabbits engage with two very different warrens, two alternative models of political order, on their path to making a new order of their own. The first warren, where they briefly try to settle, appears at first to be idyllic. The rabbits are sleek and well-fed, they have plenty of space (the burrows are oddly underpopulated), the lands around are completely clear of predators (“elil” in Adams’s rabbit tongue, Lapine), and best of all the local farmer just tosses leftover produce in the fields. But soon it becomes clear that this warren has shed all the rabbit-y virtues, cunning and daring and courage and mischief, in favor of odd imitations of human culture — attempted sculptures, existentialist poetry. Its denizens are bored or irritated by tales of adventure and heroism; they cultivate a condescending skepticism about El-ahrairah, the rabbit trickster-prince of legend; they seem comfortable and smug and yet subtly depressed. And then comes the revelation: Both the absence of predators and the presence of food is the work of the local farmer, who protects the rabbits from normal harms while trapping and killing a consistent percentage for their pelts and meat — a dark bargain the warren has learned to live with by building a sophisticated system of denial, a culture of pleasure and of death. This warren is an appealing-seeming snare from which the book’s questing heroes ultimately slip free. The next alternative, Efrafa, is a totalitarian prison house: Instead of surrendering an essential rabbitness for the sake of ease and safety, Efrafa’s dictator, the terrifying and omnicompetent General Woundwort, deals with the enmity of men and predators by running a police state, one that keeps its rabbits underground and regimented, trains the strongest bucks to fight and rule and dominate, denies any agency to the warren’s females, and refuses diplomacy and cooperation with fellow rabbits as much as with any other creature. The rabbit heroes first approach Efrafa seeking to recruit does, to enable their fledgling warren to survive; by the end of the book, they’re engaged in a death struggle with Woundwort that requires all their own political virtues to survive. Those virtues are distributed among different rabbits: Along with Fiver’s prophet, there is the statesman-leader Hazel; the soldier-fighter Bigwig; the thinker-inventor Blackberry; the storyteller Dandelion; and more. And what makes the regime the rabbits are founding good — and successful, but first and foremost good — is the integration of the different virtues, the cooperation of their different embodiments, their willing subordination to one another as circumstances require. The military hero, Bigwig, could have been a Woundwort in a different dispensation; instead he willingly bends to the statesman, Hazel, who lacks his strength and fearlessness but exceeds him in foresight and guile. Hazel in turn defers to Fiver’s gift of prophecy, his religious genius, which is why the band escapes disaster in the first place (their original warren’s leader is a talented statesman, but fatally dismissive of the religious and mystical) and why it ultimately succeeds in founding and sustaining a new regime. Meanwhile, the other virtues — invention, lore keeping, even comedy — play supporting roles as needed, and nobody claims the wrong sort of authority. (The keenest intellect, for instance, neither aspires to nor is vested with the greatest power; note well, meritocrats.) Out of this collaboration a regime emerges that is rebuke to both the grim alternatives, with a mixture of hierarchy and liberty that works with the grain of rabbitness instead of seeking a corrupt comfort or an impossible level of security. [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] The spoilers are over; now let’s return to the late-modern liberal world, and consider our own discontents in the light of the contrast that Adams draws between his newly founded warren and its rivals. Somewhere near the root of those discontents is a fear that the kind of balanced and virtuous society — simultaneously mystical and practical, orderly and free — that the rabbits build in “Watership Down” has slipped somehow from our grasp, or else was always just a myth. In which case we are left to choose between its darker rivals, between a comfortable decadence in which virtue erodes and the reaper beckons, or else some variant on Efrafa’s totalitarian alternative. Which option you choose depends on which destination you fear most. One anxiety in the Western world right now, palpable on both the right and the left, is that the plush, end-of-rabbit-history warren is liberalism’s dystopian destination: a sleek and fattened inhumanity, a terrible mix of comfort and cruelty, a loss of basic human goods under the pressure of capitalism or secularism or both. The other anxiety, dominant in the embattled liberal center, is that the people who want more than what modernity is currently delivering — whether they’re socialists or populists or integralists or something else entirely — are in various ways really just interested in building up Efrafa: either a literal police state with strongmen and zealously guarded borders and tight control of reproduction, a Gilead or Fortress Europe, or else a police state of the imagination, with ideological commissars ever on patrol. But there is a way out of both anxieties, toward the hope of something more human and humane than these two fearful destinations. No reader of “Watership Down,” and few readers of the literary and political traditions on which its narrative depends, would accept that totalitarianism and decadence exhaust the available political alternatives. Indeed the novel is compelling precisely because its new-founded warren, its good regime, is remarkable yet also homely, its founders heroic and also ordinary, with nothing utopian or superhuman or impossible about them. The ultimate political teaching of Adams’s deeply political epic, then, is an unfashionable optimism about the ends of politics — in which the genuinely good society, the well-ordered regime, is not a utopia but a live possibility, a hard thing to find but one worth going out to seek.

2019,‘We Absolutely Could Not Do That’: When Seeking Foreign Help Was Out of the Question,"White House Memo WASHINGTON — One day in October 1992, four Republican congressmen showed up in the Oval Office with an audacious recommendation. President George Bush was losing his re-election race, and they told him the only way to win was to hammer his challenger Bill Clinton’s patriotism for protesting the Vietnam War while in London and visiting Moscow as a young man. Mr. Bush was largely on board with that approach. But what came next crossed the line, as far as he and his team were concerned. “They wanted us to contact the Russians or the British to seek information on Bill Clinton’s trip to Moscow,” James A. Baker III, Mr. Bush’s White House chief of staff, wrote in a memo later that day. “I said we absolutely could not do that.” President Trump insists he and his attorney general did nothing wrong by seeking damaging information about his domestic opponents from Ukraine, Australia, Italy and Britain or by publicly calling on China to investigate his most prominent Democratic challenger. But for every other White House in the modern era, Republican and Democratic, the idea of enlisting help from foreign powers for political advantage was seen as unwise and politically dangerous, if not unprincipled. A survey of 10 former White House chiefs of staff under Presidents Ronald Reagan, Bush, Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama found that none recalled any circumstance under which the White House had solicited or accepted political help from other countries, and all said they would have considered the very idea out of bounds. “I served three presidents in the White House and don’t remember even hearing any speculation to consider asking for such action,” said Andrew H. Card Jr., who ran the younger Mr. Bush’s White House and was the longest-serving chief of staff in the last six decades. William M. Daley, who served as commerce secretary under Mr. Clinton and chief of staff under Mr. Obama, said if someone had even proposed such an action, he probably would “recommend the person be escorted out of” the White House, then fired and reported to ethics officials. Other chiefs were just as definitive. “Did not happen on Reagan’s watch. Would not have happened on Reagan’s watch,” said Kenneth M. Duberstein, his last chief of staff. “I would have shut him down,” said Leon E. Panetta, who served as Mr. Clinton’s chief of staff and Mr. Obama’s defense secretary. When Republican congressmen suggested Mr. Bush reach out to Russia or Britain for information that could help him win his re-election race against Bill Clinton, James A. Baker III, then the White House chief of staff, wrote this memo. (PDF, 1 page, 4.8 MB) The sense of incredulity among White House veterans in recent days crossed party and ideological lines. “This is unprecedented,” said Samuel K. Skinner, who preceded Mr. Baker as chief of staff under Mr. Bush. Other chiefs who said they never encountered such a situation included Thomas F. McLarty III and John D. Podesta (Clinton) and Rahm Emanuel, Denis R. McDonough and Jacob J. Lew (Obama). History has shown that foreign affairs can be treacherous for presidents, even just the suspicion of mixing politics with the national interest. As a candidate in 1968, Richard M. Nixon sought to forestall a Vietnam peace deal by President Lyndon B. Johnson just before the election. Associates of Mr. Reagan were accused of trying to delay the release of hostages by Iran when he was a candidate in 1980 for fear that it would aid President Jimmy Carter, but a bipartisan House investigation concluded that there was no merit to the charge. Mr. Clinton faced months of investigation over 1996 campaign contributions from Chinese interests tied to the Beijing government. In none of those cases did an incumbent president personally apply pressure to foreign powers to damage political opponents. Mr. Trump pressed Ukraine’s president this summer to investigate involvement with Democrats in 2016 and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. while holding up $391 million in American aid. Mr. Trump has said he was simply investigating corruption, not trying to benefit himself. “The right way to look at it is the vice president was selling our country out,” Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, said in an interview on Sunday. Mr. Trump was fulfilling his duty, he said. “I don’t see what the president did wrong.” Mr. Giuliani has been leading Mr. Trump’s efforts to dig up evidence of corruption by the Democrats in Ukraine, meeting with various officials and negotiating a commitment by the newly installed government in Kiev to investigate conspiracy theories about Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 election and supposed conflicts of interest by Mr. Biden. Told that past White House chiefs of staff said any legitimate allegations should be handled by the Justice Department, not the president, Mr. Giuliani said: “That’s if you can trust the Justice Department. My witnesses don’t trust the Justice Department, and they don’t trust the F.B.I.” He added that he would not have either until Attorney General William P. Barr took over. Mr. Barr has contacted foreign officials for help in investigating the origin of the special counsel investigation by Robert S. Mueller III into Russian interference and ties with Mr. Trump’s campaign, part of an effort to prove that the whole matter was a “hoax,” as the president has insisted. Mr. Trump defends himself by saying that other presidents have leaned on foreign governments for help. That is true, but when other presidents have pressured counterparts and even held up American assistance to coerce cooperation, it has generally been to achieve certain policy goals — not to advance the president’s personal or political agenda. As an example, Mr. Trump often cites Mr. Obama, who was overheard telling President Dmitri Medvedev of Russia in 2012 that he would have more “more flexibility” to negotiate missile defense after the fall election. While that may be objectionable, it is not the same thing as asking a foreign government to intervene in an American election. “They assume everybody’s as sleazy and dirty as they are, which is not the case,” Mr. Emanuel said. Mr. Trump points to Mr. Biden, arguing that the former vice president was the one who abused his power by threatening to withhold $1 billion in American aid to Ukraine unless it fired its prosecutor general. Mr. Biden’s son Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, earning $50,000 a month. The company’s oligarch owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, had been a subject of cases overseen by the prosecutor, and so Mr. Trump contends that Mr. Biden sought the prosecutor’s ouster to benefit his son. As a matter of appearances, at least, the former vice president’s family left him open to suspicion. Even some of his defenders say it was unseemly for Hunter Biden to seemingly trade on his family name. The elder Mr. Biden has said he never discussed his son’s business dealings in Ukraine with him, but some Democrats suggest he should have if only to prevent just such a situation from arising. For all of that, however, no evidence has emerged that Mr. Biden moved to push out the prosecutor to benefit his son. No memo or text message has become public linking the two. None of the American officials who were involved at the time have come forward alleging any connection. No whistle-blower has filed a complaint. In pressing for the prosecutor’s ouster, Mr. Biden was carrying out Mr. Obama’s policy as developed by his national security team and coordinated with European allies and the International Monetary Fund, all of which considered the Ukrainian prosecutor to be deliberately overlooking corruption. Indeed, at the time Mr. Biden acted, there was no public evidence that the prosecutor’s office was actively pursuing investigations of Burisma, although Mr. Zlochevsky’s allies say the prosecutor continued to use the threat of prosecution to try to solicit bribes from the oligarch and his team. The 1992 episode involving Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker provides an intriguing case study in the way previous administrations have viewed seeking political help overseas. At the time, Mr. Bush was trailing in the polls and eager for any weapon to turn things around. Representatives Robert K. Dornan, Duncan Hunter and Duke Cunningham of California and Sam Johnson of Texas urged the president to ask Russia and Britain for help. Mr. Dornan, reached last week, said Mr. Baker offered no objections during the meeting. “Baker sat there in the Oval Office like a bump on a log,” he recalled. “He said nothing.” If Mr. Baker advised Mr. Bush not to reach out to foreign governments, then he did so after the congressmen had left, Mr. Dornan said. Mr. Dornan said that was a mistake and that Mr. Bush should have done as Mr. Trump has. “The bottom line from me was, ‘If you don’t do this, Mr. President, leader of the free world, you will lose,’” Mr. Dornan said. “And he didn’t do it and he lost. Baker cost Bush that second term.” As it was, Mr. Baker and some of his aides got in trouble anyway because State Department employees searched Mr. Clinton’s passport file to determine whether he had ever tried to renounce his American citizenship. They found no such evidence, but an independent counsel was appointed to investigate whether the search violated any laws. The attorney general who requested the investigation? Mr. Barr, in his first tour running the Justice Department. The independent counsel who was appointed? Joseph diGenova, a lawyer now helping Mr. Giuliani look for information in Ukraine. In the passport case, Mr. diGenova concluded that no laws had been broken and that he should never have been appointed in first place. As for seeking help from Russia and Britain, Mr. Baker declined to comment last week, but his peers said he did exactly as they would have. “It would have been ludicrous at that stage to do anything,” Mr. Skinner said. “Baker’s decision was obviously the right one.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘We Looked to Escape Death’: Violence Uproots Nearly 500,000 in Burkina Faso","Aid groups and the government of the West African nation have been at a loss to respond to a fast-moving emergency, set off by lawlessness and suspected terrorist attacks in a once-tranquil country. KOMSILGA COMMUNE, Burkina Faso — A wave of violent attacks and suspected terrorist activity in Burkina Faso has triggered a sudden humanitarian crisis, uprooting hundreds of thousands of people from their homes in what was once one of West Africa’s most tranquil nations. In the space of just three weeks, the number of internally displaced people in Burkina Faso has increased by almost 70 percent to nearly half a million people, in a nation of 20 million, according to the United Nations refugee agency. About one-third of the country’s territory has become engulfed in fighting between armed groups, making the area inaccessible to aid workers, UNICEF officials said. “The attackers came into our village, they killed my husband and they left. They claimed nothing and left us with orphans,” said Mariam Birba, 32, who arrived earlier this month at a roadside camp for internally displaced people, about 12 miles south of the capital, Ouagadougou. Ms. Birba and four other residents from the village of Pissélé, less than 100 miles north of the capital, said that on the evening of Sept. 21, about 40 men wielding Kalashnikov rifles and riding motorbikes came screeching to a halt and opened fire, killing eight people. Survivors said that they didn’t know who the attackers were or where they came from, but the attackers warned the villagers that they had 48 hours to leave their homes or face more violence. Such attacks have turned life upside down in Burkina Faso, which until recently had a reputation for its calm, its bustling art scene and its music culture, a contrast to neighboring countries like Mali and Niger, which have been rocked by terrorism and violence in recent years. The crisis has overwhelmed the local authorities and international aid workers in the small, landlocked nation, where even in more peaceful times, 45 percent of the population lived on less than $1.25 per day. In response to the emergency, only one-third of the requested $187 million in international aid has been fulfilled, according to the United Nations. “We looked to escape death. There was no time to take anything. We just left like that,” said Kirakoya Adjaratou, 28, another resident of Pissélé, who broke into tears as she recounted the death of the eight men in her village. While terrorist groups like the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara and Ansaroul Islam are active in the north of Burkina Faso, much of the violence carried out in the country has gone unclaimed. Experts say that personal disputes, ethnic tensions or intercommunal conflicts are often behind the attacks — and not terrorist activity. “Many of the attacks in Burkina Faso are rarely claimed by terrorist groups. We are, therefore, entitled to ask ourselves who officially is behind terrorist acts,” said Jacob Yarabatioula, a researcher specializing in terrorism at the University of Ouagadougou. “Attacks tend to be linked to community conflicts or settling scores.” Several military outposts in the northern Sahel region have been abandoned after being attacked by armed men, according to two government officials and an international security adviser, who were unwilling to be identified because of sensitivities related to the deteriorating security situation. Capt. Aziz Ouedraogo, a spokesman for the armed forces in Burkina Faso, declined to comment on reports of military outposts being abandoned. The violence has been moving south, from the border with Mali, toward the city of Kaya, which is about 60 miles northeast of the capital. Most embassies in the country now advise their citizens not to leave the capital. Meanwhile, life in Ouagadougou goes on seamlessly — Muslims attend evening prayers, Christians go to church on Sundays and the city’s young people sip on cold Brakina beers at popular restaurants late into the night. But that sense of normality is slowing being eroded by a foreboding feeling of crisis edging toward the capital. People here vividly remember the attack in August 2017 on the Aziz Istanbul restaurant in Ouagadougou, which killed 19 people, including nine foreigners. In 2016, a terrorist attack targeted a hotel and restaurant in the capital, killing 30 people. Between Aug. 6 and Sept. 30 of this year, at least 26 military personnel from Burkina Faso’s armed forces were killed and 25 were injured in attacks, according to figures compiled by international organizations working in the country. On Friday, at least 15 people were killed when gunmen attacked a mosque in Oudalan Province, close to the border with Mali, a local security official confirmed, speaking on the condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak publicly. The attack took place in the north of the country, where an Islamist insurgency led by armed groups with links to Islamic State and Al Qaeda are present. Ioli Kimyaci, the head of the United Nation’s refugee agency in Burkina Faso, said in an interview that in addition to the nearly half a million internally displaced people, another 16,000 have asked for asylum in neighboring countries since 2018. Some 12,000 of them went to Mali. “Everything is saturated. The absorption capacity of the host communities has reached its limit,” she said. The United Nations is now looking to open new camps in Burkina Faso because of overcrowding at sites in the north, around the city of Dori. Tents designed for a family of seven are sometimes being used by up to 50 people, Ms. Kimyaci said. “It’s true that the situation has overwhelmed us,” said Emilie Fernandes, the director for Save the Children in Burkina Faso.",The New York Times
2019,‘We Were Wiped Out’: New Yorkers Preyed on Chicago Cabbies,"In the fall of 2006, Chicago held an auction to sell taxi medallions, the permits that let people own and operate cabs. Hundreds of bids poured in, including some offering to pay much more than expected. The city raised millions of dollars. Officials declared the sale a success. But there was something strange about the auction: None of the winning bidders lived in Chicago. Almost all of them lived hundreds of miles away, in New York. Over the next decade, New York taxi industry leaders — fleet owners, brokers and financiers — steadily seized control of Chicago’s medallion market and squeezed it for huge profits. Using tactics honed in New York, they made millions of dollars, but they ultimately helped to leave the industry in tatters and the lives of immigrant drivers on the edge of ruin. New Yorkers used a similar playbook in several cities across the United States: They inflated medallion prices, provided high-risk loans to buyers and collected interest and fees before the bubbles burst and the markets collapsed. Medallion prices rose sevenfold in some places, soaring to $700,000 in Boston, $550,000 in Philadelphia, $400,000 in Miami and $250,000 in San Francisco. But the most ambitious expansion targeted Chicago, home of the nation’s second-largest cab industry, a New York Times investigation found. New Yorkers eventually bought almost half the city’s medallions, records show. Some adopted an especially aggressive approach, according to documents and interviews. First, they purchased medallions at bargain rates and established big fleets of cabs. Then, they pumped up medallion prices. Finally, they sold their medallions to their drivers and to rival fleet operators just before the collapse. The incursion created extraordinary wealth for a small number of New Yorkers. One New Yorker’s network of companies bought $30 million worth of Chicago medallions and later sold them for $185 million. He purchased eight homes, including a house in one of the most elite neighborhoods in the Hamptons, records show. Another who made millions in both cities opened a polo club near his 10-acre estate in New Jersey. “They used us to get rich,” said Demetrios Manolitsis, 52, a Chicago cabdriver from Greece. Mr. Manolitsis, who started driving in 1992 and owned an extra medallion as an investment, said New Yorkers in Chicago convinced him to borrow money to buy 15 more medallions at the height of the bubble, when prices were skyrocketing and the asset seemed invincible. He is now buried in debt and on the brink of losing everything. “They came in, they juiced up the medallion, a superficial value. We took out their loans, and we were wiped out,” Mr. Manolitsis said. The average price of a Chicago medallion rose to nearly $400,000 before prices began plummeting in 2013. They had been selling for less than $50,000 in 2006, records show. As New Yorkers transformed the medallion market, and prices increased, hundreds of locals joined the rush. More than 770 Illinois residents bought at least one medallion in that time period, according to an analysis of city records by The Times. Many were immigrant cabdrivers who could not speak English fluently and signed loans they could not afford, lured by the promise of easy wealth and a secure future. Since the bubble burst, more than 200 of them have filed for bankruptcy, as have many others who bought medallions earlier and refinanced their original loans while prices were inflated, The Times found. Today, a Chicago taxi medallion is worth $30,000, or less, and many owners have given up. Forty percent of the city’s cabs are currently not in operation. Unlike in New York, where regulations and the density of the city core have partially shielded yellow cabs from the effects of competition from ride-hailing companies, the taxi industries in Chicago and other cities have been devastated by Uber and Lyft. But industry veterans said the reckless practices would have led to a crisis regardless. “In retrospect, it should’ve set off alarm bells,” Michael Negron, who was a policy adviser to former Mayor Rahm Emanuel, said of the New Yorkers entering Chicago. “Outside investors were coming in to upend the industry, and everybody kind of missed it.” The Times reported earlier this year that some New York taxi industry leaders used similar methods over more than a decade to make massive profits in that city. Government officials worsened the problems by exempting lenders from regulations and running advertisements promoting medallions as “better than the stock market.” New York medallion prices climbed above $1 million before the bubble burst in late 2014, setting off an industrywide crisis. In response to The Times’s previous reporting on New York, federal prosecutors in Manhattan and the state attorney general’s office have launched investigations. The city has arrested a notorious debt collector, waived $10 million in fees owed by medallion owners and strengthened regulations. A task force is now discussing additional remedies. To untangle the Chicago story, The Times interviewed more than 150 taxi industry veterans; examined thousands of corporate filings to identify the buyer in every medallion sale since 2001; created a database of more than 100 medallion loans; and hired a technology company to analyze court records to determine who has filed for bankruptcy. The New Yorkers who went to Chicago, and elsewhere, said in interviews that they followed every city’s rules and were never accused of breaking any laws. They said that as New York medallion prices rose, it made sense to pursue new opportunities. “It is customary for people involved in a successful business to look for logical places to grow the business,” said Bernard Block, a Chicago lawyer who helped New York taxi leaders come to his city. “This was really a very logical and normal progression.” Some of the industry leaders defended their practices everywhere, including in New York. They said no one inflated medallion prices or issued risky loans. They said medallion buyers understood what they were doing and benefited from rising prices for years. They argued the taxi industry crashed only because of ride-hailing. Others said they expanded outside New York to escape reckless practices there. Several noted Chicago medallion prices never came close to New York prices, which they said proved there was no wrongdoing in Chicago. Michael Levine, the New Yorker whose companies made at least $155 million from medallion sales in Chicago, said he bought medallions there because New York prices became grossly inflated. He said he profited because he made the smart decision to buy low and sell high. “It was a good business opportunity,” he said. “That’s all.” The migration to Chicago began, in part, with a chance meeting in Russia. In August 2001, Symon Garber, a New York fleet owner originally from Ukraine, was on vacation in Moscow when a friend introduced him to Patrick Daley, the son of then-Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley. The men talked about rugby, family and, according to the younger Mr. Daley, the taxi trade. The former mayor’s son said in an interview with The Times that he told Mr. Garber the little he knew of the Chicago market. Mr. Garber seemed intrigued, he added. Mr. Garber, who declined to talk to The Times, has acknowledged befriending Mr. Daley. “Patrick is an excellent guy. Great drinker, knows how to hold his liquor,” he once told the Chicago Sun-Times. At the time, the Chicago industry was dominated by a few operators who made money through fares, not financial maneuvers. Two fleets — run by members of the same family — controlled most of the medallions, and the permits were worth so little that the city periodically gave them away to drivers. There was a private market for those who could not wait for a city giveaway, but it was sleepy. Still, within months of meeting Mr. Daley, records show Mr. Garber opened an office on the South Side of Chicago and started a fleet, Chicago Carriage Cab. He and a group of partners, mostly from New York, began buying medallions in private sales and lending to other buyers. They eventually bought about 800 of the city’s 7,000 taxi medallions. Mr. Garber drew attention by publicly vowing to improve the experience of riding in a taxi and also by hiring powerful allies, including Gery Chico, the onetime chief of staff to Mr. Daley, the former mayor. The Sun-Times declared Mr. Garber “Chicago’s cab king.” More quietly, Mr. Garber and his partners also began driving up medallion prices, according to five people who worked with Chicago Carriage Cab and an analysis of transaction records by The Times. After buying hundreds of medallions from 2002 to 2005, the partners began the price inflation at the fall 2006 auction, The Times found. Mr. Garber and his partners won 20 of the 50 medallions at the auction because they offered to pay about $80,000 per permit, even though the median price on the private market that month was $51,000, records show. By paying higher prices for a few medallions, they effectively raised the value of the many medallions they had already bought. Then, according to the former employees, they used the increased valuations to convince banks to lend them money. After the auction, Mr. Garber and his partners expanded the strategy, records show. In one instance, Mary Frances Wilkens, who was married to a lawyer whose firm represented Mr. Garber’s company, bought a medallion at the 2006 auction and sold it a few years later to a friend of Mr. Garber for $375,000, even though the median price that month was $300,000, records show. In another case, a company whose registered agent was Alexander Igolnikov, a Chicago Carriage co-owner, sold multiple medallions to a business partner for $150,000 each, even though the median price that month was $129,000. In all, individuals associated with Chicago Carriage and Mr. Garber sold more than 100 medallions to other individuals associated with the company and him between 2006 and 2013, records show. The majority of sales were between one co-owner of the company and another; some sales were among members of Mr. Garber’s family. There are legitimate reasons for friends and co-workers to sell assets to each other, especially if prices are rising and some want to cash out. But the transactions usually increased medallion values, even though the cabs hardly ever moved from their spots in the fleet. “They knew there was no more money coming out of it. They just wanted the price to go up,” said Khaled Mahmoud, who managed medallions for several New Yorkers and worked with Chicago Carriage. “They knew exactly what they were doing.” Six financial experts said in interviews the sales suggested an attempt to manipulate the medallion market. They said in a small market, a few transactions can have a big impact. “It’s definitely suspicious,” said John M. Griffin, a finance professor at the University of Texas at Austin. “It’s indicative of manipulative wash-trading to artificially inflate prices.” Ms. Wilkens, who also worked as a manager at the American Library Association and was convicted in 2013 of embezzling money from that group, did not respond to requests for comment. Mr. Igolnikov, who was convicted in 2015 in a scheme to use wrecked vehicles as cabs, declined to comment. The rise in medallion values made millions for Mr. Garber and his partners, records show. In 2009, Mr. Garber formed the International Polo Club of Colts Neck near his 10-acre estate in New Jersey. The next year, he purchased a condominium in a lavish building on Warren Street in TriBeCa for $8 million. Mr. Garber did not respond to repeated requests for comment, including a detailed letter outlining this article’s findings. As prices kept rising, other New Yorkers clamored to buy, pushing prices even higher. Evgeny Freidman, a large New York fleet owner who has admitted to overpaying for medallions in New York to inflate their value, and Medallion Financial, a Manhattan company that lent to medallion buyers, each purchased more than 150 Chicago permits with partners, according to transaction records and financial disclosures. At least 40 other New Yorkers bought Chicago taxi medallions, including Michael Cohen, President Trump's former lawyer, records show. “Medallions were gobbled up in almost a feeding frenzy,” said Roger Bottalla, who, along with his family, led a longstanding Chicago fleet that sold medallions to New Yorkers. “It became a house of cards. In my opinion, the whole industry became a speculative bubble.” Many of the New Yorkers who changed the Chicago taxi industry were not medallion buyers. They were the lenders who provided the money. Before 2005, lending for taxi medallions in Chicago was not a big business. The cabdrivers and fleet operators who bought medallions outside of city giveaways often paid in cash, according to interviews and a review of buyer disclosures filed with the city in 2003 and 2004. As prices rose, lenders flocked to Chicago. Three credit unions that had long provided loans to most New York medallion buyers all came, along with new players in the industry, including Actors Federal Credit Union from New York. So did bigger institutions such as Capital One. Medallion Financial, the Manhattan company, expanded its presence in Chicago. By 2010, virtually every Chicago taxi medallion purchase was financed by a New York lender, according to the buyer disclosures. Some of the credit unions and banks executed the same strategy they used to boost profits in New York, according to former staffers and a review of more than 100 Chicago medallion loans: They started lending more money to low-income cabdrivers, who were less likely to be able to repay the loan but more likely to pay high fees and interest rates, sometimes indefinitely. “It was all about lending out as much money as possible, to increase the loan portfolios and bring in as much interest and fees as possible,” said Furqan Mohammed, a Chicago lawyer who has worked for both lenders and borrowers. “I think some of them didn’t really care whether the loan was repaid, frankly.” Many cabdrivers were eager to borrow because they said they had been treated poorly by fleet bosses and that buying a medallion would give them control over their hours and an asset they could sell for a retirement nest egg. Bague Atade Nanguit, 55, who immigrated to Chicago from Togo in the early 2000s, said he was making about $20,000 a year as a cabdriver when he bought a medallion in 2013. He said a broker convinced him to make the purchase by showing him data on medallion values in New York — which then exceeded $1 million — and suggesting Chicago would follow suit. Once values rose, the broker said, making loan payments would be easy. Signature Bank and the broker lent Mr. Nanguit almost $400,000 without requiring a significant down payment, records show. But he said he had to pay thousands in fees and accept an 8 percent interest rate on one of his loans, which was above the typical bank loan rate, about 5 percent. He said he fell behind on his payments and gave up his medallion in the hope of escaping his loans. He now drives for Uber. In an interview, Eric Howell, executive vice president of corporate and business development at Signature Bank, pointed to documents showing the bank lent Mr. Nanguit only $265,000 at a 5.5 percent interest rate. His other loan was handled by the broker without the bank’s knowledge, he said. Mr. Howell said Signature Bank modified Mr. Nanguit’s loan after the bubble burst to reduce his payments, as it has for many medallion owners. He added the bank lent mostly to big fleet owners in Chicago, and he disputed the notion that the taxi industry crisis was caused by lending practices. “It is well documented that the unregulated entry of Uber in Chicago, supported by Mayor Emanuel, was the principal cause of the medallion crisis in that city,” he said. The broker worked for Mr. Levine, who declined to comment on this loan. Every Chicago medallion loan reviewed by The Times had a balloon clause that required borrowers to repay everything in a few years, or face interest rates as high as 24 percent. That mandate almost always forced borrowers to extend the deals over and over, often at rates higher than the original terms, and with additional fees. As in New York, many loans included other unusual provisions, such as penalties for repaying too early and so-called confessions of judgment, documents in which borrowers admitted to defaulting — even before taking out any money at all — and authorized the bank to do whatever it wanted to collect. Veterans of the Chicago taxi industry said some New York lenders also aggressively encouraged medallion owners to refinance loans. Whenever values rose, some of the lenders called and urged borrowers to take out more money to buy a house or to put children through college, the industry veterans said. John Henry Assabill, a 67-year-old immigrant from Ghana, said he won a free medallion for being one of Chicago’s best cabdrivers in 2004. After, he said, he got calls pushing him to use it as collateral to borrow money. Eventually, records show, he borrowed from Progressive Credit Union and Signature Bank to buy more medallions and more equipment. He said he was ultimately talked into borrowing $675,000 and could not make the payments. In 2017, he went bankrupt. Signature said it never encouraged any borrowers to refinance loans. Progressive has since been closed by the government; its longtime chief executive did not respond to requests for comment. Chicago requires medallion buyers to have a lawyer. But city officials acknowledge that the lawyer often also represents the seller, lender or broker, and regulators do not have the ability to ensure that buyers’ interests are protected. In a striking resemblance to the housing market bubble, the loose lending practices in the Chicago taxi industry helped cause medallion prices to rise rapidly. Increasingly, drivers who bought medallions spent much of their income on loan payments. A 2009 University of Illinois study found that after paying expenses like gas and car insurance, Chicago medallion owner-drivers typically made about $2,200 in monthly revenue and spent about $1,500 of it on loan payments. About 90 percent of Chicago’s owner-drivers were first-generation immigrants, and many did not speak English at home, according to surveys conducted by the city. Among those trapped was Manuel Rosales. Mr. Rosales came to Chicago from Guatemala in 1992, started driving a cab several years later and chose to buy a medallion for $305,000 in 2014. He said he sold his family’s home and emptied his savings for down payments on loans, mostly from Montauk Credit Union in New York. He said he drove up to 14 hours every day and cut expenses but still struggled to make his $1,700 monthly payments. It got even harder after Uber arrived. Eventually, he filed for bankruptcy in an attempt to renegotiate his debt. Montauk Credit Union has since been closed by the government. The loan is held by another credit union, which declined to comment. “You feel like a failure,” Mr. Rosales, 45, said in an interview. “Like you’ve lost everything and you have nothing.” The drastic increase in taxi medallion prices did not escape public notice in Chicago. George Lutfallah, publisher of the Chicago Dispatcher, a trade publication, repeatedly criticized inflated prices, including in articles in 2006, 2010 and 2012. “Before you jump on the speculative bandwagon that has medallion prices going through the roof in the near future, take a step back and ask yourself what the price of a medallion should be,” Mr. Lutfallah wrote in his 2006 piece. “Why are prices going up?” City officials also noticed the rising prices. But they did not criticize them. They celebrated. Under Mr. Daley, the former mayor, the officials who regulated the Chicago taxi industry were focused on raising revenue through medallion sales, according to four former city employees. Officials sent memos praising the price increases, some of those employees said. Since 2000, records show, the city has made more than $70 million by auctioning medallions and collecting taxes on private sales. The city made medallion buyers disclose detailed information on their loans. If regulators had reviewed the data, they would have seen the rising interest rates and shrinking down payments and could have written new rules. But officials acknowledged to The Times that they never looked at the disclosures. The Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection, the city agency that oversees the industry, said it could not find any record of the city taking disciplinary action against a medallion lender or broker related to medallion transactions. “This is an industry where everything is regulated down to the smallest little thing on the car,” said Meg Lewis, of Afscme Council 31, a union that began representing Chicago cabdrivers after the bubble burst. “Yet the city allowed medallion prices to become artificially inflated and turned a real blind eye to what the implications were for small medallion owners.” The current commissioner of the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection, Rosa Escareno, who has been there since 2017, said in an interview it was the job of federal banking regulators, not the city, to police lending. A spokesman added later that the city never received any complaints about medallion lenders or brokers. After being informed of The Times’s findings, the city released an additional statement: “While this activity seems concerning, the City of Chicago does not regulate lending practices in the private marketplace, set medallion transfer prices or restrict medallion sales based on the location of the purchaser,” the statement said. “Thousands of medallions changed hands during the years in question, and outside investors were not unusual or illegal.” Mr. Daley, the mayor during most of the bubble, did not respond to requests for comment. Norma Reyes, the city’s top taxi industry regulator from 2003 to 2011, died several years ago. Her successor, Rosemary Krimbel, acknowledged she was pressured by City Hall to focus on making money off medallions. But she also said she believed that city regulators and medallion lenders had acted appropriately. “The borrowers signed the loans,” she said. “It’s kind of ‘buyer beware.’” In the gritty New York cab industry, Michael Levine was one of the most respected players. His grandfather began one of the city’s first fleets, and industry lore held that his father consulted for “Taxi,” the sitcom made popular in the late 1970s. Mr. Levine inherited the family business in the 1990s, and he quickly became president of a fleet association and a frequently quoted spokesman for the industry. “He was as interesting and legitimate of a person as you could get,” said Andrew Salkin, a former deputy commissioner of the New York City agency that regulates the taxicab industry. “I always thought he was above the riffraff.” During the first four decades of his life, Mr. Levine has said, he visited Chicago only once. But in 2005, after hearing about an opportunity from a friend, he made a play that changed the Chicago taxi industry. Mr. Levine bought a controlling stake in Yellow Cab Chicago, the bigger of the two fleets that had historically dominated the market, and then expanded it. In all, he purchased more than 500 medallions, a fleet that operated hundreds of cabs for other owners and a company that provided loans to medallion owners. To help run the empire, he eventually hired Ms. Reyes, Chicago’s former top taxi regulator. The move set up two New Yorkers — Mr. Levine and Mr. Garber — as the biggest leaders in the Chicago taxi industry. But with the Yellow Cab brand, Mr. Levine was the most prominent. “He bought half the industry and made one giant conglomerate,” said Michael Magallanez, who ran one of Mr. Levine’s garages from 2011 to 2013. “He was the most powerful person in the business.” Behind the scenes, Mr. Levine and his business partner, Patton Corrigan, a Florida investor, helped push the Chicago taxi industry toward practices that increased medallion values, according to a review of loans from their lending company and interviews with dozens of industry veterans. The company, Transit Funding Associates, issued at least 750 loans to medallion owners, according to a filing in a legal case. It had agreements that allowed it to use funding from Capital One and Signature Bank for the loans. Transit Funding was widely seen as one of the most aggressive lenders in the city, according to the industry veterans. It rarely required borrowers to post large down payments, always used balloon clauses and often structured loans so that most of the monthly payments paid by its borrowers would go just toward interest, The Times’s review of loans found. Two people who worked at Transit Funding during the bubble said they could not recall any loan applicant being denied. They added the company had extremely loose lending standards and charged interest rates they described as exorbitant. “Transit Funding was the worst,” said Cometas Dilanjian, who worked at Yellow Cab before Mr. Levine and then formed his own company catering to owner-drivers, including some who got loans from Transit Funding. Under the lender’s standards, he said, “the walking dead were getting loans.” In interviews, Mr. Levine, 56, acknowledged lenders in New York and Chicago were caught in a medallion bubble that he likened to the housing market crash. But he said he never intentionally inflated medallion prices, engaged in price speculation or issued reckless loans. Mr. Levine and Mr. Corrigan owned dozens of interrelated businesses. From one entity alone, they each made about $100,000 a month in “management fees,” according to legal filings. But the increase in medallion values offered much greater profits. As prices rose, Mr. Levine consistently promoted medallions publicly, even after ride-hailing entered Chicago in 2012. In one interview with the Chicago Dispatcher, in 2013, he predicted Uber would not affect medallion values at all. But even as Mr. Levine was promoting medallions, he was cashing out. Records show that before the market collapsed in late 2013 and 2014, Mr. Levine’s companies sold most of the Chicago medallions they had bought a few years earlier. The companies paid $30 million to buy 543 medallions between 2006 and 2008. They sold 529 medallions between 2012 and 2014, for a total of $185 million. Mr. Levine said in interviews that he did not have any inside information indicating the market was about to crash before he sold medallions. One of his former top employees in Chicago, John Moberg, said he had advised Mr. Levine to sell after meeting Ms. Krimbel, then a new city commissioner, and determining she would not be an ally of the industry. Mr. Levine was not the only major Chicago medallion owner to sell at elevated prices. Medallion Financial also sold some permits it owned in 2008 and 2009, reaping big profits, although it has held onto most of its medallions, according to city transaction records. Transit Funding issued loans to many of the buyers of Mr. Levine’s medallions. In many cases, it did not require any down payment, records show. It also sold some loans to Capital One and Signature, leaving the banks partially on the hook for the losses that followed. In 2015, Capital One sued Mr. Levine and Mr. Corrigan, claiming they owed the bank millions that they had borrowed in order to provide loans to medallion buyers. The bank said the men had tried to dodge creditors by transferring assets to family members. The parties reached a private settlement last summer. Between 2009 and 2013, records show, Mr. Levine and his wife, Marjorie, bought at least eight different homes, including a $5.3 million house on Lily Pond Lane in East Hampton, N.Y., and a $7.2 million co-op on Central Park South previously owned by the family of the founder of DC Comics. Mr. Levine said he did not see a conflict in his lending company providing loans to drivers, which in turn helped him sell off medallions. When asked if he would respond to criticisms from his borrowers, he ended the conversation. “I don’t really respond to things,” Mr. Levine said. “I tell the truth.” The Chicago taxi industry is now in the biggest financial crisis in its history. Only about 4,300 of the city’s 7,000 cabs are currently in operation, according to the city, and the ones on the road are generating at least 20 percent less than before there was ride-hailing, according to an analysis of city data by The Times. Mr. Lutfallah is closing the Chicago Dispatcher and looking for a new job. Many fleets are drowning in medallion debt. One association of owner-drivers recently laid off nearly half its staff. “We’re just trying to hold on,” said the association’s owner, Shoib Hasan, an immigrant from Pakistan who has been in the business for 40 years. Even some New York bankers and investors who bought Chicago taxi medallions have suffered large losses. Many drivers who bought medallions have had them seized by their banks after falling behind on loan payments. Some now drive for Uber or Lyft. Collins Badu, 35, an immigrant from Ghana, said he had been driving for Yellow Cab’s fleet for four years when his manager approached and asked if he wanted to become his own boss. He ultimately bought one of Mr. Levine’s medallions in August 2012, using his life savings and borrowing from family for fees and taxes on $330,000 in loans, in part from Transit Funding. Mr. Badu, who lives in a small apartment in Rogers Park, said he drove his taxi 12 hours a day but still could never earn enough for his payments. Last year, he surrendered his medallion, hoping to escape, and he became a fleet driver again. But he still owes his medallion lenders about $300,000. He is terrified he will get a notice saying they are suing him, and he will end up on the street. Every day, he nervously checks his mailbox, hoping not to see any letters from New York.

2019,‘We Will Be Stuck With One of Them’: Canadians on Their Upcoming Election,"After a contentious, scandal-filled campaign for prime minister, many voters say they feel disillusioned. Canadians will head to the polls on Monday to elect their next government ending a contentious campaign that has been heavy on personalities and opposition attacks, and light on issues and policy. Justin Trudeau, the sitting prime minister and leader of the Liberal Party, and Andrew Scheer, the leader of the Conservative Party, have been polling neck and neck throughout the campaign, despite weathering scandals involving blackface and citizenship. The New Democratic Party and the Greens, smaller left-wing parties gaining in popularity, could end up as kingmakers should one of the two major parties win a minority government. [It’s Election Day in Canada. Here’s what you need to know.] In a recent edition of Canada Letter, Ian Austen, our Canada correspondent, reported on polling data showing that voters are feeling “discouraged in the extreme.” He asked readers if they were feeling disillusioned with the campaign and whether they intended to vote. Below are highlights from the more than 200 responses we received. They have been condensed and edited for clarity. I agree the campaign was disappointing. I did not see the leadership that is required at this stage in Canada’s evolution. Where are the meaningful policies on how to help the prairie economies succeed in a green future? Where is a factual debate on Canada’s need for increased immigration, the associated social issues and a creative, unifying solution? Where are our leaders? — Ben Ferrel, Victoria, British Columbia What I wanted to hear more of from every candidate is: “I am going to take money from ‘here’ and put it ‘here.’” All their positions have been vague and undirected. — Belva London, Winnipeg, Manitoba It is unfortunate that in a country of over 37 million people, the candidates we have for prime minister are all less than qualified to do the job. Justin Trudeau, who has been in the position for the last four years, receives a less-than-passing grade from me. The others in waiting do not appear to have the qualifications needed. They all make promises that we know they cannot keep, and that is what they are running on. They do not want to address the issues facing our nation. I guess I must resign myself to the fact that we will be stuck with one of them. — Albert Baker, Castlegar, British Columbia When an election campaign focuses more on which party leader is the least ethical, you know you are in for an uninspiring campaign. When a campaign focuses on which side can fling the most sticky mud, it really takes away from any examination of which party’s vision is best for the country. When the focus of the campaign is to demonstrate that the opposing party is filled with prevaricators, racists, misogynists or homophobes, it really makes me wonder what any of the parties actually stand for. It is very much like none of the parties is speaking to me anymore. — Ian Geddes, Toronto This campaign has been disgraceful. A lot juveniles who have not matured beyond the argument of “whatever their opponent plans to do is wrong!” Leave me to judge what your opponents propose. Use what time you have to persuade me to give you my vote. Tell me what you propose to do for my benefit and for the country’s benefit. — David French, Ajax, Ontario I have definitely not been inspired by the election campaign, but I also have not been discouraged by it. I have been appalled by the quality and the style of the discourse that has taken on a very divisive, derisive and exaggerated tone, not unlike what we have come to expect from President Trump’s America. — Carol Jessop, Montreal This was my first opportunity to vote in federal elections in Canada, as I became a Canadian in July 2016. I voted early, and I voted Green. I know that by doing this I have thrown away my opportunity to influence the outcome of this election. But I didn’t do the strategic analysis this time. In this country I will vote for what I believe, and let the chips fall where they may. — Joy Hecht, St. John’s, Newfoundland I’m a 25-year-old woman who identifies as a first-generation Canadian, and I’m openly left-leaning on the political spectrum. Although I wouldn’t say that I’m discouraged by this year’s election, I find myself conflicted as to which party with left-wing political ideologies I should cast my vote for. In light of the scandals that have plagued the Liberal Party over the past couple of months, I have grown slightly apathetic to its credibility as a so-called progressive party. However, I do want to vote strategically to keep the Conservatives from winning leadership. Based on recent polling results and projections, at this point, I recognize that voting Liberal would possibly be the more strategic option in this rat race of an election that we have on our hands. — Izabela Molendowski, Toronto I am 60 years old, and for the first time in my adult life, I will not vote for the Conservatives. They have become infiltrated by climate change deniers. For me, climate change is the only issue. Although the Liberals’ policy response to the issue is not strong enough, it will have to do. A vote for the Greens would be my preference, but a vote for the Greens is a wasted vote, as it is effectively a vote for the Conservatives. So I will vote Liberal. — Jim Roberts, Kincardine, Ontario As Johnny Cash once sang, “cleanest dirty shirt.” That about sums up my feelings regarding this election. But that aside, I read in the news about countries where people are killed while trying to cast their ballot. I am not happy with my preferred party leader or the entire electoral campaign, but I will vote. We have that right and that freedom. — Loretta Hauser, Brandon, Manitoba In past elections, things happened that have changed whom I decided to vote for, but not this time around. Does that make this campaign uninspiring? Perhaps, but Canada now has scheduled elections and news channels and the internet, so politics is always in the air and I think the actual campaign is less important than in decades past. But I don’t need to be inspired to vote. What I don’t understand is people who don’t vote. So yes, I will vote: It is the only opportunity citizens have to impact the path of the country. And yes, I will remind everyone that people fought and died so we could keep that opportunity. — David Wright, Kitchener, Ontario",The New York Times
2019,‘We’re Not Fooling Around’: House Democrats Vow to Subpoena White House,"President Trump angrily struck back at Democrats in sometimes profane terms, calling them “dishonest” and “corrupt” as they pursue impeachment. WASHINGTON — House Democrats moved on Wednesday to compel the White House to cooperate in their impeachment inquiry, announcing plans to issue a subpoena by Friday if it did not comply with requests for documents related to President Trump’s efforts to press Ukraine to investigate a leading political rival, and any attempt to conceal his actions. Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the chairman of the Oversight and Reform Committee, notified his panel of the impending subpoena on Wednesday. He said the White House had thus far ignored voluntary requests he submitted with the House Intelligence and Foreign Affairs Committees. “I do not take this step lightly,” Mr. Cummings wrote. “Over the past several weeks, the committees tried several times to obtain voluntary compliance with our requests for documents, but the White House has refused to engage with — or even respond to — the committees.” The subpoena threat was the latest sign that the House was pushing ahead quickly with an aggressive investigation that has taken shape in just over two weeks, after revelations about attempts by Mr. Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats. The allegations, detailed in a whistle-blower complaint, have escalated into an impeachment inquiry that threatens Mr. Trump’s presidency and is plainly enraging him. On Wednesday, the president lashed out at Democrats online and before television cameras, denouncing leading lawmakers as “dishonest people” who were trying to overturn an election they lost in 2016. He distorted not just the facts of the case, but the investigative steps they had taken. And in a bizarre late-afternoon scene, Democrats found their expectations almost comically dashed by a briefing with the State Department’s internal watchdog that they had expected to contain new revelations that could build their case about Mr. Trump. Steven A. Linick, the department’s inspector general, had made a mysterious, last-minute request to deliver documents related to Ukraine to Capitol Hill, setting off a frenzied round of speculation of yet another bombshell from inside the administration. Instead, House Democrats were left fuming after Mr. Linick handed over a packet of news clippings, timelines and interview notes that appeared to have been shared with the State Department by Mr. Giuliani, most related to the unsubstantiated corruption accusations about Mr. Biden and his son that were at the heart of the president’s pressure campaign. Still, the impeachment inquiry is intensifying. Mr. Cummings’s warning suggested that lawmakers and their staffs were working sequentially to collect the evidence they believe they need to corroborate the anonymous C.I.A. whistle-blower complaint that touched off the inquiry. First, they targeted the State Department, then Mr. Giuliani and now the White House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, warned the administration that any attempt to stonewall the House’s request or intimidate witnesses would be construed as obstruction worthy of impeachment itself. “We’re not fooling around here,” Mr. Schiff said. “We don’t want this to drag on months and months and months, which would be the administration’s strategy. So they just need to know even as they try to undermine our ability to find the facts around the president’s effort to coerce a foreign leader to create dirt that he can use against a political opponent, that they will be strengthening the case on obstruction.” Mr. Trump, watching on television from the White House, responded on Twitter: “The Do Nothing Democrats should be focused on building up our Country, not wasting everyone’s time and energy on BULLSHIT, which is what they have been doing ever since I got overwhelmingly elected in 2016, 223-306.” Then, in a red-faced harangue in the Oval Office with a visibly uncomfortable president of Finland sitting next to him, Mr. Trump declared Democrats “guilty as hell” of corrupting the 2016 election, Mr. Biden “corrupt” and “less smart now than he ever was,” and the C.I.A. whistle-blower “a spy in my opinion.” He saved his sharpest barbs for Mr. Schiff, who has taken the lead in the investigations. Mr. Trump called him “a lowlife” and “shifty, dishonest guy.” Referring to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the president said Mr. Schiff “couldn’t carry his ‘blank’ strap,” using the word “blank” instead of “jock” for the locker-room insult. At a second appearance with the visiting President Sauli Niinisto of Finland not much later, Mr. Trump became increasingly angry while responding to questions about the impeachment investigation. He went after Mr. Schiff anew, seizing on a New York Times report that the chairman had learned the outlines of the whistle-blower’s complaint earlier than previously known. Mr. Trump said, falsely, that Mr. Schiff had “helped write it.” The president was so agitated as he was pelted with questions that he repeatedly ordered reporters to query Mr. Niinisto instead. At the end, Mr. Trump turned his back on the Finnish president and stalked off the stage in the East Room without offering his guest the customary handshake. Mr. Giuliani said in an interview that the Democrats were “coming after his two lawyers,” him and Attorney General William P. Barr, with their push to investigate the Ukraine call. He said that he and Mr. Trump were considering filing a lawsuit against Mr. Schiff. There was a sense of theatrics on Capitol Hill, too, around Mr. Linick’s appearance. Some news reports before the briefing suggested that Mr. Linick planned to bring evidence that showed Mr. Pompeo or his deputies had been trying to retaliate against State Department officials who cooperated with Congress. On a private call with Democratic lawmakers before the briefing, Mr. Cummings advised his colleagues to “stay tuned” for potentially big news. Nothing of the sort materialized. Instead, Democrats left frustrated, accusing Mr. Linick of all but wasting their time with a few dozen pages of conspiratorial documents about the Bidens and Ukraine. The material came in an aged manila envelope that was addressed in elaborate script to Mr. Pompeo and listed “The White House” as the return address. It contained several folders that appeared to have come from a Trump hotel and copies of interview notes bearing the address of Mr. Giuliani’s New York office. Democrats said afterward that Mr. Linick had told them he interviewed T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, Mr. Pompeo’s counselor, about the material. Mr. Brechbuhl said Mr. Pompeo had told him the information “came over”; Mr. Brechbuhl assumed it was from the White House. Walking out of the briefing with a copy of the files in hand, Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland, called the material an “irrelevant distraction from the matter at hand.” “It is very clear what it is,” he told reporters. “It is a package of propaganda, misinformation and conspiracy theories. The real question is where did it come from and how did it end up in our laps?” Mr. Giuliani confirmed Wednesday that at least some of the material was his. He said he gave Mr. Pompeo Ukraine-related material in March, but indicated that the secretary of state did not do anything with it. Mr. Linick said that he had handed the same material he gave to Congress to the F.B.I. in June, and Mr. Giuliani indicated that he believed material he shared with the State Department itself had also been put before the bureau. Mr. Linick did not take questions publicly. The draft subpoena circulated by Mr. Cummings suggests he is casting a wide net for potential records related to the Ukraine matter, and is all but certain to touch off a battle with a White House that has a long history of refusing to comply with congressional requests. It explicitly asks for records that could indicate whether the White House or other administration officials took steps to conceal or destroy the records to prevent Congress or the public from learning what had happened. Among the documents requested are any recordings, transcripts, notes or other records related to a July phone call in which Mr. Trump pressed President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to conduct investigations that would bolster the American leader politically, or an earlier April call between the two men. It asks for a full list of White House staff members involved in or aware of the calls, any communications that refer to the July call and details about how the White House maintained records of the call. The Justice Department on Wednesday agreed to preserve records of Mr. Trump’s calls with foreign leaders. The draft subpoena also directs the White House to hand over records of any calls with other foreign leaders referring to the topics Mr. Trump discussed with Mr. Zelensky; of meetings related to Ukraine; and of the decision to temporarily withhold $391 million in security aid from the country this summer at the time Mr. Trump was pressing Mr. Zelensky. Asked if he would cooperate, Mr. Trump said, “I always cooperate.” But he then instantly denounced the investigation as “the greatest hoax” and made no mention of the fact that he and his administration have spent much of the year blocking House requests for documents and testimony that they deemed partisan. On Tuesday, Mr. Pompeo became one of the first Trump administration officials to push back officially on the House investigation, writing in a letter to Democratic chairmen that their demands for confidential interviews with diplomats with knowledge of the case was “an act of intimidation” and would not be immediately met. But instead of bringing it to a halt, Mr. Pompeo’s actions seem only to have fueled the case. The Democrats said any attempt to block witnesses from speaking to Congress would be construed by them as witness intimidation. And at least two of the diplomats Mr. Pompeo objected to speaking had indicated to the House that they would appear for private depositions anyway. Mr. Schiff indicated on Wednesday, though, that three other scheduled depositions may not yet be assured. Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York, and Kenneth P.

2019,"‘What Is Going to Happen to Us?’ Inside ISIS Prison, Children Ask Their Fate","A rare inside look by New York Times journalists exposes an enormous legal and humanitarian crisis, one that the world has largely chosen to ignore. NORTHEASTERN SYRIA — The prisoners cover the floor like a carpet of human despair. Many are missing eyes or limbs, some are bone-thin from sickness, and most wear orange jumpsuits similar to what the Islamic State, the terrorist group they once belonged to, dressed its own captives in before it killed them. Upstairs, jammed into two cells with little sunlight, are more than 150 children — ages roughly 9 to 14 — from a range of countries. Their parents brought them to Syria and ended up dead or detained. The children have been here for months and have no idea where their relatives are or what the future holds. “I have a question,” said a boy from Suriname inside his cell. “What is going to happen to us? Are the kids going to come out?” Rare visits to two prisons for former residents of Islamic State-held territory in northeastern Syria by The New York Times this week laid bare the enormity of a growing legal and humanitarian crisis that the world has largely chosen to ignore. As the Islamic State's self-declared caliphate collapsed in Syria, tens of thousands of men, women and children who had lived in it ended up in squalid camps and crowded prisons run by the Kurdish-led militia that had partnered with the United States to defeat the jihadists. But now that a military incursion by Turkey against Kurdish forces has set off a new wave of violence and weakened their control over the area, uncertainty has grown over the fate of the huge population of people who survived the toppling of the Islamic State and have been warehoused since then in prisons and detention camps. Most of their home countries have refused to take them back, fearing that they harbor extremist thoughts or could carry out attacks. So their governments have instead chosen to leave them in the custody of a Kurdish-led force that lacks the resources to house, feed and protect them, much less to investigate the adults and provide the children with education and rehabilitation. Little about the minors’ conditions in the Kurdish-run prison appeared to meet international standards that, even for suspected criminals, prioritize children's well-being, consider detention a last resort and require specialized physical and emotional care. One crowded cell held 86 minors — from Syria, Iraq, Mauritius, Russia and elsewhere. Another held 67 adolescents and a boy who said he was 9 and from Russia. When asked where his parents were, he shrugged and said, “They got killed.” Later, he asked of his captors, “Why don’t they bring us fruit?” The confusion surrounding the detainees has only grown since President Trump started pulling United States forces out of the area, a decision that cleared the way for Turkey to begin its assault on America’s pivotal allies in the war against the Islamic State in Syria. Prison crowding has increased because Kurdish fighters, who are viewed as a threat by Turkey, moved hundreds of prisoners away from the border to facilities farther from the battle zone, Kurdish officials said. And fighters who worked as prison guards have slipped off to the front lines to fight the Turks, leaving the facilities more vulnerable to prisoner uprisings or attacks by the Islamic State to free its comrades. “We are 100 percent sure that if they have the opportunity to escape from the prison, it will be very dangerous for us,” said Can Polat, an assistant warden at a prison with more than 5,000 men. “Holding these people here is not only a danger for Syria, it is a danger for the whole world.” The detention crisis in northeastern Syria is a bleak byproduct of the war against the Islamic State. As the terrorist group was rolled back, losing its last patch of territory in Syria in March, Kurdish fighters found themselves in charge of about 11,000 men and tens of thousands of women and children. Many of them were foreigners, from Europe, Asia, Africa and the Arab world, and most of their countries refused to take them home, even to put them on trial, much less integrate them into society. So with help from a United States-led international coalition, the Kurds established camps and a prison system, housing detainees in former government prisons they had taken over and in makeshift lock-ups in schools and other facilities. Mr. Polat’s prison is a converted industrial institute that now holds more than 5,000 people. One-quarter of them are Syrians, the rest hailing from 29 other countries, including Iraq, Libya, Egypt, Afghanistan, the Netherlands and the United States. The facility opened around the collapse of the Islamic State in Syria, which caused such an influx of prisoners that many were given orange jumpsuits provided by the coalition to replace their old clothes, Mr. Polat said. Since the Islamic State often dressed its captives in orange before killing them, many of the captives gasped when they saw the new outfits, thinking they were about to be killed, too. Orange jumpsuits now filled the prison. Most of the 400 men in a vast medical ward wore them. Many of them were sick or wounded. Men with metal braces holding broken bones in place lay on thin mattresses, while others shuffled to the bathroom on crutches or dragged their legs on the ground behind them. A few were so emaciated that their cheekbones stuck out and their legs were as thin as arms. When one man made the call to prayer, many of the prisoners prayed sitting down because they were too injured or ill to stand. The Kurdish guards assumed that most of the men had been fighters and still followed the Islamic State’s ideology, but the prisoners themselves played down their roles in the world’s most fearsome terrorist organization. A Palestinian man with a broken leg said he had come to Syria because he “wanted to help.” A mechanic from Trinidad said he had not fought because he had been too busy fixing cars. A tall, muscular Russian said he had been a cook — in an elementary school. In dozens of interviews in two prisons, no one admitted to being a fighter. Most wanted to return to their countries or hoped to get amnesty for renouncing the Islamic State. “There are some who say, ‘I was a fighter and will continue on that path,’ and others who say, ‘No, I was tricked,’” said Basil Karazoun, who said he had joined the terrorist group for protection after defecting from the Syrian military. Like most of the prisoners, he feared being handed over to Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, whose forces have been accused of widespread abuse and killings of detainees. After Mr. Trump announced that he was pulling troops out of Syria, the Kurds — worried about being overrun by Turkey once the Americans abandoned them — announced that they had reached an agreement to allow Syrian government forces into the area. “It’s a fact that if we fall into the regime’s hands, there will be mass executions,” he said. “That is how the regime thinks.” Another cell in the prison held 99 men, most of whom had lost limbs, including Abdelhamid al-Madioum, who described himself as an American who had lived near Minneapolis. In an interview, he said he had worked at a Jamba Juice in high school, that his best friends were an atheist and a Christian, and that he had been studying engineering before joining the Islamic State in Syria, where he had hoped to study medicine. But a few months after he arrived, he said, he was hit by an airstrike that shattered his body and tore off his right arm. Around the time he was captured by Kurdish fighters this year, he said, his wife was shot dead and he lost track of his two young sons, aged 2 and 4. “I made a mistake,” he said. “I’ll admit it. I’ll admit it 1,000 times.” It was unclear why some minors were put in prison, while most of the children of Islamic State fighters and followers have been taken to detention camps. Their cells were crowded, with no free space between their mattresses and blankets. When a guard swung open a hatch on the cell’s door, the children crowded around to peek outside. Mr. Polat, the deputy warden, later said the authorities had indications that many of the minors had been through ideological training as “cubs of the caliphate,” or future fighters. Plans to move the youngest prisoners to rehabilitation centers had been delayed, he said, because of the Turkish incursion and the lack of international support. Under United Nations standards for juvenile justice, even minors suspected of crimes should be detained only as “a measure of last resort and for the shortest possible period of time,” pending trial. While the Islamic State did train boys for combat, it was unclear if that was true of the boys in the prison. None were awaiting trial, because the Syrian Kurdish authorities do not try foreigners. The United Nations also says detained juveniles should receive “all necessary individual assistance,” including education, medical care and counseling. The boys in prison said they received almost no services. “The situation is pretty bad here, so if they could hurry up and decide,” said a 16-year-old boy from Mauritius. “Months like this without knowing what is going to happen, people could start going crazy. They could say these guys were terrorists before with ISIS, but they are still human.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Wounds’ Review: He Sees Dead People,"streaming Movie Review Armie Hammer plays a New Orleans bartender who quickly loses his friendly veneer when a spooky cellphone takes over his life. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. It starts with an innocent-looking cellphone in a yellow case with pink heart stickers. Innocent-looking. But that little device, which is the centerpiece of the movie “Wounds,” is more potent than you might imagine. The same is true of the giant, high-speed, Southern-style flying cockroaches that pervade this film, which begins streaming Friday on Hulu. If you’ve seen these monsters, you know to fear them the moment the first one appears, scuttling up a bottle at the New Orleans dive where Will (Armie Hammer) tends bar at night. It is there, a bar called Rosie’s, that Will finds and pockets the phone, fished from among the shards of glass left after a brawl. Some puzzling, even chilling texts pop in, and he feels compelled to answer. Then he is invited to see the “pretty pictures,” photos of dead bodies and worse. When his girlfriend, Carrie (Dakota Johnson), notices his absorption with the phone, he tries to explain it away. But the more he sees, the more the normally affable Will suffers inside, his civility giving way to confused rage. Hammer maneuvers his character nimbly as Will skates on the edge of reality, lapsing into hallucinations or fugue states — or something more sinister. Carrie, a college student, gets drawn in, too, and not in a healthy way. The idea of the phone as a place where technology and the otherworldly meet attracts the researcher in her. Just bear in mind that Carrie is writing a paper on T.S. Eliot’s “The Hollow Men.” And “Wounds” begins with an epigraph from “Heart of Darkness” about a man who is “hollow at the core.” When Will swaggers into Rosie’s by day, showing his boss (Rosie, of course) his increasingly uncontrolled fury, she asks, “What’s gotten into you?” What indeed. It’s regrettable that the writer-director Babak Anvari didn’t draw on the rich history of the occult in New Orleans to add texture to his film. Nor did he drench it in New Orleans music or local accents. There’s not even a single beignet (but there is a pool-playing naked woman at Rosie’s). “Wounds” was filmed on location, but we catch only glimpses of the city and scarcely feel the heat. It could be anywhere. Anywhere with extra-large roaches, that is. The lack of local color notwithstanding, the movie more than fulfills its promise to unsettle and to incite shivers — and it doesn’t quit. Wounds Rated R for gaping wounds, violence and brief nudity.

2019,Opinion | ‘Wow. This Letter Is Bananas.’,"When reality is inconvenient, reinvent it. Opinion Columnist This article is part of David Leonhardt’s newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday. There is no legal or logical basis to President Trump’s claim that the impeachment inquiry is illegitimate. “Wow. This letter is bananas,” Gregg Nunziata, a lawyer and former Republican staff member on the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote yesterday, referring to the White House letter announcing it would not cooperate with the inquiry. “A barely-lawyered temper tantrum. A middle finger to Congress and its oversight responsibilities. No Member of Congress should accept it, no matter his or her view on the behavior of Pelosi, Schiff, or Trump.” The Constitution gives Congress the right to pursue impeachment. And a president inviting foreign interference in American affairs — for personal gain — clearly qualifies as a potential “high crime.” By pretending otherwise, Trump is making a bet. He’s betting that he can bend the Republican Party to his will and get congressional Republicans and administration officials to parrot his fictions. He’s betting that the media won’t be able to resist framing this story as “Both sides have a legitimate argument.” He’s betting that Democrats won’t be willing to engage in as tough a brand of politics as he is. What’s the right response from each of those groups? For other Republicans, it’s remembering that they don’t need to submit to Trump. Even though he says the earth is flat, they can say it’s round. For the media, it’s using plain-spoken, objective language to state that Trump’s position has no Constitutional basis. The president’s position isn’t supported by federal law. For the Democrats, it’s being both tough and smart. File subpoenas and try to persuade judges to force Trump administration officials to testify and hand over documents. If that doesn’t work — or drags on for weeks — find other ways to make the case to the country. Don’t allow the impeachment inquiry to be derailed or slowed too badly by Trump’s obstruction. And there is one other group that should be responding to the president’s lawlessness: the public. Call your member of Congress. Attend a town-hall meeting in your district. In both business and politics, Trump has often depended on lies. When reality is inconvenient or threatening, he makes up his own version. It’s worked out quite well for him thus far. This could be the time that he has finally gone too far. Elsewhere … “Really feels like the White House is flailing these past few days, in no small part because they’ve managed to open a two front war in DC by ratcheting up the impeachment resistance and making major unpopular foreign policy choices,” Matt Glassman of Georgetown’s Government Affairs Institute wrote. Mimi Rocah, former federal prosector: “Can you imagine lawyers in any other forum — criminal or civil — writing a letter saying ‘nope, my client doesn’t like this, he’s not participating?’ Of course not. This a political propaganda not real legal arguments.” The letter is a test of Congress’s will, argued Harvard’s Leah Wright Rigueur: “How do you actually deal with a president and an executive branch that doesn’t have any regard for rule, for law, for precedent, for history, and just does as it sees fit, and a Congress that hasn’t held that president accountable until right now.” “House Democrats shouldn’t have to confront Trump alone; other prominent Democrats and anti-Trump forces have a role to play too,” Brian Beutler of Crooked wrote. “Imagine the symbolic power of millions of people marching in Washington, DC, and cities and towns across the country — now, and repeatedly as the process plays out — making concrete demands: for Republicans to support impeachment, for a real impeachment trial, for Trump’s conviction, or for a swifter end to the crisis that only Republican senators could bring about by telling Trump his time is up.” If you are not a subscriber to this newsletter, you can subscribe here.

2019,Opinion | ‘You Are Leaving Us to Be Slaughtered’: Putting Out Trump’s Syria Fire,"The president’s decision to greenlight a Turkish assault on the Kurds set a fragile peace ablaze. Mr. Bokat-Lindell is a writer in The New York Times Opinion section. This article is part of the Debatable newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it Tuesdays and Thursdays. One week after President Trump’s explosive decision to clear the way for a Turkish military assault against America’s longtime Kurdish allies in Syria, many of the most dire predictions about the fallout have already come to pass: Turkey has invaded, displacing more than 130,000 people near Syria’s northeastern border; hundreds of ISIS prisoners, taking advantage of the mayhem, have escaped detention camps; and the Kurds, left with nowhere else to turn, have struck an alliance with Syria’s dictatorial president, Bashar al-Assad. “You have given up on us. You are leaving us to be slaughtered,” the commander of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces told a senior American diplomat last week, according to CNN. Who Are the Kurds, and Why Is Turkey Attacking Them in Syria? “Rarely has a presidential decision resulted so immediately in what his own party leaders have described as disastrous consequences for American allies and interests,” writes The Times’s national security correspondent David E. Sanger. The debate: What is to be done? [The big debates, distilled. This guide will put in context what people are saying about the pressing issues of the week. Sign up for our new newsletter, Debatable.] Syria is not our problem, the White House says. On Sunday, Mr. Trump ordered almost all of the roughly 1,000 remaining troops in Syria to leave. (That may take an airlift, though, Mr. Sanger reports, since Turkey has trapped them by cutting off the roads they could use to retreat.) Mr. Trump defended the decision on Twitter: But Mr. Trump hasn’t gone far enough in extracting the United States from Middle Eastern conflicts, Simon Jenkins of The Guardian argues. Even Mr. Trump’s call for scaling back “endless wars” ran counter to his decision just days earlier to deploy 3,000 troops to Saudi Arabia because of tensions with Iran (which have flared since the president scuttled the Iran nuclear deal). In all, the United States has deployed 14,000 troops to the region since May, according to The Associated Press. Mr. Trump ought to actually follow through on his rhetoric of ending endless war, writes Mr. Jenkins: His desertion of the Kurds and his license to Turkey to invade Syria must rank high in the annals of diplomatic treachery — but for realpolitik they are hard to fault. … The U.S. should get out of Syria as it must leave Iraq, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf. Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, has been uncharacteristically critical of Mr. Trump’s acquiescence to Turkey. On Friday, after the Trump administration threatened, but did not at that time impose, sanctions on the country, Mr. Graham took to Twitter to call for a more forceful response: To that end, Mr. Graham joined forces with Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland, in a proposal to punish Ankara with severe sanctions. On Monday, Mr. Graham said that the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, supported the plan. President Trump responded to bipartisan pressure on Monday, announcing on Twitter that he would soon issue an executive order halting trade negotiations with Turkey and slapping sanctions and tariffs on the country. Lawmakers from both parties have insisted that the sanctions Mr. Trump announced Monday are not enough. “We appreciate the administration’s planned sanctions, but it does not go far enough to punish Turkey for its egregious offenses in Syria,” said a spokeswoman for Representative Michael McCaul, a Republican from Texas, in a statement. What might sufficient punishment look like? The European Union, for its part, agreed on Monday to limit arms sales to Turkey, a NATO member. Representative Ro Khanna, a California progressive Democrat, called for the United States to do the same. In a similar vein, William Hartung, noting that both the Turks and the Kurds are using American-made weapons, argues in Forbes that Congress ought to wield more leverage over arms sales in the future. But the international community also has legal recourse, if it’s willing to use it. Trudy Rubin of The Philadelphia Inquirer has accused Turkey of committing war crimes; so, too, in reluctant phrasing, has Defense Secretary Mark Esper. Ryan Goodman, a professor at New York University School of Law, whom I interviewed last week, took the logic of this condemnation to its natural conclusion: The United States has a duty to protect its allies after withdrawing from a war zone, writes Philip Caruso in The Times. Mr. Trump’s rhetorical posturing against military engagement in the Middle East has coincided with the hollowing out of the United States’ refugee program, whose cap Mr. Trump slashed this year to 18,000 people, down from 110,000 in 2016. “The moral imperative to extricate loyal friends from our conflicts,” Mr. Caruso writes, “is in danger of being ignored in favor of curbing immigration at home — an ethical disaster.” He adds: These problems must be fixed. If the administration won’t act, Congress can. It can allow more foreign nationals to relocate to America, perhaps eliminating any cap. … Above all, Congress should expand the special immigrant program to address the worst-case scenarios of hasty withdrawal from war zones abroad. This is a solution that Shikha Dalmia also proposes in the libertarian outlet Reason. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have lost an estimated 11,000 lives in the fight against ISIS, she writes, and to let them now be slaughtered by Turkey “is beyond heinous”: America could safeguard Kurdish lives by offering them a quick way out and arrange their evacuation. There are less than a million Kurds in S.D.F.-controlled Syria. Even if they all came to the U.S., America could absorb them without breaking a sweat. And not all of them would even come. … But Kurdish fighters may appreciate a safe haven for their spouses and children. The least America can do is give them that option. This solution, she notes, would, of course, require Mr. Trump to lift his travel ban on predominantly Muslim countries, including Syria. The harm Mr. Trump has caused may well be irreparable, argues The New York Times editorial board. His decision, as immoral as it was reckless and mismanaged, the board writes, is all but sure to make the Middle East more dangerous. It explains: A few days ago there were valid options to answer the question of what the United States could do in response to the invasion. Harsh sanctions and other actions might have compelled Turkey to pull back, allowing for American troops to restore the status quo. Now the only alternative to Turkish control of the north is Mr. Assad’s control of the north. America’s alliance with Kurdish forces is probably dead, and it’s hard to see what role the United States can play in Syria or in the fight against the Islamic State. They say if you break it, you own it. But maybe all the United States has done is break it. On Monday night, Vice President Mike Pence said that Mr. Trump had called President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and urged a cease-fire. But even if the Turkish invasion can be halted, the geopolitical dynamics of the region are unlikely to stop shifting. As Mr. Assad sets about picking up the pieces of America’s shattered alliance with the Kurds, President Vladimir Putin of Russia has already begun fortifying his ties with Saudi Arabia in a visit this week while his troops fill the vacuum American ones left.

2019,‘You Can’t Stand in Louisiana and See a Glacier’,"A photographer pairs images to show troubling similarities between threatened environments. In one photo, ice floes separate like shattered glass — a world of blue and white, cracking apart. The photo beside it looks almost like a scene from another planet: a marsh overflowing with water, rivulets of deep blue between bright patches of green. These aerial photos were taken by the New Orleans-based photographer Tina Freeman, many miles apart: the ice, off the eastern coast of Greenland and the marsh, near Delacroix, La. But Ms. Freeman paired them as a diptych, part of her exhibition “Lamentations,” on display at the New Orleans Museum of Art through early March. Side by side, the structures in the two photographs are strikingly similar. The ice and the marsh shapes look almost like inverses of each other, a negative and positive of the same photograph. Both environments in these photos are unhealthy, and breaking apart, though you might not be able to tell from one glance. The ice is moving south, cracking off a glacier, melting; the marsh is rotting and breaking up, starved of organic matter, turning into open water. Ms. Freeman’s diptychs in “Lamentations,” which have also been published in a book by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette Press, make visible the troubling connection between two threatened environments. Glacial loss and rising sea levels are intricately connected; because glaciers store so much water, the loss of a single large one could increase sea levels by a matter of feet. This can have disastrous consequences in low-lying regions like Louisiana, where already, according to a 2017 United States Geological Survey, a portion of the coastal wetlands the size of a football field is lost every 100 minutes. This connection between melting glaciers and rising seas is well documented, but it can be hard to conceptualize or see. “These photos are showing you something that you can’t apprehend together,” said Russell Lord, the museum’s curator of photographs. “A lot of people know, oh yeah, sea level rise is caused by melting glaciers, but you can’t stand in Louisiana and see a glacier, and most people never will. It’s bringing that connection home in a visual form.” For Ms. Freeman, 68, this project began with a trip to Antarctica in 2011 when, she said, she was struck by the “otherworldliness” of the glaciers, and began photographing them. Then, in 2013, she was invited to a New Year’s Eve party at a duck camp in the Louisiana wetlands, where she also took photographs. Looking at two of the photos side by side, she was struck by similar forms and compositions in the wildly different landscapes and thought of pairing them. “I made tons of little four by six images from Costco and that allowed me to really begin to put them together,” Ms. Freeman said. “I have a magnetic wall in my office, and I started just having lots of pairs on that wall, and unpairing and re-pairing them, and putting them in different pairs.” This project, which became the book and exhibition, led Ms. Freeman to take multiple trips to Iceland, Greenland and Norway, and to travel through the wetlands in Louisiana over the course of nearly a decade. The final diptychs are often based on structural and compositional echoes: a hollow cypress tree in a Louisiana lake whose shape is eerily similar to that of a glacier in Greenland, or glacial outflow in Iceland and sediment near Wax Lake, La., that move in similar patterns. Sometimes the connections are less obvious — a pink Arctic dusk and an orange oil boom after the Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill, the colors dissonant and bright. Part of what drew Mr. Lord to these photos were these echoes and contrasts. “I really like the idea that placing two photos together can create a kind of conversation, and is essentially a mode of forgoing text because you are asking the viewer to think about the relationship between two pictures,” he said. “Everyone will see something different. Meaning in photography is slippery; everyone brings to it what they want.” The meaning can be complex and sometimes opaque, especially at first glance. Though “Lamentations” is explicitly an exhibition about the global climate crisis, the photographs don’t scream “disaster.” Beauty is at the forefront of the work — there are wild Louisiana irises in addition to abandoned pumping stations. And even the melting glaciers, or rotting marshes, are beautiful; it is not always easy to see the destruction in each piece. “As a photographer, I don’t go after the grit,” Ms. Freeman said. “What I’m trying to do is seduce people with the beauty first and then get them to look a little closer at the pairs and begin to think harder about it, Ms. Freeman said.” “The beauty is a kind of hook.” Mr. Lord added: “It’s somewhat of a controversial mode, juxtaposing the beauty against the terrible. “In Tina’s case, you don’t see something terrible happening in all the pictures. In some cases it’s a healthy marsh, in other cases it’s a stable glacier, and it provides this sense of constant haunting.” Ms. Freeman said that as she was working, she realized that this project went back to childhood summers, when her family would drive from New Orleans down to marshes near the end of the Mississippi River and spend the night on a boat. She recalled certain images: heat lightning traveling from cloud to cloud, tall grasses, gas flares on the horizon, droves of red-winged blackbirds. “I was just reading the other day that three million birds have disappeared, and one they mentioned was red-winged blackbirds,” she said. “And I thought, yes, it’s true, you still see them but not in the large numbers you used to.” The title of the exhibition, “Lamentations,” evokes an essentially lost world — lost birds, lost glaciers, lost acres of wetland — but for Ms. Freeman, it’s also about the urgency of change. It’s about preserving what remains, she said, “and lamenting that if we don’t do anything, this will all be gone.”",The New York Times

2019,‘Zombieland: Double Tap’ Review: Back to Crack Wise and Crush Skulls,"After 10 years, Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, Jesse Eisenberg and Abigail Breslin are still murdering the pop-culture clichés. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Tallahassee, the senior zombie-killer played by Woody Harrelson in “Zombieland: Double Tap,” has a catchphrase that’s a little too naughty for me to quote. You’ve probably heard it before, and you might agree with another character’s assessment: “That saying is very 2009.” The whole movie is very 2009, which is amusing and puzzling and possibly kind of a relief, given what “very 2019” might look like. But has it really been a whole decade since “Zombieland,” in which Harrelson joined forces with Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin to crack wise while the skulls of the undead exploded around them? Apparently it has, though part of the charm of this undemanding sequel (directed, like the first one, by Ruben Fleischer) is that it treats 10 years like 10 minutes. During the hiatus, Stone won an Oscar and Eisenberg published a book of stories called “Bream Gives Me Hiccups,” but you’d never know that to see them back again as Wichita and Columbus, shacking up in the Lincoln Bedroom of the White House. In the post-apocalyptic world, there’s no history, and the filmmakers (Dave Callaham, Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick share script credit) wisely refrain from calibrating too many jokes to the present-day world beyond the screen. There’s a pretty funny riff about Uber, which is a brainstorm the dumbest character comes up with. Everyone else thinks it’s a stupid idea. This is funny on many levels. “Zombieland: Double Tap” is usually content to be funny on just one. Like the first episode, but even more so, this chapter is aware that zombies are a pop-culture cliché and is content to goof on that fact. There’s nothing here to rival the thing with Bill Murray in “Zombieland” — after all this time, it still feels like a spoiler to say much about it — but the performers commit to the silliness in a spirit of well-compensated affability. Nobody works too hard, including the new faces on hand to refresh the franchise. They include Rosario Dawson, Luke Wilson, Avan Jogia, Thomas Middleditch and Zoey Deutch. Deutch is the principal scene stealer, playing Madison (it’s a “Zombieland” tradition that everyone has the name of an American city), who has survived the undead onslaught in the freezer of a shopping-mall frozen-yogurt store. Madison is blond and not very smart, and Deutch brings remarkable energy and wit to a dreary stereotype. Other satirical targets — Elvis, hippies — are about as fresh. But the zombie gore and the verbal pepper is sprayed quickly enough to keep boredom at bay. “Zombieland: Double Tap” sets the bar low and steps easily over it, which makes it better than a lot of recent big-screen comedies. It doesn’t have much on its mind, but it isn’t completely brain-dead either. Zombieland: Double Tap Rated R. Self-congratulatory profanity. Running time: 1 hour 39 minutes.

2019,“A Pretty Dirty Campaign” That’s Left Voters Unimpressed,"As Canada’s election campaign heads into its final week, neither of the country’s major parties have managed to shift the vote. In this year’s election campaign, millions of dollars have been spent, thousand of kilometers traveled and hundreds of speeches made. And the result? Just as they were on the first day of campaigning the Liberals and the Conservatives remain deadlocked in a tie for the popular vote. If the campaigning has left you feeling underwhelmed, you’re not alone. “It’s been a horrible campaign,” Frank Graves, the president of Ekos Research, a polling firm, told me on Friday. “People are discouraged in the extreme.” Yes, Canada will actually hold 338 separate elections for local members of Parliament on Oct. 21, so the popular vote is a less than ideal measure for determining how many seats each party will end up with in the House of Commons. Mr. Graves, for his part, is candid when it comes to answering that question: “I can’t tell you for sure who is going to win the election.” But he did offer this observation based on his most recent data: “A lot of people are moving into a category that could be described as disparaging. This has been a pretty dirty campaign on both sides. And we’ve seen the fault line of the country laid bare. We just don’t have a common ground any more.” When most of you read this eight more days of campaigning will remain. In 2015, when the Liberals emerged as the winner for the first time under Justin Trudeau, the closing week proved vital to the final outcome. In Quebec alone, Mr. Graves said, about 37 percent of voters changed their minds in the closing days. To find out if history may repeat itself and if we can expect the deadlock to finally break this coming week, I also spoke to Jon H. Pammett, a professor of political science at Carleton University and Lawrence LeDuc, professor emeritus of political science at the University of Toronto. They are among the authors of “Absent Mandate” a study that uses data from elections between 1993 and 2015 to examine the volatility of Canadian voters. They weren’t hopeful. Professor Pammett said that in 2015 there was “an unusual degree of enthusiasm” for the Liberals. “This time there is not a lot of enthusiasm for any of the parties or any of the leaders,” he said. Professor LeDuc summed it up this way: “The government is not popular but it is not unpopular either.” The likely effect of all that, Professor Pammett said, is that a lot of people simply may not vote. So, Canada Letter readers, how do you feel as this campaign slouches toward its conclusion? Do you agree with Mr. Graves’ polling data that finds many people are discouraged, or did you find the campaign inspiring? Most of all, will you vote?

2019,Late surge carries Capitals past Blackhawks,"Tom Wilson scored a go-ahead goal midway through the third period, and the Washington Capitals pulled away for a 5-3 win over the host Chicago Blackhawks on Sunday evening. T.J. Oshie, Nic Dowd, Alex Ovechkin and Lars Eller also scored for Washington, which won its third game in a row. Carl Hagelin added a pair of assists, as he and Eller assisted on the winning goal. Drake Caggiula, Dominik Kubalik and Patrick Kane scored in a losing effort for the Blackhawks. Wilson snapped a 3-3 tie with 8:13 to go in the third period. He parked near the right side of the crease and punched in his third goal after a defensive breakdown by the Blackhawks. Eller added an empty-net goal with 49.3 seconds to go on a backhand shot from the opposite end of the ice. Capitals goaltender Braden Holtby made 41 saves on 44 shots to earn the victory. Blackhawks goaltender Corey Crawford drew the loss after allowing four goals on 29 shots. The Capitals opened the scoring on the power play 9:25 into the first period. Evgeny Kuznetsov stole the puck from Blackhawks defenseman Duncan Keith and slid a pass to Oshie as he charged toward the low slot. Oshie buried the opportunity for his seventh goal of the season, which leads the team. The Blackhawks evened the score at 1-1 at 8:25 of the second period. Alexander Nylander fed a backhand pass to Caggiula, who punched in a one-timer for his second goal of the season. Less than 90 seconds later, Washington regained a 2-1 lead on a short-handed goal. Hagelin and Dowd came in on a two-on-one rush. Hagelin drew Crawford toward the right side of the crease before flipping a pass to Dowd, who converted for his second goal. The Capitals made it a two-goal advantage 3:52 into the third period. Ovechkin ripped a one-timer for his sixth goal of the season and the 664th of his career, which is four shy of Luc Robitaille for 12th on the NHL’s all-time list. The Blackhawks pulled within 3-2 when Kubalik notched his second goal at 6:05 of in the third period. Kane provided the equalizer at 9:58. A Capitals giveaway led to an odd-man rush for Chicago, and Kane scored his third goal on a wrist shot from the right circle. —Field Level Media ",Reuters
2019,Trump's hailing of $50 billion in Chinese farm purchases seen as 'meaningless',"BEIJING (Reuters) - China is still a long way from forking out $50 billion for farm goods from the United States, agriculture industry analysts said on Monday, cautioning that getting there is contingent on removing substantial technical and political hurdles. Outlining the first phase of a deal to end a trade war with China, U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday lauded his counterparts for agreeing to make purchases of $40 billion to $50 billion in U.S. agricultural goods. That would be double the $24 billion China spent on American farm goods in 2017. But Darin Friedrichs, senior Asia commodity analyst at brokerage INTL FCStone in Shanghai, threw cold water on the pledge. “I think it’s a meaningless big number, thrown out to get headlines, and won’t happen,” Friedrichs told Reuters. Boosting purchases so substantially will depend on further progress on other, more thorny, issues still to be dealt with in the talks, said Friedrichs and others. “It’s probably still dependent on a larger deal going through,” said Tobin Gorey, director of Agri Commodities Strategy at Commonwealth Bank in Sydney. (GRAPHIC: China agriculture product imports from the United States - here) The emerging deal between China and the United States, covering agriculture, currency and some aspects of intellectual property protections, would represent the biggest step by the two countries in 15 months to end a tariff tit-for-tat that has whipsawed financial markets and slowed global growth. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has said the agriculture purchases would be scaled up annually. But even with a breakthrough on bigger issues, scaling up farm imports to that level is a “big, big ask”, said Ole Houe, director of advisory services at brokerage IKON Commodities in Sydney. Soybeans made up more than half of China’s agriculture purchases from the United States in 2017, at about $13 billion. Bringing in significantly larger amounts of the oilseed will be difficult with African swine fever curbing soymeal demand in China, said Houe. Substantially larger soy imports from the United States would also mean reduced purchases from other producers such as Brazil, where Chinese firms have invested heavily in recent years to accelerate Brazilian soybean shipments. Imports of other products, ranging from corn to pork and beef, have always been much smaller than soybean sales, impacted by what the United States refers to as non-tariff barriers. To boost imports of U.S. beef, China would need to lift its ban on hormones and drug residues in meat, allowing for similar trading conditions as those prevailing in Japan and South Korea, said Joel Haggard, Asia president of the U.S. Meat Export Federation. That could see it export more than $1 billion in beef to China, he said, or ten times the current level, but it could take a year or two to ramp up those supplies. Other China-based market watchers were cautious about expecting any notable increase in purchases beyond soybeans until a broader trade deal is finalized. “As to other products, we need wait for a major breakthrough. Maybe after the deal gets signed in four to five weeks. I think the goal is hard to achieve until there is a written deal,” said a trader with a state-owned Chinese trading firm. “The market is still uncertain about whether there will be a trade deal. What if there is more escalation? What if Trump tweets something again?” The world’s two largest economies have made progress in their trade dispute before without sealing a deal. In May, U.S. officials accused China of walking away from a sweeping agreement that was nearly finished over a refusal to make changes to Chinese laws that would have ensured its enforceability. Trump had said previously he would not be satisfied with a partial deal to resolve his effort to change China’s trade, intellectual property and industrial policy practices, which he argues cost millions of U.S. jobs. On Friday, he said he had decided that a phased approach was appropriate. Reporting by Dominique Patton in Beijing.

2019,Dollar recovers; loonie rises ahead of election results,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar recovered earlier losses on Monday afternoon as Brexit negotiations were once again thrown into disarray, and the Canadian dollar strengthened in the hours before results of the election for prime minister, which is expected to be close. Earlier on Monday, the U.S. dollar was crawling toward its worst month since January 2018 as the pound and euro were pushed higher by intermittent waves of Brexit optimism. But the dollar turned around in North American trade after House of Commons speaker John Bercow refused to allow a vote on Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal, adding to the obstacles to its ratification in time for an Oct. 31 deadline. Against the dollar, sterling was last down 0.02% to $1.297 having earlier broken above $1.30 for the first time in 5-1/2 months. The euro was 0.21% lower against the dollar, having also been lifted by Brexit optimism this month by 2.26%. “Brexit has been doing a lot of the hard work in terms of moving things around,” said Daniel Katzive, head of foreign exchange strategy for North America at BNP Paribas in New York. The dollar was last up 0.05%, but remains down 2.05% this month. It hovered at $1.115 per euro but managed to claw up to 108.58 against the safe-haven Japanese yen . The yen has been weak too, having hit a 2-1/2-month low last week. The Canadian dollar was last 0.31% stronger against the U.S. dollar as Canadians voted on Monday to determine whether Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who swept into office four years ago as a charismatic figure promising “sunny ways,” will remain in power after two major scandals. His Liberals and the main opposition Conservatives led by Andrew Scheer are in a neck-and-neck race, according to opinion polls. “In Canada, traders are awaiting news on election results this evening and effectively keeping the powder dry given that the race is so close at this moment,” said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge Global Payments. “The consensus is that if we were looking at a Liberal government or a minority Liberal government, with the likelihood of an alliance with the NDP, that would pull the Canadian dollar back slightly, though we’re not looking at a massive move - something like 50 to 100 basis points,” he said, referring to the smaller left-leaning New Democratic Party. “Alternatively, a Tory victory would push the Canadian dollar up slightly, again by 50 to 100 basis points,” he said, referring to the Conservatives.

2019,"Instant View: China third-quarter GDP grows 6.0% year-on-year, misses expectations","BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s economic growth slowed more than expected to 6.0% year-on-year in the third quarter, the weakest pace in at least 27-1/2 years, as demand at home and abroad faltered amid a bruising Sino-U.S. trade war. Friday’s data marked a further loss of momentum for the economy from the second quarter’s 6.2% growth, likely raising expectations that Beijing needs to roll out more measures to ward off a sharper slowdown. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast gross domestic product (GDP) to grow 6.1% in the July-September quarter from a year earlier. * Q3 GDP +6.0% y/y (f’cast +6.1%, prev +6.2%) * Q3 GDP +1.5% q/q (f’cast +1.5%, prev +1.6%) * September industrial output +5.8% y/y (f’cast +5.0%, prev +4.4%) * September retail sales +7.8% y/y (f’cast +7.8%, prev +7.5%) * Jan-September fixed asset investment +5.4% y/y (f’cast +5.4%, Jan-Aug +5.5%) * China Jan-September property investment +10.5% y/y TORU NISHIHAMA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, DAI-ICHI LIFE RESEARCH INSTITUTE, TOKYO “The Chinese authorities must be taking the economic situation quite seriously. The U.S.-China trade war has worsened China’s jobs and wage situation and corporations also refrained from making capital investment.” “External risks from the trade friction between the U.S. and China have eased and we expect there will be public infrastructure spending. So, downside pressure to the economy in the fourth quarter has been eased. “There is speculation in the markets that the central bank in China may expand monetary policy, but considering higher inflation it would be difficult for the central bank to do so. “There is still a possibility that the trade friction between China and the United State would flare up again, which would put downward pressure on the Chinese economy.” NAOTO SAITO, CHIEF RESEARCHER, DAIWA INSTITUTE OF RESEARCH, TOKYO “This year the growth rate has been slipping by 0.2 percentage point every quarter and we are likely to see it falling below 6% in the final quarter.” “Policymakers are likely to take more economic steps next year, the final year in their policy target, to double GDP. The problem is policy options they can use are growingly limited. “One is more infrastructure spending. This will be made possible by fiscal spending, especially by local governments. The other one would be consumption stimulus. But mysteriously, after Beijing announced the outline of such measures on Jan. 23, it hasn’t done anything yet. I expect they will take concrete steps next year. “Chinese policymakers would want to see whether the latest deal with the U.S. will be ‘papered’ at APEC meeting on Nov. 16-17. And then they would need to see if Washington will postpone the planned tariff on Dec. 15. “If those things happen, there will be more expectations of a bottom-out in the Chinese economy as investors expect the U.S. administration to calm down a bit on trade war ahead of the election. And any economic measures will become far more effective.” KAORI YAMATO, SENIOR ECONOMIST, MIZUHO RESEARCH INSTITUTE, TOKYO “China’s exports were weak, but imports were also weak. On a net basis, it may not seem like a problem, but the GDP data was clearly weaker than expected.” “Another problem is a slowdown in infrastructure investment and a slowdown in investment by companies because of worries about the trade war. “It will take a little more time for government spending on infrastructure to boost growth, but I’m not pessimistic because money is flowing to regional governments. Corporate tax breaks really haven’t worked because companies are uncertain about the trade war. “China’s economy probably won’t worsen further, because infrastructure spending and investment related to new environmental standards will eventually hep growth. Also, consumer spending is holding up.” ALICIA GARCIA HERRERO, CHIEF ECONOMIST: ASIA PACIFIC, NATIXIS, BEIJING “China’s Q3 GDP growth came in below market expectations at 6.0% Y-o-Y, which was dragged mainly by the manufacturing sector. As such, we have already lowered our GDP growth forecast to 6.1% for 2019 given China’s limited room to push up growth despite a partial deal with the United States.” “In other words, we finally clearly see the impact of the trade war and lack of real response of the Chinese economy to stimulus. I think the number is worrisome for 2020 unless China takes some big action. The only immediate one for the manufacturing sector is a devaluation of the renminbi. I think they are leaning towards this.” “Growth retreated as expected, but below market expectations. At this point, I think that China’s GDP will grow 6% in the last quarter... I don’t think they have the policy room for more stimulus and there’s a chance that they will register growth numbers lower than 6% in Q4.” “In terms of Chinese stock and debt markets, I don’t think they’re impacted too much by the GDP numbers. They’ve had some near-term reprieve thanks to the progress in talks with the U.S. and they’re dependent on the trade talks.” MITUL KOTECHA, SR EMERGING MARKETS STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES, SINGAPORE “The numbers could have been worse. If anything there was some fear it might drop below 6% but that didn’t happen. What’s overshadowing this is, from the point of view of sentiment, for now anyway, is the industrial production numbers. It highlights that there is a bit of a glimmer of hope on the manufacturing side and some hope that trade progress will help further.” FRANCES CHEUNG, HEAD OF MACRO STRATEGY FOR ASIA, WESTPAC BANKING CORP, SINGAPORE “While GDP was a tad below expectation, this series have been very stable that the market may not pay too much attention to as long as it has not dipped below 6%.” “The monthly data shows some return of growth momentum, but it was unclear as to what was behind the strong production of some goods such as machineries and telecommunication products. “Overall it is a mixed bag of outcome. With the constructive backdrop for risk sentiment today the market may tend to have a positive interpretation. But after the initial – likely mild reaction, the market is likely to look past it. “The rebound in industrial production is encouraging, but the growth outlook has not brightened up yet with various tariffs still in place. The PBoC is likely to stay supportive, and we continue to expect some liquidity release via a 50bp cut in the reserve ratio by the year-end.” “It is actually in line with our forecast. I think the tertiary sector’s stability, or rather the improvement in the tertiary industry is very important for China. Around half of growth is actually contributed by the tertiary industry.” “But I think the slowdown is set to continue. There is a lot of uncertainty, still, regarding the U.S.-China trade agreement. I think the Dec. 15 tariffs will have very important implications for Chinese growth in 2020. Beijing’s approach has been rather measured and targeted and they will continue to be so. “I think they will continue to take interest rates lower via the loan prime rate, but it’s not going to be a big drop, it’s going to be gradual. I think fiscal policy wise there’s a lot more they can do.” - China’s economic growth has been slowing since last year as the trade war with the United States takes a toll on factory activity, exports and domestic demand, suggesting that a spate of stimulus measures including tax cuts and easier lending rules are yet to have a notable effect on overall growth. - The outlook is unlikely to change for the better any time soon even though the trade tensions between Beijing and Washington have eased somewhat. - U.S. President Donald Trump said last week the two sides had reached an agreement on the first phase of a deal and suspended a tariff hike, but officials said much work still needed to be done. - The International Monetary Fund has warned the trade war will cut 2019 global growth to its slowest pace since the 2008-2009 financial crisis, but said output would rebound if the dueling tariffs were removed. - Beijing has relied on a combination of fiscal stimulus and monetary easing to weather the current slowdown, including trillions of yuan in tax cuts and local government bonds to fund infrastructure projects and efforts to spur bank lending. - But the economy has been slow to respond with business confidence shaky and local governments facing increasing strains as tax cuts hit revenues, weighing on investment. - Analysts in a Reuters poll expect the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) to ease policy further by cutting banks’ reserve retirement ratios and the one-year loan prime rate, a new benchmark lending rate. - China’s economic growth is expected to cool to 6.2% this year, a near 30-year low, according to a Reuters poll.

2019,"Kaplan: 'Agnostic' on October rate cut, may be wise to see 'more cards' before acting again","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Dallas Federal Reserve bank president Robert Kaplan said on Friday he is currently “agnostic” about whether the Fed cuts rates at its upcoming October meeting, arguing it may be wise to see more information before adding a third rate reduction to the two the central bank has already approved this year. “This could break either way,” Kaplan said. But despite risks tilted toward a worse-than-expected economic outcome, “it may be wise to take a little time to assess and continue to turn over a few more cards.” Kaplan said he supported the Fed’s moves in July and September, but as of the September meeting did not expect more cuts would be appropriate this year. Kaplan, who is not a voter on interest rate policy this year, said he expected debate at the upcoming Oct. 29-30 policy meeting to focus on whether a slowing global economy has moved beyond dragging down U.S. manufacturing and investment, and begun to hit the U.S. consumer. Consumption is currently holding up growth, and Kaplan said he expects that to continue. It is, however, a “fragile” situation that could warrant further Fed action down the road. As of September Kaplan said he expected only one more rate cut by the end of 2020, but would be willing to move that forward if problems accelerate. “Would it shock me if we see more slowing?” he said in comments to reporters on the sidelines of an economic conference here. “We are in this fragile period where we are going to see how this is breaking.” Reporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Alex Richardson and Tom Brown",Reuters
2019,Erdogan says Syria offensive will continue if truce deal not fully implemented,"ISTANBUL, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Turkey will continue its offensive into northeast Syria more rapidly than before if an agreement with the United States to pause the operation and allow the withdrawal of Kurdish forces is not fully implemented, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday. Erdogan also told journalists that it was not a problem for Turkey if Syrian government forces, backed by Russia, were to enter areas cleared of the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, adding that Ankara had no intention to stay in areas under its control in northern Syria. He also said he had informed U.S. President Donald Trump about the offensive in a phone call a day before launching it. He added that “what is necessary will be done when the time is right” about a letter from Trump in which he told Erdogan to not be a “fool” and “tough guy”.

2019,Israel envoy demands probe after effigy of Jewish tycoon left at Ukraine synagogue,"KIEV (Reuters) - The Israeli ambassador to Ukraine asked police on Thursday to find and punish people who left a red paint-spattered effigy of tycoon Ihor Kolomoisky, who holds a Ukrainian Jewish community leadership post, on the steps of the main synagogue in Kiev. Kolomoisky, one of Ukraine’s richest men, is in the public eye over his business ties to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who came to fame as the star of TV show on a channel Kolomoisky owns. The tycoon has been in a protracted legal battle with the authorities over control of Urkaine’s biggest bank. Kolomoisky is president of the United Jewish Community of Ukraine, one of several Jewish community bodies in the country. “Another disturbing act of anti-Semitism ... I hope that the law enforcement agencies will promptly arrest the perpetrators,” Joel Lion said in a statement on the embassy’s Twitter feed where a picture of the effigy was also published. The life-size effigy was dressed in dark trousers and a green sweater, covered by large red spots of paint. “Ukraine has to do more to fight anti-Semitism, if not, violence will spread from effigies to human beings,” said the ambassador. Kiev police told Reuters they had launched a criminal investigation over hooliganism but had not identified the people involved yet. They did not give additional details. Kolomoisky did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the incident. Last year rights groups Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Front Line Defenders and Freedom House wrote an open letter to the authorities under a previous government urging them to do more to tackle cases of attacks and intimidation of by radical groups. Ukraine nationalized its largest lender PrivatBank in 2016 against the wishes of owner Kolomoisky and his business partner. A court in Kiev on Thursday suspended hearing one of the cases brought by Kolomoisky to overturn the nationalization. The court was surrounded by dozens of protesters who support the nationalization of the bank, and the court building was emptied at one point because of a bomb scare.

2019,Hong Kong leader's policy speech to focus on housing in bid to regain support,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong’s embattled leader Carrie Lam will focus on land and housing initiatives in her annual Policy Address on Wednesday, seeking to restore confidence in the city’s future amid four months of sometimes violent anti-government protests. Beijing-backed Lam, Hong Kong’s most unpopular post-colonial leader, is under immense pressure to regain trust and quell unrest that has plunged the Asian financial center into its biggest political crisis in decades. Protests over a now-withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party have evolved into calls for greater democracy and revived grievances over housing in one of the world’s most expensive property markets. Lam said on Tuesday her annual address will focus on land and housing, although she did not elaborate. Some economists also expect measures to support the retail sector, which has been battered as the demonstrations scare away tourists. “It (policy support) will mainly come from increasing the housing stock. Housing seems to be the big issue at the moment,” said Carie Li, an economist at OCBC Wing Hang Bank. “There may also be relief for retailers, the tourism and catering sectors, which have been most affected.” Hong Kong’s August retail sales were the worst on record as the protests at times forced stores and shopping malls to close, often during peak periods such as weekends and public holidays. The retail, accommodation and food-service sectors employed about 16.3% of workers based on 2018 statistics, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The protests also pose a grave challenge for Beijing, which has singled out Hong Kong developers for not doing enough to alleviate housing problems at a time when the former British colony is facing its first recession in a decade. Property developer New World Development Co Ltd said in September it would donate 3 million square feet (278,710 sq m) of its farmland reserves for social housing, while Henderson Land said it would donate land in Yuen Long to build youth and other subsidized housing. The Democratic Party and the pro-establishment Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) said the government should make use of a regulation to take back agricultural land from developers to build public housing. “The housing shortage is getting more serious, especially after the government changed the public-to-private housing ratio to 70:30. The need for public housing is more eminent but the land supply remains the same,” DAB lawmaker Lau Kwok-fan told Reuters. Economists said the government, which has fiscal reserves of HK$1.16 trillion ($147.9 billion), was also likely to roll out measures to support households as well as small and medium enterprises, and promote Hong Kong on the international stage. “Additional resources may be allocated to the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) for running overseas promotions, organizing shopping festivals, and offering merchandise concessions and discount coupons in collaboration with the retail sector,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a report. Lam’s annual address comes as Hong Kong is also grappling with the impact of a prolonged U.S.-China trade war and a broader economic slowdown that has seen a significant drop in exports. The protests have also unnerved investors. Goldman Sachs estimated this month Hong Kong may have lost as much as $4 billion in deposits to rival Asian financial hub Singapore between June and August. While Goldman’s report did not make any mention of the protests, the period during which the flows took place coincided with the demonstrations. In August, the government unveiled a HK$19.1 billion package to support the slowing economy, including subsidies for the underprivileged and business enterprises, as well as somewhat higher salary tax rebates. Local media reported that Lam could deliver her annual speech in a pre-recorded message if protesters besieged the Legislative Council when it reconvenes on Wednesday.

2019,Harley-Davidson halts electric motorcycle production,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc (HOG.N) said on Monday it has stopped production and deliveries of its first electric motorcycle after discovering a glitch in the final quality checks. The motorcycle maker said it has discovered a “non-standard condition” with LiveWire, which it began shipping to its dealers late last month, prompting additional testing and analysis. While the company said its testing is progressing “well,” it did not offer a timeline as to when the production will resume. Harley’s shares turned lower on the news and were last trading down 1% at $34.73. The company is betting on electric motorcycles to attract the next generation of younger and more environmentally conscious riders to reverse declining U.S. sales. LiveWire - priced at $29,799 - has been available for preorder in the United States since January. The bulk of the orders for the bike were coming in from existing and old riders, its dealers told Reuters.

2019,World Bank slashes India's growth forecast to 6% for this fiscal year,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The World Bank on Sunday slashed its growth forecast for India’s current fiscal year to 6%, down from 7.5%, warning that the “severe” slowdown could further weaken the country’s stuttering financial sector. In its last forecast in April, the bank had said that India’s economic outlook was strong and expected growth of 7.5% during the current fiscal year that began in April. But Asia’s third-largest economy is currently growing at its slowest pace in six years, expanding by just 5% in the April-June quarter, hit by flagging consumer demand and a slackening in government spending. India’s industrial output also shrank at its fastest rate in more than six years in August, data released last week showed, indicating that a slew of government measures had yet to underpin a recovery. In an effort to kick-start the economy, India’s central bank has cut interest rates five times this year, and underlined the challenge for policymakers by downgrading its growth forecast to 6.1% from 6.9% earlier this month. Last week, ratings agency Moody’s Investors Service lowered its growth forecast for India to 5.8% for the current fiscal year from 6.2%, adding that a long period of weak growth will hamper the government’s fiscal consolidation plans. The World Bank’s latest forecast also underlined similar concerns linked to slowing growth and New Delhi’s decision to cut the corporate tax rate, which will cost about 1.5 trillion rupees in tax revenues. “While the authorities have shown steadfast commitment to fiscal prudence, the significant growth deceleration as well as the corporate tax cuts undertaken to counter it come with heightened risks of fiscal slippage,” the bank’s report said. The bank said it expects the economy to gradually recover, growing at 6.9% in the fiscal 20/21 starting next April. Reporting by Devjyot Ghoshal; Editing by Shri Navaratnam",Reuters

2019,Moderate Democratic candidates' strategy shifts from taking down Biden to attacking Warren,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (Reuters) - For long-shot moderates trying to compete for the Democratic presidential nomination, this week’s debate in Ohio marked a significant shift in strategy. Attacking former Vice President Joe Biden, the longtime front-runner in the race, was out. Going after U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the candidate who has grabbed the momentum in the nominating contest, was in. It might have seemed counter-intuitive for Democratic moderates such as Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and Amy Klobuchar, a U.S. senator from Minnesota, to direct their fire at Warren. She is a progressive who champions sweeping structural change. Biden is an establishment favorite who appeals to the same kinds of voters the lower-tier rivals are chasing. But campaign sources said the approach reflected a new dynamic in the race. With Warren’s ascent in the polls, Buttigieg, Klobuchar and other moderate candidates are trying to slow Warren’s rise while also positioning themselves to benefit should Biden falter. Part of that strategy has involved warning moderate voters that Warren’s ambitious plans for universal healthcare coverage and free public college may be unworkable legislatively and unpalatable to a large swath of the electorate. “They are creating a third lane of sorts. There’s voters who don’t like Warren’s progressive brand of politics and want an alternative to Biden, and that’s what they are trying to provide,” said Aaron Pickrell, who ran former President Barack Obama’s Ohio campaign. Time is running out for many of the candidates in the sprawling presidential field to make an impact. Democrats cast votes in the first nominating contest in Iowa in less than four months. The nominee will challenge Republican President Donald Trump in the November 2020 election. For much of the year, moderate Democrats in the field have been waiting for Biden, who served two terms as Obama’s vice president, to come back to the pack. But that has largely not happened, forcing a retooling that came into sharp focus during Tuesday’s debate. “Folks have stopped relying on the strategy that the path to success comes from stealing Biden voters and waiting for him to fall,” a campaign adviser to former congressman Beto O’Rourke, another presidential candidate in need of a boost, told Reuters. “Warren’s rise has come from taking voters away from several different campaigns, and I think what you saw are candidates trying to get those voters back,” the adviser added. Buttigieg went into the debate with a clear strategy of drawing contrasts between himself and Warren, according to a campaign adviser who asked for anonymity to discuss strategy. The two candidates engaged in a fierce back-and-forth over healthcare policy. The campaign believes that in attacking Warren, Buttigieg is also positioning himself as a viable alternative to Biden and stands to pick up supporters not only from his campaign but from other Democratic contenders. Buttigieg may be best positioned to make a run at Biden. After a strong fundraising performance in the third quarter of the year, the mayor has more than $20 million in cash on hand and has already invested in more resources in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Biden, who has struggled with grassroots fundraising, has just $9 million in the bank. A win in Iowa likely would give candidates like Buttigieg or Klobuchar a dramatic jump-start that could carry them forward into subsequent early contests, while a loss for Biden there could be a mortal blow to his effort. Klobuchar, who has made winning Iowa central to her strategy, also arrived at the debate poised to distinguish herself from Warren, according to a source with her campaign. She suggested that Warren’s progressive agenda would leave a lot of middle-class voters cold. “I think simply because you have different ideas doesn’t mean you’re fighting for regular people,” Klobuchar told Warren. The campaign source said the strategy worked: Klobuchar’s campaign raised more money in small donations after the debate than in any previous 24-hour stretch. She still has a lot of ground to make up, however, with a national polling average of just under 2%. After the debate, Warren spokeswoman Kristen Orthman said the senator from Massachusetts “took heat” as a result of her momentum, but “stayed focused on what’s broken and how she plans to fix it ... that’s how Elizabeth will win the nomination, beat Donald Trump and make big, structural change.” Cory Booker, a U.S. senator from New Jersey, used the debate to position himself above the fray as the candidate who can unite the party’s warring moderate and progressive factions. “While others were going after each other, Cory won the night by standing out as a leader, a unifier, and the adult in the room who refocused the conversation on the issues that matter most,” a Booker representative told Reuters. Biden, who faced tough criticism in past debates from candidates such as U.S. Senator Kamala Harris and former U.S. Housing Secretary Julian Castro, had a relatively easy time of it on Tuesday from his rivals. The prior attacks largely backfired on Harris and Castro. But Delacey Skinner, a Democratic strategist who has worked for Senate and gubernatorial candidates, said there was an even simpler reason why Buttigieg and Klobuchar did not go after Biden. “I’d guess neither of them wants to alienate Biden supporters,” she said.

2019,Hong Kong tourism fall hits cognac sales at Remy Cointreau,"PARIS (Reuters) - French spirits maker Remy Cointreau (RCOP.PA) said falling tourism in Hong Kong hurt cognac sales in its second quarter, as a revenue decline deepened across the group. Several months of pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong have hurt groups that are highly dependent on tourist flows, such as hotelier Accor (ACCP.PA), as well as luxury goods retailers, with many brands forced to temporarily shut up shop. At Remy Cointreau - which relies on its Remy Martin cognac label for the bulk of sales, and is also behind brands like Mount Gay rum - the turmoil dragged on revenues, which it had previously flagged would improve in the second quarter. Instead, group sales were down 4% on a comparable basis in the July to September period, after a 3% sales fall in the previous three months. Cognac sales had “suffered from the fall in tourism in Hong Kong and from slower than anticipated stock replenishment by retailers in the United States”, the company said. On a reported basis, second-quarter sales fell 1.3% to 300.7 million euros ($334.5 million). The end of distribution contracts in markets like the Czech Republic, which had been expected, also contributed to the decline. Spirit makers benefited from some good news in recent weeks as cognac, champagne and blended whiskies were excluded from a list of goods set to be slapped with 25% U.S. tariffs as of Friday, as part of a trade row over EU aircraft subsidies. But some wines and types of whisky will still be affected. France’s Pernod Ricard (PERP.PA) said on Thursday it may raise prices on spirits like its Glenlivet Scotch whisky as a result. Pernod, as well as other consumer goods companies including Nestle (NESN.S), have also pointed to slower progress in key Asian countries including China, which is also an important market for Remy Cointreau.

2019,AT&T's Xandr purchases TV advertising company clypd: source,"(Reuters) - AT&T Inc’s (T.N) advertising unit Xandr has purchased clypd, an advertising platform that uses data to better target television ads, a source familiar with the matter said, as Xandr seeks to make TV commercials as personally targeted as internet ads. Clypd, which counts TV networks Discovery (DISCA.O) and CBS (CBS.N) as partners, uses data to enable advertisers to target viewers more precisely by their interests. TV commercials are traditionally purchased with only the capability to target people by age and gender. The purchase amount could not be learned. A Xandr spokesman declined to comment. Clypd did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The deal will also add linear TV ad inventory, or ad space, from clypd’s clients to Xandr Community, a product that pools advertising space from AT&T-owned properties that include WarnerMedia and DirecTV, but also third parties like cable networks A+E and AMC, the source said. The addition helps resolve a concern from some advertising buyers that Community did not offer access to enough valuable linear TV, which still reaches a larger audience than streaming services. The deal comes as AT&T is fending off activist investor Elliott Management, which has questioned its $85 billion purchase of Time Warner. It has also called for AT&T to consider selling satellite TV provider DirecTV, which has been losing subscribers. AT&T has resisted suggestions such as getting rid of DirecTV because that would undercut its master plan to create a powerful advanced advertising machine by stitching together wireless, satellite TV and content operations. The plan would allow advertisers to reach the right viewers and more effectively measure their ads. Clypd is the second deal under Xandr Chief Executive Brian Lesser, who previously led ad agency GroupM in North America, to build Xandr’s ad tech capabilities. It bought AppNexus, a digital advertising tech platform, last year for a reported $1.6 billion. Reporting by Sheila Dang; Editing by Chris Reese and Cynthia Osterman",Reuters
2019,"Australian shares gain for 5th day on Wall Street rally, Brexit optimism","* Aussie benchmark index at 2-week high * Banks, energy firms lead gains * Commodity prices weigh on mining stocks (Updates to close) Oct 16 (Reuters) - Australian shares ended higher for a fifth straight session on Wednesday, buoyed by gains in financial and energy stocks, as upbeat U.S. corporate results and hopes of a potential Brexit deal boosted risk appetite. The S&P ASX 200 index closed 1.3% higher at 6,736.5, its highest level in two weeks. The benchmark ended marginally higher on Tuesday. Stronger-than-expected corporate earnings from major U.S. banks helped alleviate fears of a global economic slowdown, while news that Britain and the European Union could reach a deal in time for a leaders’ summit this week added to the positive mood. Australia’s financial index, which has the biggest weightage on the benchmark index, climbed as much as 1.7%, marking its best session in more than a month. Gains in the financial sector were led by the country’s “Big Four” banks, which added between 1% and 1.5%. Meanwhile, strength in global crude prices on signals of possible further supply curbs lifted energy stocks 1.3% higher, with index heavyweights Santos Ltd and Oil Search rising 1.3% and 1% each. Industrial engineering firm WorleyParsons jumped 4% and was among the top performers in the energy sector. The company on Wednesday informed Australia’s foreign investments regulator of “creeping acquisitions” by its biggest shareholder, Dubai-based Dar Group. The mining sub-index ended 0.3% lower, pressured by weaker iron ore prices. Global mining giants BHP Group fell as much as 0.5%, while Rio Tinto slipped 0.9% despite reporting a 5% rise in third-quarter iron ore shipments. Gold stocks skid as much as 2.8% to their weakest level since July 3, as a broader risk-on sentiment capped the bullion’s gains. OceanaGold Corp declined 8.4% and was among the biggest drags on the gold index, as the miner warned of lower output this year after it suspended production at its Didipio gold and copper mine in the Philippines citing a dispute with local government. Across the Tasman Sea, New Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index rose 1.2% to finish the session at 11,178.64, marking a fourth straight day of gains. New Zealand’s central bank signalled more rate cuts, or even unconventional stimulus measures, may be needed to counter global headwinds, as data on Wednesday showed the country’s annual inflation rate slowed in the third quarter. Dairy firm Synlait Milk and Restaurant Brands New Zealand were among the top gainers on the local benchmark, soaring 5.4% and 4.2% each. Reporting by Shriya Ramakrishnan in Bengaluru; Editing by

2019,Cycling: Sunweb teenager Maas may never walk again after collision with car,"(Reuters) - Teenage cyclist Edo Maas of Sunweb’s development team may never walk again after he fractured his back in a collision with a car at the Piccolo Lombardia race earlier this month, the German cycling team has said. Maas, 19, was moved to a hospital in Milan with injuries to his face, neck and back after the collision on the Madonna del Ghisallo hill. He underwent a series of intensive surgeries and has since regained consciousness. ""The fracture in his back has led to paraplegia, a loss of nerve feeling in his legs,"" Sunweb said in a statement here “At this moment it remains unlikely that functionality in his legs will ever return, but fighting power and hope prevails.” Sunweb also called upon cycling’s governing body UCI to take action and prioritize rider safety. Maas’ collision follows the death of 22-year-old Belgian cyclist Bjorg Lambrecht, who crashed during the third stage of the Tour of Poland in August.

2019,UPDATE 1-Lebanon protesters keep pressure on government as reform deadline nears,"* Lebanon protests enter fourth day * Growing calls for government to resign * PM Hariri proposes reform plan to government partners (Adds comments, IMF report, colour) By Eric Knecht and Suleiman Al-Khalidi BEIRUT, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Protesters in Lebanon flooded the streets on Sunday, keeping pressure on Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri as a self-imposed deadline to deliver a package of badly needed reforms for the country’s crumbling economy drew near. Anti-government protests that have swept the country since Thursday have pulled together all segments of Lebanese society in an unusually unified call for the downfall of a political elite that protesters blame for plunging the economy into crisis. On Sunday demonstrators clogged streets across the country for a fourth day with marches resembling outdoor festivals. Loudspeakers blared nationalistic music as energised protesters chanted calls for the government’s fall. “I didn’t expect people from the country’s north, south and Beirut to join hands and like each other. The protests have brought together everyone and this has never happened before,” said Sahar Younis, a 32-year-old worker with a non-governmental organisation. Hariri, who is leading a coalition government mired by sectarian and political rivalries, gave his feuding partners a 72-hour deadline on Friday to agree to reforms that could ward off economic crisis, hinting he may otherwise resign. He accused his rivals of obstructing budget measures that could unlock $11 billion in Western donor pledges and help avert economic collapse. Government sources said Hariri was waiting for his coalition to get on board with the economic proposals, which include taxes on banks and implementing a plan within one month to overhaul the country’s costly and crumbling state electricity utility. Reforming the country’s wasteful electricity sector is key for potential investors and donors who consider it one of the biggest strains on the country’s depleted finances. Pressure on Hariri has mounted as a rising chorus of voices, from union leaders to politicians, join popular calls for his government to resign. The Maronite Christian Lebanese Forces party said late Saturday its four ministers would withdraw from the government. If Hariri, a Sunni Muslim who is traditionally backed by the West and Sunni Gulf Arab allies, resigns it would be harder for the various parties that make up the ruling coalition to form a new cabinet. A new cabinet would also likely see Iranian-backed Hezbollah and its allies more in control, a shift that would make it nearly impossible for international donors or Gulf Arab countries at odds with Iran to offer aid or investments. Ending rampant corruption is a central demand of the protestors, who say the country’s leaders have used their positions to enrich themselves for decades through favourable deals and kickbacks. “All of the leaders should be put under house arrest and be held accountable to return the money they stole from the state so Lebanon can get back on its feet,” said Antoine Zahli, 43, a pharmacist who was among the protesters in downtown Beirut. Charbel Antoun, a 17-year-old student added: “We want to stay in Lebanon to build our future but if these corrupt politicians stay here what future will be left for us?” Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has thrown his powerful Shi’ite group’s weight behind the current government, saying the country’s deep economic crisis means precious time should not be wasted forming a new one. Nasrallah said on Saturday that imposing more taxes on people could lead to an “explosion” of unrest and warned of the risk of bankruptcy and currency devaluation if the government failed to come up with solutions. Without a foreign funding boost, Lebanon faces bleak economic prospects. Officials and economists also predict a currency devaluation or a debt default within months if it fails to sure up its finances. The IMF said last week that Lebanon’s crisis requires tough austerity measures such as tax hikes and levies on fuel, steps the country’s politicians have publicly vowed not to take. The mounting unrest was triggered in part by a proposed fee on WhatsApp calls, a measure quickly scrapped but that was seen by many as the latest government attempt to squeeze citizens receiving little in return from the state. Lebanon’s economy registered just 0.3 percent growth last year. The IMF said the reforms were needed to stem a ballooning deficit and public debt it forecasts to reach 155 percent of GDP by year-end, one of the world’s highest.

Even though Republicans do not control the chamber, the measure has a good chance of passing, with members of both parties condemning the swift eruption of violence from Turkey, a NATO ally. In the Republican-led Senate top Democrat Chuck Schumer on Wednesday called for the House to quickly pass the resolution and for his chamber to then immediately take it up. Republican President Donald Trump has announced sanctions on Turkey, ratcheted up tariffs on the country’s steel imports and suspended a major trade deal, but many lawmakers say the U.S. response must go even further.

2019,Spanish court to probe Russian tycoon's bid for DIA supermarket chain: document,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain’s High Court will investigate allegations that Russian tycoon Mikhail Fridman acted to depress the share price of DIA (DIDA.MC) when trying to take control of the supermarket chain, a court document seen by Reuters showed. Fridman’s LetterOne fund denied the allegations on Tuesday, saying in a statement they were “untrue and defamatory”. LetterOne rescued DIA from the brink of insolvency this year after the retailer’s market value fell by 90% in 2018 as it lost out to rising competition. Spain’s Supreme Court gave the High Court a mandate to investigate anonymous accusations which it said indicated Fridman may have acted to manipulate prices, engaged in insider trading and damaged the interests of minority shareholders, the court document seen by Reuters showed. “The reality is that DIA has suffered from mismanagement and previously disclosed accounting irregularities that have negatively impacted all shareholders, including LetterOne,” LetterOne said in a statement emailed to Reuters. The court document cites a police report alleging that Fridman acted in a coordinated and concerted way through a network of corporations to create short-term illiquidity in the company and lower the share price before launching his takeover. “According to the accusation, LetterOne Investment Holdings (directed by Fridman), shareholder in DIA, maintained a heightened financial tension to lower the share price before buying the company,” said the court document, dated Sept. 18. As part of the bid, which raised its stake to 70%, LetterOne loaned DIA 490 million euros ($546 million) and struck deals to extend debt agreements and set up new credit lines with banks. “We have backed DIA and have committed to invest 1.6 billion euros to protect jobs and suppliers, keep stores open, and rescue this Spanish retailer,” LetterOne said. DIA shareholders met on Tuesday and approved a capital hike, the proceeds of which will be partially used to pay back LetterOne’s loan. Fridman appeared in court in Madrid on Monday as part of a separate case, in which judges are investigating the bankruptcy of digital entertainment firm Zed Worldwide. He denied all charges in that case in a statement on Monday. Reporting by Emma Pinedo and Isla Binnie; Editing by Ingrid Melander, Jan Harvey and Alexander Smith",Reuters
2019,UPDATE 2-China's Hengli wins license to supply jet fuel for commercial use,"(Adds spokesman’s comments) BEIJING, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Hengli Petrochemical Co has become the first private refiner to win approval from China’s civil aviation authority to supply jet fuel for commercial use, it said on Tuesday, a first step towards selling the product overseas. Hengli has long aimed to be China’s first private exporter of jet fuel, but the authorities had held off granting approval to private refiners to export refined oil products. In August, the company, which submitted its fuel exports application months ago, sold its first jet fuel cargo for export through a state-owned firm, bypassing Beijing’s export quota restriction. Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request seeking for comment. Based in Dalian, a port city in the northeast province of Liaoning, Hengli launched a mega refining plant with crude oil processing capacity of 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) in late May. The refinery is expected to produce an estimated 2.5 million tonnes of aviation fuel this year, though its designed capacity is 3.71 million tonnes, a company spokesman said. Despite the new jet fuel license, Hengli has not been granted any government quotas to export jet fuel. “There is still no word on the export quotas,” the spokesman said. China has by far only allowed state refiners such as PetroChina, Sinopec Corp, China National Offshore Oil Company and China National Aviation Fuel Company. to export the fuel under a quota management system.

2019,Bulgarian soccer chief quits in racism row,"SOFIA (Reuters) - The president of the Bulgarian Football Union (BFU) stepped down on Tuesday after the prime minister urged him to quit following racist abuse from Bulgarian fans towards black English players during their Euro 2020 qualifier. Prime Minister Boyko Borissov called for former goalkeeper Borislav Mihaylov to step down after Monday’s match was temporarily halted by the referee to tackle abuse from the crowd. “Today, the president of the Bulgarian Football Union Borislav Mihailov submitted his resignation, which will be presented to the members of the Executive Committee at the meeting on Friday,” the BFU said in a statement. “His position is a consequence of recent tensions: an environment that is detrimental to Bulgarian football and the Bulgarian Football Union.” The BFU announcement came only a couple of hours after a BFU spokesman said that Mihaylov would not resign because the state had no right to interfere in football. “The football union cannot be held responsible for the hooliganism of a group of people,” BFU’s spokesman Hristo Zapryanov had said earlier. Racist abuse cast a blight over the match at the Vasil Levski national stadium as the game was twice halted by the referee after monkey noises and chants from the crowd were aimed at black English players. A group of black-clad Bulgarian fans, some of whom were making right-wing salutes, were moved from an area behind the dugout at the stadium with home team captain Ivelin Popov appealing to the supporters in a heated discussion at halftime. The 56-year-old Mihaylov, part of Bulgarian team that reached the semi-finals at the 1994 World Cup in the United States, had been BFU president since 2005 when he replaced long-serving Ivan Slavkov, who was expelled from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) following allegations of corruption. Former Reading keeper Mihaylov, who also played at the World Cup finals in 1986 and 1998 as well as the European championship in 1996, has been heavily criticised by Bulgarian media and fans for failing to lead the BFU out of years of corruption and controversy. Bulgaria have failed to qualify for a major tournament since 2004 while Mihaylov’s tenure has been marred by cronyism allegations. There have been widespread reports of match-fixing in Bulgaria in recent years but little in the way of progress in holding anyone accountable. “After many years spent in the post and with his many contacts at a high international level, Mr. Mihailov expresses his firm readiness to continue to help the development of Bulgarian football in every way possible,” BFU said in a statement.

2019,Bayer expects significant surge in number of U.S. glyphosate cases,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Bayer expects the number of claims in the United States related to Roundup herbicide to have surged in the third quarter, as the German drugs and pesticides maker tries to reach a settlement after earlier court rulings against it. “With the substantial increase in plaintiff advertising this year, we expect to see a significant surge in the number of plaintiff filings over the third quarter,” the company said in a written statement. Bayer, which acquired Roundup and other glyphosate-based weed killers as part of its $63 billion takeover of Monsanto last year, faces potentially heavy litigation costs as plaintiffs claim Roundup causes cancer, something Bayer disputes. Bayer’s shares have lost about 30% of their value since last August when a California jury in the first such lawsuit found Monsanto should have warned of the alleged cancer risks. The drugmaker said in July that the number of U.S. plaintiffs in the litigation had risen to 18,400 and it is due to provide an update on Oct. 30, along with quarterly earnings. Analysts at JP Morgan, citing an analysis of Missouri court data, said in an Oct. 9 research note that the total number of glyphosate cases could rise to more than 45,000. However, several lawsuits have been delayed recently as mediator Ken Feinberg tries to negotiate a settlement. The increase “may reflect a campaign by plaintiffs’ lawyers and lead generators to increase the volume of plaintiffs as quickly as possible in connection with that process,” Bayer said, adding that the number of plaintiffs was not an indication of the merits of these cases. Bayer has previously said that cases where lawyers expect to win the highest damages tend to be filed first. The head of Bayer’s Crop Science unit, Liam Condon, already flagged a likely increase in the number of cases in a newspaper interview earlier this month, citing the prospect of a settlement and lawyers’ efforts to recruit new plaintiffs via media campaigns. Bayer, which says regulators and extensive research have found glyphosate to be safe, has previously said it was banking on U.S. appeals courts to reverse or tone down three initial court rulings that have so far awarded tens of millions of dollars to each plaintiff.

2019,Ripe for a fall: private equity debt rush stokes bond market fears,"LONDON (Reuters) - A growing number of private equity firms are taking advantage of Europe’s buoyant bond market to extract money from companies they hold by loading them with debt, prompting some investors to warn the fixed income rally is nearing its peak. Several private equity-backed companies have issued bonds backing “dividend recapitalizations” in recent weeks — a term that refers to the contentious practice of a companies issuing debt to pay dividends to the owner. Britain’s Pinewood Studios, owned by Aermont Capital, and Spanish gaming company Cirsa, owned by Blackstone, both issued debt to undertake dividend recaps in September, raising 500 million pounds ($625.4 million) and 375 million euros ($413.1 million) respectively. Elsewhere, Switzerland’s Salt and Greece’s Wind Hellas issued debt which included language allowing for the proceeds to be used for dividend payments. There has been 3.33 billion euros of dividend recap-related issuance this year so far, according to data provider 9fin, over three times the 2018 figure. (GRAPHIC - ""Dividend recapitalisation"" issuance builds up again: here) The deal structure has courted controversy in the past, with critics accusing private equity firms of piling debt onto their subsidiaries for personal gain and making them more vulnerable in the future. The 2014 collapse of British high street retail firm Phones4U was blamed partly on the company issuing 200 million pounds of debt to pay a dividend to owner BC Partners just a year earlier. <reut.rs/2Mv7HN6> Private equity executives say that as a structure it is no different to any company paying a dividend rather than investing in the business. But portfolio managers who cover this market said the return of these deals has left them uneasy, with one high-yield bond fund manager saying he has been switching out of bonds in recent weeks. “It is a controversial structure that usually means the bond market has peaked,” he said. The jump in debt-funded dividend recapitalizations offer warnings that the fixed income cycle might be about to turn. Firstly, investors are turning to such risky instruments because yield is so hard to find elsewhere. However, the fact that yields have been squeezed so much — in some cases into negative territory — is a sign that the next move may be downward for fixed income prices, which move inversely with yields. Such a warning light flashed in the run-up to the financial crisis. In 2007 dividend recaps were booming - with more than 20 billion euros worth in Europe that year, mainly issued through loans, according to S&P Global Intelligence. A year later the crisis exploded and the structure lost traction, slowing re-emerging only in 2011. There are also more recent examples of a rise in dividend recaps in European bond markets followed by a sell-off. In late 2017, there was 4.69 billion euros of dividend recap issuance in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2017 alone, according to 9fin. This proved to be the top of that particular run in European junk bonds, with the average yield on Markit’s iBoxx euro-denominated high-yield bond index rising over 70 basis points in the last six weeks of 2017, and continuing to climb all the way through 2018. (GRAPHIC - European junk bond yields: here) Charles Diebel, head of fixed income strategy at Mediolanum Asset Management, agreed an uptick in deals such as dividend recaps is usually a sign of a bond market peak. “Whether it’s right to call a widening of spreads now, I’m not sure, but we are clearly entering a period where the risk of idiosyncratic factors triggering a negative turn in markets is high,” he said. The bond market has rallied across the board and yields have dropped to unprecedented levels in 2019, as the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank ramp up stimulus in the face of a potential economic slowdown. With over a third of the European corporate bond market now in negative-yielding territory, according to Tradeweb, dividend recap deals have stepped up. However, those central bank actions to shore up the economy highlight another factor that is pushing interest in dividend recaps — that despite soaring fixed income valuations, underlying market sentiment is still very shaky. “There is clearly a continued major concern for stressed and distressed credits and lack of willingness (from banks) to underwrite there,” said Fraser Lundie, head of credit at Hermes. “In this type of environment if you’re coming across a repeat issuer where you’ve done the work, you already know the management, the decision to invest is an easy one,” he said. A credit analyst who works for a firm that bought Cirsa’s bond said knowledge of the company helped in their decision, but acknowledged that it didn’t mean she wasn’t worried about the structure in general. “People are worried at the moment, so it’s not ‘oh, everything will be great’, but these sillinesses happen because they can’t find yield,” she said. A Blackstone spokesperson declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Private equity firms also show interest in dividend recapitalizations in anticipation of future fundraising pitches to their own investors, says Tanneguy De Carne, head of financial sponsor coverage UK, Nordics & Benelux at Societe Generale. “They need to demonstrate they can monetise investments. For them a recapitalization is a demonstration that their investment thesis is correct; they can take money off the table without damaging value,” he said.

Economists expect China’s growth has slowed to near its lowest since 1990 because of the escalating trade conflict with the United States and weakening domestic demand. That slowdown appears to be deepening despite a weakening currency and steps by Beijing to provide stimulus, including cuts in taxes and fees equivalent to about $282 billion. China’s third-quarter GDP is expected to grow 6.1%, according to a Reuters poll. Some analysts expect growth to have dipped beneath 6% for the quarter, below the bottom of the government’s growth target for 2019. Below are six indicators pointing to the state of China’s slowdown. (Graphic: Employment - here) While China’s official unemployment rate has remained steady, signs have emerged that sluggish domestic demand and trade friction with the United States have triggered increased layoffs in the country’s manufacturing sector. An employment-tracking component of the Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) - a snapshot of conditions in the sector - has been trending sharply lower since last year. The August reading slipped below 47 for the first time since the global financial crisis. A reading below 50 indicates that firms are hiring fewer employees. (Graphic: Electrical machinery exports - here) Outbound shipments of electrical machinery began to contract at the end of last year. That contrasted with double-digit growth for most of 2018. For 2019, exports have been falling, reflecting the toll U.S.-imposed tariffs are taking on Chinese manufacturers. The fall in September exports was the steepest in almost 10 months, excluding the February reading, which was distorted by seasonal factors. Even a cheaper yuan CNY=CFXS has failed to arrest the decline in exports. The Chinese currency has dropped 12% against the dollar since the trade war erupted early last year. (Graphic: Rail freight - here Annual growth in the volume of freight delivered over China’s more than 100,000 kilometers of railway lines has tapered each month since end-2017 as domestic demand has softened. Compared with the double-digit percentage monthly gains previously, railway freight has mostly eased to single-digit growth or even outright declines. The slowdown has come despite a reduction - or in some cases a cancellation - of freight charges by state-run China Railway Corp in April this year to support the economy. Rail freight was said to be one gauge of economic growth favored by Premier Li Keqiang when he was the Communist Party secretary of northeastern Liaoning province in the mid-2000s. (Graphic: Electricity generation - here) China’s electric power industry, the world’s largest, is a key gauge of the activity in the country’s industrial sector. Growth in electricity generation has slowed visibly since the second half of last year to the lowest in three years. Accounting for almost a third of GDP, Chinese industry has come under pressure as the Sino-U.S. trade war has disrupted supply chains. (Graphic: Auto sales - here) China’s car sales declined last year for the first time since the 1990s. In September, sales of autos, which account for about a tenth of all retail sales, fell for a 15th straight month, dampening hopes for any quick turnaround in the world’s largest auto market. Besides autos, Chinese consumers are scaling back purchases on everything from smartphones to furniture, as income growth slows and debt levels creep higher. Consumer spending accounts for over 60% of China’s economy. (Graphic: Box office revenue - here) China’s 2018 movie box office revenue slowed from a year earlier, growing just 9% to the equivalent of $8.6 billion. That compared with nearly 13.5% growth in 2017. The slowdown in the world’s second-largest film market after the United States has further deepened this year as consumers tightened spending. Box office revenue last month slipped to the lowest since September 2018, according to Reuters calculations based on daily statistics provided by the official China Movie Data Information Network.

2019,Former President Carter hospitalized with broken pelvis after fall,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter has been hospitalized with a minor pelvic fracture after a fall on Monday night, the Carter Center said on Tuesday, the second such accident this month for the nation’s oldest living president. Carter fell at his home in Plains, Georgia, the center said in a post on Twitter, but added, “he is in good spirits and is looking forward to recovering at home.” For now, he is being observed and treated at the Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in nearby Americus, Georgia, for observation and treatment, it said. Carter, 95, fell at his home earlier this month and required stitches to his face, but resumed work soon after on a homebuilding project for the nonprofit group Habitat for Humanity. In May, the Democrat broke his hip, again at his home, requiring surgery. He was hospitalized briefly in 2017 for dehydration and was diagnosed with skin cancer in 2015. Carter, a former peanut farmer and Georgia governor, was the nation’s 39th president and served one term from 1977 to 1981. After his presidency, Carter went on to become an international fixture and a noted humanitarian. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his efforts toward finding peaceful solutions to international conflicts, advancing democracy and human rights, and promoting economic and social development. He and his wife, Rosalynn, founded the Carter Center in 1982 to carry on their international and humanitarian work. Reporting by Susan Heavey; Editing by Bernadette Baum",Reuters
2019,Jolie and Pfeiffer battle for power in 'Maleficent' sequel,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The sequel to Walt Disney Co’s 2014 hit “Maleficent,” which begins rolling out in global theaters on Wednesday, puts three women at the center of a fight for control between humans and fairies. Angelina Jolie stars in “Maleficent: Mistress of Evil” as the titular villain and dark fairy godmother to Aurora, the queen of the fairies played by Elle Fanning. When Aurora becomes engaged to the human Prince Phillip, the pending marriage brings Maleficent in conflict with Aurora’s future mother-in-law, Queen Ingrith, who is played by Michelle Pfeiffer. It is the rare Hollywood movie where men are in secondary roles. “They’re just not the focus” in this film, Pfeiffer told Reuters in an interview. Chiwetel Ejiofor, in the role of a mysterious figure named Conall, said the movie plays with many of the traditional narratives typical to fairy tales. “There’s like 100 tropes that are exploded in this film,” Ejiofor said. “Seeing those explored in different ways, I think is very exciting.” The sequel reflects the message of the original, which urged people not to judge a book by its cover or to attach labels to others that ostracize them. The sequel amplifies the look with more fantastical creatures and more intricate costumes. “You try that little bit harder to say ‘We’ve got to give them something better or we’ve got to give them something a little more fun,” said Jolie, who also acted as a producer of the film, “or this would make a better Halloween costume for the kids.” Reporting by Rollo Ross in Los Angeles; Writing by Lisa Richwine; Editing by Matthew Lewis",Reuters
2019,EU countries stop short of arms embargo for Turkey,"LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - European Union countries committed on Monday to suspending arms exports to Turkey, but stopped short of the EU-wide arms embargo that France and Germany had sought.

2019,British PM pushes for Brexit deal vote after being forced to seek delay,"* Britain’s Boris Johnson seeks vote on his deal * UK PM forced to ask for Brexit delay * European Union plays for time By Alistair Smout and Guy Faulconbridge LONDON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will try to put his Brexit deal to a vote in parliament on Monday after he was forced by his opponents to send a letter seeking a delay from the European Union. With just 10 days left until the United Kingdom is due to leave the EU on Oct. 31, the divorce is again in disarray as Britain’s political class argue over whether to leave with a deal, exit without a deal or hold another referendum. Johnson was ambushed by opponents in parliament on Saturday who demanded a change to the sequencing of the ratification of the deal, exposing the prime minister to a law which demanded he request a delay until Jan. 31. In a twist that illustrates the extent to which Brexit has strained the norms of British statecraft, Johnson sent the note to the EU unsigned - and added another signed letter arguing against what he cast as a deeply corrosive delay. “A further extension would damage the interests of the UK and our EU partners, and the relationship between us,” Johnson said his own letter, signed “Boris Johnson”. The British government insisted on Sunday the country will leave the EU on Oct. 31, and plans to put the deal to a vote in parliament later on Monday though it is unclear if the House of Commons speaker will allow such a vote. The government has proposed a debate on the deal, according to the House of Commons order paper which says the speaker will make a statement on the proceedings shortly after parliament opens at 1330 GMT. The EU, which has grappled with the tortuous Brexit crisis since Britons voted 52%-48% to leave in a 2016 referendum, was clearly bewildered by the contradictory signals from London. It was unlikely that the EU’s 27 remaining member states would refuse Britain’s request to delay once again its departure, given the impact on all parties of a no-deal Brexit. Sterling, which has rallied more than 6% since Oct. 10, slid from five-month highs on Monday. It hit as low as $1.2850 in Asian trading before settling around $1.2920 in London, down 0.5% on the day. Goldman Sachs raised the probability of the United Kingdom leaving with a ratified deal to 70% from 65%, cut its view of the chances of a ‘no-deal’ Brexit to 5% from 10% and left its view on no Brexit at all unchanged at 25%.

2019,October brings losses for short sellers in U.S. opioid-related shares,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - October has been a rough month for short sellers betting against companies at the heart of the opioid crisis, although those traders still have paper profits of almost $600 million for the year, according to data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners. The data from S3 analyzed changes in short interest and profits related to shares of eight companies named in U.S. opioid litigation. In October, short sellers registered $324 million in mark-to-market losses from those shares. But for the year, they have still gained $593 million in mark-to-market profits. The list includes U.S. shares of drugmakers Mallinckrodt Plc, Endo International Plc and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, drug distributors Cardinal Health Inc, McKesson Corp and AmerisourceBergen Corp, pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc and healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson. Of those companies, only Johnson & Johnson’s shares have yielded mark-to-market profits for short sellers so far this month. October’s losses for short sellers of opioid-related shares comes as several of the companies attempt to settle litigation against them. AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health, McKesson and Teva agreed with two Ohio counties to a $260 million deal, averting a federal trial that was to begin on Monday. The parties could resume talks as soon as Tuesday aimed at a broader settlement of thousands of opioid lawsuits brought by states and local governments. The news of steps towards a broader settlement boosted Teva’s U.S.-listed shares, which rose 8.7% on Monday. Despite recent losses, short interest remains elevated among shares of several opioid-related companies. Some 58% of Mallinckrodt’s floating shares have been sold short, while 20% of Endo’s floating shares have been sold short. Across the group of eight companies, short interest has grown by $1.8 billion this year despite $71.3 million of short covering in October. “It might be a slight pull off the throttle,” said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, of short sellers in shares of opioid-related companies. “They’re adjusting temporarily until they see what’s happening with the lawsuits.” Reporting by April Joyner; Editing by Lisa Shumaker",Reuters
2019,British protesters lampoon the 'Lucifer' of Brexit and his billionaire backers,"LONDON (Reuters) - Anti-Brexit protesters used a bizarre array of humour on Saturday to lampoon Britain’s leaders, casting Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s chief adviser as a manipulating devil behind an EU divorce they view as the work of a privileged few. The battle over Brexit spilled onto the streets of London when hundreds of thousands of people gathered to demand a new referendum while lawmakers decided the fate of Britain’s departure from the European Union. Many turned to sometimes risqué British humour and their props ranged from exquisitely crafted effigies to battered empty boxes and a baguette. Dominic Cummings, cast by his enemies variously as the puppet master of Brexit, Britain’s Rasputin or a political vandal, was made into a giant effigy of the devil, complete with horns and brandishing a glove puppet of his boss, Johnson. “Demonic Cummings” was scrawled across the head of the effigy, pulled by protesters, some with berets sporting the stars of the European Union flag. Another sign read: “I didn’t vote for Dominic Cummings”. Other targets were the privileged financial backers of Brexit. “Brexit is a billionaire con,” read one banner. “Brexit = Disaster Capitalism” read another. Under the slogan “Eton Mess” one placard showed former Prime Minister David Cameron and Johnson, both of whom studied at Britain’s most privileged school - Eton College. Eton Mess is the name of a British dessert made of smashed meringue, strawberries and whipped cream. Cameron and Johnson were cast as “Horror and Lardy” in the pose of historic comedians Laurel and Hardy, complete with bowler hats. In 2016, 17.4 million voters, or 52%, backed Brexit while 16.1 million, or 48%, backed staying in the EU. Both campaigns were supported by wealthy backers. Sex, of course, was one topic employed on Saturday, as peculiarly, were vegetables and fruit. “Brexit is like consent - we can change our minds during foreplay,” read one placard. “Pulling out never works,” read another. One man was dressed as broccoli while another was dressed as a banana with a sign: “We are ripe for change.” Younger and older demonstrators drew attention to the fact that Britain’s youth had overwhelming voted to remain in 2016, unlike the older generation. “I’m here ‘cos my grandad voted leave,” read one sign. “To my grandson, if Brexit still happens I’m so sorry, we tried our best,” read another sign. “I was 17 in 2016, give me a vote on my future!” demanded one protester. Children marched with their parents holding simple crayon placards, asking to remain citizens of the European Union. Other protesters made light of the fact that “remainers” have been portrayed as out-of-touch posh and wealthy residents of London and the southeast. “I tried to make this sign funny but there’s no bigger joke than Brexit”, read another placard.

Syromolotov, who said only the Russian and Iranian militaries had the legal right to be in Syria, made the comments as President Vladimir Putin held talks in southern Russia with his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan. Syromolotov was also quoted as saying he expected the Putin-Erdogan meeting to clarify who controlled oil-rich parts of northeast Syria. Reporting by Tom Balmforth; Editing by Andrew Osborn",Reuters
2019,South Africa's Zuma to appeal decision he must face graft charges,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Former South African president Jacob Zuma will appeal a high court decision to deny him a permanent stay of prosecution on charges related to a $2 billion arms deal, his lawyers said on Tuesday. Zuma, in office from 2009-2018, had applied for the stay of prosecution for alleged fraud, racketeering and money laundering relating to the deal to buy European military equipment for South Africa’s armed forces in the 1990s. On Friday the Pietermaritzburg High Court dismissed the application by Zuma and his co-accused, French arms company Thales. “Mr Zuma elects to exercise the full extent of his constitutional rights, which includes the right to appeal (this) ... decision,” Zuma’s lawyer, Thabani Masuku, told the court, where pre-trial proceedings were set to start. Zuma’s lawyers and state prosecutors had agreed to provisionally set down Feb. 4, 2020 as a trial start date. But State prosecutor Billy Downer said the state intended to oppose the appeal, potentially delaying any trial deep into 2020. Ousted by the ruling African National Congress in February 2018 after two terms in power marked by corruption allegations and economic stagnation, Zuma has claimed the charges are a politically motivated conspiracy. He repeated the claim during testimony at a judicial corruption inquiry July as well as in his few public appearances to rally his supporters. Outside court on Tuesday, Zuma ascended a mobile stage to a chorus of ululations and his campaign song, telling the crowd of a couple of hundred that he deserved a clear explanation of why his stay of prosecution application was denied. “I’m used to this kind of treatment but I don’t want to say too much,” Zuma told the crowd. “When you are a black person in this country you will be attacked and mistreated all the way to the grave.” Reporting by Mfuneko Toyana; additional reporting by Nqobile Dludla; editing by John Stonestreet and Giles Elgood",Reuters

2019,"Google unveils Pixel 4 phones with radar, more affordable laptop","NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO/BERLIN (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google unveiled new Pixel smartphones with higher quality cameras, a radar sensor to track hand gestures and faster virtual assistant on Tuesday, but the devices had no surprise features to set them apart from rivals and nix concerns about price. The Pixel 4 phones, in two sizes, headlined a New York press event at which Google also announced its first moderately priced laptop, first wireless earbuds and upgrades to its to well-reviewed Wifi router and burger-sized smart speaker. Google started developing hardware about four years ago, wagering that it could introduce artificial intelligence into devices faster and better than rivals and that consumers would clamor for such features. The strategy has generated mixed results. But the world’s largest search company is pushing forward, not wanting to cede ground to Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O) and other competitors which are investing in hardware to make users spend more time on their services. Google’s lower-priced devices have been top sellers, but are far from being major profit drivers. Higher-priced devices, such as the Pixel phones, have gained little traction versus those of industry leaders such as Samsung Electronics Co (005930.KS) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) because of limited marketing and stiff competition. Consumers are also holding on to their devices for much longer. People are “starting to look for more affordable smartphone options instead of going for a high-end, premium smartphones for (over) $800,” said Maurice Klaehne, a devices analyst at technology market researcher Counterpoint. That has been good news for the Pixel 3a, which launched in May starting at $399, he said. It will remain available in the dozen countries such as Japan and Germany where the Pixel 4 will go on sale. India, where the Pixel 3a is on sale, has yet to approve the Pixel 4’s radar chip. The Pixel 3a boosted Google’s smartphone sales to 4.1 million in the first half of 2019, compared to 4.7 million for all of 2018, technology research company IDC said. Still, Google accounted for under 1% of smartphones shipped during the second quarter, according to IDC. Google’s product rollouts have been slow and deliberate, but the company has said that just having the devices in the market has been good for its brand. The fourth-generation Pixel starts at $799 for a 5.7-inch (14.5-cm) display and $899 for a 6.3-inch display, and for the first time all four major U.S. wireless carriers will offer the smartphones, beginning Oct. 24. A new feature based on radar technology enables users to skip songs or issue other commands by waving their hands above the screen. The phones include a telephoto lens and improved software to take photos of the night sky. Google Assistant has been deeply integrated into the device to reduce response times. Sherry Lin, a Pixel product manager, said Google tested adding 5G network technology but found that it “just didn’t work very well if trees and buildings got in the way.” “We are working with carriers and need them to put in the infrastructure before we pass on the cost (of the new technology) to everyone else,” Lin said. The new 13.3-inch touchscreen Pixelbook Go laptop, starting at $649, features a textured bottom panel, meant to make it easier to grip with one hand while working in transit. It follows the Pixelbook, which debuted in 2017 with a starting price of $999. It has barely made a dent on the market, to the point that some researchers do not track it. Google slashed costs for Pixelbook Go by shifting to magnesium from aluminum for the laptop exterior and removing hinges and wiring that enabled the prior model to be used like a tablet, product leaders Ben Janofsky and Matt Vokoun said in an interview. It also improved the design of components such as the trackpad to cut manufacturing mishaps and therefore costs. But the company still included a 15% larger battery and reduced the overall weight of the device to 2.3 lb (1.04 kg) from 2.4 lb. Pre-orders for the Pixelbook Go, which runs Google’s ChromeOS operating system, began Tuesday in the United States and Canada. Google also announced Pixel Buds, a set of wireless earbuds with hands-free access to Google Assistant launching next spring in the United States for $179.

2019,Volvo Cars aims to be climate neutral by 2040,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Volvo Cars, owned by China’s Geely Holding, is targeting a 40% reduction in the carbon footprint of each car it manufactures by 2025 as it bids to become fully climate neutral by 2040, it said in a statement on Wednesday. The company aims to reach the 2025 targets through a string of measures, including generating 50% of global sales from fully electric cars and having a 25% share of recycled plastics in new vehicles by that time, both of which have been previously announced. It is also aiming for a 25% cut in carbon dioxide emissions related to its global supply chain and its overall operations, including manufacturing and logistics, by 2025. “At Volvo Cars we will address what we control, which is both our operations and the tailpipe emissions of our cars,” Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson said in a statement. “And we will address what we can influence, by calling on our suppliers and the energy sector to join us in aiming for a climate neutral future.” Volvo also said it aims for its global manufacturing network to be fully climate neutral by 2025.

2019,Currency hit to North American companies' results stays above $20 billion,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The negative effect of currency fluctuations on North American companies’ second-quarter results eased slightly from the preceding quarter but remained at a historically elevated level, according to data from treasury and financial management firm Kyriba on Thursday. The collective exchange rate impact, including on companies in the United States, Canada and Mexico, was $21.01 billion, Kyriba said in a report. This was less than the $23.39 billion negative effect in the first quarter, but marks the third straight quarter that the hit has totaled more than $20 billion, the longest such streak in more than a decade. “What’s interesting about this is we continue to have this trend of north of $20 billion three quarters in a row. We have not seen that since we started this research in 2008-09,” Wolfgang Koester, senior strategy officer of Kyriba, said. “We’ve also never had a $44 billion loss for the start of a year since we’ve been reporting it.” Kyriba, which acquired currency risk consulting firm FIREapps earlier this year, said 291 North American companies reported negative currency impacts in the second quarter, roughly the same as in recent quarters. A stronger dollar can hurt large U.S. companies that derive much of their revenue from abroad as they repatriate foreign earnings. At the end of the second quarter, the U.S. dollar had risen nearly 3% against the euro from a year earlier. EUR= Investors have favored the dollar for many months, thanks to relatively high U.S. interest rates and a strong economy.

2019,Apple's Cook meets China regulator after pulling Hong Kong app,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook met the chief of China’s market regulator in Beijing on Thursday, the Chinese agency said, a week after the U.S. firm was thrust into political tensions between the mainland and protesters in Hong Kong. Apple last week removed from its app store an app that helped Hong Kong protesters track police movements after a Chinese state newspaper sharply criticized it for allowing the software. The company said the app, HKmap.live, was used to target the police. Cook had defended the removal in the face of criticism for appeasing mainland China, telling Apple workers that “this decision best protects our users”. China’s State Administration for Market Regulation said in a statement on its website that its chief, Xiao Yaqing, and Cook discussed topics including Apple expanding investment in China, consumer rights protection and fulfilling corporate social responsibility. It did not give more details. Cook was in Beijing for an annual meeting at Tsinghua University, where he serves on an advisory board alongside executives from other companies. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China is a key market for Apple. Apple’s smartphone market share fell to 5.8% in the June quarter from 6.4% in the same period a year ago, according to research firm Canalys, as China’s homegrown Huawei Technologies Co Ltd became the dominant smartphone seller. Cook’s meeting Thursday came as China prepares to host the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen in China’s eastern Zhejiang province. The event in the past has attracted overseas company executives, foreign diplomats and Chinese government officials. It was not immediately clear if Cook would be a participant at the conference this year. He last attended the event in 2017.

2019,"Raiders OT Brown accused of domestic violence, sued","Oakland Raiders offensive lineman Trent Brown is facing a civil lawsuit from the mother of his child, who is accusing him of domestic violence. The woman, identified as Diorra Marzette-Sanders, said Brown “bruised, bloodied and battered” her on numerous occasions over the past two years. The woman began dating the 6-foot-8, 380-pound tackle in March 2017, and their child was born in January 2019, according to the lawsuit, which was filed in Alameda County Superior Court in California. Also described is an incident in which Marzette-Sanders claims that when she told Brown, 26, she was leaving and taking their child, he said he would “shoot yo ass in the f—-ing head before you walk out that door with my son.” According to the lawsuit, he kicked the woman out of the house they shared in June. The lawsuit is requesting a jury trial and seeking unspecified compensation, including punitive damages. Brown could face punishment for the NFL if he is found to be in violation of the league’s personal conduct policy. “We attempted to get this matter resolved amicably,” Marzette-Sanders’ lawyer Waukeen McCoy told USA Today Sports, “and we were unsuccessful.” The 49ers selected Brown in the seventh round of the 2015 NFL Draft, and he played three seasons with San Francisco before being traded to the New England Patriots.

In what was to be their second attempt at listing in just over a year, KKR, Deutsche Bank and Varde Partners, decided to cancel the expected A$1 billion ($676.20 million) offering on Tuesday, because a large proportion of demand for shares was coming from hedge funds rather than desired long-term investors, the sources said.

2019,Scorsese says he wanted to 'enrich' past De Niro work with 'The Irishman',"LONDON (Reuters) - Martin Scorsese reunites with Robert De Niro in “The Irishman”, a 3-1/2 hour long mob drama the acclaimed director said he chose to do with his frequent collaborator to build on their past work together rather than replicate it. Set over several decades, “The Irishman” looks at a Pennsylvania organized crime family with Oscar winners De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci in the main roles. The Netflix movie, which closes the BFI London Film Festival on Sunday, uses digital de-ageing technology to show the characters in their 30s and 40s. De Niro, Pesci and Pacino are all in their 70s. The project is Scorsese’s and De Niro’s latest collaboration following acclaimed works like “Taxi Driver”, “Raging Bull”, “Goodfellas” and “Casino”. “I was really looking for something with Bob (De Niro) to enrich more or less where we had gone in the ‘70s and the ‘80s and the early ‘90s,” Scorsese told a news conference. “To just replicate what we had been trying to do at the beginning of our careers wouldn’t be enriching in any way.” The film, which runs just short of 3-1/2 hours, begins with elderly narrator Frank Sheeran, played by De Niro, recounting his life. Told in flashbacks, the audience sees him as a soldier, truck driver and eventually mob hitman after meeting organized crime boss Russell Bufalino, played by Pesci. The plot, based on Charles Brandt’s book “I Heard You Paint Houses”, is tied to the disappearance of former U.S. Teamsters union boss Jimmy Hoffa, portrayed by Pacino in his first Scorsese collaboration. “I’d known Marty and Bob a very long time so when Bob ... called me ... it sounded really interesting and the opportunity to work with them was very important to me,” Pacino said. “For years, we almost worked together Marty and I.” The film, which has won rave reviews from critics touting it an Oscar contender, will have a limited theatrical run before and after its Nov. 27 Netflix release. “The original conception of what a film is and where it’s to be seen has now changed so radically,” Scorsese said. “Something that should always be protected as much as possible ... is a communal experience and I think that’s best in the theater. Now homes are becoming theaters too, it’s a major change and I think one has to keep an open mind.” The 76-year-old reiterated his comparison of superhero flicks to “theme park” films, where he said “theaters become amusement parks”. “That’s a different experience ... it’s not cinema it’s something else whether you go for that or not ... and we shouldn’t be invaded by it.” Asked about watching younger versions of themselves, Pacino who described the de-ageing effects as “a form of make-up”, said: “This whole thing is innovative of course but at the same time, you tell a story, and in the end I’m a little more concerned about that.” At a festival talk on Friday, De Niro reflected on his illustrious career, shared acting tips and renewed his criticism of U.S. President Donald Trump. “I enjoy movies, I like the fact that ... they last forever,” De Niro said, adding he hoped to be remembered “favorably”.

2019,UniCredit to apply negative rates only on deposits over 1 million euros,"MILAN (Reuters) - UniCredit (CRDI.MI) will only apply negative rates to customer deposits of more than 1 million euros ($1.1 million), the Italian bank said on Monday, clarifying comments by its CEO last week which drew angry reactions from unions and consumer groups. European banks are grappling with the consequences of the European Central Bank’s September decision to cut its key deposit rate further into negative territory, making it tough for banks to earn money from their traditional lending business. UniCredit Chief Executive Jean Pierre Mustier last week said the bank was working on measures to pass on the European Central Bank’s negative rates to customers holding more than 100,000 euros in their accounts. Italian banking unions were critical of Mustier’s announcement which they described as “reckless”. Consumer group Codacons said it would fight banks in the courts that planned to hit customers with negative returns on deposits. A UniCredit spokesman said the negative rates would only apply to clients with more than 1 million euros in their bank accounts, meaning less than 0.1% of the bank’s client base. And customers will be offered a number of alternatives. “We will offer as an alternative investments in money market funds targeting positive returns, with no fees charged,” the spokesman said. “For ... deposits with a balance in excess of the 1 million euro threshold, ad hoc measures will be discussed with clients to take into account the extraordinary changes in the macroeconomic environment.” Mustier, speaking in his capacity as Chairman of the European Banking Federation earlier this month, urged the ECB to take action to reduce the impact of negative interest rates on banks, recommending general charges for cash deposits. Italy has high levels of private savings, where people have been increasing current account deposits this year to reach 1.17 trillion euros in August, according to Italy’s central bank. Banks in Italy are currently free to charge for cash deposits, but most avoid doing so, fearing depositors would transfer their savings to other lenders. Italian banks are taking countermeasures against negative rates through fees, Banca Generali (BGN.MI) CEO Gian Maria Mossa said in an interview published on Monday. “UniCredit had the courage to stir up a debate which was already taking place abroad, for example in Switzerland ... (but) I don’t think in the end single banks will apply negative rates,” he told daily La Stampa. UBS (UBSG.S) in July said it would impose from November a negative interest rate of 0.75% on wealthy clients who deposit more than 2 million Swiss francs ($2 million) with its Swiss bank. In Denmark, which was among the first countries to introduce negative rates, Spar Nord (SPNO.CO) said earlier this month it would impose negative rates on large deposits by private clients, making it the third Danish bank to do.

2019,Loosened lending rules in Hong Kong stoke optimism for small apartment sales,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Relaxed mortgage rules in Hong Kong that allow buyers to take on bigger loans will drive small-to-medium flat sales, property agents say, with the changes already prompting some sales. Hong Kong’s leader Carrie Lam on Wednesday expanded borrowers’ power by reducing the size of down payments required for home purchases as part of a slew of measures aimed at alleviating the city’s housing shortage. Under the Mortgage Insurance Programme, borrowers can carry a loan-to-value ratio (LTV) as high as 90% on properties worth up to HK$8 million ($1 million). Before, such a high ratio was only permitted on properties worth half as much. Borrowers can get an LTV of 80% on properties worth as much as HK$10 million, previously capped at HK$6 million. This means prospective home buyers will not need so much money up front; for example, the down payment on an HK$8 million home will fall to HK$800,000 from HK$3.2 million. “Last evening, our agents sold three apartments in Fanling (in the New Territories), which was a lot because there haven’t been 3 transactions for a whole month,” said Centaline Property Agency Asia Pacific residential chief executive Louis Chan. He said that the transactions ranged from HK$4 million to HK$6 million and that the buyers hastened their decision after Lam’s announcement. The sellers also cut their price by 2-3%. “The new mortgage policy will help the secondary market for flats below HK$10 million,” Chan said. “In the last 8 years the demand for this segment has been suppressed by the restrictive policies and the transaction volumes have been very low.” Previously, buyers were more likely to consider new homes, for which developers provided high LTV loans. Sammy Po, residential chief executive of property agency Midland Hong Kong, said that about 10% of sellers of apartments valued below HK$8 million were raising their price by 3-5%, and that he expected a 2-3% price rise in small to mid-sized apartments in the fourth quarter. Property developers plan to push out new launches faster on the news, with China Evergrande Group (3333.HK) expected to release the price list for its new development this week. Midland’s Chan, however, stuck with his original forecast of a 5% decline in home prices over the rest of the year, as the current protests and trade tensions between the U.S. and China weigh on the market.

2019,Police free nearly 150 from school in northern Nigeria,"KADUNA (Reuters) - Police said on Saturday they had freed nearly 150 students from a purported school in northern Nigeria that claimed it was teaching the Koran but had instead subjected them to abuse. It was the fourth such operation in a month and brings the total released from religious schools in northern Nigeria to more than 1,000. The raid will put more pressure on President Muhammadu Buhari to take action on loosely regulated Islamic schools called Almajiris, which experts say teach millions of children across the mainly Muslim north of the country. Kaduna state governor Nasir El Rufai ordered the raid on the Islamic reform school in Rigasa, officials said. The captives were gathered later at a camp nearby, standing in lines in maroon uniforms as state officials tended to them. Unlike the other schools, at least 22 of the 147 released captives were female, Hafsat Baba, Kaduna’s commissioner for human services told Reuters. The condition of those released was not immediately clear. An official told Reuters the school was owned by the same man who owned one of the schools raided in neighboring Katsina state earlier this week and had already been arrested by police. Those freed from other schools over the past month - including two this week - were chained to walls, beaten and sexually molested. At the other raided facilities, some parents thought their children would be educated and even paid tuition. Other families sent misbehaving or difficult family members and wards to them for discipline. Buhari, whose home state is Katsina, said in June that he planned to ban Almajiris eventually but would not do so right away. Buhari’s office, in a statement issued on Saturday, said “no responsible democratic government would tolerate the existence of the torture chambers and physical abuses of inmates in the name of rehabilitation of the victims.” Reporting By Garba Muhammad in Kaduna, Ahmed Kingimi in Maiduguri and Ardo Hazzard in Bauchi; Editing by Christina Fincher",Reuters
2019,UPDATE 1-Sun Capital frontrunner to buy Italy's Vetrerie Riunite-sources,"(Adds comment from VAM Investment spokesman) MILAN, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Private equity firm Sun Capital Partners is in the lead to buy Italy’s Vetrerie Riunite, two people familiar with the deal said on Monday, after VAM Investments withdrew its offer when it received no response from the glass products group. Vetrerie Riunite, which makes door glass for home appliances and also supplies the automobile and ceramics manufacturing sectors, is controlled by Italian private equity firms Opera SGR and Style Capital. Alantra is an adviser on the sale. Earlier on Monday, one of the two sources said private equity firm VAM Investments had submitted an offer last week, giving Vetrerie Riunite until Sunday evening to accept it. It received no response to the offer, the source said. “VAM Investments points out that it doesn’t intend to press ahead with an offer for Vetrerie Riunite,” a spokesperson for the Italian private equity firm told Reuters. However a second source, who is close to Vetrerie Riunite shareholders, said the company was expecting binding offers in the next few days from both Sun Capital Partners and VAM Investments, which emerged as frontrunners after a due diligence process to sell the glass door maker. Vetrerie Riunite reported revenues of 109 million euros ($120.14 million) in 2018, with a core profit of 16.4 million euros. Sun Capital Partners and Alantra both declined to comment. Vetrerie Riunite had no immediate comment. (Reporting by Elisa Anzolin; editing by James Mackenzie and Deepa Babington)",Reuters
2019,Turkey says Kurdish militia kills one soldier in northeast Syria despite ceasefire,"ANKARA, Oct 20 (Reuters) - One Turkish soldier was killed and another was wounded on Sunday after an attack by the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia in northeast Syria’s Tel Abyad, the defence ministry said, despite a deal to pause military operations as militants withdraw from the area. Turkey agreed with the United States on Thursday to pause its offensive into northeastern Syria for five days to allow the YPG to withdraw out of a planned “safe zone”. The fragile truce had so far held up. In a statement, the defence ministry said an attack by the YPG with anti-tank and light weapons had struck Turkish soldiers carrying out a reconnaissance and surveillance mission in Tel Abyad. It said the attack was retaliated, and added that Turkey remained committed to the truce deal despite the violations. (Reporting by Tuvan Gumrukcu. Editing by Jane Merriman)",Reuters

2019,France puts onus on exporters to prepare for Brexit custom checks,"PARIS (Reuters) - France has warned companies bringing goods in and out of Britain through its border after Brexit that they are responsible for making sure their paperwork is in order. French junior economy minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher said on Tuesday the government had done all it could to prepare. But, she told Reuters, French measures including a “smart” Channel border allowing trucks and others transporters to complete customs checks in advance would only go so far to help businesses if they were not ready. “We’ve put in place a fast-track border, we’ve tested it, it works,” Pannier-Runacher said. “But in a truck all of the goods have to have been pre-cleared. If something being carried by a company didn’t tick that box, it’s going to have to stop and that will be a pain.” Companies across Europe - many of which go through France by road to reach the United Kingdom - have been rushing to prepare paperwork ahead of Britain’s exit from the European Union. Uncertainty over whether it will leave without a deal on Oct. 31 has exacerbated concerns over traffic pile-ups and delays at the border, which could be particularly painful for those dealing in groceries or other perishable goods. In Britain, ferry hub Dover has said it is as ready as can be, though the port’s chief executive told Reuters there were uncertainties over the extent to which freigh operators were ready for new declarations on the French side. British government no-deal planning documents from August, known as Operation Yellowhammer, said 50-85% of lorries might not be ready for French customs. Pannier-Runacher said that within France, companies that were the most exposed to trading with the United Kingdom were largely ready and had taken other steps such as stockpiling goods. But the government had also stepped up pressure on firms to check they were well prepared, she said. “A company boss can’t just sit there, arms crossed, saying ‘I don’t understand, I can’t cross the border’,” Pannier-Runacher said. France had hired extra customs agents - beefing up staff in areas where more rigorous checks are needed for health reasons, such as food - and told ambassadors across Europe to whip companies into action, she added. “The French state has gone to considerable pains to ensure things will go as well as possible,” Pannier-Runacher said.

2019,Brazil's GPA posts 9.5% rise in third-quarter gross sales led by Assai wholesale unit,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian supermarket chain Grupo Pão de Açúcar SA (PCAR4.SA) on Wednesday reported its total gross sales grew 9.5% to 14.57 billion reais ($3.49 billion) in the third quarter as double-digit growth in wholesale unit Assai compensated for flat performance in its other segments. GPA, owned by France’s Casino Guichard Perrachon SA (CASP.PA), said Assai’s quarterly gross sales rose 18.9% to 7.587 billion reais. On a like-for-like basis, excluding calendar effects, the wholesale unit reported 3.2% growth year-on-year. In the division comprised of Pão de Açúcar, Extra and Compre Bem stores in different formats, known as “multivarejo”, gross sales hit 6.982 billion reais in quarter ended on September 30, up 0.8% from the same period in 2018. The unit’ same-store gross sales without seasonal effects grew only 0.3% in the same comparison, reflecting lower food inflation in the period and a sluggish economic scenario with still high unemployment rates. GPA said e-commerce sales grew above 30% in the third-quarter, mostly underpinned by the integration of its online platform and brick-and-mortar stores, with its delivery express and click & collect programs now present in over 100 stores. The retailer also cited positive prospects for the upcoming fourth-quarter with the expected approval of key economic reforms and the release of workers’ fund as part of a government stimulus package to foster economic recovery.

2019,Hitler satire 'Jojo Rabbit' mixes dark humor with plea for tolerance,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - New Zealand movie director Taika Waititi says he likes a challenge and his satire of Adolf Hitler and Nazi culture may be his riskiest and most successful yet. “Jojo Rabbit,” which Waititi wrote, directed and in which he plays a ridiculous Hitler, combines dark, absurdist humor with a serious plea for tolerance as an antidote to hate. The movie opens in U.S. theaters on Friday after winning the top award in September at the Toronto film festival, which has often been the proving ground for Oscar glory. It tells of a 10-year-old German boy (Jojo) toward the end of World War Two who is a Nazi fanatic and whose imaginary friend is Hitler. Filled with anti-Semitic ideas, Jocko’s world is turned upside down when he finds his mother has hidden a young Jewish girl in the attic of their home. “I was really taken by the idea of children witnessing grown-ups doing terrible things,” said Waititi, whose mother is Jewish and whose father is Maori. “We need to educate our kids about tolerance and continue to remind ourselves that there’s no place in this world for hate.” Waititi, whose work ranges from the New Zealand TV musical parody “Flight of the Conchords” to superhero movie “Thor: Ragnorak,” said he wanted the film to overturn any notion that stories about the Nazi era have had their day, especially given the worldwide rise of white nationalism. “It’s really crazy that at the end of World War Two, if you were a Nazi, you went to jail. Now it’s like, if you’re a Nazi, feel free to go to the town square and have a rally,” he said. Movie critics have called “Jojo Rabbit” both bold and divisive, despite a history of Hitler spoofs dating back to Charlie Chaplin’s “The Great Dictator” in 1940 and the 1967 Mel Brooks film “The Producers.” “I’ve always been prepared that for some people it’s still too soon to be mixing humor with this subject matter. There are one or two people who won’t see the film because they’ve had family members who’ve gone through the camps. And that’s totally fine.”But it’s so obvious what this is. You’d have to be dumb to misconstrue the message of this movie,” Waititi said. Waititi said a 2018 survey commissioned by the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany showed that 41% of Americans and 66% of U.S. millennials questioned could not say what Auschwitz was. “The fact that number is so high is staggering and shocking and simply not good enough. We are forgetting. So no, we should not stop having this conversation and making these films and talking about it. “If I have to make a film with an imaginary Hitler and a few jokes, then so be it,” he said.

2019,"AMS plans new Osram offer: Same price, lower acceptance rate","VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria’s AMS (AMS.S) plans to launch a new takeover bid for German lighting group Osram (OSRn.DE) at the same price but lowering the acceptance rate to 55%, to make its vision of becoming a global leader in sensors and lights come true. Sensor specialist AMS failed with its 4.5 billion euro ($5 billion) takeover offer for the leader in automotive lighting after a fierce takeover battle earlier this month. It collected 51.6% of Osram shares, including its own nearly 20% stake, falling short of the required 62.5%. However, it vowed to pursue the acquisition. Swiss-listed AMS, which is best known for supplying Apple (AAPL.O) with sensors for iPhones, wants to expand in the auto industry and supply manufacturers with sensors and lighting systems for self-driving cars to reduce its dependence on smartphone producers. AMS had sweetened its bid to the current 41 euros a share after private equity groups Bain Capital and Advent said they were prepared to trump the Austrian group’s initial offer of 38.50 euros. Since AMS’s offer fell through, Bain and Advent have not made any public statement. They informed Osram in a letter on Friday that they would refrain from a takeover bid for the time being, the German company said. With hope for a higher rival bid out of the market, AMS hopes to succeed this time. “We are pleased to announce the launch of the new takeover offer to acquire Osram, delivering on our stated intention,” said AMS Chief Executive Alexander Everke. “We are convinced that our offer will be successful as it provides a highly attractive, fully valued price at a straightforward acceptance threshold.” The German group initially did not welcome the much smaller Austrian firm’s intention, especially since the private equity groups had promised to keep it as an independent company. It said on Friday that recent discussions with AMS had been “constructive”. Osram became a takeover target after its strategy of turning itself into a high-tech company focused on LEDs and state-of-the-art laser chips did not bring the hoped-for success. “The managing board welcomes the progress made so far and is confident that both parties can agree on a future oriented strategic concept,” Osram said. AMS targets annual cost savings of more than 240 million euros by 2023, helped by restructuring Osram’s front-end LED production in Germany, resizing its loss-making production site in Kulim in Malaysia and consolidating corporate functions, sales and reducing IT systems. These savings would represent around 5% of the combined group sales of the last 12 months excluding Osram’s digital business, which AMS wants to sell, Vontobel analysts said in a note, adding that these ambitions were “not aggressive”. To formally launch its new offer, AMS has to set up a new bidding company to avoid a legally required 12-months waiting period. It also needs the German finance watchdog Bafin to approve its bid.

2019,Jeers force Hong Kong leader to abandon address with no olive branch on offer,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam had to abandon her policy speech because of jeering lawmakers on Wednesday but later offered no direct olive branch to pro-democracy protesters, hoping instead to ease resentment by building more public housing. Lam, who had to broadcast the annual address via a video link after the rowdy scenes in the Legislative Council, had hoped to try to restore confidence in her administration after four months of often violent anti-government and anti-China protests. She gave up initial attempts to deliver the address after pro-democracy lawmakers called out for “five demands, not one less” and projected the protest rallying cry on to a backdrop behind her. The demands include universal suffrage for the Chinese-ruled city and an independent inquiry into what they say has been excessive force by police in dealing with the unrest. Protesters have trashed government buildings, including the Legislative Council, daubed businesses seen as pro-China with graffiti, set street fires and thrown petrol bombs at police who have responded with water canon, tear gas, rubber bullets and several live rounds. Police have arrested more than 2,300 people since June. Thousands have been wounded, including two shot by live rounds. In her policy statement, Lam was unapologetic about her government’s response to the protests, which has included introducing British colonial-era emergency laws this month. “Any acts that advocate Hong Kong’s independence and threaten the country’s sovereignty, security and development interests will not be tolerated,” she said. “Despite the stormy times and overwhelming difficulties Hong Kong is experiencing, I believe that so long as we accurately adhere to the principle of ‘one country, two systems’, we will be able to get out of the impasse.” Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the protesters were trying to humiliate and bring down the Hong Kong government. “There is no simple solution,” he said. The protesters are angry at what they see as Beijing’s tightening grip on Hong Kong, which was guaranteed 50 years of freedoms under the “one country, two systems” when Britain returned the city to China in 1997. Beijing rejects the charge and accuses Western countries, especially the United States and Britain, of stirring up trouble. The unrest poses the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012. He has warned that any attempt to divide China would be crushed. A Norwegian lawmaker, Guri Melby, tweeted that she had nominated the Hong Kong people for the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize for their stand for freedom of speech and democracy. Lam later told a news conference that she had held “closed door” meetings with some members of the protest movement and when the unrest ended she would hold more. Pro-democracy lawmaker Tanya Chan said Lam should resign. “Both her hands are soaked with blood. We hope Carrie Lam withdraws and quits,” an emotional Chan told reporters. In her news conference, Lam rejected two of the protesters’ five demands - amnesty for those charged and universal suffrage - saying the first was illegal and the second beyond the chief executive’s power. Hong Kong’s Civil Human Rights Front in a statement also called for Lam to step down. “We urge Carrie Lam to stop destroying Hong Kong, respond to the five major demands, and step down,” it said. Lam has for months rejected calls to step down. The leader of the group, Jimmy Sham, was attacked hours later by a group of men in the gritty Mong Kok district on the Kowloon peninsula. Photographs on social media showed a bloodied Sham laying in the street. It is the second time he has been attacked since the protests began. “It is not hard to link this incident to a spreading political terror in order to threaten and inhibit the legitimate exercise of natural and legal rights,” said the group. Hong Kong’s unrest was ignited by an extradition bill, which could have seen residents sent to Communist Party-controlled mainland courts for trial. Lam has said the bill has been withdrawn, but the suspension of the legislature meant it could not be formally dropped. Densely populated Hong Kong boasts some of the world’s most expensive real estate and the inability of many young people to get a place of their own has fueled the protests. Lam’s housing policy is one of the boldest in recent years, vowing to take back large tracts of land held by a handful of powerful developers and create public housing. “We are determined to create home ownership opportunities for people of different income groups such that they will happily make Hong Kong their home,” Lam said. Lam said about 700 hectares of land in the New Territories would be brought back into public use under what is known as a land resumption ordinance. More than half of the land would be taken back in the next few years. No Hong Kong leader has take back land from private developers since the handover. Pro-establishment lawmaker Abraham Shek, who represents the real estate sector, rejected the policy, and the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance party said the policy speech lacked concrete measures. “It’s a conservative, procrastinating blueprint with few new ideas,” said the party’s chairwoman, Starry Lee. Major developers, including Henderson Land (0012.HK), New World Development (0017.HK) and Sun Hung Kai Properties (0016.HK), are sitting on “no less than 1,000 hectares” of agricultural land, according to government estimates.

2019,Terra Firma founder in management buyout deal for Australian farm CPC,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Terra Firma founder and chairman Guy Hands is leading a consortium to buy the firm’s Australian cattle company, Consolidated Pastoral Co (CPC), off its funds in a management buyout, CPC’s chief executive Troy Setter said on Wednesday. After having spent more than 18 months trying to sell cattle land across northern Australia the size of a small country for over A$1 billion ($673.70 million), the British private equity firm, which bought CPC in 2009, had raised about A$310 million for a 40% stake, a source close to the company said. Terra Firma will now sell the rest to a group led by Hands that also includes management for an undisclosed amount, CPC said in a separate statement. “The Hands family will provide a cornerstone commitment and invest alongside CPC management,” the statement said. “Other investors will be invited to participate in the buyout.” Terra Firma had been keen to offload the whole chunk in one piece for more than A$1 billion, even as the country experiences its worst drought on record, Reuters reported. [reut.rs/2krltpY] Soon after the firm put the station on the market, Reuters reported the anticipated premium for CPC would make a local sale to all but the wealthiest cattle-focused parties difficult given the need for major capital works. Indeed, Terra Firma has sold eight out of the 16 properties on sale - just over 40% of the 5.5 million hectares (55,000 square kilometers) on sale - to third parties for about A$310 million, according to the source, who declined to be identified because the information is private. CPC, however, is still the largest private cattle company in Australia, with 3.2 million hectares (7.91 million acres) of land, a carrying capacity of close to 300,000 head of cattle and two feedlots in Indonesia. “I am personally very excited about the future of CPC and delighted to be partnering with the management team of CPC,” Hands said. “CPC is a high quality, well run business with a strong position in a large and growing industry. Its operations are close to major beef-consuming markets.” On Tuesday, The Australian newspaper reported the consortium expected to pay between A$600 million to A$700 million for the assets. CPC declined to confirm the value of the deal. “It is great to have the chance to offer our management teams (across the stations) the opportunity to co-invest in this opportunity,” Setter told Reuters on Wednesday. “We’ve already had fantastic feedback from our team and people across the agricultural sector.” Editing by Jacqueline Wong",Reuters

Intel said it would buy Smart Edge, a software that helps split up data and store it closer to users to make computing devices respond faster. The software is designed to run on Intel’s chips, which are best known as the heart of most personal computers but which the company is aiming to sell into equipment for 5G, the next generation of wireless data networks that is being rolled out starting this year. According to Pivot’s securities filings, Smart Edge did not generate significant revenue in the first six months of 2019, but made a loss of about $1 million before depreciation and amortization. Pivot, which has a market value of about $43 million, was issued a U.S. patent on Smart Edge’s technology in July. Intel, which expects to close the Smart Edge deal in the fourth quarter, views 5G as a chance to expand its sales beyond personal computers and data centers, its two largest business segments. In 5G networks, more data will be stored on computers scattered near cell towers and other network gear. Storing the data there, a practice called “edge computing” in the industry, is expected to help large files like videos show up more quickly on users’ screens than if they were stored in centralized data centers. “We plan to take full advantage of our combined technologies and teams to accelerate the development of the edge computing market,” Dan Rodriguez, a general manager of the network compute division in Intel’s data center group, said in a statement. Intel’s shares rose nearly 1% to $52.15 in morning trade, while of Pivot Technology stock gained 4.9% to C$0.70.

2019,Angola hopes key reforms will aid efforts to sell oil assets,"LONDON (Reuters) - Angola is hoping sweeping economic reforms will smooth an ambitious plan to sell key state assets, including stakes in oil company Sonangol, a share of Puma Energy and more than 100 other enterprises. Africa’s second biggest oil exporter is in a rush for cash as it struggles to cope with moribund crude prices, slumping output and years of mismanagement that left Sonangol bloated and inefficient. In August, the government published an extensive list of assets that will be offered to investors via public offerings, stake sales, asset sales or tenders. The swift timeline aims for an initial public offering of Sonangol in 2022, the sale of a 28% stake in Puma and its portion of oil venture China Sonangol in 2020 and the offloading of a share of Ivory Coast refinery SIR this year. Central Bank governor Jose Massano told Reuters that there is “tremendous interest” in the asset sales, but also questions as the nation scrambles to shed an image of widespread corruption, state control and unfriendliness toward foreign capital. “Most of the investors, they express concerns (over) the security of getting funds into Angola,” he said, adding there should not be any such problems. “In the past, we have had that difficulty, but we have also introduced changes,” he said. An anti-corruption drive has gathered steam since 2017, when Joao Lourenco ended ex-Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos’ nearly 40-year grip on politics. Lourenco dismissed the former leader’s daughter Isabel as Sonangol’s chair later the same year and the government has sought to crack down on the influence of the ex-first family and reform bloated state institutions. The World Bank is advising on the asset-sale process to ensure it is transparent and open to a range of would-be investors. Massano said Angola this year cleared a backlog of money that investors had sought to repatriate and amended the law so those looking to withdraw funds in the future could do so via commercial banks, bypassing the Central Bank. The country also scrapped rules requiring foreign companies to partner with a local enterprise. Kwadwo Sarkodie, a partner at law firm Mayer Brown, which advises governments and international companies in Africa, said Sonangol is the crown jewel of the privatization drive.  “Sonangol is such a central organization to so much of what goes on in Angola,” he said. “The quest for cash is all-important, it’s getting money in the door against the backdrop of the difficulties in recent years caused by the oil prices,” he added. Angola wants international oil companies to develop its fields and stem serious production declines. Last year, it halved taxes on some oil fields to 10 percent and created an independent body, the National Agency for Petroleum, Gas and Biofuels (ANPG) to manage oil and gas concession sales. But observers say the nation’s relatively expensive production costs are an issue. “It’s just a pretty tough environment to do deals at the moment. And Angola doesn’t have the best reputation as a place to buy assets,” said Anish Kapadia, managing director of AKap Energy Ltd. “The incentive isn’t really there to invest. There have been some changes, but it hasn’t really been enough.” Puma Energy, Angola’s joint venture with trading firm Trafigura, is among the most interesting for potential investors, sources said, due in part to the lower level of expertise needed to run retail fuel and storage operations, compared with upstream oil assets. But Puma has also been on its own asset sale and restructuring drive to turn around weak profits and lower its debt levels.

2019,Former Conservative leader Duncan Smith reserves judgment on Brexit deal,"LONDON (Reuters) - Pro-Brexit former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said he was reserving judgment on the last-minute deal struck by Britain and the European Union on Thursday until he understood why Northern Ireland’s DUP opposed it. “There are some issues I have already spotted in the political declaration,” he said. “I am reserving my position on this. “There are some issues, for example if the DUP aren’t backing it - what’s their reasons for not backing it,” he said, adding that questions remained about the concept of consent.

2019,Lyft follows Uber in suing NYC over cruising time caps,"(Reuters) - Lyft Inc, following its rival Uber’s move, has sued New York City seeking to nullify a new rule limiting the time its drivers are allowed to spend cruising in Manhattan without passengers, the company said on Saturday. The lawsuit, filed by the San Francisco-based ride-hail company on Friday, argues that the cruising rule is arbitrary and threatens to shift business away from ride-hailing companies like Lyft in favor of taxis. “This rule is not a serious attempt to address congestion, and would hurt riders and drivers in New York,” Lyft spokesman Campbell Matthews said in a statement to Reuters. The “cruising cap” rule, implemented by the city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), sets a 31% limit on how much time drivers of app-based vehicles may drive without passengers in Manhattan south of 96th Street, meaning they would have to have fares at least 69% of driving time. “We will vigorously defend against this suit, and we will continue to fight for safer, less congested streets and for drivers’ rights,” TLC spokesman Allan Fromberg said in a statement, but mentioned that the agency has not been served with the suit yet. The rule, along with several others introduced last year, is aimed at reducing congestion in Manhattan, where ride-share vehicles make up close to a third of peak time traffic, according to the TLC. Uber contested the rule in September along with another rule banning issuance of new licenses to for-hire vehicles through August 2020. Uber and Lyft disconnected drivers from their apps at times of slow demand this year in an effort to comply with the city regulation. Both companies oppose the new rules, saying they will prevent drivers from earning money and deprive low-income New Yorkers of ride services in remote areas where regular taxis do not travel frequently. The city rejects that claim. Reporting by Akshay Balan and Mekhla Raina in Bengaluru; Editing by David Gregorio",Reuters
2019,"Syrah Resources to cut jobs, output at Mozambique graphite project","(Reuters) - Syrah Resources will cut 30% of the jobs at its flagship project Balama graphite operation in Mozambique due to weak Chinese demand hitting prices for flake graphite, the Australian miner said on Friday. Syrah, for which China is a big market, is the latest casualty of a fall in demand for battery raw materials which has also prompted Australian lithium miners to cut supply. The miner said full-year output in 2020 for Balama, which stood at 137,000 tonnes for the first nine months of this year, would fall to 120,000-150,000 tonnes. In addition to cutting jobs, the miner said it plans to restructure its executive committee. “We aim to continue to capitalize on our production improvement plan with the ability to quickly ramp up production in response to market conditions,” CEO Shaun Verner said referring to the Balama project. Its planned cost cuts are expected to reap benefit from January 2020, Syrah said in a statement. In September the miner signaled a likely fall in fourth-quarter output citing low demand stemming from cuts in Chinese electric vehicle subsidies.

2019,Exclusive: Whiting Petroleum in deal talks with smaller rival Abraxas Petroleum - sources,"(Reuters) - Whiting Petroleum Corp (WLL.N), an oil and gas producer with operations in North Dakota and Colorado, is in deal talks with San Antonio-based Abraxas Petroleum Corp (AXAS.O), two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. A deal would increase Whiting’s acreage in the second-largest U.S. shale field by output and spread its overhead costs over greater production, according to one of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as the talks are not yet public. It was not clear what terms the companies were discussing, although one of the people familiar with the matter described it as an all-stock deal. There is no guarantee they will strike a deal. Shares in both companies rose in late trading on Monday after Reuters reported on the talks. Weak oil and gas prices and poor shareholder returns have soured investors on U.S. shale, leaving many producers’ shares lower on the year. The S&P Oil and Gas Exploration & Production ETF (XOP.N) is off 21% this year compared with an 18% gain in the S&P 500 index. Investors also have punished producers that acquire rivals. Parsley Energy Inc (PE.N) on Monday lost about 11% of its market value after agreeing to pay $1.64 billion in stock for Jagged Peak Energy Inc (JAG.N). Abraxas CEO Bob Watson said in an email that the company does not comment on market rumors. A Whiting spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. Investors have called for change at Abraxas, an exploration and production company operating in the Rocky Mountains, the Permian Basin of West Texas, and in Wyoming’s Powder River Basin. Abraxas on Monday said it had engaged investment bank Petrie Partners for a thorough review of its business and strategic plans after concluding a sale of south Texas assets. The latest review would include “potential alternative transactions that might further enhance shareholder value.” This summer, Whiting announced a restructuring designed to generate $50 million in annual cost savings and to focus on unconventional assets. In late trading, Abraxas shares gained 19% to 45 cents apiece, giving the company a market value of about $75 million. Whiting added 1.2% to $7.34. Whiting shares are off about 68% year to date.

2019,FOREX-Dollar slips as euro bounces on Brexit deal; sterling volatile,"* Britain clinches Brexit deal, parliament hurdle remains * Dollar index down 0.6% for the week (New throughout, updates rates and adds comments post-U.S. market open; new byline, changes dateline, previous LONDON) By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed NEW YORK, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell against the euro on Thursday as the common currency got a lift from the European Union and Britain striking a long-awaited Brexit deal. Britain clinched an eleventh-hour deal on its exit from the EU on Thursday, more than three years after Britons voted in a referendum to leave the bloc, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson still faces a knife-edge vote in parliament to get it approved. While uncertainty remains on whether the pact will be ratified by British lawmakers, news of the agreement was enough to boost the euro 0.5% against the dollar and 0.66% against the British pound. “The fact that we have a deal means that we are further from a hard Brexit and all eyes will shift to this weekend’s vote,” Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at Jefferies, said in a note. The development in the Brexit saga marks a welcome respite for the euro which has dropped more than 3% this year. Investor sentiment towards the single currency has been hurt by a broad economic slowdown in Europe driven by the protracted U.S.-China trade dispute. On Thursday, the German government said it lowered its 2020 forecast for economic growth to 1.0% from 1.5% previously, but added that Europe’s largest economy was not facing a crisis. News of the deal sent sterling surging to a five-month high and within a whisker of $1.30 before retreating sharply as traders worried that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson might fail to get lawmakers to support the Brexit plan, plunging the country into another round of uncertainty. Sterling was 0.18% lower at $1.2807. The dollar has come under pressure this week, shedding about 0.6% against a basket of currencies. The greenback, which fell on Wednesday after weak U.S. retail sales data supported the case for further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, extended its weakness on Thursday. Data showed U.S. homebuilding tumbled from a more than a 12-year high in September. Separately, data showed a deceleration in factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region in October. The Norwegian crown weakened to an all-time low of 10.1800 against the euro. Some analysts blamed the crown’s recent weakness on global trade jitters, while others said the speed and magnitude of the drop were hard to explain. The Australian dollar held near the day’s highs, up 1.04% against the dollar after jobs data showed buoyant hiring, lowering chances of monetary easing in November.

2019,PM Abiy says Ethiopia ready to hold elections in 2020,"ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia will face problems if it delays its general election beyond the scheduled date of May next year, the prime minister said on Tuesday, recalling past political violence. “Democracy needs exercise. If we say we cannot hold elections now, it will bring a lot of problems. We should work wholeheartedly by building public trust,” Abiy Ahmed, this year’s Nobel peace prize winner, told parliament. The electoral board has the financing and capacity to conduct the polls in the country of 105 million. The vote would be the first under Abiy, who took office in April 2018 and began introducing political and economic reforms. These reforms have opened up what was once one of Africa’s most repressive nations but also stoked violence as emboldened regional strongmen build ethnic powerbases and compete over political influence and resources. Ethiopia has regularly held elections since 1995, but with the exception of the 2005 election, no election has been competitive. In the 2005 poll, riots erupted after the opposition cried foul, security forces killed nearly 200 protesters, and the government jailed many opposition politicians. “The people of Ethiopia have taken lessons from the conflict that happened following the 2005 general elections. Ethiopians do not want conflicts arising in connection with elections,” Abiy said. Questioned by MPs about the future of the fractious ruling coalition - some form of which has been in power since 1991 - Abiy said he intends to merge the coalition into a single party. One of the coalition’s four ethnic-based parties, the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), rejected the idea last week. The TPLF was the most powerful force in the coalition until Abiy came to power. Rapidly transforming the ruling Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front “may create more instability and that would exacerbate an already difficult environment for conducting a free and fair election”, said William Davison, an Ethiopia analyst at the International Crisis Group think-tank. Asked about a dispute with Egypt over the giant hydropower dam being built on Ethiopia’s Blue Nile, Abiy said: “No force will stop Ethiopia from building the dam.” Abiy, who won the Nobel this month for his peacemaking efforts with longtime enemy Eritrea, raised the prospect of war over the dam: “If we are going to war ... we can deploy many millions. But war is not a solution.” Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is expected to raise the demand for a mediator over the dam when he meets Abiy during a Russia-Africa summit this week.

2019,"Rule-breaking Booker judges honor Atwood, Evaristo with rare double prize","LONDON (Reuters) - Margaret Atwood’s “The Testaments” and Bernardine Evaristo’s “Girl, Woman, Other” jointly won the Booker Prize on Monday in a surprise double award in which the literary prize recognized its oldest and first black woman winners. The authors will split the 50,000 pounds ($62,800) annual prize, the judging panel said. The award honors “the best novel of the year written in English and published in the UK and Ireland.” Atwood, 79, previously won the prize in 2000 for “The Blind Assassin,” and “The Testaments,” published last month, is the sequel to the Canadian author’s best-selling 1985 novel, “The Handmaid’s Tale.” Evaristo, the first black woman to win the prize, tells the stories of 12 characters, mainly female and black aged 19 to 93, living in Britain in “Girl, Woman, Other.” While the prize has been jointly awarded twice previously, the rules changed in 1993 limiting the award to one author. The judges defied those rules, saying they could not agree on a winner between the two books, which were on a shortlist of six. “Neither of us expected to win this,” Atwood said in her acceptance speech in a televised ceremony. “I would have thought that I would have been too elderly and I kind of don’t need the attention so I’m very glad that you’re getting some ... It would have been embarrassing if I had been alone here,” she said to Evaristo. Atwood’s book, eagerly awaited by fans, returns to the totalitarian state of Gilead some 15 years after the end of “The Handmaid’s Tale,” telling the story of three women. Atwood has said a deterioration in women’s rights in some parts of the world including in the United States prompted her to write the sequel, described as a “savage and beautiful novel” by the judging panel. In Britain, it was an immediate hit, selling just over 100,000 hardback copies in its first week of release. The bleak dystopian “The Handmaid’s Tale,” where women are banned from reading and writing and those that are fertile are forced into sexual servitude, was itself nominated for the Booker Prize. “Girl, Woman, Other” is Evaristo’s eighth book of fiction, and was described by the judges as “a must-read about modern Britain and womanhood”. “This is incredible. I suppose a lot of people say, ‘I never thought it would happen to me,’ and I will say I am the first black woman to win this prize,” the British author, 60, said to loud applause. “I hope that honor doesn’t last too long. I hope that other people come forwards now,” she said. Reporting by Marie-Louise Gumuchian in LondonEditing by Matthew Lewis and Cynthia Osterman",Reuters
2019,"UK autos firms cut jobs, fear for investment as Brexit nears: SMMT","LONDON (Reuters) - One in three British automotive firms is cutting jobs as Brexit nears, up from one in eight just under a year ago, according to a survey conducted by a group representing the industry which risks being a big loser from Brexit. Eighty percent of firms feared leaving the European Union would hurt their future prospects and nearly two-thirds said they would be unable to invest in their British operations, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) survey showed. “Make no mistake, every day ‘no deal’ remains a possibility is another day of lost investment, another day that makes it harder to recover investor confidence in the UK,” SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes said. “As yet, the damage is not irreversible. But we need a deal. A deal that, in the short term, enables a ‘business-as-usual’ transition for as long as it takes to negotiate and implement the future trading relationship.” In the longer term, the industry needed frictionless trade with the EU, he said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is prepared to take Britain out of the EU without an agreement on Oct. 31 if necessary, although lawmakers have passed legislation that they say will force him to seek a delay from Brussels. The autos sector, Britain’s biggest exporter of goods, is concerned that World Trade Organisation tariffs of 10% on vehicles alongside new customs checks and border delays could halt production if there is a disorderly Brexit. Last week, Nissan (7201.T), which runs Britain’s biggest car factory, said such tariffs would make its business unsustainable in Europe. The SMMT said its survey was based on responses from 158 member companies polled in September. Writing by William Schomberg, editing by Andy Bruce",Reuters
2019,"India government, Facebook spar over decryption laws at top court","NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s government asked Facebook Inc on Tuesday to help it decrypt private messages on its network, citing national security requirements in a court hearing on privacy rights on social media platforms. India’s Attorney General K.K. Venugopal told the Supreme Court that it was the responsibility of social media companies to share data wherever there was a threat to national security. “A terrorist cannot claim privacy,” Venugopal said. “For Facebook and WhatsApp to say they cannot decrypt is not acceptable.” Facebook-owned WhatsApp, which has about 400 million users in India, allows groups of hundreds of users to exchange texts, photos and videos using end-to-end encryption, beyond the oversight of independent fact checkers or even the platform itself. The government said in an affidavit it planned to frame new rules to govern social media “keeping in view the ever growing threats to individual rights and nation’s integrity, sovereignty, and security.” “They can’t come into the country and say we will establish an non-decryptable system,” Venugopal said, referring to big internet platforms. But Facebook’s lawyer Mukul Rohtagi told the court the company was not obliged to share users’ data with the Indian government. The case went to the Supreme court after Facebook in August asked the top court to hear all cases concerning privacy and curbs on social media usage, local media reported. WhatsApp has been trying to find ways to prevent its misuse, following concerns that the platform was being used to spread disinformation, but has said it will not dilute end-to-end encryption. Rohtagi said local laws neither mandated companies to share data with government agencies, nor placed the onus of facilitating a process of decrypting messages on them. “The rules say if I have the key, I could give the key. But I don’t have the key myself,” Rohtagi said, referring to Facebook or WhatsApp servers which are located outside of India. The Supreme Court said it will now consolidate all pending cases on the issue from lower courts across the country and hear it beginning the last week of January. Tushar Mehta, a lawyer for the government, said there was no intention to invade into personal lives of citizens, and India merely wanted to guard its citizens against extremism. But Judge Deepak Gupta asked the government lawyers to explain why the onus of facilitating decryption should be on the social media companies. He said the law allows the government to seek help to decrypt, but does not suggest the companies do it for the government, he told Venugopal. “Nobody prevents you from having your own system of decryption,” Gupta said.

2019,Asian cities risk stumbling 'zombie-like' towards digital dystopia,"PENANG, Malaysia (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - As Asian cities turn to technologies such as facial recognition and artificial intelligence to deliver social welfare and public services, urban experts on Thursday urged authorities to address privacy concerns and protect the vulnerable. From India to Indonesia, governments across the region are backing hundreds of Smart Cities that use technology and data to improve waste management and energy conservation, tackle traffic congestion and mitigate risks linked to climate change. “Frontier technologies such as AI hold promise to reimagine how the public sector can better serve sustainable development needs,” U.N. Under-Secretary-General Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana said at an urban conference in Penang. “Fast-evolving technologies have the potential to transform the traditional way of doing things across all government functions and domains,” she said, adding that public-private partnerships will be key. Worldwide, the rise of cloud-computing and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have led to data-gathering streetlights in China, autonomous buses in Singapore and facial recognition systems in Indian airports. AI, which includes machine-learning, autonomous and data processing systems, is currently being used in crime prevention, trademark applications and to improve crop yields, according to a U.N. study here released this week. But the increased use of data, and of systems such as facial recognition software and closed-circuit television have also sparked concerns over bias, security, privacy and surveillance. With systems of social assistance increasingly being driven by data and technologies, there is “a grave risk of stumbling zombie-like into a digital welfare dystopia”, said Philip Alston, the U.N. special rapporteur on poverty and human rights. This is “especially problematic when the private sector is taking a leading role in designing, constructing, and even operating significant parts of the digital welfare state”, Alston warned in a report last week. Technology companies operate in an almost “human rights-free zone”, he added. Governments can guard against this by putting in adequate safeguards, and ensuring that there is good planning and governance, said Lim Teng Leng, deputy director at the Singaporean government’s Center for Liveable Cities. Technology-based solutions are no panacea for city problems, and can often cause just as many problems as they set out to address, he said. “Smart Cities cannot be a measure of how advanced the technologies are, but how these technologies are used to solve problems,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “People have to believe that all this data will improve their lives, make their cities better and safer. The government must build trust by being upfront about what data they are collecting, what it is for, and admit when there are mistakes.” This is particularly relevant to poorer residents and those who are not tech-savvy and may be excluded, said Colin Fernandes at the Global Disaster Preparedness Center, a unit of the American Red Cross. “Data collection often misses those in informal settlements, who are usually the most vulnerable to disasters and climate change risks, and most in need of welfare benefits and other assistance,” he said. “There is a failure to collect data, or a reluctance on their part to give up data, because they don’t know whether the data will be used to evict them or protect them. They need to be assured of what they are signing up for.” Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran; Editing by Michael Taylor.

2019,"No longer the host, Brazil still aims for key role at U.N. climate talks","BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil may have backed out of hosting this year’s U.N. climate summit, but the country will still take a leading role in negotiating the mechanisms needed to implement the Paris Agreement, its top climate negotiator said on Tuesday. Shortly after right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro won election last year, he canceled Brazil’s plans to host the COP25 climate change conference. The summit will now be held in Chile in December. At the meeting, countries will attempt to settle final details on how to implement the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to hold global warming to 1.5 degrees to 2 degrees Celsius to avert the worst affects of climate change. Leonardo Cleaver de Athayde, the lead climate negotiator in Brazil’s Foreign Ministry, told a congressional hearing that Brazil would be a protagonist on many of the key points of negotiation, including rules for carbon markets and financing for developing countries. Athayde said that developed countries should remember that they played a larger role in causing climate change and therefore should take more responsibility in resolving it. “The recognition of the historic responsibility of developed countries and more industrialized nations for greenhouse gas emissions is a central aspect of the climate regime and always has been,” he said. He warned developed countries not to forget commitments made prior to the Paris accord, noting that the promise to mobilize $100 billion in annual financing to support developing countries’ climate initiatives by 2020 had yet to materialize. “There is essentially one major challenge the climate regime is facing and will continue to face in the years to come,” he said. “We have sensed that unfortunately there is a tendency on the part of many players ... to act as if after the Paris Agreement everything that came before it ceases to exist.” Brazil has laid out ambitious targets for greenhouse gas reductions under the Paris Agreement, pledging to cut emissions by 37% by 2025, compared to 2005 levels, with a looser commitment to raise that to 43% by 2030. Bolsonaro said on the campaign trail last year that the country would pull out of the Paris Agreement but later backtracked. Athayde confirmed that the country’s targets remain unchanged under the new Bolsonaro government. Bolsonaro has nevertheless appointed climate skeptics to key positions, such as Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo, who argues that global warming is a Marxist hoax.

2019,IBM revenue misses on weakness in its biggest unit; shares fall 5%,"(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue on Wednesday, as its global technology services unit was hit by weakness in some European markets, sending its shares down 5% in extended trading. IBM, which wrapped up its acquisition of Linux maker Red Hat Inc earlier this year, has faced years of revenue decline amid its shift to the cloud from its traditional businesses, including mainframe servers. Sales from global technology services, IBM’s biggest unit that caters to some of the world’s largest data centers, were weighed down by lower client business volumes, mainly in the UK and Germany, Chief Financial Officer James Kavanaugh said on a post-earnings call. After a down-cycle, the company expects mainframe business to return to a normal product cycle in the fourth quarter, Kavanaugh told Reuters. Revenue from IBM’s cloud services rose 11% to $5 billion, helping the company beat profit expectations for the quarter. Total revenue fell 3.9% to $18.03 billion, missing analysts’ average estimate of $18.22 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Excluding the impact from currency and business divestitures, revenue dropped 0.6%. IBM’s global technology services unit reported a 5.6% drop in revenue to $6.70 billion. Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty, who has led IBM for more than seven years, is betting on subscription-based software offerings with the Red Hat deal, the company’s biggest acquisition so far. However, IBM has said that it would report only a portion of Red Hat’s actual revenue for some quarters, while recording all its expenses as required by U.S. accounting standards. The cloud and cognitive software unit, which includes Red Hat, reported a 6.4% rise in revenue to $5.28 billion for the third quarter ended Sept. 30. Net income fell to $1.67 billion, or $1.87 per share, from $2.69 billion, or $2.94 per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, the company earned $2.68 per share, 1 cent above analysts’ estimate.

2019,"After heart attack, campaign battles to keep Bernie Sanders in presidential race","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With all campaign events canceled after an unexpected heart surgery and nothing scheduled until Tuesday’s Democratic presidential debate, Bernie Sanders’ campaign has been seeking to reassure supporters the 78-year-old senator is still a viable presidential pick. The campaign has blasted the press with policy announcements and attempted to pivot the health scare to a message about his signature Medicare for All policy. His campaign is going forward with a $1.3 million TV ad buy in Iowa, the crucial early voting state that will kick off the Democratic primary contest in February. Sanders cleared his previously frenetic campaign schedule after a heart attack on Oct. 1 at a time when his candidacy has already been eclipsed by fellow liberal Elizabeth Warren’s ascent as a chief contender to early front-runner Joe Biden, who is 76. At 78, Sanders is the oldest of the 19 Democrats seeking the party’s nomination to take on Republican President Donald Trump, 73, in the November 2020 election. “That question starts to creep into people’s minds in terms of, ‘Is this guy going to be around for eight years after the election?’” said Bret Nilles, Democratic chair of Iowa’s Linn County. Sanders, who has been recovering at his home in Burlington, Vermont, since his heart attack, will hold a “Bernie’s Back” rally at Queensbridge Park in New York on Oct. 19, his first rally in nearly three weeks. On Tuesday, he will appear alongside 11 other Democratic candidates who qualified for the fourth primary debate in Ohio, when voters in Iowa will be watching Sanders’ performance closely, Nilles said. A raft of TV ads - postponed for several days when Sanders was hospitalized - began airing on Oct. 8 in Iowa, at a cost of $1.3 million, underscoring the campaign’s spending power after raising more cash than any other candidate in the third quarter. Phone volunteers also made about 800,000 calls to early voting states including Iowa in the four days after Sanders health scare was reported, campaign officials said. “The rest of the campaign and the volunteers took it upon themselves to double down on their effort and their energy,” said Sanders’ campaign manager Faiz Shakir. “They really said, ‘Senator Sanders, we’ve got you on this’.” The response was a sign of the passion his loyal supporters feel for the democratic socialist’s agenda of reorienting the U.S. economy against corporate power and tackling rising inequality with measures like expanding government-run healthcare. But doubts over his health could make it more challenging to pick up new supporters. Many national polls in recent weeks have already shown U.S. Senator Warren of Massachusetts, who is 70, pulling ahead of Sanders into second place behind Biden. Shakir, the campaign manager, said Sanders would show during Tuesday’s debate he was “on the path to a full recovery”. Some had been writing off Sanders’ campaign from the start, ignoring the large numbers of people donating to and volunteering for the campaign, he said. Sanders raised $25.3 million from 1.4 million individual donations in the last quarter, exceeding Warren’s $24.6 million raised from 943,000 donations. Within days of his campaign launch in February, Sanders has said more than 1 million people volunteered. His campaign boasts 25,000 organizers and volunteers in Iowa alone. Other campaigns have not disclosed comparable figures. Sanders told CNN on Thursday he would soon return to campaigning in early primary and caucus states and was “ready to go full blast”. “I’m feeling great and we’re going to run a vigorous campaign,” Sanders said. Grant Woodard, who has served on several Democratic campaigns and works as a lawyer in Iowa, said while Sanders might not be leading in polls his campaign boasts an impressive network in the state. “I think some people wanted to try to dismiss what happened here last time as a fluke,” said Woodard, referring to the 2016 Iowa caucuses where Sanders came close to beating the eventual nominee Hillary Clinton. “But he’s still attracting very large crowds. His supporters are very red hot in their support of him.” In Iowa, the campaign said Sanders staffers and volunteers continued to canvass voters and knock doors even as the candidate was in hospital. But fired up volunteers might not be enough for the campaign to stand out in the historically large Democratic primary field, said Elesha Gayman, chair of the Democratic party in Iowa’s Scott County. Georganne Guillen, a Sanders supporter in southern California, said she worried for Sanders’ candidacy after his heart attack, but trusted the senator to decide for himself whether he was still capable of running for president. “I believe that he cares enough about the country to put the country first,” she said, “and he won’t try to pursue something that he doesn’t think he can’t see through.” Reporting by Simon Lewis; Editing by Soyoung Kim and Lisa Shumaker",Reuters
2019,RPT-COLUMN-Hedge funds hold fire after two weeks of heavy selling in oil: Kemp,"(Repeats with no changes. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/33IESn8 By John Kemp LONDON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Hedge funds stuck with their existing bearish view on oil prices last week - leaving positions in petroleum broadly unchanged after two weeks of heavy selling at the end of September and the start of October. Hedge funds and other money managers sold the equivalent of just 4 million barrels in the six major petroleum futures and options contracts in the week to Oct. 15 (tmsnrt.rs/33IESn8). The pause came after sales totalling 190 million barrels over the two previous weeks, according to records published by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and ICE Futures Europe. Portfolio managers were small sellers last week of NYMEX and ICE WTI (-11 million barrels), Brent (-3 million), and European gasoil (-0.5 million), but small buyers of U.S. gasoline (+9 million) and U.S. diesel (+1 million). Hedge funds now hold just 2.5 long positions for every short position, down from a recent high of almost 9:1 in April and the most bearish position since the middle of January. Moreover, if passive structural long positions, which rarely change, are excluded, fund managers were running a dynamic net short position of 58 million barrels, also the most bearish since mid-January. The hedge fund community has become very pessimistic about the outlook for prices amid increasing concern about the state of the global economy and prospects for oil consumption in 2019/20. But with so much bearish sentiment already incorporated into the market, fresh selling dried up, which should ease some of the downward pressure on prices, at least temporarily. The large number of short positions that have been established has created the potential for a sharp rally if they have to be covered, but that depends on an improvement in the economic outlook.

2019,"China September new bank loans beat expectations, more easing seen","BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s banks extended more new yuan loans than expected in September, as policymakers ramped up support to stabilize the slowing economy during a bruising trade war with the United States. Chinese policymakers have been trying to boost bank lending and lower corporate financing costs, especially for the small and private companies vital for growth and jobs, but they have also cautioned against aggressive stimulus amid worries over debt risks. Separate data on Tuesday showed China’s factory-gate prices fell at their fastest pace in more than three years in September, adding to a slew of data in recent months that underline increasing pressure on the world’s second-biggest economy. Consumer inflation accelerated to 3% in September — the highest since October 2013 — but analysts attributed this to the supply-side impact of rising food costs, driven by surging pork prices as African swine fever diminishes hog supplies. Chinese banks extended 1.69 trillion yuan ($238.98 billion)in new loans in September, up from August and exceeding analyst expectations, data released by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) showed on Tuesday. Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted new yuan loans would rise to 1.4 trillion yuan in September, up from 1.21 trillion yuan in August but largely in line with the tally in September last year. Banks have boosted lending for the real economy, underscored by a pick-up in medium- and long-term corporate loans, Ruan Jianhong, head of statistics at the PBOC, told reporters. She added that property loans have been slowing. Corporate loans jumped to 1.01 trillion yuan in September from 651.3 billion yuan in August. Household loans, mostly mortgages, rose to 755 billion yuan last month from 653.8 billion yuan in August, central bank data showed. Sun Guofeng, head of the central bank’s monetary policy department, told the same briefing that the PBOC will rely on reforms to improve policy-transmission mechanisms and help lower borrowing costs. Sun also said the central bank should manage inflation expectations, although there is no basis for continued inflation and deflation. Broad M2 money supply in September grew 8.4% from a year earlier, above the 8.2% forecast in the Reuters poll, which was unchanged from August. Outstanding yuan loans grew 12.5% from a year earlier, quicker than August’s 12.4%. Analysts had expected a 12.3% growth. Analysts expect the central bank to ease policy further to support growth, despite some signs of easing in trade tensions between Beijing and Washington. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday the two sides had reached agreement on the first phase of a deal and suspended a tariff increase, but officials said much work still needed to be done. “The upshot is that policy easing is still failing to meaningfully lift credit growth. We think this will ultimately push the PBOC to cut the rates on its lending facilities more decisively,” Martin Lynge Rasmussen, China economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients after the data release. China’s economic growth in the third quarter is expected to slow to 6.1% year-on-year, just below the 6.2% pace in the second quarter, according to a Reuters poll. Analysts in the latest Reuters poll expect the PBOC will ease policy further by cutting banks’ reserve retirement ratios (RRR) and the one-year loan prime rate (LPR), its new benchmark lending rate. The PBOC has already cut RRR seven times since early 2018, in addition to two modest reductions in the one-year LPR since August. Central bank Governor Yi Gang said late in September large interest rate cuts were not urgently needed, following Beijing’s reiteration that it would not use “flood-like” stimulus measures. Despite prodding from Beijing, several bankers have told Reuters they have little appetite for lending to smaller companies because of the uncertain economic outlook, the trade war and a years-long drive to purge risks from the financial system. Some companies also say banks are sharply reducing credit lines. Corporate bond defaults, meanwhile, look set for another record year, though most have been by smaller, private firms. Growth of outstanding total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, rose 10.8% in September from a year earlier. The central bank has revised TSF growth in August to 10.8% from 10.7% after a change in the way it calculates TSF. TSF includes off-balance-sheet forms of financing from outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies and bond sales. In September, TSF rose to 2.27 trillion yuan, according to PBOC. It also revised up August’ s figure to 2.02 trillion yuan from 1.98 trillion yuan. Many analysts believe high debt levels — a legacy of massive stimulus sprees in the past — are making policymakers more cautious in their stimulus and more tolerant of slower growth as long as it is gradual.

2019,Consulting group Eurasia forecasts narrow defeat for Brexit deal in parliament,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Consulting firm Eurasia Group on Thursday predicted British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal would be narrowly defeated in a parliamentary vote on Saturday. “Without the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), Johnson appears to be between 15 and 20 votes short of the 320 votes needed to guarantee victory; he will focus efforts between now and Saturday on wooing the European Research Group (ERG), the ex-Conservatives, and Labour,” the consulting group said. After several days of negotiations, Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday said that Britain and the EU had agreed a “great” new Brexit deal, but it must still be approved by the British parliament. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he would recommend the EU’s speedy approval of the agreement. Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Alexandra Hudson",Reuters
2019,UK PM Johnson hails 'great' new Brexit deal but DUP says 'no',"LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday that Britain and the European Union had agreed a “great” new Brexit deal but still faced resistance from the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) as he sought support for the deal. Britain and the European Union have been racing to renegotiate the Withdrawal Agreement in time for an Oct. 31 Brexit, but the deal still needs approval from parliament. “We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control,” Johnson said in a tweet. “Now parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.” However, the DUP, who have expressed concerns that the Brexit deal could cut Northern Ireland off from Britain in customs and regulatory terms, said there had been no change in their position following the confirmation of the deal. Earlier the DUP had said it could not support the last-ditch Brexit proposal due to concerns about the issues of customs and consent, adding there was a lack of clarity on VAT (sales tax) arrangements.

2019,IMF awaits new fuel decree to revise Ecuador lending program: official,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund on Friday said it is awaiting the Ecuadorian government’s next move regarding fuel subsidies to continue the revision of its lending program for the South American country. On Monday, after days of violent protests and in a major win for Ecuador’s indigenous peoples, President Lenin Moreno abandoned an IMF-backed measure to end decades-old fuel subsidies aimed at getting the country’s finances in check. “We are waiting for the new decree that the government will publish regarding its policies associated with the price of fuels,” said Alejandro Werner, director of the IMF’s Western Hemisphere department. Werner, speaking at a press conference during the IMF and World Bank fall meetings in Washington, said the Fund is waiting to make the evaluation of a final package of policies. The review will then be concluded “in case our interaction with the Ecuadorian government is positive,” he said.

2019,Nursing mothers stage climate protest against Google in London,"LONDON (Reuters) - About 150 mothers with babies and young children defied a police ban on climate protests to stage a “nurse-in” outside the London offices of Google on Wednesday, while activists launched a parallel protest at the premises of its subsidiary YouTube. The mothers said they were acting in response to a report in Britain’s Guardian newspaper last week that said Google has made “substantial” contributions to climate deniers in Washington despite saying it supports climate action. “It’s just a terrible betrayal to all the parents, families and children that are suffering as a result of the climate and ecological crisis,” said Lorna Greenwood, one of the organizers of the mass nurse-in. Google said in the Guardian report: “We’re hardly alone among companies that contribute to organizations while strongly disagreeing with them on climate policy.” The mothers gathered despite police banning protests by the Extinction Rebellion group in London, which has been widely ignored by activists. Separately, about five Extinction Rebellion volunteers scaled the entrance to YouTube’s London office and unfurled a banner that said: “YouTube Stop Platforming Climate Denial.” Extinction Rebellion Youth, a group affiliated with the main movement, accused YouTube, which is owned by Google, of offering a disproportionate platform to people who dispute the scientific consensus that climate change is caused by burning fossil fuels. “This is not about censorship of individuals’ freedom of speech: it is about preventing YouTube being exploited by fossil fuel companies seeking to warp the public debate in their favor,” it said. Police said on Wednesday they had arrested 1,642 people in London since Extinction Rebellion launched a wave of civil disobedience on Oct. 7. Extinction Rebellion wants to force governments to take bold action to tackle climate change and the accelerating loss of plant and animal species by using disruptive tactics such as blocking roads and bridges, and glueing themselves to buildings. Hundreds of the group’s supporters gathered for a rally in London’s Trafalgar Square on Wednesday despite the police ban. The square was cleared of camping protesters earlier in the week. Police made further arrests on the adjacent street of Whitehall, where Extinction Rebellion protesters blocked the road. Hundreds more protesters gathered outside the London office of News Corp to demand newspapers owned by media magnate Rupert Murdoch, including the Times and Sunday Times, do more to inform readers about the dangers posed by climate change.

2019,Drugstore drones: UPS will fly CVS prescriptions to U.S. customers,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc’s (UPS.N) new Flight Forward drone unit will soon start home prescription delivery from CVS Health Corp (CVS.N). The service, which will debut in one or two U.S. cities in the coming weeks, shows how the parcel delivery company plans to expand its upstart drone business beyond hospital campuses. “Flight Forward will work with new customers in other industries to design additional solutions for a wide array of last-mile and urgent delivery challenges,” UPS Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer Scott Price said. The Atlanta-based company this month won the U.S. government’s first approval to operate a drone airline, leapfrogging rivals like Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Wing and clearing the way for the expansion of Flight Forward. UPS, which owns 251 jet aircraft and charters nearly 300 more, is building its Flight Forward business at a time when U.S. drone delivery is in its infancy. Regulations for operating those unmanned vehicles in U.S. airspace are not expected until 2021. On Monday, Flight Forward and partner Matternet also announced a deal to deliver biological samples and other cargo on University of Utah Health hospital campuses. That will be similar to the service at North Carolina’s WakeMed Hospital, where Flight Forward operates about 10 flights per day, said Bala Ganesh, vice president of the advanced technology group at UPS. Flight Forward has also signed a hospital campus deal with healthcare provider Kaiser Permanente, UPS said. In addition, the company said pharmaceutical distributor AmerisourceBergen Corp (ABC.N) will use Flight Forward drones to move pharmaceuticals, supplies and records to select U.S. medical campuses it serves. UPS rival FedEx Corp (FDX.N) last week delivered a residential package to a home in Christiansburg, Virginia, as part of a trial service with Alphabet’s Wing Aviation. Dan Gagnon, vice president of global healthcare strategy at UPS, said Flight Forward “is not a one and done business model.

2019,"South Korea's third quarter GDP quarter-on-quarter growth seen slowing, no quick recovery seen: Reuters poll","SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea’s economy continued to grow in the third quarter but at a slower pace than in the second, when government spending lifted the pace following a contraction in January-March, a Reuters poll found on Tuesday. The median forecast from 26 economists for gross domestic product in July-September was to expand by a seasonally adjusted 0.5% from the previous quarter, when it grew 1.0%. During the third quarter, a supplementary budget aimed at supporting growth kicked in. “Though contributions from domestic demand will remain sluggish, government expenditure likely continued steady due to supplementary budget, while contributions from net exports were seen improving on slowing imports,” said Lee Sang-jae, economist at Eugene Investment & Securities. In annual terms, third-quarter growth was expected to remain steady at 2.1% from 2.0% in April-June, according to the poll. Thirty economists provided year-on-year growth estimates. Despite the economy showing some signs of stabilization, economists do not expect any immediate recovery in growth as recent indicators pointed to further weakness, with global risks remaining high. South Korea’s producer prices index contracted 0.7% in September from a year earlier, central bank data showed on Tuesday, sharper than in August and the fastest annual decline since a 1.1% drop in September 2016. Exports plunged 19.5% during the first 20 days of October from a year earlier, pressured by weak sales to China and frail global demand for semiconductors. “It is premature to expect a substantial turnaround,” said Ma Tieying, economist at DBS Bank, adding that external conditions remain challenging, with a global growth slowdown and unresolved trade conflicts. “The negative spillovers on the domestic economy could continue to spread in the coming quarters, requiring stronger fiscal and monetary policy support,” she added. South Korea’s economy, the fourth-largest in Asia after China, Japan and India, is on track for growth of around 2% this year. It would be far below the government’s original target of 2.6-2.7% and the weakest since the 2008/09 global crisis. For 2018, South Korea reported growth of 2.7%. “Export data for the next two months will be the main factor deciding whether the economy could maintain a 2% growth in 2019,” Park Sang-hyun, Hi Investment & Securities’ economist, said. Last week, South Korea’s central bank cut its policy interest rate KROCRT=ECI for the second time in three months and left the door open for further easing although another cut is not expected soon. The next policy meeting, the last of 2019, is Nov. 29. The Bank of Korea will release advance estimates of third-quarter gross domestic product at 8:00 a.m. on Thursday (2300 GMT Wednesday).

2019,Chimbusco secures 4 million tonnes of very low-sulphur fuel,"ZHOUSHAN, China (Reuters) - China Marine Bunker, known as Chimbusco, [CMBPC.UL] says it has secured at least 4 million tonnes of very low-sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) for the next three quarters and has already started to supply all major Chinese ports from bonded storage. Demand for VLSFO is set to rise as International Maritime Organisation (IMO) rules will ban ships from using fuel oil with a sulphur content above 0.5% from Jan. 1, 2020 compared with 3.5% now unless they are equipped with exhaust scrubbers. Chimbusco, part of state-run oil and gas firm PetroChina, already has more than 10,000 tonnes of VLSFO into its bonded storage in China, the company’s general manager, Sun Hougang, said at an industry conference in Zhoushan. The 4 million tonnes of supply has been secured from Chinese and international firms for the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first two quarters of 2020, Sun later told Reuters. VLSFO produced by PetroChina will mostly be sold via Chimbusco after IMO 2020, said Sun, who sees demand for VLSFO picking up from mid-late November ahead of the Jan. 1 deadline. PetroChina International earlier on Friday announced it was setting up a bunker fuel division in Zhoushan, a bonded free trade zone in Zhejiang province just south of Shanghai. Eight of PetroChina’s refineries and 10 of rival Sinopec’s are capable of producing VLSFO, Sun said, noting that seven plants had far carried out trial output, producing 37,000 tonnes. Bunker fuel suppliers’ financing needs were set to rise by 20-30% after IMO 2020 due to higher costs, Sun added. In this regard, Chinese firms have been lobbying the government to introduce tax rebates and an export quota system to boost output of VLSFO. It is just a matter of time before a waiver of the 1,218 yuan ($172.01) per tonne consumption tax and rebate on the 13% value-added tax on fuel oil is released for VLSFO, Sun said.

2019,Russia says Bulgaria to complete pipeline stretch of TurkStream by 2020,"SOFIA/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Bulgaria has promised to complete its stretch of the TurkStream gas pipeline by 2020 as planned, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Monday, trying to tackle scepticism about the timescale of the project. Last month Bulgaria signed a 1.1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) contract with Saudi-led group Arkad to build the 474 km pipeline across its territory. Sofia hopes the whole pipeline, which Bulgaria has dubbed Balkan Stream, will become operational as early as 2020, but given that the contract with Saudi company was signed only in September, some industry officials are doubtful of the timeline. Lavrov, speaking in Moscow at a briefing with his Bulgarian counterpart Ekaterina Zaharieva, said he was given assurances that the second part of TurkStream would be completed as planned. “The partners have underscored that the work will be finished on time, by 2020,” Lavrov said. Russia, which is building TurkStream to bypass Ukraine to the south, has said its second portion, with an annual capacity of 15.75 billion cubic meters, will pass via Bulgaria to central Europe. Earlier on Monday, Bulgaria opened the 11 km pipeline that links its gas transport network with Turkey as part of its push to transport Russian natural gas from TurkStream to central Europe and inspected the laying of pipes Arkad has started in northwestern Bulgaria. The pipeline stretch is part of Bulgaria’s plans to link its southern border with Turkey to its western frontier with Serbia and provide a link to the Russia-backed TurkStream twin pipeline to Serbia, Hungary and Austria. Last week, Russia’s Gazprom began filling the first part of the TurkStream pipeline, which runs via the Black Sea, with gas. Moscow plans to launch the first part of the pipeline, with an annual capacity of 15.75 billion cubic meters, by the end of the year. Speaking to officials at the opening in southern Bulgaria, Prime Minister Boyko Borissov said Balkan Stream was also a political highway ensuring peace along with its economic benefits. Serbian Energy Minister Aleksandar Antic, who attended the inspection of construction works in northwestern Bulgaria, said Serbia will be ready with the pipeline on its territory by the end of the year and gas can flow once Bulgaria completes its part of the work.

Sanchez also urged Torra to acknowledge the many Catalans who do not want independence for the wealthy northeastern region and who are “asking him to rebuild the coexistence damaged by the independence movement”.

2019,U.S. oil major Chevron set to receive Venezuelan crude cargo: document,"(Reuters) - U.S. oil major Chevron Corp (CVX.N) is scheduled this month to receive at least one cargo of crude oil from sanctioned Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA, according to an internal PDVSA document. If the loading proceeds, it would be the first shipment assigned to Chevron since the United States sanctioned PDVSA in January as part of a campaign to oust Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, whose 2018 reelection most Western nations consider a sham. The vessel Agios Fanourios is set to load 2 million barrels of Venezuelan heavy crude on Oct. 19-21 at Jose port, according to a PDVSA scheduling document viewed by Reuters. The document does not show where the cargo is to be delivered. Chevron in a statement declined to confirm the loading, saying it “does not discuss specific commercial transactions,” but said its operations comply with all legal requirements. “International crude marketing activities that ultimately pay for expenses related to the maintenance of operations are permitted under OFAC General License 8C,” the company said in an emailed statement, referring to its current sanctions waiver. The planned Agios Fanourios loading is set to occur days before the U.S. license that has allowed Chevron to continue its oil production and crude blending in Venezuela is due to expire. The company has lobbied for another renewal. The loading is also set to happen the same month that India’s Reliance Industries (RELI.NS), Italy Eni (ENI.MI) and Spain Repsol (REP.MC) will load cargoes of Venezuelan crude through swaps for fuel deliveries to PDVSA or for settling pending payments, such as dividends. The Trump administration has several times imposed sanctions on Venezuela and sought to limit PDVSA’s transactions to largely cut off Maduro’s access to oil revenues, which account for most of the South American country’s hard currency income. A mandated exit would put at risk $2.7 billion that Chevron has invested in the nation and about 300 employee jobs.

2019,Head of Beijing-backed lender warns of Asia pain from U.S.-China trade dispute,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Sino-U.S. trade dispute, if it persists, will hurt Asian countries that rely heavily on exports to China and affect their debt sustainability, the head of the Beijing-backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) warned on Thursday. Some Asian economies that run trade surpluses against China could see their exports hit if the trade spat hurts growth of the world’s second-largest economy, said AIIB President Jin Liqun. That will have a direct impact on the debt sustainability of these countries, which depend on export income to finance infrastructure projects and repay debt, he told a seminar in Washington. “This is definitely going to be problem,” Jin said of the bitter bilateral trade tension. “We are looking forward to a solution ... not partial but a complete solution.” U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators are working on nailing down a Phase 1 trade deal text for their presidents to sign next month, spurring hope the two nations are de-escalating the spat that has roiled markets and hit global growth. Jin is the founding president of the AIIB, which was set up to help meet Asia’s infrastructure needs and demonstrate that a China-led institution can meet international standards for best practice. Jin said the AIIB was not undercutting other multilateral lenders, and instead focusing on supporting infrastructure investment rather than directly addressing poverty reduction - something the World Bank is already doing well. “We can invest in high, middle-income countries. We don’t make poverty reduction as our central focus,” he said, adding that his bank hopes to help reduce poverty by promoting economic development via infrastructure lending. Jin also said dealing with climate change is “considered a very important part of our mission.” Reporting by Leika Kihara; Editing by Andrew Heavens and Andrea Ricci",Reuters

2019,"Global economy slows, recession risk hangs in the balance: Kemp","LONDON (Reuters) - Economic growth around the world has slowed to a crawl but (so far) there are few signs of the second-round effects on jobs, income and spending that would turn a significant slowdown into an outright recession. The International Monetary Fund has forecast global output will increase by just 3.0% this year, the slowest expansion since the recession of 2008/09 (“World economic outlook”, IMF, Oct. 15). The Fund expects growth to accelerate slightly to 3.4% next year but only because of a slightly better performance in economies such as Turkey and Argentina currently under severe strain. The slowdown has been synchronized globally and centered on manufacturing, investment and trade as rising tariffs and increased policy uncertainty have hit business confidence and consumer spending on motor vehicles. In recent months, there have been signs the slowdown has spread from the more volatile manufacturing sector to infect more stable services industries, raising the threat of a recession to its highest level for a decade. So far, however, there have been few of the second-round effects on employment, incomes and consumer spending that would turn a slowdown into a more serious downturn (tmsnrt.rs/2qnkcmh). U.S. manufacturers reported production excluding motor vehicles and parts was down 0.7% in the three months between July and September compared with a year earlier, the worst performance since late 2016. But the number of employees in manufacturing was still up 1.0% compared with the same period a year earlier, while aggregate hours worked were down but only by 0.3% (“Current employment statistics”, BLS, Oct. 4). For the whole U.S. economy, personal incomes minus transfer payments from the government such as social security were still up by 2.8% in real terms in the three months from June to August compared with a year earlier. Real consumer expenditures were also up 2.5% in June-August compared with the same period in 2018, down from 3.5% growth a year earlier but well above recession levels (“Personal income and outlays”, BEA, Sept. 27). The U.S. slowdown is real and significant, but unless it starts to translate into job losses and reduced income growth it is unlikely to become a full-blown recession. Growth has been hit even harder in the rest of the world, especially in economies with a heavy exposure to international trade such as China and Germany. But there have been few reports of widespread job losses, which suggests the slowdown is showing only first-round effects so far. Recessions, like booms, are caused when the change in economic activity is amplified and becomes self-reinforcing through second-round positive feedback effects. The challenge for policymakers is to create a firebreak to prevent the slowdown from becoming a slump, and there are signs that the risks have been recognized at the top level. In response to growing fears of recession and signs of ebbing growth, the Federal Reserve has already cut interest rates by 50 basis points since July, with other major central banks also taking steps to ease financial conditions. Prodded by the deteriorating economic outlook, trade negotiators from the United States and China have also displayed greater flexibility and claim to be making progress towards a phased agreement. While any deal is unlikely to settle all economic disputes between the two nations, it could provide a truce and prevent further damaging tariff escalation that would almost certainly tip both economies into recession. Provided policymakers can avoid any further unnecessary shocks to the system, the global economy has a fair chance of avoiding a recession. The progressive inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve through the latter part of 2018 and the first nine months of 2019 was symptomatic of growing fears about recession and expectations of interest rate cuts. Since the start of October, the yield curve inversion has been reversed, reflecting greater hopes for a trade deal as well as economic data suggesting conditions are not worsening as rapidly as feared. Recent yield curve movements are only partially reassuring. The curve normally inverts well before the onset of a recession and then starts to un-invert a little before the recession itself kicks in. The initial inversion is driven by fears of a slowdown, but the curve starts to un-invert as policymakers respond to weakening activity by cutting short-term interest rates aggressively in an attempt to sustain the expansion. Significant and sustained yield curve inversions have preceded every recession in the last 50 years, and in almost all cases the curve has started to un-invert before the recession actually starts. Not since 1966/67 has there been a significant and sustained inversion followed by a soft landing rather than a recession (“Annual report of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System”, 1966 and 1967). In that case, the Fed acted to tighten credit and bank lending significantly in late 1966 to cool an overheating economy and then reversed course in 1967 when the economy showed signs of slowing significantly. Top Federal Reserve officials will be hoping for a similar outcome in late 2019 and early 2020, with rate cuts intended to provide a soft landing and sustain a continued expansion. From now, however, rate cuts will matter less than whether a trade truce is achieved and uncertainty for business can be reduced, and whether or not manufacturers and services firms react to the slowdown by cutting jobs and scaling back wage increases.

2019,Factbox: Brexit to budgets - the key themes at this week's EU summit,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU national leaders will meet in Brussels on Thursday and Friday to discuss some of the biggest issues facing the bloc, including the prospect of a member state leaving for the first time and two countries looking to join. With cliffhanger negotiations for a Brexit deal still under way on Wednesday, Britain’s exit from the EU is expected to dominate the summit. The crisis in Turkey and Syria, and the EU’s next seven-year-budget will also take up much of the leaders’ time. Here is a rundown on the meeting’s main themes. This is the last summit scheduled before Britain’s current date of exit from the union of Oct. 31. The European Commission and Britain have been holding last-ditch talks to clinch a deal that leaders can agree on at the meeting. The main stumbling block is the border between EU member Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland: how to prevent it becoming a backdoor into the EU’s single market without erecting controls that could undermine the 1998 peace agreement that ended decades of sectarian violence. Possible results include a framework deal for an orderly Oct. 31 Brexit with legal details agreed upon later, an extra EU summit a couple of days before the Oct. 31 deadline, a further Brexit extension, or possibly no deal at all. EU BUDGET FOR 2021-2027 The EU budget, called the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), is an enormous undertaking with the union deciding on its finances for the coming six years - 2021-2027. The biggest issue is how the union will cover the shortfall left by Britain’s departure. Member states have yet to agree how much of individual countries’ economies - gross national incomes (GNI) - should be contributed to the EU. Suggestions range from as much as 1.114% to as little as 1.0% of members’ GNI. The leaders will discuss how to make the budget fairer by ending the tradition of rebates, where certain member states have historically received reductions of their contributions to the EU budget. Also on the budgetary agenda are reforms, investments and measures to mitigate financial shocks in the 19 countries sharing the single currency. Albania and North Macedonia are next in line to join the EU for what would be the bloc’s first enlargement since 2013, when Croatia joined. But not all member states are on board. At ministerial talks on Tuesday, France stuck to its hard line against membership talks for the Balkan countries, setting up a showdown between French President Emmanuel Macron and fellow EU leaders at the summit. France says challenges facing the EU - including Brexit; China as a “strategic rival”; security threats posed by Russia; and migration - are already too extensive to admit two more states from a region still scarred by the legacy of 1990s wars and struggling with crime and corruption. France’s stance has raised concerns in Brussels about further delays in an already protracted process that could backfire by spurring Balkan states to cultivate closer ties with Russia and China. On Monday, EU countries agreed to limit arms exports to Turkey over its offensive in northern Syria, prompting condemnation from Ankara, even as they stopped short of a bloc-wide embargo against a NATO ally. Turkey was already being scrutinized for its drilling for oil and gas in the east Mediterranean, which has triggered condemnations from several EU states. The summit will be the scheduled gathering of EU leaders before the United Nation’s climate summit in Chile in December. A few member states have not yet signed up to the EU goal of becoming climate neutral by 2050. Other member states are also pushing for more ambitious goals for 2030 goals relative to 1990, currently set at a 40% reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. The tensions prevented the bloc from taking a leadership role in fighting climate change during the UN summit in September. Christine Lagarde is the nominee to be president of the European Central Bank and Charles Michel, currently Belgian prime minister, is slated to be the next head of the European Council, a role that will see him chair EU summits. Lagarde, former director of the International Monetary Fund, is due to become the first woman president of the ECB on Nov. 1. Michel is due to assume office on Dec. 1.

2019,Democratic 2020 hopeful Warren still weighing Medicare for All financing options,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House hopeful Elizabeth Warren is taking heat from her Democratic rivals for her demurrals when asked whether her Medicare for All healthcare plan would require raising taxes on middle-class households. One explanation, according to sources close to Warren’s campaign, is that the U.S. senator from Massachusetts is still considering financing options and at least one under review does not include a middle-class tax hike. “I’ve been working for a long time on this question about what the costs will be and how to pay for it and I’m getting close. It’s just got a little more work that it needs on it before it’s ready,” Warren told reporters in Indianola, Iowa, on Sunday, adding that she will be “ready to put out a plan soon on exactly what the costs will be.” How best to expand health insurance coverage has become one of the defining issues in the Democratic nominating contest to take on Republican President Donald Trump in November 2020. Progressives Warren and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders favor expanding the government’s existing Medicare program for individuals 65 years and older to cover all Americans. Moderates such as South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Vice President Joe Biden favor a more incremental opt-in approach that would have a lower price tag but cover fewer individuals. How to pay for a single-payer system that could cost as much as $34 trillion over 10 years, according to a study released last week by the liberal Urban Institute, has become the main point of contention between the progressive and moderate Democratic White House candidates. Warren has repeatedly said that she “will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.” Her go-to answer when asked about paying for Medicare for All is that overall costs for families will go down. Though Warren has become known for a voluminous stable of detailed policy proposals and “I have a plan for that” has become the catch phrase of her White House campaign, her initial healthcare plan was comparatively light on details. She has said “I’m with Bernie on Medicare for All” when asked about her stance. Sanders introduced a Medicare for All bill in the Senate that would transition the U.S. to a single-payer system. But the legislation, which was co-sponsored by Warren and fellow 2020 rivals Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, did not detail how to pay for the proposal. Sanders released a five-page explainer of financing options in conjunction with the bill’s introduction. In last week’s presidential debate, Sanders said it would be “appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up” if the proposal is enacted, which could require approval from both chambers of the U.S. Congress. Buttigieg on the campaign trail has slammed Warren for not detailing how she would pay for Medicare for all. Sanders is one reason why Warren has yet to address whether middle-class tax rates would go up. “She’s trying to be respectful of his genuine thought leadership here,” said one progressive activist close to the campaign. Another is that her campaign has solicited input from experts on a variety of Medicare for All financing options, including at least one that would not necessitate a middle-class tax hike. Robert Pollin, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst who studied financing options for Sanders’ 2017 Medicare for All bill and has advised both his and Warren’s campaigns, estimated that a single-payer healthcare system would have cost the government $37.8 trillion over 2017-2026. New sources of revenue would be needed to cover about $13.5 trillion of that, he estimated. Pollin said in an interview that his research shows a 1.8% business tax on gross receipts, a 3.75% federal sales tax on non-essential goods and a 0.38% tax on wealth above $1 million would respectively generate about $600 billion, $200 billion and $200 billion annually. That, along with cost savings associated with a single-payer system, would account for the $13.5 trillion needed. He said he designed his plan to minimize impact on consumer behavior, keep the burden on employers to cover some healthcare costs via the business tax and that lower-income households would be exempt from the sales-tax on non-essential goods. A middle-class household with an annual income of $60,000 would pay about $900 a year in sales tax. Depending on current healthcare costs, however, it would save about $2,000 to $8,000 each year, he said. Pollin said his discussions with Warren’s campaign are ongoing and its questions have been “very diligent.” “The notion that Elizabeth Warren’s staff or Elizabeth Warren herself has neglected this is very false. They’re trying to be very, very careful,” he said. Reporting By Amanda Becker; Editing by James Oliphant and Bill Berkrot",Reuters

2019,Top Philippine cop resigns after accusation of link to drug scandal,"MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines’ police chief stepped down on Monday less than a month before his retirement, after he was accused of involvement in “recycling” confiscated drugs, an allegation that could undermine the government’s anti-narcotics campaign. President Rodrigo Duterte has made a bloody war on drugs his signature campaign, to the approval of most voters, despite international outrage about the bloodshed amid fears many suspected dealers have been killed by police in staged encounters and by death squads. Duterte has rejected the accusations. In testimony that has raised questions about the government’s campaign, witnesses in Senate inquiries have accused police chief Oscar Albayalde of protecting officers who sold confiscated narcotics back onto the black market. Albayalde denied the accusations and had ruled out resigning. On Monday, he referred to the hearing and the fact he was being implicated in the scandal and said he was stepping down to make way for a new police chief. “After careful thought and deliberation, I have come to the decision to relinquish my post as chief of the Philippine National Police,” Albayalde said in the speech to police officers. Albayalde, the second chief of the 191,000-strong force under Duterte, was the head of the Pampanga provincial police when 13 of its officers were accused of stealing about 160 kg (353 lb) of narcotics seized in a 2013 raid. Albayalde had sought to prevent the dismissal of the 13, Senate witnesses said. Presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo told ANC news channel that perhaps Albayalde was stepping down because he had had enough of the “the accusations, the innuendos”. “He wants to spare the entire organization from whatever speculations, bad or false about him and the organization,” Panelo said. Albayalde was set to retire on Nov. 8. The police are spearheading the anti-drugs campaign. They say they have killed more than 6,700 suspected drug dealers who resisted arrest, and deny involvement in the mysterious killing of thousands more suspected drug users. But Duterte has at times criticized the force, once deriding it as “rotten to the core” and twice suspending anti-narcotics operations until the police cleaned up the force. The thousands of killings, mostly of poor urban people, have alarmed rights groups. The 47-member U.N. Human Rights Council in July approved a resolution to investigate the crackdown. Duterte condemned the proposed investigation. Reporting by Neil Jerome Morales; Editing by Robert Birsel",Reuters

2019,Home from home: Hong Kong police group plans retirement in mainland China,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - A Hong Kong police association is in talks with a Chinese property developer about a planned Hong Kong-themed retirement community in mainland China, it said on its website. A letter from the Hong Kong Junior Police Officers’ Association, dated Wednesday, coincides with more than four months of sometimes violent protests in the Chinese-ruled city, much of it aimed at the police. “Hong Kong City” will be in Zhaoqing, one and a half hours by high-speed rail from Hong Kong, with the first phase expected to be completed by the end of next year, the letter said. The developer, Agile Group (3383.HK), said it was talking to the Zhaoqing municipal government about the development which it said would provide retirement for all walks of life, not just the police. In the past few weeks, demonstrators have hurled petrol bombs and other objects at police, who have responded with tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannon and several live rounds. One police officer was slashed in the neck with a knife. Many protesters have accused the police of using excessive force but police say they have shown restraint. A Hong Kong court granted an injunction earlier this week to ban anyone from blocking or damaging married police officers’ quarters that have been targeted in the protests. The Hong Kong City aims to provide a “high-quality life with low cost”, the police association said in the letter, adding it would try to get a good price from Agile for its members. The Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants’ Association was also involved in the collaboration, it said. When asked about the plan, Acting Chief Superintendent of the Police Public Relations Branch, Kong Wing-cheung, said the developer wanted to sell the apartments in groups, to allow for discounts, and the two associations were talking to the developer about this. He added that buyers would have to abide by the bribery prevention ordinance and other guidelines when they accept any benefits. Agile said in an emailed statement it had entered into a letter of intent with the Zhaoqing government to build the community “featuring Hong Kong culture” in a diversified project. An increasing number of Hong Kong people are moving outside the densely populated financial hub - one of the world’s most expensive cities - to mainland China for cheaper and better retirement options, helped by faster transport links and an integration push by the Hong Kong and Chinese central governments under the Greater Bay Area initiative. The former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula, allowing wide-ranging autonomy for 50 years which the pro-democracy protesters believe is increasingly under threat.

2019,Factbox: Early details of new Brexit deal,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union has agreed a new Brexit deal with Britain. Here are the initial details. Northern Ireland remains in the United Kingdom’s customs territory but all EU procedures will apply to goods arriving there in this complex system. There will be no customs checks on the island of Ireland - they will be done in ports. For goods crossing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland that are deemed to be staying there, no EU tariff will apply. No EU tariffs would be paid on personal goods carried by travellers across the Irish frontier and for a second category of exempted goods that can only be for immediate consumption rather than subsequent processing. An EU-UK body called the Joint Committee will define this second group of goods more precisely after Brexit. The UK will be allowed to reimburse excise duties for companies in Northern Ireland as long as it does not undercut EU state aid rules. Northern Ireland will be able to benefit from future UK trade deals around the world. As long as the goods do not cross to Ireland and the EU’s single market, only UK customs tariffs will apply. The Northern Irish assembly will have to give consent after Brexit for the region’s continued alignment with the EU regulatory regime. Four years after Brexit, the assembly will have to decide by simple majority of those taking part in the vote whether to apply it. If the vote is positive, the system is extended for another four years. If another vote then is positive with cross-community support, the system is extended by another eight years until another vote. If consent is not granted, there is a two-year cooling off period during which sides need to find a new solution to prevent the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland. If the regional assembly does not sit or vote, the system continues as the default position. Unlike the “backstop” solution in the original deal, rejected by the British parliament, this system would not be replaced by a new free-trade deal between Britain and the EU. That marks a big concession from the EU side. FUTURE TRADE DEAL, LEVEL-PLAYING FIELD Sides aim at an ambitious free-trade agreement after Brexit with no tariffs and unlimited quotas. It comes together with a statement that sides will uphold high standards on environment, climate, workers’ rights and other rules. Previously agreed settlement on citizens’ rights after Brexit and Britain’s divorce bill stay as they were. That also goes for a transition period of 14 months until the end of 2020, which can be extended by one year or two years. Reporting by Gabriela Baczynska; Editing by Janet Lawrence",Reuters
2019,'Buckle up:' New IMF chief vows 'relentless' focus on gender equality,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva on Tuesday vowed to fight for greater gender equality at the global lender and around the world, telling a packed audience: “Buckle up. It’s going to come.” Georgieva, the first person from an emerging economy to lead the IMF and only the second woman, told the IMF’s fall meeting that there was hard work ahead, even at the lender, where women account for just 25% of top jobs. The Bulgarian economist and former World Bank chief executive spoke openly about her battle scars after decades in international institutions. She said economic studies clearly showed that improving gender equality would boost growth. She said she backed quotas for the private sector to accelerate better representation of women in C-suites, citing IMF studies that companies boosted results by 8% to 11% if they had women on their boards or senior management. “I am in favor of quotas because otherwise it will take us a very long time to get to where we want to get,” she said. When she took over as chief executive of the World Bank in 2017, Georgieva set a goal of achieving gender parity in top roles, and the bank met that target a year later - two years ahead of schedule. Georgieva said she would also prioritize pay equity at the lender, noting that it was not until she reached a senior position at the World Bank that she realized how much her salary had lagged that of male counterparts for many years. She said the gender pay gap averaged 16% in advanced economies and was as high as 37% in South Korea. Georgieva lauded a new IMF working paper on unpaid labor, which showed that women do an average of 2.7 more hours of childcare, housecleaning and other unpaid work per day than men. The study showed the gender gap in unpaid hours had narrowed in advanced economies, but traditional gender imbalances remained in most countries. Even in Norway, one of the most egalitarian countries in the study, women did 20% more unpaid work than men, while in Pakistan they did 1,000% more, Georgieva said. If such work were included in calculations of gross domestic product, it would boost economic output by as much as 35% worldwide, Georgieva said. Individual countries could boost GDP significantly by getting more women into the workforce. The study showed that reducing constraints to women’s paid work could boost economic output significantly, the study found. Georgieva underscored what she called her “relentless” commitment to addressing gender inequality and using the fund’s budgeting instruments and other tools to help countries reduce barriers to women in the paid labor force. “There is no way for any society to prosper without tapping into the talent of all its people – men and women. It’s very simple, if you ignore part of your capabilities, you ... come up short in terms of economic achievements,” she said. Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Cynthia Osterman",Reuters

2019,California governor demands PG&E accountability for mismanaging power shutoffs,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California Governor Gavin Newsom said on Monday that utility Pacific Gas and Electric Co should be held accountable for mismanaging last week’s widespread power shutoffs and urged the company to provide credits or rebates to affected customers. Separately, the California Public Utility Commission ordered corrective steps by PG&E, the state’s largest investor-owned utility, while summoning eight of its top executives to an emergency meeting on Friday. The utility, a unit of PG&E Corp (PCG.N), cut off electricity to more than 730,000 homes and workplaces in northern California last week in a bid to reduce wildfire risks posed by extremely windy, dry weather. The precautionary shutdown, unprecedented in its scope, has been widely criticized as being haphazardly conducted on too large a scale, with insufficient advance notice to affected customers. On Thursday, the governor said the power outage followed years of mismanagement by the utility and branded its handling as “unacceptable.” Chief Executive Bill Johnson publicly acknowledged that day that PG&E had fallen short in its preparations for the outage. In response to state officials’ latest moves, Johnson again acknowledged room for improvement while defending the broad-scale power cutoff as “the right decision.” He added that there “were no catastrophic wildfires started” last week in the utility’s service areas. Newsom said he had sent a letter to Public Utilities Commission President Marybel Batjer confirming that the agency will conduct a comprehensive inquiry and review of PG&E's planning, implementation and decision-making process failures. (bit.ly/35zARTI) “Californians should not pay the price for decades of PG&E’s greed and neglect,” Newsom said. “We will continue to hold PG&E accountable to make radical changes – prioritizing the safety of Californians and modernizing its equipment.” Newsom also urged the company to provide affected customers an automatic credit or rebate of $100 per residential customer and $250 per small business as compensation. Separately, Batjer sent PG&E executives an eight-page letter on Monday directing the utility outlining seven “major areas where immediate corrective actions are required,” the commission said in a statement. “Failures in execution, combined with the magnitude of this (power shutdown) event, created an unacceptable situation that should never be repeated,” Batjer wrote. “Loss of power is not a mere inconvenience - it endangers lives and property, especially those individuals who are reliant on power for medical reasons.” Several of the corrective actions ordered by the commission dealt with website crashes and an overwhelming surge in call center activity the utility experienced during the shutdown. PG&E filed for bankruptcy in January 2019, citing potential civil liabilities in excess of $30 billion from major wildfires linked to its transmission wires and other equipment.

2019,Wild push past Canadiens in third period,"EditorsNote: Fixed grammar error in final graf Zach Parise scored the game-winning goal midway through the third period, and Jason Zucker had a goal and an assist to lead the Minnesota Wild to a 4-3 victory over the Montreal Canadiens on Sunday afternoon in Saint Paul, Minn. Marcus Foligno and Brad Hunt also scored goals for Minnesota, which snapped a two-game losing streak and won for just the second time in eight games. Mikko Koivu added two assists. Devan Dubnyk finished with 30 saves for the Wild, notching his first win in six starts this season. Phillip Danault scored two goals and Tomas Tatar added one for Montreal, which was playing the second half of a back-to-back that started with a 5-2 victory at St. Louis on Saturday. Keith Kinkaid made 29 saves. Minnesota, playing for the first time since a 4-0 loss at Montreal on Thursday night that was followed by a players-only meeting, dominated the first period while taking a 1-0 lead. The Wild outshot the Canadiens 19-7 in the opening 20 minutes. Zucker put Minnesota in front with a power-play goal, deflecting Koivu’s blast from the right circle past Kinkaid’s stick side for his third goal of the season. The Canadiens took a 2-1 lead early in the second period with a pair of goals just 16 seconds apart. Tatar got the first on the power play when he put in a rebound of a Jeff Petry shot into an open left side of the net for his third goal of the season. Danault then scooped up a rebound of a blocked pass near the left post and then banked in a shot off of Dubnyk’s right skate. Minnesota tied the score with 15 seconds to go in the period on Foligno’s first goal of the season. Eric Staal fired a shot from near the left boards. The puck hit the skate of Luke Kunin to the side of the net and then caromed to an unguarded Foligno, who fired the puck into a wide-open right side of the net. Danault put Montreal back ahead, 3-2, with his fourth goal of the season early in the third period. Brendan Gallagher’s shot from the right circle bounced off Dubnyk’s blocker and into the skate of Danault, who was driving toward the net. The puck then slid into the net. The Wild tied it midway through the final period when Hunt one-timed a Matt Dumba cross-ice pass to the top of the right circle off the far post for his third goal of the season. Parise then produced the game-winner four minutes later when he took Zucker’s pass through traffic and drove it under the crossbar from below the left circle. —Field Level Media ",Reuters

Calgary answered with two goals in the span off 33 seconds early in the second period to take a 2-1 lead. Andersson got the first goal, taking a pass from Mikael Backlund at the end of a two-on-one rush and beating Fleury with a wrist shot on his glove side. Gaudreau followed with his third goal of the season when his pass for Elias Lindholm in front of the net deflected off the stick of William Karlsson through Fleury’s pads. But the Golden Knights answered with three goals in less than 11 minutes to take a 4-2 lead at the end of the period. Stone started the comeback with his third goal of the season when he fired in his own rebound from the bottom of the right circle. Carrier made it 3-2 when he roofed in a backhand shot from in front of the crease. Stastny followed with his first goal of the season when he picked up a loose puck in the neutral zone and skated in and beat Rittich five-hole with a wrist shot. It was Stastny’s 26th career goal against the Flames, the most of any active player in the NHL. Reaves picked up a loose puck in the slot after a pair of Flames collided and fell to the ice and then beat Rittich with a wrist shot to make it 5-2 early in the third period. Glass finished the scoring with 2:48 remaining when his backhanded pass bounced in off the leg of Flames’ defenseman Mark Giordano. —Field Level Media ",Reuters
2019,Three buyout groups vie for Scout24's Autoscout unit: sources,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German classifieds group Scout24 (G24n.DE) has picked three private equity firms for the second round of bidding for its autos unit AutoScout24, people close to the matter said on Thursday. Permira, Apax and Hellman & Friedman have been allowed to proceed in the auction for the unit, which is expected to value AutoScout at 2-2.3 billion euros ($2.2-2.6 billion), they added. Softbank-backed used-car dealing platform Auto1 had offered to buy AutoScout in the past, only to be turned down by Scout24 earlier this year. Two people familiar with the matter said Auto1 had not made an offer on its own this time around, while a third person said that it joined forces with Hellman & Friedman in the bidding for AutoScout. Scout24 and the bidders declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment. AutoScout24 - which operates in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Austria - bills itself as the largest automotive digital marketplace in the European Union. It lags eBay’s (EBAY.O) mobile.de in its home market, however. U.S. activist investor Elliott has argued that Scout24’s auto and property listings businesses have few synergies. It says ImmobilienScout24 could command a standalone valuation of 5 billion euros, while AutoScout24 could fetch up to 2.5 billion euros. A joint bid by private equity houses Hellman & Friedman and Blackstone to take over Scout24 in its entirety failed in May after a share-price rally squeezed the premium on offer.

2019,Ex-CEOs to plead guilty to roles in U.S. college admissions scandal,"BOSTON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Three wealthy parents including the former chief executives of bond manager Pimco and specialty finance lender Hercules Capital Inc will appear in court on Monday to plead guilty to participating in a vast U.S. college admissions cheating and fraud scheme. Federal prosecutors in Boston allege that ex-Pimco CEO Douglas Hodge, Hercules Capital founder Manuel Henriquez and onetime food manufacturer executive Michelle Janavs paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to have their children admitted to universities as fake athletic recruits. They are among 52 people charged with participating in a vast scheme in which wealthy parents conspired with a California college admissions consultant to use bribery and other forms of fraud to secure the admission of their children to top schools. William “Rick” Singer, the consultant, pleaded guilty in March to charges he facilitated cheating on college entrance exams and helped bribe sports coaches at universities to present his clients’ children as fake athletic recruits. The 35 parents charged in the investigation include executives and celebrities, such as “Desperate Housewives” star Felicity Huffman and “Full House” actress Lori Loughlin. Huffman reported to prison last week to serve a 14-day term after admitting she engaged in the college exam cheating scheme. Loughlin has pleaded not guilty. Hodge was CEO of Allianz SE’s Pimco, the world’s largest bond manager, from 2014 to 2016. Prior to his arrest in March, Henriquez was chairman and CEO of Palo Alto, California-based Hercules. Janavs was formerly an executive at her family’s food manufacturing company Chef America, which produced the microwavable snack Hot Pockets before being bought by Nestle for $2.6 billion in 2002. Prosecutors alleged that Hodge paid $525,000 to facilitate the admission of his daughter and son to the University of Southern California as soccer and football recruits through the use of bribery and falsified athletic profiles. Henriquez and his wife turned to Singer to help fraudulently inflate their two daughters’ entrance exam scores and also paid him $400,000 to bribe a tennis coach to help their oldest gain admission to Georgetown University, prosecutors alleged. Janavs similarly conspired with Singer to pay $600,000 to facilitate her son’s admission to Georgetown as a fake tennis recruit and her older daughter’s admission to USC as a volleyball recruit, according to an indictment. She also paid Singer $100,000 to have a corrupt exam proctor to secretly correct her two daughters’ answers on the ACT exam, prosecutors said.

2019,U.S. soldiers who fought alongside Kurds blast Trump's Syria retreat,"(Reuters) - In the summer of 2004, U.S. soldier Greg Walker drove to a checkpoint just outside of Baghdad’s Green Zone with his Kurdish bodyguard, Azaz. When he stepped out of his SUV, three Iraqi guards turned him around at gunpoint. As he walked back to the vehicle, he heard an AK-47 being racked and a hail of cursing in Arabic and Kurdish. He turned to see Azaz facing off with the Iraqis. “Let us through or I’ll kill you all,” Walker recalled his Kurdish bodyguard telling the Iraqi soldiers, who he described as “terrified.” He thought to himself: “This is the kind of ally and friend I want.” Now retired and living in Portland, Oregon, the 66-year-old former Army Special Forces soldier is among legions of U.S. servicemembers with a deep gratitude and respect for Kurdish fighters they served alongside through the Iraq war and, more recently, conflicts with the Islamic State. So he was “furious” when President Donald Trump this month abruptly decided to pull 1,000 U.S. troops from northeast Syria, clearing the way for Turkey to move in on Kurdish-controlled territory. Walker’s rage was echoed in Reuters interviews with a half dozen other current and former U.S. soldiers who have served with Kurdish forces. Mark Giaconia, a 46-year-old former U.S. Army special forces soldier, recalled similar camaraderie with the Kurds he fought with in Iraq more than a decade ago. “I trusted them with my life,” said Giaconia, who now lives in Herndon, Virginia, after retiring from the Army with 20 years of service. “I fought with these guys and watched them die for us.” The Trump administration’s decision to “leave them hanging” stirred deep emotions, Giaconia said. “It’s like a violation of trust,” he said. The White House declined to comment. Trump’s abrupt decision to pull back U.S. troops from along the Syria-Turkey border allowed Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan to launch an offensive into the region aimed at creating a 20 mile (32 km) “safe zone” clear of the Kurdish YPG militia. The Kurdish fighters had been Washington’s main ally in the region but the Turkish government regards them as a terrorist group. In the face of criticism from both Democrats and his own Republicans, Trump defended the move, saying that it fulfilled a campaign promise to reduce foreign troop presence and asserting that the Kurds were “not angels.” The Kurds pivoted quickly, allying themselves with Syria to try to hold off the Turkish onslaught. Trump then sent Vice President Michael Pence to Ankara to negotiate a pause in the fighting that the United States said would allow the Kurds to pull back from the area Turkey aimed to take, and which Turkey said achieved the main goal of the assault it launched Oct. 9. Congressional Republicans - including Senator Lindsey Graham, normally a staunch Trump ally - fretted that the move would risk allowing the Islamic State militant group to resurge. “Congress is going to speak with a very firm, singular voice,” Graham said at a Thursday news conference to unveil legislation to impose new sanctions on the Turkish government. He said the “Turkish outrage” would lead to the re-emergence of Islamic State, the destruction of an ally - the Kurds - and eventually benefit Iran at the expense of Israel. The House of Representatives voted 354 to 60 last week to condemn Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. forces from northeastern Syria - a rare case of Republicans voting en masse against Trump. A Senate vote on the resolution was blocked, however, by Republican Senator Rand Paul. Paul, a senator from Kentucky, has voiced his support Trump’s withdrawal of troops, saying during a Senate hearing on Thursday that “the Constitution is quite clear, no authorization has ever been given for the use of forces in Syria.” Some of the U.S. soldiers interviewed by Reuters pointed out that the United States has history of forging alliances with Kurdish forces only to later abandon them. In the 1970s, the administration of President Richard Nixon secretly agreed to funnel money to Iraqi Kurds fighting for autonomy from Iraq, only to drop that aid after Iraq and Iran reached a peace treaty to end border disputes in 1975. Likewise after the 1991 Gulf War, a Kurdish uprising against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein eventually led to a brutal crackdown after U.S. forces left the region. Those incidents came up often among Kurds who fought alongside a U.S. Army soldier who did several tours in the Middle East. “Even then, they were bringing up the 1991 betrayal of the Kurds. This idea of betraying the Kurds was something that was very, very front of mind,” said the soldier, who spoke on the condition of anonymity since he is still in the military. “There was definitely some skepticism of our support of them long term.” Kurds have come to know betrayal, said Kardos Dargala, a 38-year-old Iraqi Kurd whose relationship with the U.S. military dates back to 2004 and the second U.S. invasion of Iraq. “Feeling betrayed, throughout history it is a very familiar pattern,” said Dargala, who worked as a security contractor for the U.S. military until 2008 - when he immigrated to the United States, joined the U.S. Army, and was deployed to Afghanistan. Dargala, a U.S. citizen, was injured multiple times in combat. He returned to Iraq earlier this year to spend time with family members who are unable to travel to the United States. The president’s withdrawal of troops from Syria left him in disbelief. Dargala said Trump’s decision ran counter to U.S. values and interests and sent the wrong message to its allies. “The path the president is on,” he said, “is a very destructive path.” Reporting by Maria Caspani in New York; Writing by Scott Malone; Editing by Brian Thevenot",Reuters
2019,Stars slip past Senators for first home win,"EditorsNote: fixes story type from “preview” to “recap” Joe Pavelski scored a rare Dallas power-play goal, and backup goaltender Anton Khudobin was solid as the Stars earned their first home win of the season, 2-1 over the Ottawa Senators on Monday night. Radek Faksa also scored for the Stars, who outshot Ottawa 43-20 to improve to 3-7-1 and win back-to-back games for the first the first time this season. They were 0-2-1 at home before finally breaking though one night after several players, including stars Tyler Seguin and Ben Bishop, sustained damage to their homes from a tornado that swept through the north Dallas area. With Bishop not in the lineup, Khudobin, who had yielded 10 goals while losing his first three starts of 2019-20, was needed to make only 19 saves. He improved to 8-0-1 in his career against Ottawa. The Senators, who have just one win and three points through their first eight games, managed only Vladislav Namestnikov’s fourth goal of the season with 1:13 left in the contest. Ottawa, mired in an 0-3-1 rut, failed to score on two power-play chances, dropping to 1-for-25 with the man advantage on the season. Dallas has also struggled in that department, entering 2-for-27 on the power play, but managed one goal with the man advantage for the second straight contest. The Stars had five power plays on the night. Pavelski netted his second goal of the season, working to push the puck past Ottawa netminder Anders Nilsson (41 saves) in traffic just as a Dallas five-on-three advantage ended at 10:44 of the second period. The Stars opened the scoring when they were rewarded for some relentless early pressure with 1:02 left in the first period. Faksa deflected Taylor Fadun’s shot from the right point past Nilsson. Namestnikov’s late goal with the extra skater on the ice made things interesting. However, the Senators could not keep from falling to 0-3-1 on the road during the young season. —Field Level Media ",Reuters

2019,"Two years on, mourners seek justice for Maltese anti-graft journalist","VALLETTA (Reuters) - Thousands of people held candles and pictures on Wednesday at an evening vigil in Malta’s capital Valletta to mark two years since anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was killed by a car bomb outside her home. Three people have been under arrest since December 2017 and face trial for allegedly carrying out the murder, but police say investigations are continuing to identify who ordered it. Those taking part in the vigil walked silently behind a banner calling for “Truth and Justice”. The Maltese government has been criticized by the Caruana Galizia family and the Council of Europe for its handling of the investigation. The Times of Malta reported on Sunday that one of the three men awaiting trial had been offered a reduced sentence in exchange for testimony leading to the identification and conviction of the mastermind. The government has not confirmed the report. “The Government has full faith in the ongoing work of the investigators and the independent inquiring magistrate who should be allowed to continue carrying out their duties in a serene and independent manner,” it said on Wednesday. A group of Geneva-based human rights experts said Valletta must do more to establish the truth. “Two years have passed. No convictions, no trials of ringleaders and masterminds,” the group said in a statement. “On the contrary, posthumous libel suits continue to target the family of Daphne Caruana Galizia and makeshift memorials of her are frequently removed.” Representatives of Reporters Without Borders, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and local politicians took part in a short ceremony on Wednesday at the time and on the spot where the bomb went off in Bidnija, seven miles from Valletta.

2019,"Triathlon: Germany's Frodeno wins Ironman World Championship, compatriot Haug takes women's race","(Reuters) - Jan Frodeno won his third Ironman World Championship triathlon in a course record time in Hawaii on Saturday to continue German dominance of the men’s event. Anne Haug won the women’s race to complete a German double. Frodeno, the 2008 Olympic champion, produced a good swim and then scorched the bike course to open a lead of more than two minutes starting the marathon run under a fierce sun on the Big Island. The 38-year-old set a cracking pace from his very first step and inexorably extended his advantage, being able to savor his achievement by walking across the finish line to add to his previous victories in 2015 and 2016. Frodeno said his record time of seven hours, 51 minutes and 13 seconds was insignificant compared to the victory. “My legs are shattered,” he said. “I don’t care about the record. It’s a championship, the Wimbledon of our sport.” American Tim O’Donnell also broke eight hours for a distant second place, more than eight minutes behind in 7:59.41, while German Sebastian Kienle claimed third. German men have won the past six years, with Patrick Lange (2017 and 2018) and Kienle (2014) also notching victories. Lange pulled out during the bike leg on Saturday, reportedly suffering from a fever. In the women’s race, Haug overcame an eight-minute deficit in the run to triumph in 8:40.10, well ahead of Briton Lucy Charles-Barclay, while Australian Sarah Crowley claimed third. Charles-Barclay led for more than seven hours and started the run with a big lead, but was overtaken by Haug with more than 16 km remaining. While German men have dominated recently, Haug is the first German woman to triumph. “The whole run felt pretty amazing,” she said. The Ironman comprises a 3.8 km swim, 180 km bike ride and 42.2 km run. The race was first held in 1978 to settle a friendly argument among Hawaiian endurance athletes about who was the fittest.

2019,Hedge funds turn bearish on oil as economy slows: Kemp,"LONDON (Reuters) - By early last week, hedge funds had become the most bearish toward petroleum prices since the start of the year, as traders grew increasingly pessimistic about the global economy. Hedge funds and other money managers sold the equivalent of 95 million barrels in the six most important futures and options contracts tied to petroleum prices in the week to Oct. 8. Sales over the last three weeks have totaled 206 million barrels, according to an analysis of position records published by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and ICE Futures Europe. Fund managers now hold a net long position across the six main contracts of just 437 million barrels, down from a recent high of 911 million barrels in April, and the lowest since January. If structural long positions are excluded, money managers are running a dynamic position of 53 million barrels net short, which is also the most bearish since January (tmsnrt.rs/32gbCnk). Funds have become increasingly bearish toward all elements of the petroleum complex in recent weeks, but especially crude and mid-distillates such as diesel and gasoil. In the week to Oct. 8, fund managers sold Brent (47 million barrels), NYMEX and ICE West Texas Intermediate (34 million), U.S. diesel (7 million), European gasoil (5 million) and U.S. gasoline (2 million barrels). Funds have sold 106 million barrels of WTI in the last three weeks and 88 million barrels of Brent in the last four weeks. There are clear indications money managers embarked on a new cycle of short selling in NYMEX WTI around the middle of last month, with short positions increasing by 62 million barrels since Sept. 17. Crude and mid-distillates are the contracts with the greatest exposure to the economic cycle and especially the performance of manufacturing, mining, oil and gas, and freight transportation. Hedge fund sales are consistent with evidence from business surveys and other economic data suggesting global manufacturing and freight activity has started to shrink in recent months. As a result, the major statistical agencies in the oil market have downgraded their forecasts for consumption growth in 2019/20 recently. The most recent data came before the latest trade negotiations between the United States and China, which U.S. sources have called a “phase one deal” but China has described as a new round of consultations. Reported progress in the talks has improved sentiment across all financial markets, including oil, but it remains unclear whether a significant deal will be reached soon or whether it can stem the earlier loss of economic momentum.

2019,"Halliburton vows more cost cuts as shale demand dwindles, shares rise","(Reuters) - Halliburton Co on Monday promised more cost cuts after reporting a bigger-than-expected drop in quarterly revenue as the oilfield services looks to counter weak demand from North American shale producers, sending its shares up about 7%. The biggest hydraulic fracking services provider, which earlier this month cut 650 jobs in North America, said it would take steps over the next few quarters that will lead to $300 million in annualized cost savings. Oilfield service providers are struggling with reduced spending by oil and gas producers as investors push for higher buybacks and dividends rather than growth in a weak oil price environment. Larger rival Schlumberger NV said on Friday it had recorded a $1.58 billion goodwill impairment charge related to its pressure pumping business in North America. “HAL is taking costs out more aggressively than the Street forecast, which it expects to lead to strong Q4 operating margin improvement in the Drilling & Evaluation segments despite falling revenue,” said Anish Kapadia, founder of London-based oil and gas consultancy firm AKap Energy. Halliburton warned of further activity declines in North America, with fourth-quarter revenue for its hydraulic fracturing business declining by low double digits and margins by 125 basis points to 175 basis points. “Feedback from our customers lead us to believe that the rig count and completions activity may be lower than the fourth quarter of last year,” Chief Executive Officer Jeff Miller told analysts during a post-earnings call. Halliburton said its revenue from North America, which accounts for more than half of the company’s total, fell 21% in the third quarter. Revenue from completion and production fell 16% in the three months ended Sept. 30. The company also idled more equipment in the third quarter than the first six months of the year, Miller said. Evercore ISI analyst James West said Halliburton was “showing leadership by walking away from unprofitable or low return work.” Net profit attributable to Halliburton fell to $295 million, or 34 cents per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, from $435 million, or 50 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts had on average estimated 34 cents per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Revenue fell to $5.55 billion, below analysts’ average estimate of $5.80 billion. Halliburton’s shares were last up 5.9% at $19.52. The stock also pulled rivals higher, with Schlumberger gaining 2.4%.

2019,Alitalia rescue hopes rise as Lufthansa looks set to step in,"BERLIN/ROME (Reuters) - Alitalia’s rescue hopes received a boost on Thursday with signs that Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) could take a stake in the Italian carrier, while Rome agreed to a 350 million euro ($389 million) bridging loan to ease immediate cash worries. Loss-making Alitalia has been run by special administrators since May 2017 and talks led by state-owned railway group Ferrovie dello Stato to put together a consortium of rescuers have been going on for a year without coming close to a deal. Until now Ferrovie has been negotiating with U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) and infrastructure group Atlantia (ATL.MI), but the three potential partners have been divided on key aspects of the rescue plan including the size of their respective investments. On Thursday, two people with knowledge of the matter said Germany’s Lufthansa was now offering not only a commercial partnership, but could also take a stake in the rival. Lufthansa would be open to making the investment if conditions, mainly regarding restructuring measures it deems necessary at its Italian rival, were met, one of the sources said. Lufthansa declined to comment. With Alitalia burning through its cash reserves and down to just 310 million euros by the end of September, the carrier urgently needs new investors and a fresh business plan that will enable it to prepare for next year’s peak summer season. To give Alitalia more time to negotiate a rescue deal, Rome could grant a postponement of up to six weeks to an Oct. 15 deadline for Ferrovie to present a binding bid for the carrier, two sources said. Rome will also give the carrier a new bridge loan of 350 million euros, a draft decree seen by Reuters showed. Lufthansa has said many times in recent years that the Italian market was an interesting one for the company, but so far it had demanded shrinking Alitalia in terms of staff and fleet, making it an unpalatable option for Rome. The German carrier still insists on restructuring but it is now willing to talk and might be more flexible, one of the sources said on Thursday. A government source said Rome would welcome the German carrier taking a stake in Alitalia. The Italian airline, which went through two previous rescues in 2008 and 2014, has a workforce of 11,600 people. An involvement of Lufthansa would likely close the door to Delta, which has expressed commitment to contributing only around 100 million euros to the rescue of Alitalia, angering Rome. Alitalia is currently part of the Skyteam alliance with Delta, Air France-KLM (AIRF.PA) and other carriers while Lufthansa is a member of rival Star Alliance. According to a source close to the matter, an exit of Alitalia from Skyteam to join Star Alliance would involve costs of around 80 million euros, not hundreds of millions of euros as some Italian media have reported. Italy’s Il Messaggero newspaper earlier reported that a senior Lufthansa executive said the company was ready to acquire a stake in the Italian airline.

2019,Australia calls for new probe into loan pricing by banks,"MELBOURNE, Oct 14 (Reuters) - The Australian government has ordered the competition watchdog to investigate why banks failed to pass on the central bank’s three rate cuts this year in full, less than a year after a public inquiry exposed the industry for cheating customers. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has been asked to investigate prices charged for residential mortgages by all banks and non-bank lenders and how they make pricing decisions, including passing on changes in the official cash rate. The inquiry will also look at differences in prices paid by new and existing customers and barriers that may deter customers from switching lenders. The watchdog is due to deliver a preliminary report by March 30 and a final report by Sept. 30, 2020. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the government needs information on the banks’ funding costs to understand why they are not passing on rate cuts in full, after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) said those funding costs have dropped. The RBA has cut the official cash rate three times so far this year to a record low of 0.75% in a bid to stimulate consumption and investment in a slowing economy. “The Government and the RBA itself have called on the banks to pass them on and the banks have just ignored that advice and that call,” Frydenberg said in an interview on Australian Broadcasting Corp television. Frydenberg said he had spoken to bank chief executives about the inquiry and told them this was an opportunity for them to “clear the air” to explain why they haven’t passed on rate cuts in full and how they balance the needs of customers and shareholders. “They’re defending their patch and will continue to do. We’ll continue to get the best possible deal for the consumer,” Frydenberg said. However he said the government would not resort to levying a tax on banks if they refuse to pass on rate cuts in full and has previously ruled out legislating for the banks to pass on rate cuts in full. “What would concentrate the banks’ mind is a competitive and fairer marketplace and that’s why we want to empower consumers with more transparency in the bank reporting, more information,” Frydenberg said.

2019,Trump lawyer Giuliani defies House subpoena in impeachment inquiry,"(Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani on Tuesday said he would not comply with a subpoena issued by U.S. House of Representatives Democrats seeking documents as part of their impeachment inquiry into the president. A letter from a lawyer representing Giuliani sent to a lawyer for House leaders called the inquiry illegitimate, and said the information sought by lawmakers relating to his work in Ukraine is protected by attorney-client privilege and executive privilege. The move represents the latest effort by Trump and those close to him to refuse any cooperation with the inquiry. “In addition, the subpoena is overbroad, unduly burdensome, and seeks documents beyond the scope of legitimate inquiry,” Jon Sale, the lawyer for Giuliani, wrote. Attorney-client privilege is a legal principle in which certain confidential communications between a lawyer and client are kept secret. Executive privilege is a legal doctrine under which a president can keep certain information from other branches of government. The House Intelligence Committee had demanded that Giuliani hand over by Tuesday documents related to Trump’s effort to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Joe Biden, a top contender for the Democratic nomination to run against Trump in the 2020 election. Tuesday’s letter could prompt House Democrats to file a lawsuit intended to force Giuliani to comply with the subpoena. Sale said Giuliani was adopting arguments made by Pat Cipollone, the top White House lawyer, in an Oct. 8 letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress. In that letter, Cipollone said the House impeachment inquiry was constitutionally invalid and denied Trump basic due process rights, such as the ability to cross-examine witnesses, call witnesses to testify, receive transcripts of testimony, and have access to evidence. Many legal experts have rejected Cipollone and Giuliani’s arguments that the impeachment investigation is unconstitutional. Impeachment lawyers have said the House has broad authority to set the ground rules for an inquiry under the U.S. Constitution. The House Intelligence Committee on Sept. 30 issued the subpoena in consultation with two other House panels. The three committees did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Forty-eight respondents, or 71% of all participants including traders and analysts, predicted a reduction in the Loan Prime Rate (LPR) in monthly fixing on Monday. Another 20 respondents forecast no change in the interest rate.

A lower LPR could translate to lower borrowing costs for companies and consumers in the real economy. “I think LPR may trend down further gradually to reflect the narrowing credit spread,” Tommy Xie, head of Greater China research at OCBC Bank in Singapore said. One-year LPR was set at 4.20% in September, down 5 bps from the previous rate at 4.25%. The 5-year LPR was unchanged at 4.85% last month. A batch of recent data underlined broad economic weakness, boosting prospects for more stimulus from Beijing as policymakers try to prevent a sharper downturn. China’s economy grew at the weakest pace in nearly three decades in the third quarter, official data showed on Friday, due to a costly trade war with the United States and weak factory production. The LPR is a lending reference rate set monthly by 18 banks. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) revamped the mechanism to price LPR in August, loosely pegging it to the rate on the central bank’s medium-term lending facility (MLF). China’s central bank unexpectedly extended 200 billion yuan ($28.24 billion) worth of loans through MLF on Wednesday while keeping the lending rate unchanged at 3.3%.

2019,"Snap disappoints with fourth-quarter revenue guidance, sending shares down","(Reuters) - Snap Inc (SNAP.N) on Tuesday forecast fourth-quarter revenue largely below Wall Street estimates, sending its shares down 5% in after-market trading. The parent company of photo messaging app Snapchat estimated fourth-quarter revenue of $540 million to $560 million, the midpoint of which was below analysts’ estimate of $555.4 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The outlook overshadowed Snap’s third-quarter results released on Tuesday, which showed larger-than-expected growth in daily active users. Wall Street also glossed over Snap’s estimate it would reach profitability in the fourth quarter, as measured by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). On a conference call with analysts, Snap Chief Financial Officer Derek Andersen said the company’s peak advertising demand period, which runs between the Black Friday and December holidays, had one fewer week this year, and was reflected as a “headwind” in the guidance. Snapchat, popularized by its photo visual effects which allow users to change gender in photos or add a dog filter over their face, had 210 million daily active users in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, up from 203 million in the prior quarter. It had 186 million users in the year-ago quarter. The number, a widely watched metric by investors and advertisers, was above analysts’ average estimate of 206.6 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Snapchat faces competition from several other apps for the coveted younger demographic, including Facebook Inc’s (FB.O) Instagram and newer apps like TikTok, used to create and share short lip-sync, comedy and talent videos. Investors are still cautious about Snap, given the company’s tumultuous past and “irregular user-engagement record,” said Haris Anwar, an analyst at financial markets platform Investing.com. “A slight miss on expectations would be enough to hurt the stock and revive the old memories,” he said. Revenue, which the company largely makes by selling advertising on the app, jumped about 50% to $446.2 million in the third quarter and beat an average analyst estimate of $435.05 million. Average revenue per user jumped 33% to $2.12 during the quarter from a year earlier. In remarks released before the conference call with analysts, Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel said this year’s growth has put the company “on a clear path to Q4 adjusted EBITDA profitability.” The company’s net loss narrowed to $227.4 million, or 16 cents per share, from $325.1 million, or 25 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, Snap posted a loss of 4 cents per share in the quarter. Analysts had expected a loss of 5 cents per share.

2019,"Boeing 737 MAX test pilot grappled with simulator flaws, too","SEATTLE, Oct 18 (Reuters) - In newly released text messages from 2016, a top Boeing 737 MAX test pilot tells a colleague that the jet’s MCAS flight control system - the same one linked to two fatal crashes - was “running rampant in the (simulator) on me.” But the broader conversation appears to show the Boeing pilot was also grappling with a number of software problems with the flight simulator itself, according to a former Boeing test pilot who analyzed the transcript and who had direct knowledge of the flight simulator at the time. Such calibration problems may have contributed in some way to Mark Forkner’s observations and conclusions of MCAS’ behavior, the pilot, and a second former Boeing engineering employee, Rick Ludtke, said. The messages, first reported by Reuters, sent Boeing’s shares tumbling, prompted a demand by U.S. regulators for an immediate explanation, and a new call in Congress for Boeing to shake up its management. At one point during the 9-minute conversation, the MAX’s then-chief technical pilot Forkner tells colleague Patrik Gustavsson that he was in his hotel room “with an ice cold grey goose” after a session on a flight simulator earlier in the day. The Nov. 16, 2016 conversation took place four months before the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration certified the MAX, the latest iteration of Boeing’s 737 aircraft, and two years before deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people. That simulator, likely supplied by Textron Inc company TRU Simulation + Training, was also still months away from winning FAA certification and had numerous technical problems that affected its performance, the former Boeing pilot said. At one point in the exchange, Forkner tells his colleague the machine was “pretty stable” and he had signed off on some “DRs”, or “discrepancy reports” - likely meaning that they had resolved earlier issues, the two former Boeing employees said. “But there are still some real fundamental issues that they claim they’re aware of,” Forkner said, likely referring to the manufacturer. Boeing declined to comment. TRU did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Forkner’s lawyer David Gerger told Reuters: “The simulator was not reading right and had to be fixed to fly like the real plane.” Earlier in their conversation, Gustavsson asks Forkner whether he could get anything done in the simulator or if he experienced the “normal chaos.” That likely refers to general software issues, the former Boeing employees said. Forkner then says MCAS was “running rampant in the sim on me”. He describes what he experienced: “I’m levelling off at like 4000 ft, 230 knots and the plane is trimming itself like craxy (sic). I’m like, WHAT?” Gustavsson responds that he experienced similar patterns with MCAS, “but on approach.” “On approach” is when pilots line up the aircraft to land. At a certain elevation, pilots typically extend the aircraft’s flaps, the former Boeing employees said. Boeing has said MCAS only operates when the flaps are retracted, so it would be unusual that Gustavsson would have experienced the same behavior on approach, with flaps extended, the former Boeing employees said. “We don’t know if he is describing glitches in the simulation, or if it’s actually an MCAS misbehavior,” Ludtke said. Pilots have complained they did not know about the existence of MCAS before the Lion Air crash in October 2018. In a separate set of emails released by the FAA late Friday, Forkner told the agency in January 2017 that the company would delete references to MCAS from the flight operator’s manual “because it is outside the normal operating envelope.” In marketing the 737 MAX, Boeing said pilots would only need computer-based training on the new narrowbody model rather than simulator training, which is more costly. The FAA approved the training requirements when it certified the aircraft in 2017. A November 2016 email from Forkner to someone in the FAA said he was working toward “jedi-mind tricking regulators into accepting the training that I got accepted by FAA.” (Reporting by Eric M.

2019,Papua New Guinea delays inquiry into UBS loan for ill-fated Oil Search stake,"(Reuters) - Papua New Guinea has delayed an inquiry that was due to begin this week into the terms of a A$1.2 billion ($819.00 million) loan from Swiss bank UBS that was used for an ill-fated government investment in the gas sector. The commissioner for the inquiry, Salamo Injia, blamed slow-moving government officials for the delay, saying they had failed to appoint an overseas legal team as ordered by Prime Minister James Marape last month. Injia, a former chief justice, said in an email late on Thursday that he was “hopeful” the relevant government agencies would prioritize the task so public hearings could begin on Nov. 4. The government-backed inquiry is looking into how the UBS loan was used by the government to buy a 10% stake in PNG-focused energy firm Oil Search in 2014 under former prime minister Peter O’Neill. Marape, who was finance minister at the time of the deal, set up the inquiry shortly after taking over as leader in May. He last month agreed to requests from Injia and ordered that the length of the investigation be doubled to six months, its budget increased and an international law firm appointed. Retired Australian judge John Gilmour has already been appointed as a second commissioner and Injia has requested an Australian firm of solicitors be appointed “given the international dimension of the subject matter.” The UBS loan was handled by the firm’s Australian offices. Oil Search has a near one-third interest in the Exxon Mobil-led PNG LNG Project, where gas is extracted from PNG’s highlands region. Questions were immediately raised over whether the deal was overly complex, and if the PNG government followed correct legal procedures, sparking various internal inquiries. The cash-strapped government went on to sell its stake after a prolonged period of weak oil and gas prices. The total sum of the financial loss has never been disclosed by the government. UBS did not immediately return an emailed request for comment on Thursday. It has previously said it would not comment on specific transactions and that it adhered to strict standards in banking operations. Swiss financial watchdog FINMA said in March it was in contact with UBS about the loan. Reporting by Colin Packham; editing by Jane Wardell",Reuters
2019,"Showered in blaze of bullets, upscale Mexican neighborhood in shock after cartel assault","CULIACAN (Reuters) - The trendy bars and restaurants along the main strip of the Mexican city overwhelmed late last week by an army of cartel gunmen slowly began their recovery over the weekend even as many traumatized residents still shied away. Culiacan’s central Tres Rios neighborhood, with its gated communities, upscale shopping centers and exclusive golf course, was victim to some of the most intense firefights last Thursday, concentrated on the street where soldiers attempted to arrest Ovidio Guzman, a son of jailed drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman. While El Chapo’s Sinaloa Cartel successfully pinched off access at various points in the city, they trained their focus on Tres Rios, where Ovidio Guzman was briefly found and detained, but later released after officials realized they were outmatched. Mexico’s foreign minister admitted on Saturday that the government feared upwards of 200 civilian casualties if the operation to extract the young narco had continued. Just off the entrance of a Tres Rios seafood restaurant that found itself at the heart of the hours-long siege, workers scrubbed away dried blood from the steps. They said the spot marked the final resting place of a cartel gunman following what officials described as 14 separate, armed attacks launched by the Sinaloa Cartel’s convoys of pickup trucks against Mexico’s overwhelmed military at different points in the city. “It’s going to be a struggle to open back up, but we have to do it,” said the restaurant’s owner, declining to provide his name, but ticking off his immediate priorities: “sweeping up the debris, cleaning up everything and calling for help to repair the damages.” As workers assessed the few windows that had not been pierced by the flurry of bullets, the owner acknowledged it will take time to lure customers back. “Right now, everyone here is in a state of panic, but Tres Rios will still be the best part of Culiacan,” he said. Meanwhile, workers at the car wash next door to the restaurant focused on repairing metal vacuum cleaners ripped open by bullets. Upon finding out that authorities sought to capture Ovidio Guzman and extradite him to the United States, the cartel’s heavily armed gunmen strategically erected 19 blockades during a roughly four-hour stretch in the afternoon, preventing additional military and police from responding as terrorized locals scurried for cover. One of the most intense firefights took place on the block behind the restaurant where local residents said several military vehicles had stopped along a non-descript building with tall, white walls, in a bid to extract El Chapo’s son from a residence inside. Now the walls stood covered with hundreds of bullet holes, as if the building had broken out in a rash. The soldiers in the vehicles came under heavy fire from a hill across an adjacent drainage canal, separating Tres Rios from the Tierra Blanca residential neighborhood, and several homes there were caught in the crossfire. “They destroyed my bedroom windows. The walls, they’re filled with bullet holes,” said taxi driver Jose Manuel Uriarte, whose home is located just below the hill where he said gunmen had taken up positions to fire upon the military vehicles. He pointed out, with fingers stained with paint from the repairs he had started, where his mattress had been covered by a blanket of broken glass. An avocado tree in the lush garden outside his bedroom had been split open by the gunfire and Uriarte estimated that he had already found around 500 bullet casings nearby. He spotted another on the ground, squatted down to pick it up and then handed it over like it was a souvenir. Like other locals, he wonders about the possible infiltration of the cartel into local and state police, but said there is no doubt that the cartel proved itself to be the stronger force, at least for one violent afternoon last week. And then his face turned angry and he pursed his lips. “It’s infuriating,” he said, “because you have to ask yourself, ‘Who’s really in charge?’” Reporting by David Alire Garcia; Editing by Steve Orlofsky",Reuters
2019,Biden rips Warren's credibility after contentious Democratic debate,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (Reuters) - Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden questioned surging rival Elizabeth Warren’s credibility on Wednesday, accusing her of failing to be open with voters about how she would pay for her ambitious Medicare for All healthcare proposal. Biden said it was “about time” that Warren, who has been steadily rising in opinion polls of the Democratic White House race for two months, face scrutiny on her plan for a government-run healthcare system. “She’s going to have to tell the truth, or the question will be raised about whether or not she’s going to be candid and honest with the American people,” Biden told reporters in Columbus, Ohio. His comments came the day after a Democratic debate marked by repeated attacks on Warren by her more moderate White House rivals that exposed the party’s divisions on issues like healthcare and taxes. Warren has risen in the past month into a virtual tie with Biden, the former vice president, atop polls to pick a challenger to Republican President Donald Trump in the November 2020 election. In Tuesday’s debate in Ohio, moderates Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar aggressively challenged Warren to explain how she would pay for ambitious proposals including the Medicare for All plan based on the government-run insurance system for Americans aged 65 and older. Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts and a leading progressive voice in the party, stayed calm under the attacks as she described her proposals to end income inequality and level the economic playing field for workers. But Warren did not directly respond to questions about whether she would raise taxes for the healthcare plan, although she said she would not sign any bill that does not lower healthcare costs for middle-class families. “I have made clear what my principles are here, and that is that costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations and, for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down,” Warren said in the debate. Biden said it was an ironic stance for Warren, who repeatedly promises she has “a plan for everything.” “It’s fascinating that the person who has a plan for everything has no plan on the single most consequential issue in this election in the minds of the American people across the board,” Biden said. “Tell us how you’re going to do what you say you’re going to do,” Biden said, adding “credibility matters.” The sharp exchanges before and after the debate were a sign of the heightened stakes less than four months before the first nominating contest in Iowa on Feb. 3. Many of the contenders also face a scramble to qualify for the next Democratic debate in Georgia in November, when polling and fundraising qualifying criteria will be even tougher. So far, just eight candidates have qualified. Biden said it was “absolutely ridiculous” that Warren would not delve into the details of her healthcare proposal, drawing a comparison to Trump. “The last thing the Democrats should be doing is playing Trump’s game and trying to con the American people to think this is easy. There’s nothing easy about it,” he said. Trump has repeatedly called Biden corrupt since Democrats in Congress opened an impeachment inquiry focused on Trump’s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate unsubstantiated charges that Biden improperly tried to aid his son Hunter’s business interests in Ukraine. Biden said Trump was “running the most corrupt government in the history of the United States” and taunted Trump for his refusal to release his taxes. “Even Richard Nixon released his tax return,” Biden said. “Mr. President, release your tax returns, or shut up.” Trump, who has blasted the impeachment probe and denied any wrongdoing, dismissed the field of Democratic candidates on Wednesday, tweeting: “Now you see why they have no choice but to push a totally illegal & absurd Impeachment of one of the most successful Presidents!” Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Writing by John Whitesides; Editing by Steve Orlofsky and Sonya Hepinstall",Reuters
2019,Royal Mail union votes overwhelmingly in favor of a nationwide strike,"(Reuters) - Britain’s Royal Mail (RMG.L) staff want to go on a nationwide strike, the Communications Workers Union (CWU) said on Tuesday, after it alleged that the company failed to adhere to a pension deal signed last year. CWU said more than 97% of a ballot of roughly 110,000 British postal workers were in favor of going on strike. Some 76% of its members working in Royal Mail voted in the ballot, the union said. “The prospect of the first national postal strike in a decade now looms large,” CWU said in a statement. Royal Mail, which has 142,000 employees in Britain, said it was disappointed that union chose to ballot for industrial action and that it was still in mediation with the union. Royal Mail last year reached a deal with the union over pensions, pay, a shorter working week, culture and operational changes, after nearly 10 months of negotiations. (reut.rs/35DHVio) “Today the new RMG leadership are breaking that agreement,” said Terry Pullinger, Deputy General Secretary (Postal) at CWU. “We would urge Royal Mail Group to now enter serious negotiations with this union,” said Dave Ward, General Secretary at CWU. The company was not immediately available to comment on Pullinger’s comments. The run-up to Christmas is its busiest time of the year. Royal Mail, privatized four years ago, is one of the few big British firms still to have a defined-benefit pension scheme, which pays out a proportion of a member’s final salary depending on how long employees have paid in to the scheme. By contrast, a defined contribution scheme is a retirement plan in which the employer and employee contribute to an investment fund that is used to buy a pension on retirement. Under a collective scheme, contributions are pooled, instead of being held in an individual account, helping to share risk.

2019,SDF commander: Trump did not oppose deal with Damascus to fend off Turkish offensive,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump did not object to an agreement cut between Kurdish-led forces and the Syrian government to protect Syria from a Turkish offensive, Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) commander Mazloum Kobani said on Wednesday. Kobani, who said he had a phone call with Trump, told Kurdish-language Ronahi TV that U.S. adversary Russia would guarantee the SDF agreement with Damascus. He added that the deal would pave the way for a political solution, to be worked out later with the Syrian government, that could guarantee Kurdish rights in Syria. Turkey began an offensive a week ago against the U.S.-allied Syrian Kurds after Trump abruptly upended five years of U.S. policy with a decision to withhold protection for the Kurds. The Trump administration dispatched top officials to Turkey on Wednesday for emergency talks with Ankara to try to halt the assault while Russian troops swept into territory abandoned by American forces. Kobani said that while the military agreement calls for Russian-backed Syrian troops to deploy across SDF-stronghold areas along the border with Turkey, reports of the SDF handing control of territory in recent days to government forces were incorrect. Kobani said the Kurdish-led group, which was Washington’s main ally in the battle to oust Islamic State, has now turned its attention to pushing back the Turkish invasion. “The war against Islamic State, as we have said previously, will not be a priority for us, our main goal now is the protection of our people and our areas,” said Kobani. His forces would, however, continue to be in charge of roughly 12,000 detainees from Islamic State being held in their territory, Kobani said. Kurdish leaders have said that the Turkish invasion could compromise their ability to adequately hold thousands of foreign militants and their families captured during the ouster of Islamic State, and have pleaded with governments to take their citizens back.

2019,Exclusive: Scottish social entrepreneurs emerge optimistic in global poll amid Brexit uncertainty,"LONDON, Oct 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When Josh Babarinde came up with the idea of a company hiring young ex-offenders to fix phone screens, he found Britain a good environment for accessing investment and sales took off. Babarinde said Cracked It found its niche - and the awards and accolades rolled in - with Britain found to be one of the top nations in policies and support for social entrepreneurs in a global poll by the Thomson Reuters Foundation in 2016. Three years on the sector is thriving in Scotland - but conditions for ventures with a mission to succeed commercially while helping society were stalling elsewhere in Britain with experts saying Brexit had dominated the political agenda. The second poll of experts on the best countries for social entrepreneurs by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, released on Tuesday, found Britain had slumped to 13th place among the world’s 45 biggest economies from third slot three years ago. Babarinde, who recently announced plans to run for public office, said it was frustrating to see the pace of the sector’s development slowing as social enterprise slipped down the political agenda. “We have the capacity for a social innovation policy revolution - tax breaks for social enterprises, social innovation in the curriculum - yet we’ve only seen a very slow evolution over the last couple of years,” Babarinde said. “There’s never been a need more than now for social enterprise. We need to treat social enterprise more seriously.” Britain’s fall in the poll, produced in partnership with Deutsche Bank, came as experts cited less favorable business conditions and government support for social entrepreneurs and a fall in public awareness about what they do. Britain’s well-established social enterprise sector – with more than 100,000 social enterprises contributing 60 billion pounds ($78 billion) to the economy – is held up as an exemplar, tackling issues like homelessness, knife crime and pollution. But since Britain’s 2016 referendum, the country has become embroiled in a prolonged political crisis with no clarity on when and how the nation will depart the European Union. “The political environment is so uncertain, unpredictable, and more extreme than it has previously been,” said Peter Holbrook, chief executive of Social Enterprise UK, the trade body representing the sector. “Whether you’re a social business or mainstream business, this is not a great place – given all of the uncertainties and unpredictability – to start a business.” Britain was been hailed an example after launching a social enterprise strategy in 2002, issuing the first social impact bond in 2010, and introducing social investment tax relief. It created a law in 2013 for all public sector commissioning to factor in social value, which it expanded this year. But when about 900 social enterprise experts were asked in this year’s poll how favourable conditions were for social entrepreneurs to start and grow their businesses, Britain slumped 10 places to 13th slot. Asked if government policy supported social entrepreneurs, Britain slipped eight places to rank 15th. A decision in 2016 to move responsibility for Britain’s social enterprise sector from the Cabinet Office - a department at the heart of government - to the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), left many industry leaders feeling side-lined. A DCMS government did not comment directly on the results of the poll but said Britain was committed to supporting the sector which has a vital role in changing lives for the better. “As set out in our Civil Society Strategy, we are placing social value at the heart of central government’s estimated 49 billion pounds ($60 billion) of procurement spending each year,” he said. 10-YEAR STRATEGY Cliff Prior, chief executive of Big Society Capital, said social entrepreneurship had been high profile in the political scene in Britain from the 1990s and to 2016 and it could be time for the well-established sector to stand up on its own more. “Government is still important, as it sets the tax rules, sets the regulatory system, sets the procurement system ... but we should do a lot of our own sector development,” he said But while Britain as a whole declined in the poll, Scotland bucked the trend and was seen as a rising star of the sector. The Scottish government, led by Nicola Sturgeon, in 2016 launched a 10-year strategy to promote social enterprises with about 5,600 running in Scotland employing about 82,000 people. Since 2007 students in about 1,000 schools and colleges have been taught about social enterprise with the aim to teach the topic in all schools by 2026, according to Social Enterprise Academy (SEA), a training organization in Scotland. “Governments in the UK rarely think beyond their five-year terms, which has made it difficult to address issues like social care, housing or the attainment gap,” said David Bryan, an SEA regional manager. “The 10-year strategy has focused minds in the government on investing in the social enterprise sector, so that it can help government address some of these really wicked issues.” Glasgow-based Sophie Unwin, who set up Remade Network, a social enterprise to promote the repair and reuse of household goods, said there was a lot of support for social enterprises. “But then it’s a smaller place than England so you feel that support goes a lot further,” she said.

The so-called “Panda-Kangaroo 2019” exercise began on Oct. 10 and ended on Saturday, Xinhua said, adding that 10 officers and soldiers from each country’s army participated in the drill, which “focused on honing the participants’ military skills, willpower and team spirit.” The joint exercise comes amid a downturn in Sino-Australia relations, with China in August formally arresting Chinese-born Australian writer Yang Hengjun on suspicion of espionage and Canberra expressing concern over China’s actions in disputed South China Sea waters. Australia last year blocked Chinese telecoms giant Huawei Technologies from supplying equipment for its 5G mobile network, citing national security risks, while Reuters reported in February this year that a key Chinese port had restricted imports of Australian coal. In a statement earlier this month, Australia’s Department of Defence said the annual “Pandaroo” exercise was “designed to establish strong people-to-people links and mutual understanding” at the junior officer, non-commissioned officer and soldier level.

About 3,400 people have been arrested since protests began, including about 300 who have since been released, according to the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms, an independent body. “Unfortunately such arrests are continuing, and have included a number of well-known and respected civil society figures,” U.N. human rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told a news briefing. Protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Cairo and other cities have followed online calls for demonstrations against alleged government corruption. Sisi, first elected in 2014 after, while army chief, leading the 2013 overthrow of Islamist President Mohamed Mursi, has overseen a crackdown on dissent ranging from liberal to Islamist groups - the most severe in recent memory, rights groups say. Journalist and activist Esraa Abdelfattah was arrested by plainclothes security officers in Cairo on Oct. 12 and was reportedly beaten after she refused to unlock her mobile phone, Shamdasani said. Abdelfattah is on a hunger strike, she added. Alaa Abdel Fattah, a blogger and software engineer, was released in March after serving a five-year sentence for protesting without permission, but was re-arrested on Sept. 29, Shamdasani said. The same day, his lawyer Mohamed al-Baqer, was arrested while attending the interrogation, Shamdasani added. Abdel Fattah was struck by guards on his back and neck while being forced to walk down a corridor in his underwear, while al-Baqer has been subjected to physical and verbal abuse, and denied water and medical aid, she said. Ivan Surkos, the European Union’s ambassador to Egypt, tweeted on Tuesday that he had raised concerns over individual detained activists with Ahmed Gamal Eddin, Assistant Foreign Minister for Human Rights. “Will my messages end as (a) dialogue of deaf persons? Let’s hope not,” Surkos said. Reporting and writing by Stephanie Nebehay with additional reporting by Amina Ismail in Cairo; Editing by Mark Heinrich",Reuters
2019,Cathay Pacific shelves U.S. dollar bond plans amid Hong Kong unrest,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (0293.HK) has shelved plans for its first U.S. dollar debt deal in 23 years, the airline said on Friday, after sources told Reuters that global investors had baulked at the pricing due to civil unrest in Hong Kong. The airline, the biggest corporate casualty of widespread anti-government protests in the Asian financial hub, on Friday lowered its second-half profit expectations, citing “incredibly challenging” conditions in its home market. Cathay had started meeting investors in Hong Kong and Singapore on Sept. 24 after it mandated four banks to explore carrying out a U.S. dollar denominated bond, according to a term sheet issued at the time, seen by Reuters. It would have been the first U.S. dollar debt deal for Cathay since 1996 and had been touted as a landmark transaction for the airline given all of its debt is denominated in Hong Kong dollars. The issuance was to be unrated, and two sources with knowledge of the matter said that Cathay was willing to pay 200 basis points over the U.S. Treasuries rate to secure three-year or five-year funding, with the size and term of the placement dependent on demand. However, investors demanded a higher price of at least 300 basis points over U.S. Treasuries, which made the deal more expensive for Cathay, said the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. Cathay’s term sheet had said the transaction would be reliant on market conditions. A Cathay spokesman on Friday said the Hong Kong dollar private placement market was providing more funding opportunities and a debt issuance in that market was completed last month. “We will continue to monitor the U.S. dollar bond market in future,” he said in a statement. Dealogic data showed that Cathay raised $102 million in October and $64 million in May through Hong Kong dollar denominated deals. The airline has only carried out 12 bond transactions in the past decade and all were priced in Hong Kong dollars. Cathay had mandated Bank of America Merrill Lynch, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank and HSBC to work on the shelved U.S. dollar bond deal.

2019,"GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks, sterling rise on long-awaited Brexit deal","(Adds gold, oil settlement prices) * Sterling pares gains as Brexit deal nagged by doubts * Lack of support from Northern Irish party presents a snag * Wall Street edges higher on robust earnings, Brexit deal By Marc Jones and Herbert Lash LONDON/NEW YORK, Oct 17 (Reuters) - A deal on Britain’s departure agreed with the European Union sent sterling to a five-month high on Thursday and hoisted European stocks to a year-and-a-half peak before doubts about UK parliamentary support brought them back to earth. Wall Street rose as upbeat earnings from Netflix and Morgan Stanley affirmed a strong start to the U.S. reporting season, while the dollar fell against the euro as the common currency got a lift on the long-awaited Brexit deal. But the Irish border riddle remained a sticking point for Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which withheld its backing and created doubt among investors. The DUP’s opposition reduces the chances of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson winning parliamentary ratification at the extraordinary session of parliament on Saturday. But after weeks of negotiations, British and EU leaders welcomed an agreement being struck. “Where there is a will, there is a deal - we have one!” said European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker as the news broke from Brussels. Sterling, the key gauge of Brexit sentiment all along, jumped as much as a 1% against the dollar, putting it on course for its best six-day gain in more than 30 years before the doubts and grumbles set in. Market optimism faltered when the Northern Ireland party said it could not support the agreement, torpedoing hopes of a smooth passage through parliament. Having ran up as far as $1.2988, sterling fell well under $1.28 before regaining momentum to trade at $1.2863, up 0.26% on the day. European shares edged lower as fading optimism over the Brexit deal was offset by strong earnings from Sweden’s Ericsson. France’s CAC 40 index eased 0.4% after hitting a fresh 12-year high earlier, while Germany’s DAX closed down 0.1%, though near its strongest level in over a year. Shares in domestically focused British companies and Irish firms, which have been seen as a barometer on Brexit sentiment, also gave up initial gains. London’s benchmark FTSE index closed up 0.2% and the broad-market pan-European STOXX 600 fell 0.1%, while the FTSEurofirst index of leading regional European shares slid 0.12%. UK Gilts, German Bunds, gold and most other safe havens also rebounded after selling off. On Wall Street, Netflix Inc shares rose 3.0% in heavy trade after the video streaming service provider added slightly more paying subscribers than Wall Street expected in the third quarter. Morgan Stanley gained 2.27% after the big lender beat analysts’ expectations for quarterly profit, buoyed by higher revenue from bond trading and M&A advisory fees. Earnings season is dictating U.S. market moves, which has historically been the case, said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. “The buck stops with earnings,” Hooper said. “The good news is most earnings reports thus far have been positive and that’s provided some nice momentum for the market.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 68.11 points, or 0.25%, to 27,070.09. The S&P 500 gained 12.32 points, or 0.41%, to 3,002.01 and the Nasdaq Composite added 37.93 points, or 0.47%, to 8,162.12. Emerging-market stocks also gained for a sixth day - their longest winning streak since early April - after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators were nailing down a Phase 1 trade deal text for their presidents to sign next month. The dollar index fell 0.4%, with the euro up 0.47% to $1.1122. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.10% versus the greenback at 108.68 per dollar. Oil prices rebounded. Brent crude futures settled up 49 cents at $59.91 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 57 cents to settle at $53.93. Gold rose as weak U.S. retail sales rekindled fears of an economic slowdown and concerns about possible risks to the Brexit deal supported bullion. U.S. gold futures settled 0.3% higher at $1,498.30 an ounce. Reporting by Herbert Lash

2019,"FOREX-Dollar, pound tread water; Aussie bolstered by jobs report","* Dollar nurses overnight losses, risk appetite cautious * Pound on edge ahead of EU summit in Brussels * Aussie jumps after joblessness rate drops * Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Tom Westbrook HONG KONG, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The dollar drifted lower on Thursday after lacklustre U.S. retail data and gathering doubts about a Sino-U.S. trade deal, while the volatile pound was on edge as Britain and the European Union scrambled to secure a last-minute Brexit deal. As the greenback gave ground to major currencies, the biggest gainer was the Australian dollar, which jumped 0.4% from the session’s low after jobs data showed buoyant hiring, lowering chances of monetary easing in November. Sterling edged higher to $1.2828 after swinging about a five-month high overnight, knocked around by a series of mixed headlines on the likelihood of progress at an EU leaders summit in Brussels later on Thursday. It has surged some 5% since last week as negotiations stepped up. “I think we’re all grateful that we might be coming to some sort of an end to the recent saga,” said Nick Twidale, director of Sydney-based trade finance provider Xchainge. “Anything that isn’t a hard Brexit is going to be positive for the sterling,” he said, adding a deal or something close to one could push the pound to $1.3500 or above. Failure could drop it below $1.2200, Commonwealth Bank of Australia analyst Richard Grace said in a note. The U.S. dollar, meanwhile, had dropped on Wednesday as U.S. retail sales fell for the first time in seven months, painting a gloomy picture of the economy. It drifted 0.1% weaker against the euro to $1.1083 and was steady against the Japanese yen at 108.76. Against a basket of currencies the dollar hit a month low of 97.898 overnight and was steady around that level on Thursday. The Aussie jumped to $0.6786 after figures showed joblessness unexpectedly contracting a bit last month, taking some pressure off the central bank to further reduce interest rates in November. “This is just what the doctor ordered,” said CBA Chief Economist Craig James. “There is no reason for the Reserve Bank to cut rates again in November – giving the central bank more time to gauge the effectiveness of early rate reductions.” Lingering worries about trade tensions between the United States and China kept a lid on gains for trade-exposed currencies. Reports of a partial trade deal between the world’s two largest economies last week initially cheered markets, but a lack of details on the agreement has since curbed enthusiasm. “Even if a deal is signed, it remains uncertain if the obligations can be fully met on both sides,” strategists at Singapore’s DBS Bank said in a note. The New Zealand dollar was lower, following dovish comments from a top central banker on Wednesday, and sits at $0.6287, not far from a four-year low hit two weeks ago. China’s yuan weakened slightly to 7.0975 per dollar. (Reporting by Tom Westbrook; Editing by Sam Holmes)",Reuters
2019,"UPDATE 1-DUP leader says ""no"" to mooted Brexit compromise on tariffs","(Adds quotes on N.Ireland backstop, tariffs) By Padraic Halpin DUBLIN, Oct 15 (Reuters) - The small Northern Irish party supporting Britain’s minority government insisted on Tuesday that the region must remain within the United Kingdom customs union as part of any Brexit deal and not have to follow tariffs set by the European Union. While Britain and the EU made headway in eleventh-hour talks on Tuesday to reach a deal, the Democratic Unionist Party’s 10 lawmakers in London will play a key role in deciding whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson can pass any deal in parliament. The main obstacle is around customs, with diplomats and officials saying London is proposing that Northern Ireland stays in the UK customs area but that EU tariffs are applied on all goods crossing from mainland Britain to the island. Asked if the DUP could support an arrangement where Northern Ireland would stay in the UK customs territory but essentially adhere to the EU customs rules on tariffs, DUP leader Arlene Foster said “no because we would have no say in those tariffs and in relation to how those tariffs are set.” “We want to get a deal but it has to be a deal that respects the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom and that means all of the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland included,” Foster told BBC Northern Ireland. “I think it’s very important that we say that we must remain within the United Kingdom customs union, it’s a principle that has always been there and a principle that will forever be there. We have to be entirely within the United Kingdom.” “What we have to see is flexibility from the European Union, just as we have shown flexibility around the single market regulations... People have to get real and have to understand that we are part of the United Kingdom, will remain part of the United Kingdom and there has to be respect for that.” The EU has many doubts about the tariff plan, saying the system is too complicated, untested and not detailed enough at this stage. It believes the only possible deal to be had at an EU summit this week is a return to a ‘backstop’ solution - already rejected by Britain - of keeping Northern Ireland in the EU customs area. On the idea of a Northern Ireland-only backstop, Foster, who expects her party to engage with Johnson later on Tuesday, told Irish national broadcaster RTE: “When I hear talk of a Northern Ireland backstop, as I did in your headlines, I think things are very far off the mark in terms of all of that.” (Reporting by Padraic Halpin; editing by Kate Holton)",Reuters

2019,Wirecard rejects FT report as shares drop,"LONDON/BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s Wirecard (WDIG.DE) rejected allegations of impropriety on Tuesday after the Financial Times newspaper published documents on the company’s accounting practices which it said appeared to indicate an effort to inflate sales and profits. Shares in the payments group sank more than 20% and its euro-denominated bonds DE205218076= expiring in 2024 fell 7.4 cents to 91.01 on the Financial Times report. “Today’s article by the Financial Times is a compilation of a number of false and misleading allegations... which were already fully refuted before,” Wirecard said in a statement. At 1349 GMT, the company's shares were down 14.1% after hitting their lowest since April 24, making them the biggest faller on Germany's DAX 30 .GDAXI and on track for their worst day since early February. The newspaper published documents including internal company spreadsheets and related correspondence between senior members of Wirecard’s finance team, which, in an accompanying article, it said appeared to indicate an effort to inflate sales and profits at Wirecard’s businesses in Dubai and Ireland, as well as to potentially mislead EY, its tier-one auditor. Wirecard said it was regrettable that the Financial Times chose to publish “such an irresponsible” article. German markets regulator Bafin said it would include Tuesday’s share price drop in a market manipulation investigation it started in April after earlier FT reports on the company sent the stock sliding. “We are in very close coordination with Munich prosecutors,” a Bafin spokeswoman told financial news website Boerse Online. Tuesday’s FT report comes after the paper published a series of stories earlier this year alleging fraud and false accounting at Wirecard’s Singapore office and that a key Middle East unit was not properly audited. The company has already denied the FT’s previous allegations, saying that although Dubai-based subsidiary Card Systems was not individually audited, its books had undergone higher-level “full-scope” scrutiny by auditor EY.

2019,U.S. proposal would lift logging ban in pristine Alaska forest,"(Reuters) - The Trump administration on Tuesday proposed lifting longstanding restrictions on logging in a southeast Alaska forest, the nation’s largest national forest. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which manages federal forests, recommended exempting Alaska’s Tongass National Forest from the Clinton-era Roadless Rule that banned logging, roads and mining in undeveloped forests. The rule applies to 9.2 million acres, or 55 percent of the forest. The Tongass is the largest intact temperate rainforest in the world and spans 500 miles, covering most of southeast Alaska. The state’s capital, Juneau, is located in the Tongass. The USDA proposal is part of President Donald Trump’s broader effort to roll back environmental regulations to boost industry. The plan is subject to a 60-day public comment period once it is published in the Federal Register later this week. If adopted, it will mark a victory for Alaska state officials who petitioned for the change. Governor Mike Dunleavy and Senator Lisa Murkowski have said the 2001 rule has cost Alaskans jobs by limiting opportunities for development of industries such as timber, mining, tourism and energy. Alaska’s three-member Congressional delegation praised the proposal in a joint statement. “The U.S. Forest Service has a multi-use mandate for its lands that includes a timber harvest, and defending this mandate is key to ensuring that Alaska is entrusted to Alaskans,” Representative Don Young said. Environmental groups opposed the move, saying the Tongass’ trees absorb greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change and provide critical habitat for wildlife including salmon, bear, wolves and deer. “Alaska’s elected officials are selling out their constituents and robbing future generations by trying to strip protections from one of the most pristine old-growth forests in the world,” Randi Spivak, public lands director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement.

2019,Prince William and wife Kate see impact of climate change at Pakistan glacier,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Britain’s Prince William and his wife Kate on Wednesday visited a melting glacier in the Hindu Kush mountain range not far from Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan, witnessing first hand the impact of climate change their trip is seeking to highlight. They flew by helicopter to the northern tip of the Chiatibo glacier, where a climate change expert explained how it was retreating. It is one of the around 7,000 of Pakistan’s 7,200 glaciers that meteorological officials say show signs of melting, citing data gathered over the last 50 years. Earlier, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had stopped at an airport in Chitral and been given a traditional feathered mountain hat, similar to one gifted to William’s mother Princess Diana during her visit to the area in 1991. They were also given an album of photos of Diana during her visit. William highlighted the visit to the glacier and the challenge of climate change, a major theme of their five-day trip, in a speech the previous evening at a reception hosted by the British High Commission at Pakistan’s national monument in the capital, Islamabad. Pakistan’s northern glaciers and those throughout the Hindu Kush and Himalaya region, are an important water store for 250 million people, and another 1.6 billion rely on rivers originating in the mountains, putting many communities at risk as global temperatures rise. “This could lead to a loss of over a third of these vital glaciers in less than a century, with enormous impacts not only on the availability of water, but on agriculture and hydropower generation,” William said in his speech. He said he hoped Wednesday’s visit to Chitral would help the couple better understand the challenges residents were facing first hand. “I hope to learn what more we all can do to help prevent and mitigate this impending global catastrophe.” Kate and William later observed damage and emergency response drills in a village in Chitral that had been hit by floods due to glaciers melting. They also vistaed a settlement of the Kalash people, a small indigenous group living in the Chitral region where they met with young people and wore colourful local scarves and headwear while being treated to song and dance.

2019,Ukrainian captain expected to face charges over Danube boat disaster,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungarian prosecutors are expected to charge the captain of a cruise ship that struck and sank a small tourist vessel on the River Danube, killing 28 mostly Korean tourists, after police finished their investigation, officials said on Tuesday. The tourist boat Mermaid, with 35 people on board, sank in seconds in May after the river cruiser hit it from behind under a bridge in the Hungarian capital during heavy rain, in the worst disaster on the Danube in more than half a century. Lawyers for the Ukrainian cruiser captain, identified by police as 64-year-old C. Yuriy from Odessa, who has been in custody since he was arrested after the incident, have said he is devastated but did nothing wrong. They could not be reached for further comment on Tuesday. “The (cruiser) captain was definitely in the control cabin at the time of the accident,” Budapest deputy police chief Adrian Pal told a news conference announcing their investigation had been concluded. “Neither alcohol nor other psychoactive substances could be detected in his bloodstream,” Pal said. “He just did not notice the Mermaid, simple as that. He never saw it before he hit it.” Police transferred the case to prosecutors and proposed pressing formal charges against the captain. Their investigation did not establish the responsibility of anyone else on board the cruiser. Prosecution spokesman Ferenc Rab said prosecutors would prepare and submit charges after a mandatory 30-day waiting period, adding the captain would remain in custody to prevent him escaping. The precise charges will be determined by the prosecutor. Police were investigating him on suspicion of misconduct leading to mass casualties and 35 counts of failing to provide assistance. Seven people survived the sinking of the Mermaid. Two Hungarian crew were among the dead. The liner’s owner, Swiss-based Viking Cruises Ltd, has said it is cooperating with Hungarian investigators.

2019,European Investment Bank postpones decision on fossil fuel lending,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Investment Bank has postponed taking a decision on whether to stop financing fossil fuel projects to November, an official said on Tuesday, as the multilateral lender works out whether to keep financing gas projects for a period. The bank’s president, Werner Hoyer, is pushing for the bank to take the lead in financing sustainable projects, and proposed in July to stop its fossil fuel lending by the end of 2020. But Germany, Europe’s biggest economy and the EIB’s biggest shareholder, wants the bank to continue financing projects linked to natural gas, which produces less greenhouse gas emissions than coal or oil and which Germany and some other states want to use as a fuel to transition away from coal. “On the basis of what we discussed this morning I am increasingly confident that we will achieve final approval in November,” said Andrew McDowell, an EIB vice-president, told Reuters in an interview during the meeting. The EIB’s board, made up mostly of European Union finance ministers, has been discussing ways to make the bank greener by ending financing for fossil fuel-powered energy projects, but some countries heavily dependent on coal or gas have opposed the total ban of fossil fuel lending. Germany, Italy, Poland and Latvia want the bank to keep funding certain gas projects to help the transition from coal or nuclear power, or for energy security reasons. McDowell said the delay would “allow some more national reflection” after some countries asked for clarification on the proposal from EIB to completely stop funding fossil fuel-linked projects from the end of next year. EIB figures show it funded almost 2 billion euros ($2.10 billion) of fossil fuel projects last year, drawing ire from Green lawmakers and environmental groups. “The possibility of transforming the European Investment Bank into a climate bank is vanishing,” said Alex Doukas, lead analyst at think tank Oil Change International, joining other environmental groups such as WWF urging member states to support the EIB proposal at the upcoming Nov. 14 board meeting.

2019,Atlantia's motorway unit to pick outside company for safety inspections,"MILAN (Reuters) - Infrastructure group Atlantia will hand monitoring and safety checks of its Italian motorway network to an outside company after the deadly collapse of a bridge operated by its toll-road unit, the subsidiary said on Tuesday. Atlantia’s Autostrade per l’Italia unit said these services would no longer be handled by Atlantia’s Spea Engineering unit, which is at the heart of a criminal probe stemming from the bridge collapse in 2018. Atlantia and its units have denied any wrongdoing. Following the Genoa disaster, several employees at Autostrade and Spea were put under investigation for allegedly falsifying safety reports on nine bridges operated by Atlantia’s motorway unit, two sources told Reuters. The two subsidiaries of Atlantia, which is controlled by the Benetton family famous for its clothing label, are also formal suspects in a separate enquiry over the Genoa bridge. Autostrade CEO Roberto Tomasi on Tuesday outlined to board members a plan to spend an additional 360 million euros ($400 million) for maintenance work on the motorway network. Ruling party 5-Star Movement has repeatedly urged the government to strip Autostrade of its motorway concession, which accounts for one-third of group core earnings.

Spot gold dropped 0.1% to $1,487.81 per ounce as of 0729 GMT, having shed 1% in the previous week. U.S. gold futures inched up 0.2% to $1,492.20 per ounce. “Gold is not moving on gold fundamentals, it is moving on whatever is going on with the trade situation,” OANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley said. “The trade deal was short on detail, but is still going to be enough to probably support risk, and that will be negative for gold.” U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday outlined the first phase of a deal to end the protracted Sino-U.S. trade war and suspended a threatened tariff hike, the biggest step by the two countries in 15 months. Asian stock markets cheered the news, with MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan up 1.1% in light trade. The dollar index climbed higher from a three-week low hit in the previous session, and traded near multi-month highs versus the yen, also considered a safe-haven asset. “The positive headline is encouraging. However, we saw the same move before in April .... This time may be different as timing could be the catalyst for both sides to go ahead with the talk without derailing the situation,” OCBC Bank said in a note referring to the U.S.-China trade talks. Tepid data from China brewed concerns that the world’s second largest economy was hurt by the ongoing trade spat, as exports in September fell 3.2% from a year earlier. Meanwhile, markets await Britain and the European Union’s talks later in the day, ahead of a summit on Thursday and Friday. Both parties said that a lot more work would be needed to secure an agreement on Britain’s departure from the bloc, scheduled for Oct. 31. Gold is generally used by investors as a hedge against political and financial uncertainty. “We remain optimistic on bullion prospects as central banks enact for monetary-policy easing programmes over looming downside risks in the global economy,” Phillip Futures analyst Benjamin Lu said in a note. Spot gold may fall to $1,446 per ounce, as it has cleared a support at $1,488, Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao said. Among other precious metals, silver inched 0.3% higher to $17.59 per ounce and platinum dropped 0.3% to $886.69. Palladium rose 0.2% to $1,702.63 an ounce, hovering close to its record high of $1,705.84 on Friday.

2019,Ostapenko eases past Goerges to claim Luxembourg title,"(Reuters) - Former French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko proved too strong for defending champion Julia Goerges in the Luxembourg Open final as she cruised past the German 6-4 6-1 on Sunday. The 22-year-old Latvian, who captured her first Grand Slam title at Roland Garros in 2017, won the third WTA crown of her career with a solid display in her second final of the year. Just when she looked like she was shedding the inconsistency that has dogged her game in recent months, Ostapenko was beaten by 15-year-old Coco Gauff of the United States in the Linz Open final last week. But the Luxembourg wild card was in no mood to let another opportunity slip by in her final tournament of the year, sealing the decider on the back of her superb serve. “Of course it’s great to finish the season with winning a title, especially in the last tournament,” said Ostapenko, who fired six aces and won 83% of points off her first serve. “I enjoyed this week so much. I think I played really well today. I just like to finish the year this way. Especially after making the final last week, I was much more confident in coming to this tournament.” Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by David Goodman",Reuters
2019,California governor demands PG&E accountability for mismanaging power shutoffs,"Oct 14 (Reuters) - California Governor Gavin Newsom said on Monday that Pacific Gas and Electric Co (PG&E) should be held accountable for mismanaging last week’s power shutoffs and urged the company to provide credits or rebates to affected customers. PG&E had imposed a string of planned power outages of unprecedented scale to reduce wildfire risks posed by extremely windy, dry weather that left more than 730,000 homes and workplaces in northern California without power. Newsom also said he sent a letter to California Public Utilities Commission President Marybel Batjer, confirming that the agency will be conducting a comprehensive inquiry and review of PG&E's planning, implementation and decision-making process failures. (bit.ly/35zARTI) “Californians should not pay the price for decades of PG&E’s greed and neglect,” Newsom said. “We will continue to hold PG&E accountable to make radical changes – prioritizing the safety of Californians and modernizing its equipment.” Newsom also urged the company to provide affected customers an automatic credit or rebate of $100 per residential customer and $250 per small business as compensation. PG&E filed for bankruptcy in January 2019, citing potential civil liabilities in excess of $30 billion from major wildfires linked to its transmission wires and other equipment.

2019,Maple Leafs score five of final six to beat Red Wings,"EditorsNote: Adds missing “the” before Detroit in lead; removes second use of Kerfoot’s & Moore’s first names; Nicholas Shore and Ilya Mikheyev each had a goal and an assist as the visiting Toronto Maple Leafs downed the Detroit Red Wings 5-2 on Saturday. Alexander Kerfoot, Jake Muzzin and Trevor Moore also scored for the Leafs, while Frederik Andersen made 25 saves. Jacob de la Rose had a goal and an assist for the Wings and Darren Helm also scored. Jimmy Howard stopped 36 shots. The game was tied 1-1 after the first period. Detroit scored first at 3:44. Patrik Nemeth took a shot from the point, which was deflected by de la Rose and stopped by Andersen. De la Rose scooped up the rebound and backhanded it into the net. Toronto, which outshot Detroit 13-9 during the period, tied it at the 9:57 mark. Detroit defenseman Dennis Cholowski had the puck taken away by Dmytro Timashov, who passed it to Shore. He cut to his left and scored on a backhander. Toronto had an 11-8 shots advantage in the second period and scored in the final minute. Mikheyev got behind the defense after Kasperi Kapanen flipped the puck out of his zone. Howard came out of the crease but Mikheyev beat him to the puck and fired it into the empty net. Kerfoot scored off a rebound at 9:11 of the third period. Toronto won a faceoff in the Detroit zone. Howard made a pad save off a Mikheyev shot but Kerfoot pounced on the rebound and tossed it into the net. Helm scored for the second time in as many games just 24 seconds later to cut the Leafs’ lead to one. Justin Abdelkader passed the puck from behind the Toronto net to Helm, who beat Andersen over his left shoulder. Anthony Mantha nearly tied it moments later when his shot bounced off the crossbar. Muzzin scored his first goal of the season on a wrist shot off a Timashov feed to give the Leafs a two-goal cushion again. Shore also assisted on the goal at 13:34. Moore scored an empty-netter to clinch Toronto’s win. —Field Level Media ",Reuters
2019,Tyson Foods bans growth drug from U.S. hog supply as meat firms chase China demand,"(Reuters) - Tyson Foods Inc in February will stop buying U.S. hogs raised with a growth drug banned by China, the company said on Thursday, as global meat suppliers seek an edge in boosting sales to Chinese buyers facing a huge pork shortage due to an outbreak of a fatal pig disease. The halt in the use of the drug, ractopamine, reflects a change in strategy for Tyson, company watchers say. The company previously sought to profit by filling holes in U.S. supplies that were left when industry rivals like Smithfield Foods and JBS USA sent American pork to China. Now, Tyson, Smithfield and JBS - the top three U.S. pork processors - are vying for business in China, the world’s biggest pork consumer, where an outbreak of African swine fever has devastated the hog herd, pushed pork prices to record highs and sent imports rocketing. Though not harmful to humans, the disease is deadly to pigs, with no vaccine available. But U.S. companies have to cope with a significant handicap compared to suppliers based elsewhere. Beijing has imposed tariffs on imports of U.S. pork due to the long-running trade war between the world’s two biggest economies. “Of course it’s all to pave the way to get ready to start shipping very large amounts of pork to China,” said Dennis Smith, a commodity broker for Archer Financial Services in Chicago. Tyson, the biggest U.S. meat producer, is “the last shoe to drop,” said Smith, who said he learned of the policy change from a farmer. The company already generates almost $1 billion in pork export sales annually. “We believe the move to prohibit ractopamine use will allow Tyson Fresh Meats and the farmers who supply us to compete more effectively for export opportunities in even more countries,” Steve Stouffer, president of Tyson Fresh Meats, said in a statement. China’s pork imports climbed 76% in September from a year earlier with African swine fever having decimated its domestic hog herd, according to Chinese government data. The disease surfaced more than a year ago in China - the first time it had been detected in Asia - and has since spread to more than 50 countries, according to the World Organization of Animal Health, including those accounting for 75% of global pork production. Chinese authorities blocked the use of ractopamine in livestock in 2002 over health concerns, and the European Union also prohibits the drug. The United States and other countries say it can be safely used to add lean muscle to pigs. Tyson previously offered a small amount of ractopamine-free pork to export customers by working with farmers who raise hogs without the feed additive. Those programs “no longer adequately meet growing global demand,” Tyson said. Tyson’s share price was down 1.3 percent at $80.80 in Thursday morning trade. JBS USA, owned by Brazil’s JBS SA, said this month it would remove ractopamine from its hog supply chain. Smithfield, owned by China’s WH Group, raises pigs on company-owned and contract farms without the drug, but still processes pigs from other farmers who use ractopamine. Elanco Animal Health manufactures a ractopamine feed ingredient under the brand name ‘Paylean’. “We’re disappointed in any decision that would take safe, proven technology out of the hands of farmers,” Elanco spokeswoman Keri McGrath said in a statement Thursday.

Turkey agreed with the United States on Thursday to pause its military offensive in northeastern Syria for five days while Kurdish fighters withdrew from a “safe zone”. Erdogan will visit Sochi for emergency talks with Putin on what steps to take next.

2019,South Sudan's Machar says unlikely to be part of unity government by Nov. 12,"JUBA (Reuters) - South Sudan’s main opposition leader told a visiting United Nations Security Council delegation on Sunday that he will not be part of a unity government next month, dashing the prospects of progress in a stalled peace process. Former rebel leader Riek Machar said the parties have failed to agree on ways to integrate the army, a key condition of a peace accord signed last year, and could not see how they could form a government without it. “We in the SPLM-IO won’t be there because we don’t want to put the country into crisis,” he said. “The aspect needed for the establishment of such a government is not there.” President Salva Kiir and Machar signed a peace deal in September 2018 after a string of failed agreements to end a civil conflict that has led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands, displaced a third of the population and ruined the country’s economy. The U.N. Security Council delegation said that the problems identified by Machar can be solved by the Nov. 12 deadline. “What Dr. Riek Machar is asking is not impossible to do in the next three weeks but need the political leaders to say (we are) going to do it,” Jerry Matthews Matjila, South Africa’s Ambassador to the U.N., told reporters. Kelly Craft, the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., said that they are still holding to the Nov. 12 deadline. “We expect both the government and the oppositions to unify together and to be able to put their people first,” she said.  In May, the two sides agreed to form a unity government in six months and in September said that they will establish a transitional government by Nov.12 as part of the deal. The pact has stalled because the government has said it does not have the finances to fund the disarmament and integration of the army. Machar said he met with Kiir on Sunday to discuss the security arrangements and they could not come to an agreement on the issue. “The security arrangement has to be in place,” he said. The parties have also been unable to conclude negotiations on regional states, another crucial component of the pact. South Sudan’s cabinet affairs minister Martin Elia said the head of the army Gabriel Jok Riak has assured them that 3000 members of a protection force will be ready before Nov. 12, 900 of whom will be from Machar’s group. “Machar should not complain about the delay in implementing some of the key mechanisms because he has representatives in all the committees,” he said.  South Sudan aims to hold elections after a transition period of three years. The country secured independence from north Sudan in 2011 after decades of war but descended into its own conflict at the end of 2013 after Kiir sacked Machar as vice president. The United States has said that it will not accept more delays to the formation of a transitional government and will re-evaluate its relationship with South Sudan and may impose sanctions on leaders if a government is not formed by Nov. 12. The Security Council urged the parties to set aside their disagreements for the sake of peace. “Now it is time to make a compromise necessary for the formation of the transitional government of national unity,” Craft said.

2019,Mexican president confirms Pemex union boss under investigation,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The veteran leader of Mexico’s powerful oil workers’ union faces formal accusations of wrongdoing, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Tuesday, slowly turning up pressure on the labor boss to step aside. Earlier this year, sources said the attorney general’s office had accused Pemex union chief Carlos Romero Deschamps and several relatives of illicit enrichment and money laundering, charges he has consistently denied. “Complaints have been presented to the attorney general’s office,” Lopez Obrador told a regular news conference. “If he decides to leave the union so that he can attend to these issues, that’s his right. But we will not get involved.” “I think anyone who faces a complaint like this and at the same time is in charge of a union,” he added, “it’s best not to involve institutions and handle it on a personal level.” Still, the president added there would be no “persecution” of Romero Deschamps, and said the case should be handled with strict adherence to the law. The union did not immediately respond to a request for comment after Lopez Obrador’s remarks. Romero Deschamps, a former senator, has led the oil workers union since 1993 and his current term is set to end in 2024 - the same year that Lopez Obrador’s term as president concludes. Union members make up the vast majority of employees at national oil company Pemex, a state-run company Lopez Obrador has pledged to strengthen while rooting out corruption. Media reports of the lavish lifestyle of Romero Deschamps and his family, which included trips on private jets and the purchase of luxury sports cars, despite his modest official salary, have for years stoked accusations of corruption.

2019,Xiaomi says widening India product range to shed budget image,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - China’s Xiaomi Corp is shedding its image as a budget brand by widening its India product portfolio to include pricier, high-spec smartphones and smart TVs, a senior company executive said on Monday. Xiaomi, which began selling devices in India in 2014, has outflanked South Korea’s Samsung Electronics as India’s top smartphone player, according to tech research firm Counterpoint. The Beijing-headquartered company’s devices, typically become instant sellers on e-commerce websites and top sales in the up to $250 price-segment. But Xiaomi’s more expensive smartphones face stiffer competition from Samsung and Chinese rivals Oppo and Vivo. And technology analysts say it is seen as a cheap or budget brand by customers. Xiaomi has tried to change that by launching phones with high-end processors and cameras, priced above 20,000 rupees. “We are inching up in the entire ASP (average selling price) curve,” Muralikrishnan B, the Chief Operating Officer of Xiaomi’s India unit told Reuters. “There is acceptance coming in at the higher end of the price band and in our definition higher end is now 30,000 (rupees)” Xiaomi’s range of smart TVs, priced from 11,999 to 54,999 rupees, and other internet-enabled products have also helped bolster its smartphones sales and brand image. “There are various ways in which you make inroads into the consumers psyche, into their home and help one category grow from the other,” Muralikrishnan said. Xiaomi, which sells the bulk of its smartphones online, is also expanding its retail network in India: it will open 10,000 stores in the country by mid-2020 from over 6,000 stores currently. It also plans to soon launch a consumer lending business in India, its biggest market outside of China. On Wednesday, Xiaomi unveiled two new phone models and a new version of their operating system, based on Google’s Android mobile platform.

2019,China's 2019 coal imports set to rise more than 10%: analysts,"BEIJING/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - China, the world’s top coal buyer, is on track to boost imports of the fuel by more than 10% this year, traders and analysts said on Tuesday, countering earlier expectations that shipments would be capped by Beijing at the same level as 2018. China’s coal imports have already surged 9.5% in the first nine months of 2019 to 250.57 million tonnes, customs data shows, and at least 18.84 million tonnes of seaborne coal are due to arrive this month, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Refinitiv. With China typically bringing in about 7 million tonnes more a month on trucks and trains from Mongolia and Russia, total volumes are likely to reach 276 million tonnes well before the end of the year. Last year’s total was 281.23 million tonnes. “Signs are emerging of a modest recovery in coal import volumes into China, which has led to recent market speculation that the Chinese government may allow a relatively modest uplift in annual imports to around 300 million tonnes,” said Whitehaven Coal Ltd, Australia’s largest independent coal producer, in a note on Tuesday. Energy consultancy IHS Markit expects that China may bring in around 320 million tonnes of coal this year. Some Singapore-based coal traders forecast Chinese coal imports could reach at least 305 million tonnes. Graphic: China's monthly coal imports in 2015-2019, here The rise in imports comes even after Beijing has pledged to curb coal use to tackle persistent severe pollution in the world’s top energy market. Last year it took drastic measures to cap its shipments, halting all clearance of coal cargoes at major ports in December, which sent imports plunging to just 10 million tonnes that month, down from an average monthly level of 22 million tonnes. “Government priority at this moment is to boost the economy ... Relaxing coal imports curb would help maintain a moderate coal price and therefore cut electricity prices in order to reduce energy costs for Chinese enterprises,” said Liu Xiaomin, analyst at IHS Markit in Beijing. Analysts and traders warned that the customs authorities could still take such action however, and said they are closely watching for any change in import policy. “The market is full of uncertainties at this moment. We have to wait until at least the end of October to see if a new policy will come out,” said a Beijing-based coal trader with a leading German power company. IHS Markit’s Liu also warned the import policy may be adjusted anytime based on coal prices and the economic situation in China. Still, buyers have not slowed their purchases, thanks to a large spread between domestic and imported coal prices and increasing demand for the fuel ahead of northern China’s heating season that kicks off next month, said three other traders with major power utilities and trading houses. Port prices for Chinese thermal coal with energy content of 5,500 kilocalories per kilogramme (Kcal) were around 575 yuan ($81.25) a tonne on Monday, while Australian coal of the same quality was sold at $53 a tonne FOB.

2019,UPDATE 1-EU criticizes 'unlevel playing field' in Mozambique election,"(Adds ruling party comments) By Manuel Mucari MAPUTO, Oct 17 (Reuters) - A European Union observer mission to Mozambique’s election raised the alarm on Thursday over unfair conditions and unjustified use of state resources by the ruling party, as well as widespread violence. Results are not in yet from Tuesday’s presidential, legislative and provincial poll. But its outcome will test a fragile peace deal between the ruling Frelimo party and its old civil war foe turned opposition rival Renamo. Any reports of irregularities or fraud are likely to put the two-month-old agreement at risk. “An unlevel playing field was evident throughout the campaign,” the EU mission said in a statement. “The ruling party dominated the campaign in all provinces and benefited from ... incumbency, including unjustified use of state resources, and more police escorts and media coverage than opponents.” Frelimo spokesman Caifadine Manasse said the EU claims were “unfounded”. “Frelimo went to these elections as a governing party, but competed on equal terms with the other parties,” Manasse said. “The European Union is acting badly in making such pronouncements ...We work on the ground using our means, the means of the Frelimo party and the candidate.” The election is widely expected to return President Filipe Nyusi to power, and extend his party’s decades-long rule over a southern African nation set to become one of the world’s main gas exporters. Very few results have yet trickled out, although an official at the electoral commission said they may start coming out on Friday — the law allows 15 days in total after the vote. Under the peace deal, Renamo will be able to choose governors for the first time in any provinces it wins, instead of them being appointed by the central government in Maputo. Yet there are fears of unrest if it fails to win any. The electoral campaign has already been marred by violence. “Inter-party violence was prevalent as well as mistrust between the main political parties and a lack of confidence that the electoral administration ... (was) independent,” the EU said, adding that there was also little public trust in the independence of the police. The run-up to the vote was marred by sporadic violence, including the killing of an election observer and attacks from a breakaway group of Renamo fighters, with one person reported killed. African observer missions were more sanguine, with both the African Union team lead by former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan and the Southern Africa bloc SADC praising the poll for being peaceful and well organised. “We commend (the electoral commission) and the state for conducting successful, peaceful and orderly elections,” SADC mission chief Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri told journalists. “Parties and people must be patient and remain committed to Peace as the results are being compiled for validation,” said Muchinguri-Kashiri, who is Zimbabwe’s defence minister. The former rebel movement Renamo seeks to control its traditional heartlands in central and northern provinces but it faces the waning popularity of its candidate, Ossufo Momade, and a challenge from younger opposition party, the MDM. Momade warned against any manipulation of the results on Tuesday. (Reporting by Manuel Mucari Writing by Olivia Kumwenda-Mtambo and Tim Cocks Editing by Frances Kerry and Tom Brown)",Reuters
2019,Mexico's Senate aims to pass bills cutting bank fees by end-October: MORENA,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s Senate aims to pass a first raft of bills to regulate fees for financial services by the end of October, said Ricardo Monreal, Senate leader of the ruling National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) party. Last November, shortly before President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office, MORENA lawmakers presented a bill to limit bank fees, sparking an investor backlash that pummeled the peso MXN=, Mexico's S&P/BMV IPC stock index and banking shares. The bill, which is sponsored by Monreal, has since then been wrapped up in negotiations with Mexico’s central bank, the finance ministry and Mexico’s banking association (ABM). In “two weeks (we’ll) pass an initial package of initiatives,” Monreal said in an interview with Reuters on Monday. “We’re going step by step,” he added, saying the first group of bills would change 32 articles and three laws. If approved by the Senate, the package would pass to the lower house. MORENA and its allies hold big majorities in both. The planned changes mostly relate to transparency and including more Mexicans in the banking system, which is in banks’ interest, Monreal said. “There is resistance,” he added. “But I think (banks) have understood ... they must reduce these sorts of charges,” a reference to fees in general. His plan includes a proposal that banks exempt accounts smaller than 18,700 pesos ($970) from certain fees, as well as free up such accounts from other charges. A study by financial products watchdog Condusef said 30% of Mexican banks’ revenue on average comes from their fees, which Monreal called “among the highest in the world.” The ABM represents banks such as BBVA (BBVA.MC), Santander (SAN.MC), the Mexican unit of Citigroup (C.N), Grupo Financiero Banorte (GFNORTEO.MX), and billionaire Carlos Slim’s Grupo Financiero Inbursa (GFINBURO.MX). Separately, Monreal, a 59-year-old veteran of Mexican politics, said Congress will by Oct. 20 approve a proposal to apply a value-added tax on digital businesses. The VAT rate at Mexico currently stands at 16%.    Under the initiative, companies such as Amazon (AMZN.O), Uber (UBER.N) or Google (GOOGL.O), will be responsible for paying the tax, the senator said. “They have to pay without hitting the consumer. From what they make now,” he said. “It would be very easy to charge the consumer for it. They have to absorb it as part of their costs.” The initiative also obliges platforms such as Netflix (NFLX.O) to produce at least 30% worth of their Mexico programing within the country, said Monreal.

2019,China copper smelters hike fourth-quarter treatment charge floor ahead of 2020 talks,"KUNMING, China/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China’s top copper smelters on Thursday raised their fourth-quarter floor treatment and refining charges (TC/RCs) by 20% from the previous quarter, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. The China Smelters Purchase Team (CSPT) set the treatment charge floor at $66 per tonne, and the refining charge floor at 6.6 cents a pound at a meeting in Shanghai, said the sources, who asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. That was up from $55 a tonne and 5.5 cents a pound in the third quarter, but still below the $90 a tonne and 9 cents a pound set for the fourth quarter of last year. “Easing (restrictions) from an Indonesian miner ...and compounding smelters’ closures and maintenance in October both contribute to spot TC’s hike, then a CSPT floor price hike, and hopefully a benchmark hike next year,” said a trader with a private smelter. Last month, Indonesia authorities approved an increase in copper concentrate exports for a unit of Freeport McMoran Inc, while research house Antaike said there were plans for some smelting overhauls in October. Copper miners pay TC/RCs to smelters to process their ore into refined metal. Higher charges indicate more abundant concentrate supply or that smelters have less need. The floor price agreed on Thursday also serves as an indication of the position that smelters in China, the world’s top copper consumer, will take in negotiations on a TC/RC benchmark for 2020, used for longer-term deals. The benchmark is usually determined at a major November copper gathering in Shanghai. Even as spot TC/RCs usually hike in the fourth quarter, a source at a large mining firm said he saw no fundamentals-based rationale behind the move, given recent supply disruptions and a decline in spot TC/RCs this year. “I don’t think they can buy a lot of tonnes of clean concentrate at that spot number,” the source said, noting a supply disruption at the giant Las Bambas mine in Peru. Smelter expansions in China, including Zijin Mining’s recent launch of a 150,000 tonnes per year plant in the northeastern city of Qiqihar, has also added to competition for concentrate. Spot TC/RCs bottomed at a near seven-year low of $55.50 earlier this month before edging up to $56.50 a tonne, having fallen around 38% this year, squeezing smelters’ margins. CSPT members are supposed to adhere to the floor charges in any spot processing deals. Huludao Dongfang Copper Industry Co Ltd, part-owned by Metallurgical Corp of China, and Zhejiang Jiangtong Fuye Heding Copper Co Ltd, a joint venture of CSPT member Jiangxi Copper, are joining the CSPT, three smelter sources said, which would increase the group’s membership to 12. It was not immediately clear when the two firms, accounting for some 450,000-tonne annual capacity combined, would officially become members.

2019,NHL roundup: Penguins rout Jets for 3rd straight win,"Sam Lafferty, Jake Guentzel and Zach Aston-Reese each scored twice as the Pittsburgh Penguins won their third game in a row, defeating the host Winnipeg Jets 7-2 Sunday. Dominik Simon also scored for the Penguins and goaltender Tristan Jarry made 27 saves. Mathieu Perreault and Mark Scheifele scored for the Jets, who had their three-game winning streak snapped. Goalie Laurent Brossoit stopped 21 of 28 shots. Lafferty, who was recalled from Wilkes-Barre/Scranton of the American Hockey League last week due to a rash of injuries to Penguins forwards, scored his first NHL goal in a 7-4 victory Saturday at Minnesota. He has three goals and two assists in four games. Sharks 3, Flames 1 Tomas Hertl netted one goal and one assist while Logan Couture collected two assists to lead host San Jose to its second straight win. Martin Jones made 32 saves for the Sharks. Despite the visitors holding the early momentum, San Jose’s Timo Meier opened the scoring 3:04 into the affair, converting on the first shot on goal against Flames goalie Cam Talbot. Couture fired the puck to the front of the net from the corner and the puck banked off Meier’s skate and past Talbot for Meier’s first goal of the season. Patrick Marleau, playing his first game in San Jose after rejoining the Sharks following two seasons away, also collected an assist. It’s the first time this season the Sharks opened the scoring. Golden Knights 5, Kings 2 Paul Stastny had two goals and two assists and Max Pacioretty added a goal and two assists to lead visiting Vegas to a victory over Los Angeles. It was the 250th goal of Pacioretty’s career. Reilly Smith and Mark Stone also scored goals for Vegas, which converted all three of its power-play chances. The Golden Knights had entered the contest just 3 of 17 on the power play. Marc-Andre Fleury finished with 36 saves for Vegas and Shea Theodore added a pair of assists. It was also the 250th NHL coaching victory for Golden Knights coach Gerard Gallant. —Field Level Media",Reuters

2019,"BOJ's Kuroda says global growth rebound seen delayed, signals easy bias","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said any pickup in global economic growth will likely be delayed due to the widening fallout from the U.S.-China trade tensions, signaling the bank’s readiness to ease monetary policy as early as this month. But he added the central bank will scrutinise various data “without any preconception” at its Oct. 30-31 rate review, suggesting that additional monetary easing this month was hardly a done deal. “As we have been saying, we will ease policy without hesitation if there are heightened risks the economy will lose momentum for achieving our 2% inflation target,” Kuroda said. “We have tools available to act. But what we will do would depend on developments at each policy meeting,” he told reporters on Thursday upon arrival in Washington for the International Monetary Fund and Group of 20 finance leaders’ gatherings. The remarks came after the IMF warned on Tuesday that the U.S.-China trade war will cut 2019 global growth to its slowest pace since the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Kuroda said that based on the IMF’s projections, it was now more likely that any rebound in global growth would be delayed from the BOJ’s initial projection of around late this year through early next year. “The pick-up in global growth is being delayed. Japan’s economy is seeing exports weaken significantly and that’s affecting factory output,” he said. “Domestic demand is firm with consumption and capital expenditure in good shape. But external demand is very weak.” Kuroda also warned that global risks remain elevated as there was uncertainty on how the U.S.-China trade negotiations and Britian’s exit from the European Union will play out. At last month’s meeting, the BOJ said it will more thoroughly assess economic and price developments at the October rate review due to heightening global risks - offering the strongest sign to date of its readiness to ease policy soon. Kuroda had said the expected timing of the global growth pickup will be crucial to whether the BOJ will act this month. Reporting by Leika Kihara; Editing by Andrea Ricci",Reuters

2019,Renault chairman vows to get Nissan alliance back on track next year,"PARIS (Reuters) - Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard is determined to get the carmaker’s alliance with Japan’s Nissan (7201.T) back on track next year, he said on Tuesday, adding other matters such as a potential tie-up with Fiat Chrysler were less of a priority. The Renault-Nissan partnership was rocked by former alliance boss Carlos Ghosn’s arrest in Tokyo almost a year ago on financial misconduct charges, which he denies. The two firms are still trying to repair relations, including through recent management overhauls, to focus again on combined efforts to cut costs and invest in new technologies - among the pressing issues thrown into sharp relief by a Renault (RENA.PA) profit warning last week. “My obsession is for the alliance to take off in 2020,” Senard told France Inter radio. “If, by 2020, we don’t manage to start extracting ... all the potential of this alliance, I’ll consider it to be a failure, on a personal level and by our teams.” Senard did not give further details. But he added that other matters, such as attempting to revive merger talks with Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI) (FCAU.N), which were abandoned in June, were secondary to the industrial projects Renault and Nissan needed to work on. “Today, it’s not on the table,” Senard said of a Fiat deal. He added reducing Renault’s 43.3% stake in Nissan, which could help improve relations, was also not top of his list. “Nothing can ever be excluded, (but) this is not what we’re focused on,” Senard said. Senard was parachuted in from tyre maker Michelin in early 2019 to help steady Renault, which is 15% owned by the French state. Earlier this month, the carmaker ousted CEO Thierry Bollore, a former Ghosn protegee known for having a strained relationship with Nissan, as it tries to wipe the slate clean with its Japanese partner. “I discovered an alliance in worse shape than I’d imagined ... this takes time to mend,” Senard said. Renault, which said last week it was reviewing some mid-term targets, is due to release more details about its third quarter performance on Oct. 25.

2019,Brazil's Bolsonaro suggests oil spill could be attempt to sabotage auction," (This October 18 story has been refiled to change to 200 tonnes of oil from 200 million tonnes in paragraph 5) RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro questioned on Friday whether a far-reaching oil spill on the nation’s northeastern shore may have been a criminal act designed to harm a major oil auction scheduled for November. “Coincidence or not, we have the transfer-of-rights auction,” said Bolsonaro in a Facebook Live video, referring to an oil bidding scheduled for Nov. 6, in which an array of major oil players will compete for $26 billion worth of production rights in large offshore oil areas of Brazil. “I wonder, we have to be very responsible about what we say - could it have been a criminal act to harm this auction? It’s a question that’s out there.” Bolsonaro offered no evidence for his statements. Oil has been washing up on the shore of northeastern Brazil for two months, but its origin has remained a mystery so far. On Wednesday, Brazilian state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA said it had cleaned up some 200 tonnes of the oil from Brazil’s beaches. On Thursday, the head of Brazil’s environmental regulator said tests had proved the oil was Venezuelan. He said that the cause of the spill was criminal in nature, as it would otherwise have been reported. He added, however, that Venezuela may not be responsible for the spill, even if the oil originated there. Venezuela has denied responsibility for the oil.

2019,COLUMN-The battery metal no one wants to talk about: Andy Home,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Andy Home LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - It accounts for around 75% of all rechargeable energy storage around the world. It is in just about every car and truck, regardless of whether the vehicle has an internal-combustion engine, uses hybrid technology or is pure electric. Its proven reliability makes it the metal of choice for energy back-up services in hospitals, telephone exchanges, emergency services and public buildings. It is one of the most recycled materials in the modern world, more so than glass or paper, with the United States and Europe boasting near 100% recycling rates. Yet it is largely absent from any discussion of battery materials in the coming electric vehicle and energy storage revolutions. Welcome to lead. THE LEAD-ACID BATTERY The lead-acid battery was invented in 1859 by a French physicist, Gaston Plante. While plenty of other scientists were experimenting with electrical storage in the middle of the 19th century, Plante’s breakthrough was to create a battery that could be recharged. The lead-acid battery was quickly adopted by the newly emerging automotive sector, which at the time was experimenting with both internal-combustion and electric propulsion systems. Although the industry plumped for internal combustion, lead-acid batteries became the power source of choice for starting, lighting and ignition (SLI) functions. And they still are. Even most pure electric vehicles use lead-acid batteries for SLI purposes as well as newer functions such as electronic door-locking and in-car entertainment. Technical innovation of the lead-acid battery has been incremental rather than revolutionary over the last century, but that’s started to change with a new generation of more powerful batteries produced to meet the tougher demands of stop-start engine technology. The Consortium for Battery Innovation (CBI) relaunched earlier this year to stimulate research into “advanced” lead batteries, with one eye on the burgeoning market for energy storage systems. Lead should be a core component of future energy storage, given its proven technical track record, relatively low cost and security of supply based on an already high recycling rate. There is just one problem. Lead is poisonous. Which hasn’t stopped mankind using it in all sorts of inappropriate ways, from the Romans adding it as a sweetener to wine to Victorian women using lead-based make-up. The two most insidious historical uses, though, have been in pipes for drinking water and in gasoline. Both still cast a long shadow over the metal’s reputation in large part because of the reluctance of producers and authorities in conceding there was a problem. Lead was added to gasoline in the United States in the 1920s and despite mounting evidence of its toxicity, not least for workers employed in the industry, was fully removed only in 1996. Lead piping remains an issue to this day. The U.S. state of New Jersey unveiled a $120 million plan in August to speed up the replacement of old lead pipes in Newark after tests found that some of the water filters previously distributed were not working properly. The city even handed out bottled water to some residents. Newark follows a similar lead-pipe scandal in the city of Flint in Michigan in 2015 and a Reuters investigation in 2016 found nearly 3,000 places in the United States with lead poisoning rates much higher than those in Flint. Lead poisoning, in other words, is still an active issue even in the developed world. Which is why it is largely absent in any public discussion of the “green technology” revolution. Even the CBI has changed its name from the Advanced Lead Acid Battery Consortium. No prizes for working out which word has been dropped. The lead-acid battery faces an uphill battle in terms of grabbing more market share from the energy storage sector. This is partly out of the industry’s control. It can’t, for example, force U.S. city authorities to spend the money to replace old lead piping. What it can do is try to spread the recycling message beyond the developed world into the developing world, where recycling regulations are, to quote the International Lead Association (ILA), often “inadequate, non-existent or ineffectively enforced”. The ILA was last month one of several signatories to a binding memorandum of cooperation to “improve global health, safety and environmental performance in the supply chain of lead acid batteries”. Also involved are the Battery Council International, European battery association EUROBAT and the Association of Battery Recyclers. The message is being picked up in China, where the environment ministry this year published an action plan to boost recycling of lead-acid batteries to 40% by 2020 and 70% by 2025, according to “BEST Battery Briefing”. Critically, though, the ministry also declared lead-acid batteries a “key commodity” with production and recycling described as “backbone enterprises”. China, for one, it seems is not ready to get rid of the lead-acid battery. Nor is the rest of the world. Even though the lead-acid batteries used in electric vehicles (EVs) are smaller than those in internal-combustion engines, the continuing growth of the conventional global vehicle fleet means that “overall demand for lead in automotive batteries will continue to grow”, according to Farid Ahmed, principal lead analyst at research company Wood Mackenzie. Moreover, constraints on lithium-ion battery production to meet EV demand over the coming years open the energy storage market to “other battery technologies” such as those using lead. “This presents the opportunity for lead batteries to expand into a rapidly growing sector which is creating new battery demand, not substitution,” according to Ahmed. But it’s not going to be easy. Take the example of the European Union, which is scrambling to formulate a comprehensive policy for building out its own battery supply chains. Lead could be a core component of a future European energy-storage market. But while one arm of the EU is working on that policy, another arm, the European Chemicals Agency, has this year added lead to the list of hazardous substances with another four lead compounds, many of them used in lead-acid batteries, possibly also joining the list. The toxic legacy lives on. And while it does, lead is going to remain the battery metal no one wants to talk about. Editing by Dale Hudson",Reuters
2019,Iran president says there is video footage of attack on Iranian tanker,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani said an Iranian tanker damaged in the Red Sea on Friday had been hit by at least two rockets, and there is video footage of the incident. Iranian authorities reported that the Iranian-owned oil tanker, the Sabiti, was struck off Saudi Arabia’s coast. There has been no independent report on the cause of the damage. Iran’s rival Saudi Arabia has said it was not behind any attack on the tanker. Saudi authorities said they received a distress message from the vessel, but they added that it had switched off its transponder before they could assist. Rouhani, speaking live on state television on Monday, said the attack was undoubtedly carried out by a government and that there would be consequences.

2019,India's Axis Bank posts surprise quarterly loss on tax charge,"BENGALURU (Reuters) - India’s Axis Bank Ltd (AXBK.NS) reported a surprise loss for the second quarter on Tuesday, hurt by a one-off tax expense of 21.38 billion rupees ($301.22 million). Net loss came in at 1.12 billion rupees ($15.78 million) for the three months to Sept. 30, compared with a profit of 7.90 billion rupees last year, the Mumbai-based private-sector lender said in a filing here to the exchanges. Nineteen analysts, on average, had expected a profit of 11.51 billion rupees, according to Refinitiv data. Adjusted for the tax charge, Axis Bank would have reported a profit of 20.26 billion rupees for the quarter, up 157% from a year ago, the bank said. Gross bad loans as a percentage of total loans, a measure of asset quality, eased to 5.03% by the end of September, compared with 5.25% in the previous quarter, and 5.96% during the same period last year.

2019,Trump says U.S. Energy Secretary Perry to step down at end of the year,"FORT WORTH, Texas/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry will step down by the end of the year, President Donald Trump said on Thursday, a day before a deadline set by congressional Democrats for Perry to turn over documents in the impeachment probe. Trump told an event in Texas that he had known for months that Perry would resign. “Rick and I have been talking for six months. In fact, I thought he might go a bit sooner,” Trump said. “But he’s got some very big plans. He’s going to be very successful. We have his successor. We’ll announce it pretty soon.” Deputy Secretary Dan Brouillette, who has attended several international energy meetings in recent months, is widely expected to replace Perry. Perry, 69, who was the longest-serving governor of Texas and faced off against Trump in the 2016 Republican presidential nominating contests, said earlier this month he had no plans to step down, denying a media report that he was expected to announce his resignation in November. “It has been a tremendous honor to serve our country in your administration in such a meaningful way,” Perry said in his resignation letter to Trump. In recent weeks, Perry has found himself engulfed in the impeachment investigation threatening Trump’s presidency. Three Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives committees issued a subpoena on Oct. 10 for Perry to turn over documents on any role he played in Trump’s bid to get Ukraine to investigate a political rival. The probe focuses on Trump’s efforts to pressure Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a July 25 call to investigate his unsubstantiated allegation that former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, improperly tried to aid his son Hunter’s business interests in Ukraine. White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said earlier on Thursday that Trump had directed Perry to work on Ukraine policy with Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Critics have accused Giuliani, who was not a U.S. government official, of conducting a shadow Ukraine policy. In a visit to Ukraine for Zelenskiy’s inauguration in May, Perry had recommended that he talk about energy reforms with two Texas businessmen Michael Bleyzer, a Ukrainian-American, and Robert Bensh, a frequent visitor to Ukraine, as well as unnamed Energy Department experts, a department official said earlier this month. The Associated Press reported at the time that an unnamed source said Perry had pushed for Bleyzer to be put on the board of Naftogaz, the Ukrainian state oil and gas company, after meeting with Ukrainian officials during his visit. Before Zelenskiy was president, Perry helped seal a deal to sell U.S. coal to Ukraine and had worked with the country and others on providing Europe an alternative to its dependence on gas from Russia. Perry talked up shipments of U.S. liquefied natural gas, a booming industry, as “freedom gas” for Eastern Europe. Perry was virtually free of the ethics investigations that weighed on other Trump administration officials. He has been a champion of U.S. oil and gas production and the nuclear industry, but failed to achieve a goal of subsidizing aging U.S. coal and reactors facing a rash of closures. Perry has tried to persuade Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, to build nuclear power plants using U.S. technology. He often met Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, a fellow alumnus of Texas A&M University, about the kingdom’s plans to build its first two commercial nuclear power plants. In September, Saudi Arabia’s king replaced Falih with his son, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, whom Perry had met before. The Trump administration kept the civilian nuclear talks quiet, a source of friction with Democrats in Congress who wanted to ensure that the kingdom would agree to strict nonproliferation standards. The Energy Department issued seven licenses to companies to share sensitive information on nuclear power with Riyadh, including two that were issued after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last year. Riyadh plans to issue a multibillion-dollar tender for the nuclear plants in 2020. Perry, who advocated for maximum pressure on Iran over its nuclear and missile programs and influence in Syria and Iraq, also talked with Falih about oil. In 2018, Trump pressed Saudi Arabia to boost oil exports ahead of his administration’s unilateral reimposition of sanctions on Iran’s oil exports. Falih explained to Perry then that global demand was not strong enough to justify a big boost in output and depended on Perry to explain that to Trump to reduce pressure on the kingdom.

2019,Japan's Taiju Life to shift away from FX-hedged foreign bonds,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Taiju Life Insurance plans to reduce its holdings of currency-hedged foreign bonds in the six months to March while increasing those of domestic bonds, the company’s investment planning official said on Thursday. Japanese life insurers collectively hold about 370 trillion yen ($3.4 trillion) of assets under management and have been a big player in U.S. and European bond markets for many years as the Bank of Japan’s aggressive easing has shrunk domestic bond yields. However, a recent drop in U.S. and European bond yields and elevated costs for dollar hedging have reduced the attraction of foreign bond investments. Government bonds in the United States and Europe are no longer investable, so the firm is now mostly buying euro or dollar-denominated corporate and supranational bonds, said Yoshiki Nakamura, head of investment planning at Taiju Life. While it aims to mainly buy bonds with a credit rating of single A or above, it is dabbling in triple B-rated debt for industry diversification, he added. Taiju plans, meanwhile, to increase investment in domestic bonds, mainly focusing on long-term government debt such as 30-year bonds as well as subordinated debt issued by Japanese banks. The company expects U.S. bond yields to fall further, with the U.S. Federal Reserve widely expected to impose additional cuts to interest rates in an effort to shore up the economy. “As business sentiment among U.S. manufacturers has deteriorated due to the U.S-China trade war and global uncertainties, we expect U.S. growth to slow next year, though we believe a recession will be avoided,” Nakamura said. Taiju has cut its forecast for the U.S. 10-year Treasuries yield for end-March, the end of its current financial year, to between 1.1% and 1.9%, compared with 2.4% to 3% in its April projections. Falling U.S. yields are likely to slow Taiju’s sale of dollar-denominated annuity products and, therefore, its purchase of foreign bonds without currency hedging, Nakamura added. The company expects to increase unhedged foreign bond holdings by 110 billion yen in the six months to March, about half the 210 billion yen increase in the same period a year earlier. It has no plan to give up currency hedging on its foreign bonds holdings because of the risk that lower U.S. yields could lead to a weaker dollar against the yen, Nakamura said.

2019,California governor demands PG&E accountability for mismanaging power shutoffs,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California Governor Gavin Newsom said on Monday that utility Pacific Gas and Electric Co should be held accountable for mismanaging last week’s widespread power shutoffs and urged the company to provide credits or rebates to affected customers. Separately, the California Public Utility Commission ordered corrective steps by PG&E, the state’s largest investor-owned utility, while summoning eight of its top executives to an emergency meeting on Friday. The utility, a unit of PG&E Corp (PCG.N), cut off electricity to more than 730,000 homes and workplaces in northern California last week in a bid to reduce wildfire risks posed by extremely windy, dry weather. The precautionary shutdown, unprecedented in its scope, has been widely criticized as being haphazardly conducted on too large a scale, with insufficient advance notice to affected customers. On Thursday, the governor said the power outage followed years of mismanagement by the utility and branded its handling as “unacceptable.” Chief Executive Bill Johnson publicly acknowledged that day that PG&E had fallen short in its preparations for the outage. In response to state officials’ latest moves, Johnson again acknowledged room for improvement while defending the broad-scale power cutoff as “the right decision.” He added that there “were no catastrophic wildfires started” last week in the utility’s service areas. Newsom said he had sent a letter to Public Utilities Commission President Marybel Batjer confirming that the agency will conduct a comprehensive inquiry and review of PG&E's planning, implementation and decision-making process failures. (bit.ly/35zARTI) “Californians should not pay the price for decades of PG&E’s greed and neglect,” Newsom said. “We will continue to hold PG&E accountable to make radical changes – prioritizing the safety of Californians and modernizing its equipment.” Newsom also urged the company to provide affected customers an automatic credit or rebate of $100 per residential customer and $250 per small business as compensation. Separately, Batjer sent PG&E executives an eight-page letter on Monday directing the utility outlining seven “major areas where immediate corrective actions are required,” the commission said in a statement. “Failures in execution, combined with the magnitude of this (power shutdown) event, created an unacceptable situation that should never be repeated,” Batjer wrote. “Loss of power is not a mere inconvenience - it endangers lives and property, especially those individuals who are reliant on power for medical reasons.” Several of the corrective actions ordered by the commission dealt with website crashes and an overwhelming surge in call center activity the utility experienced during the shutdown. PG&E filed for bankruptcy in January 2019, citing potential civil liabilities in excess of $30 billion from major wildfires linked to its transmission wires and other equipment.

The “Innovation Challenge” prompts teachers to craft creative FinLit projects, helps them get funded, and then monitors which ones pay off. “Experiential learning is so important, especially for lower-income families,” said Casey Cortese, managing director of Schwab’s community services, which is taking a new hands-on approach to teaching financial literacy. “If you make lessons tangible and real, it really cements learning.” This year’s overall winner of an online fan vote: Students of Rapunzel Galang in Lanham, Maryland, undertook virtual-reality field trips to different historical landmarks through time. They did that using VR headsets – but first they had to plan, budget, and pay for such trips, by researching about the places they wanted to visit. Another innovative project: Xavier Lewis in Dayton, Texas, combined financial literacy with a “Mission to Mars” STEM project. Students earned money in their virtual bank accounts with attendance, class participation, and completing assignments. They could then spend that money to buy supplies to assemble rockets, rovers and hovercrafts for a simulated flight to Mars. Other projects included creating a virtual-reality bank, filming a how-to video series on personal finance, using dinosaurs to pass along money lessons, and teaching the idea of “wants versus needs” via dramatic play. While 92% of teachers say financial education is important, only 12% actually undertake it - because they just don’t have the resources, said Cortese. To combat that with the Innovation Challenge, 15 of the top projects were developed into full lesson plans. Teachers across the country could then download them for free and use them in their own classes. The first 200 teachers who did so, and submitted a report on how it went, got a $250 credit to apply to future projects on the site. The initiative has encouraged educators to think bigger and more creatively than just using a crowdfunding site like DonorsChoose to cover things like basic supplies. Since the Innovation Challenge first got started, “There has been a 66% increase in FinLit projects posted,” said Rianne Roberts, partnerships manager for the fundraising site. Financial literacy is a long game, though. You can teach a third grader about money smarts today, but you will not know for years whether those habits have actually taken root. When the Schwab Foundation first started partnering with the site in 2017, 350 teachers participated in its financial literacy campaigns, reaching 36,000 students. In 2019, in comparison, they have already reached 1,600 teachers and 250,000 students. So far this year, Schwab donated $375,000 to the Innovation Challenge, and $500,000 total to DonorsChoose. Of those teachers who used the resulting materials, 98% said they plan to keep teaching financial literacy in schools.

2019,"UPDATE 1-Logitech posts 4.5% rise in qtrly operating income, retains outlook","(Adds details of results, background) Oct 22 (Reuters) - Logitech International SA reported a 4.5% increase in operating income for its latest quarter, the Swiss computer keyboard and gaming accessories maker said on Tuesday. GAAP operating income increased to $68.1 million in the three months to the end of September from 65.1 million a year earlier, the company said in a statement. Non-GAAP operating income rose to $89 million from $85 million a year earlier. Net profit at the world’s biggest maker of computer mice was $72.9 million, missing analyst estimates for $82.9 million, according to Refinitiv data. Sales rose 4% to $720 million, boosted by the performance of fast keyboards, mice and headsets that Logitech makes for players of online games like Fortnite and League of Legends. Anticipating further growth in the online gaming market, Logitech recently doubled down on its involvement in online sports games, buying live streaming company Streamlabs in a deal worth up to $118 million. The company confirmed its full year outlook of expecting mid to high single-digit sales growth in constant currencies and $375 million to $385 million in non-GAAP operating income. “This quarter, we delivered record sales in video collaboration, which grew nearly 60%, as well as strong growth in our PC peripherals categories,” Chief Executive Bracken Darrell said in the statement.

2019,Japan's Fukoku Life triples domestic stock investment as yields tumble,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Fukoku Mutual Life Insurance Co plans to triple its investment in domestic stocks this fiscal year as global monetary easing has crushed overseas bond yields, reducing the appeal of foreign debt. Fukoku, which had 6.28 trillion yen ($57.74 billion) in total assets as of March, plans to halve its investments in foreign bonds this fiscal year. The company bets it can generate better returns on domestic stocks with attractive dividends, Yusuke Onodera, general manager of investment planning at Fukoku, told Reuters. In August, government bond yields around the world plunged to unprecedented levels, pushing yields on some debt into minus territory. In some cases, entire yield curves went negative, which has made some institutional investors more cautious. “Given low domestic bond yields and the risks from investing in overseas bonds, it makes sense to buy Japanese stocks that promise to deliver good dividends,” Onodera said in an interview on Wednesday. Bond yields have since risen from their lows touched in August, but expectations are still strong that central banks in Europe, the United States and elsewhere will need to ease monetary policy further. A bruising trade war between the United States and China is slamming the brakes on global economic growth, and the situation could get worse unless the world’s two-largest economies find a way to quickly scale back punitive tariffs. For the year ending March 2020, Fukoku plans to invest 60 billion yen in Japanese equities. This is an upward revision from the 20 billion yen in purchases it had planned in May, the insurer said. The insurer will look to buy Japanese equities on dips that have higher dividend yields than returns expected from overseas debt, Fukoku’s Onodera said. Some equity analysts are worried that corporate profits will weaken, but the chance of corporate share buybacks and expectations for stable dividends still make Japanese shares attractive, he said. In fiscal 2019, Fukoku will buy 20 billion yen in foreign bonds, half the 40 billion yen it had planned in May. Fukoku will reduce purchases of currency-hedged overseas debt to 40 billion yen from its previous plan of 50 billion yen in purchases. The insurer now plans to sell 40 billion yen in unhedged overseas debt this fiscal year, more than its previous plan for a 30 billion yen reduction. The U.S. Federal Reserve has cut interest rates twice this year in response to sluggish inflation and worries about the U.S.-China trade war. Traders are betting that the Fed will cut rates further, futures show. In September, the European Central Bank stunned investors by agreeing to cut rates deeper into negative territory and revive purchases of government debt as the continent struggles with the threat of recession. Fukoku will reduce holdings of yen-denominated debt by 50 billion yen in fiscal 2019, more than its previous plan of a 30 billion yen reduction issued in May. Years of aggressive monetary easing by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) has depressed yields, making it harder for institutional investors to generate returns on Japanese government bonds. Expectations are growing that the BOJ will expand its negative interest rate policy due to worries about the economy but take some measures to steepen the yield curve. Onodera questioned the BOJ’s ability to steepen the yield curve, saying the central bank can push down yields at the short end but has not found a way to make longer-term yields gain.

Gedi’s holding company CIR is controlled by De Benedetti’s three sons, to whom the father transferred his stake seven years ago. De Benedetti at the weekend said he had offered to buy a 29.9% Gedi stake from CIR at Thursday’s closing price of 0.25 euros a share.

2019,Ecuadorean indigenous group Conaie says will continue protests after curfew imposed,"LIMA (Reuters) - Ecuadorean indigenous group Conaie said late on Saturday that it would continue anti-austerity protests after President Lenin Moreno imposed a military-enforced curfew in the capital Quito and the armed forces said they would restrict movement across the country. The group suggested that its decision earlier in the day to hold direct talks with Moreno about a decree that cut fuel subsidies might be at risk by the military crackdown. Conaie has led protests against the law but has rejected vandalism that swept Quito on Saturday. “There’s no real dialogue without guarantees for the safety of indigenous leaders,” Conaie said in a statement on Twitter. “We’ll carry out approaches to try to repeal the decree,” it added, “but we will hold protest actions nationally..exhorting the government to provide necessary guarantees.” It did not specify when it would hold protests or if it would do so in defiance of the curfew. Moreno did not say when the curfew in Quito would end. Reporting By Mitra Taj; Editing by Shri Navaratnam",Reuters
2019,Brazil's Light agrees to sell 17.17% stake in Renova Energia,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian energy company Light SA (LIGT3.SA) said on Monday its subsidiary Light Energia S.A. has agreed to sell a 17.17% stake in Renova Energia SA (RNEW11.SA) to CG I Fundo de Investimento em Participacoes Multiestrategia for a symbolic value of 1 real ($0.2435). In a securities filing, the company added that, after concluding the transaction, CG I has committed to then sell Renova shares to Cia Energetica de Minas Gerais (CMIG4.SA), if the latter decides to exercise its preemptive rights. Cemig, as Brazil’s second-largest utility is known, is a shareholder in both Light and Renova. Rio de Janeiro-based distributor Light said the sale of its stake in Renova is part of a strategy to divest non-core assets and focus on improving the performance in operations involving energy distribution.

2019,"UAW, GM leaders have a deal to end strike, now workers will decide","DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co and the United Auto Workers union reached a tentative agreement on Wednesday for a new four-year labor deal, moving closer to ending a costly month-long strike that shut down GM’s most profitable factories in a test of wills over the future of U.S. auto industry jobs. Neither the UAW nor GM released details of the deal, which is subject to ratification by UAW members, a process that could last up to two weeks. A new contract is expected to include commitments by the automaker to invest billions in U.S. vehicle factories to build new generations of electric vehicles, as well as U.S. electric vehicle battery plants. Union leaders worry that a shift to electric vehicles could cost thousands of jobs at engine and transmission factories. The longest nationwide strike against a Detroit automaker since 1970 became a political event. Democratic presidential candidates joined UAW picket lines, eager to win union votes in Midwest swing states. For his part, U.S. President Donald Trump put pressure on GM Chief Executive Mary Barra before the strike to preserve jobs at a car plant in Lordstown, Ohio, that she had targeted for closure. Trump spoke individually with Barra and UAW President Gary Jones on Wednesday, spokesmen for GM and the union confirmed. The White House declined to comment on the discussions. Details of GM’s last offer emerged over the weekend and Reuters had reported that the company boosted the amount it plans to invest in the United States to about $9 billion from its previous offer of $7 billion. That figure is unchanged in the final agreement, a person briefed on the matter said. The deal also would create or retain 9,000 UAW jobs, a “substantial” number of which will be new, the source said. GM in September said its initial offer would support 5,400 jobs - and a majority of those would be new jobs. If the contract is ratified, UAW workers who have been living on $250 a week in strike pay are expected to get one-time signing bonuses, as well as increases to base pay. The union had also pushed for temporary workers at GM plants who earned less than permanent UAW employees to get an easier path to full-time wages and benefits. GM shares closed 1.1% higher at $36.65 on Wednesday after rising as much as 2.6% during the day. Shares of some auto parts suppliers also rose after the UAW announced the tentative deal. The cost of the strike - and how quickly those costs can be recovered - will be a focus for investors as the automaker and its major suppliers report quarterly results over the next several days. Analysts have estimated the strike cost GM more than $2 billion in lost production, though some of that could be made up through overtime work. The strike halted production of GM’s large pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles - key drivers of the company’s global profit. The deal is not done yet. The union’s national GM council will decide whether to accept the agreement during a meeting on Thursday. Then UAW members at GM will vote on the agreement. The strike continues at least until Thursday’s meeting, the UAW said in a statement. The strike began on Sept. 16, with about 48,000 hourly workers of the UAW union at GM seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of profit and protection of healthcare benefits. Other issues included the fate of plants GM has indicated it may close, and the use of temporary workers. GM’s revised offer that emerged over the weekend also included an increase of its proposed ratification bonus by $1,000 to $9,000. GM also proposed 3% pay raises in the second and fourth year of the four-year-contract and 3% and 4% lump sum payments in the first and fourth year respectively. It agreed to make temporary workers with three years of service permanent and give those workers a $3,000 ratification bonus. The final agreement is similar to that offer on pay and bonuses, but includes some enhancements, the person briefed on the matter said. The automaker said during the talks that it had offered “solutions” for the Lordstown assembly plant and a large assembly plant in Detroit-Hamtramck that were targeted for closure. A group affiliated with electric truck maker Workhorse Group had proposed acquiring the Lordstown plant. GM also said it had proposed a “union represented battery cell manufacturing site in the U.S.” GM was considering using the Detroit-Hamtramck factory to build a new line of electric trucks, sources said. These proposals could have changed or been dropped in the final days of the talks. If the deal is approved by the workers, the union will next begin negotiations with Ford Motor Co or Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA), covering many of the same issues. The UAW previously agreed to temporary contract extensions with both automakers while it focused on GM. A successful ratification is not a sure thing as workers during the 2015 talks initially rejected a deal with FCA before eventually approving a revised offer. This year’s talks have been overshadowed by a widening federal investigation into corruption at the union. For GM and the UAW, the bargaining came at a time of industry uncertainty following nine years of strong sales and robust profit, fueled by the trucks and SUVs built by UAW workers. GM’s Barra and President Mark Reuss joined the bargaining on Tuesday, indicating a deal was close. Union leaders said the rewards of GM’s recovery from its 2009 bankruptcy had not been shared fairly. Inflation-adjusted wages for all U.S. auto workers have fallen 16% since 2010, and UAW workers at the Detroit Three have received only two base wage increases of 3% in the past nine years, according to CAR. GM management, on the other hand, sees UAW wages as 26% higher than the average for non-union auto factories in the Southern United States. High absenteeism and rich health benefits add to the cost burdens at a time when U.S. vehicle sales are projected to decline and automakers are funding investments in electric vehicles.

2019,UnitedHealth sees 2020 profit above Street target; shares climb 8%,"(Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) on Tuesday provided an optimistic outlook for 2020 profit, saying it expected growth to be at least 13%, which outpaces current Wall Street estimates and sent its shares up as much as 8.6%. The largest U.S. health insurer, which also raised its 2019 earnings forecast for the third time this year, is targeting earnings growth of between 13% and 16% in the long term. Wall Street analysts had forecast growth of 11% next year. UnitedHealth, the first health insurer to report third-quarter results, also lifted rivals Anthem (ANTM.N), CVS Health (CVS.N), Humana (HUM.N), Molina (MOH.N), Centene (CNC.N) and Cigna (CI.N), as well as the overall market. UnitedHealth Chief Executive Officer David Wichmann said on a conference call with analysts and investors that he is optimistic about 2020 and also called the company’s forecast “conservative.” “We think it’s a reasonable and prudent position at this distance,” he said, adding the company expected strength in its Optum unit, which includes a pharmacy benefits management business, and sales of its Medicare Advantage plans for people over age 65, to propel growth. UnitedHealth also posted third-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street estimates and raised its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to between $14.90 to $15 per share, up from an earlier view of $14.70 to $14.90. Results from the industry bellwether come as a relief to a sector that has been facing uncertainty in the run-up to the 2020 U.S. presidential elections. With some Democrat candidates proposing elimination of private health insurance in favor of a government-run health plan and increased scrutiny of healthcare costs, UnitedHealth stock had fallen about 11% this year. BMO Capital Markets analyst Matt Borsch said the stock may have risen as much as it did because the report eased concerns about the potential for elevated medical costs and 2020 earnings. “There’s been this massive relief this morning,” he said. For the quarter, the company’s medical care ratio, or the percentage of premiums paid out for medical services, was 82.4%, worsening from 81% last year but in line with the average analyst estimate. Revenue from the health insurance business rose 4.7% to $48.11 billion in the third quarter, while Optum posted a 13.3% jump to $28.76 billion. Excluding items, UnitedHealth earned $3.88 per share, beating the average analyst estimate by 13 cents, bolstered by higher Optum revenue as well as its core health insurance business. Total revenue rose 6.7% to $60.35 billion, beating Wall Street estimates of $59.79 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. UnitedHealth shares were up nearly 8% at $238.00 after climbing as high as $239.84 earlier. Reporting by Tamara Mathias in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr and Bill Berkrot",Reuters
2019,"U.S. manufacturing production falls in September, hurt by GM strike","WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing output fell more than expected in September, hampered by a strike at General Motors, and the outlook for factories remained weak amid slowing global growth and unresolved trade tensions. The Federal Reserve said on Thursday that manufacturing production fell 0.5% last month after an upwardly revised 0.6% rise in August. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, overall industrial production and manufacturing output still fell 0.2%. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing output would decline 0.2% and industrial output would slip 0.1% in September. Production at factories dropped 0.9% in September on a year-on-year basis. The Fed’s measure of the industrial sector comprises manufacturing, mining, and electric and gas utilities. Industrial output declined 0.4% in September after an upwardly revised gain of 0.8% in August as a result of the manufacturing softness and drop in mining production. The manufacturing sector, which makes up about 11% of the U.S. economy, has been weakened by a 15-month trade war between the United States and China, which has hurt business confidence and investment. A separate survey of the sector released earlier this month showed manufacturing activity fell to a 10-year low in September as trade tensions weighed on exports. U.S. President Donald Trump last Friday outlined the first phase of a deal to end the trade war with China and suspended a threatened tariff hike, but officials on both sides said much more work needed to be done before an accord could be agreed. With overall output declining, the percentage of industrial capacity in use decreased 0.4 percentage point to 77.5 in September from an unrevised 77.9 in August.

2019,Indonesia state miner agrees to buy 20% stake in Vale Indonesia,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Mining Industry Indonesia, the state miner formerly known as PT Inalum, said on Monday it has signed an initial agreement to buy a 20% stake in nickel miner PT Vale Indonesia (INCO.JK) for an undisclosed sum. The planned sale was flagged by the Indonesian government last week as Vale Indonesia seeks to comply with rules that require foreign controlled miners to reduce their ownership to 49% or below within 10 years of starting operations. Vale Indonesia is currently around 59% owned by Brazil’s Vale SA (VALE3.SA) and around 20% by Japan’s Sumitomo Metal Mining Co Ltd. “The (shareholder) structure is still being discussed, but foreign participation will be reduced to 60% or less,” Rendi Witular, a spokesman for Mining Industry Indonesia, told Reuters by text. Asked about the sale price, Witular said it would be a “fair market value.” Vale Indonesia’s share price rose as much as 2.4% after the announcement, to touch 3,920 rupiah, its highest in a month, giving the company a market capitalization of 38 trillion rupiah ($2.69 billion), according to Eikon Refinitiv data. Mining Industry Indonesia said in a statement that its stake in Vale Indonesia would give it strategic access to the raw material needed to expand Indonesia’s downstream nickel industry. The Indonesian government is keen to build an holistic onshore electric vehicle (EV) industry, covering everything from the production of nickel chemicals needed for batteries, through to producing those batteries and eventually building vehicles domestically. Vale Indonesia, which produced 74,806 tonnes of nickel in matte last year and expects to produce 70,000-72,000 tonnes this year, said the deal positions the company to “contribute to the development of Indonesia.” Mining Industry Indonesia changed its name from PT Inalum in August to distinguish its holding company function from its smelting operational business.

2019,U.S. social networks withhold data on spread of livestreamed Germany shooting video,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. tech companies have declined to release data on the online spread of footage of last week’s shooting in Halle, Germany, despite pledging greater transparency as part of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s “Christchurch Call.” Companies including Facebook and Twitter committed in May to take “transparent, specific measures” to prevent the amplification of violent content, after the killing of 51 people in Christchurch, New Zealand was livestreamed on Facebook. Releasing the data would provide an indication of the impact of the new policies. The companies introduced a new system for data sharing around major incidents and agreed to implement “regular and transparent public reporting, in a way that is measurable and supported by clear methodology.” The killings of two people outside a synagogue in Halle by a gunman, which were livestreamed on Amazon.com’s gaming platform Twitch, was the first test of the new “Content Incident Protocol.” The Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, a group founded by Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and Alphabet Google’s YouTube which facilitates the protocol, said on Thursday that content related to the Halle attack was “significantly less impactful online” than the Christchurch footage. The group said companies shared hashes, or digital fingerprints, for 36 visually distinct videos linked to the attack, fewer than the 800 hashes Facebook said it shared with the group after the Christchurch shooting. But the GIFCT and the companies declined to release data on how many people had seen the footage and how many of the videos were taken down automatically by their systems, key metrics in measuring the impact of content online. After the Christchurch attack, Facebook said in a statement it had removed about 1.5 million videos of the attack globally, more than 1.2 million of which it blocked at upload. Facebook and Microsoft declined to answer questions about how they decide when to disclose data around attacks. Twitter spokesman Ian Plunkett said the company discloses data on “terrorist content removals” twice a year in a transparency report, adding: “We’ve nothing else to share.” Google did not respond to requests for comment. The Anti-Defamation League said last week the Halle footage appeared to have spread rapidly online after it was posted to white supremacist channels on messaging app Telegram. “In order to assess the efficacy of the protocol, we urge the GIFCT and member companies to release data on the impact of the protocol on the spread of the video,” said Daniel Kelley, of the ADL’s Center for Technology and Society. Twitch said after the Halle shooting that the footage had been viewed live by five people and then seen by 2,200 others before the company took it down.

2019,"Goldman profit slammed by souring WeWork, Uber bets","(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit on Tuesday as it took heavy losses from high-profile investments in WeWork and Uber Technologies and faced up to a weakening global economy. The bank’s shares slipped nearly 3% as revenue at three of its four major businesses fell, including a 15% drop in investment banking revenue because of lower advisory and underwriting fees. Net revenue at Goldman’s investing and lending division slumped 40% as it swallowed a loss of about $80 million on its stake in WeWork owner The We Company, along with hits from other investments. Chief Operating Officer Stephen Scherr blamed the bank’s investments in ride-hailing company Uber (UBER.N), medical device maker Avantor Inc (AVTR.N) and trading platform Tradeweb (TW.O) for the $267 million markdown in the quarter. Scherr said those investments comprise 40% of the bank’s $2.3 billion invested in public companies, and they “were the largest contributors to the downdraft.” Office-sharing startup WeWork’s valuation plummeted from a peak of $47 billion in January to as low as $10-12 billion, Reuters reported last month, forcing it to pull its IPO. Uber’s shares are down 24% since the company debuted earlier this year. An analyst note out earlier this month from Morgan Stanley projected that Goldman could lose as much as $264 million on its investment in The We Company. After the writedown, the bank’s equity in We is worth roughly $70 million, Scherr said. The only bright spot for Goldman was its institutional client services business, which accounts for more than a third of its overall revenue, but a 6% growth at the unit was not enough to offset weakness in its other major businesses. “Overall, GS posted mixed results this quarter. While the top line beat to us was a positive, it was driven by more trading which tends to be less persistent and investment banking results were weak,” analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a note to clients on Tuesday. Bond trading revenue was up 8%, while equities rose 5%. JPMorgan (JPM.N) also reported a surge in bond trading. Wall Street’s biggest banks are facing several challenges in growing their revenue, largely as concerns of slowing growth have deterred companies from tapping public markets for funds, but Chief Executive David Solomon sounded optimistic on a call with analysts. “The IPO process is alive and well in the United States,” he said. Under Solomon, Goldman has undertaken a major shift in strategy from its focus on trading to building a bigger consumer business in a bid to shield its revenue from wild swings in financial markets. Goldman, which recently launched a credit card with Apple, has also attempted to build out new businesses, but top executives at the bank have warned in previous quarters that those efforts will take time to bear fruit. Solomon has pushed his top lieutenants to bring in at least $5 billion of new revenue from those businesses by 2020, while simultaneously conducting a full-scale review of the business that has led to a number of new efficiency initiatives and a culling of its partnership pool of top executives. The bank’s net earnings applicable to common shareholders fell 27% to $1.79 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from $2.45 billion a year ago. Earnings per share fell to $4.79 from $6.28 a year earlier. Total net revenue fell 6% to $8.32 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $4.81 per share and revenue of $8.31 billion, according to the IBES estimate from Refinitiv. Expectations from most brokerages tracking the investment bank were generally muted as macroeconomic conditions have been weighing on investor sentiment. Goldman’s main rival Morgan Stanley (MS.N) is expected to report quarterly results on Thursday.

2019,EU to ban Bayer's pesticide linked to harming bees,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union governments on Tuesday widened the EU ban on pesticides linked to harming bees after deciding not to renew their approval for Bayer’s insecticide known as thiacloprid. Farmers will not be allowed to use the insecticide, sold under brands Calypso and Biscaya, after April 30, 2020, when its current approval expires. A majority of EU countries approved the proposal of the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, not to extend approval. The Commission based its assessment on findings of the European Food Safety Agency published in January 2019. It highlighted concerns about the active substance being toxic for humans and present in too great a concentration in ground water, an EFSA spokesman said in an email. The EU prohibited the use of three so-called neonicotinoids everywhere except greenhouses in April 2018. France has already outlawed all four insecticides and one other, including in greenhouses.

2019,UPDATE 1-Nigeria govt can't recover $62 bln sought from oil majors -minister,"(Adds quotes, background) ABUJA, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Oil minister Timipre Sylva said Nigeria knows it cannot recover $62 billion from oil majors despite ongoing cases against the companies for money the government believes it is owed. “Nobody can bring out that kind of money,” Sylva told reporters after a weekly cabinet meeting in Abuja. “I mean, we can’t get $62 billion. We can maybe get something from them but not $62 billion. It’s an opportunity we have lost.” Nigeria has been fighting for the cash under a 1990s law that states it can revisit production-sharing contracts on oil output if crude prices exceed $20 a barrel. Sylva said talks about recouping some money from oil majors, such as Shell, Chevron, ENI and ExxonMobil, were ongoing. The companies received individual requests for cash in February, with one telling Reuters its bill was nearly $10 billion. Shell and Chevron are fighting the cases in court, according to scheduled cases seen by Reuters. Sylva said the government must quickly pass amendments to the underlying law to ensure it did not miss out on more revenue. “We have to ensure that this bill is passed. With this bill now, there will be some adjustments in the fiscal regime and we believe that the government will get a lot from the oil companies, especially their deep shore exploration activities.” The senate passed amendments to the bill on Tuesday. Last week, President Muhammadu Buhari said the government could get an additional $500 million in 2020 and $1 billion in 2021 by revising the law. The government in Africa’s largest oil exporter relies on oil for some 90% of foreign exchange. Oil prices rose to more than $100 a barrel in 2014 before a sharp drop that triggered a 2016 recession in Nigeria, leaving the government struggling to fund its budgets.

2019,Realty bites: Indian property slump leaves beleaguered banks exposed,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India might have thought the worst of a bad loans crisis was past, but a severe cash crunch in the real estate industry could augur fresh strife for its banks. A slump in the residential property market is leaving many builders struggling to repay loans to shadow lenders - housing finance firms outside the regular banking sector that account for over half of the loans to developers. With about $10 billion of development loans coming up for repayment in the first half of 2020, according to Fitch Rating’s Indian division, the fallout could spread to mainstream banks that have lent money to the shadow lenders or invested in their bonds. Indian financial authorities, including the central bank and government, have said this year that the banking sector’s bad loans - totaling more than $150 billion - are on the decline for the first time in four years after ballooning during a debt crisis. But the number of property developers falling into bankruptcy has doubled during the past nine months, piling pressure on non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), commonly known as shadow lenders. Potential implosions of these NBFCs could expose banks, according to 12 banking and real estate sources. A senior banking industry official, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, said banks would be affected by the property cash crunch in three ways: their lending to NBFCs, their own direct exposure to developers and also individuals who do not repay mortgages. “It will be a triple-whammy,” he said. While the Indian banking system could be hit by billions of dollars of additional soured debt, the cash crunch in the housing market has levied a toll in human misery. Retired Squadron Leader Krishan Mitroo has paid 90% of the cost of his house in Noida, northern India, to developer Jaypee, and the property was supposed to be handed over five years ago. However, Jaypee was forced to delay the project and went into insolvency in 2017. “The project has been stuck and there is no progress at all. Even the bankruptcy court has not been able to resolve the issue so far, it is just hanging in thin air,” Mitroo said. He did not say how much money he had paid, but properties in that project range from about $56,000 to $140,000. Several such projects are stuck across the country and buyers are waiting for new developers to take interest and complete them with the hope that their hard-earned money, which has been stuck for years, won’t be lost forever. The property sector has been battling a downturn for the last 3-4 years. Things have now, however, hit a critical point due to a liquidity crunch hitting shadow banks that are big lenders to both developers and property buyers. As of June 30, 421 realtors were under the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP), up from 209 on Sept. 30 last year, data from the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India shows. Defaults by two housing finance companies, Dewan Housing Finance Corp (DWNH.NS) and Altico Capital, have increased fears of contagion to the banking system.. Dewan and Altico did not respond to requests for comment. Shadow lenders will be highly exposed when loans worth roughly 700 billion rupees come up for repayment in the first half of 2020, as many builders may struggle to repay, Fitch’s India Ratings said last month. “The number of stressed assets in real estate are huge,” said Rohit Poddar, managing director at Poddar Developers. “The stress now is just the start, only the mid-sized to large developers will survive, others will die.” If three-quarters of the high-risk category of outstanding real estate loans is not repaid, that could lead to additional bad debt of $15 billion on banks’ books in the next few years, according to confidential research conducted by one of India’s leading real estate consultancies for an international financial client, and provided to Reuters. The Nifty Bank index , which surged in late September after the government moved to slash corporate tax rates, gave up more than half those gains as of Friday. Concerns about real estate loans were one factor, according to analysts, but the fall was also driven by low growth in the economy and the overall worsening asset quality of certain lenders. Banks’ gross non-performing assets fell to 9.3% of total loans as of March, from 11.5% a year earlier, according to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The improvement was bigger than the RBI had expected, having forecast a drop to 10.3% by March and saying last December the ratio had fallen for the first time since 2015. The central bank said in June it expected bad loans to continue to fall in the current financial year, both the ratio and absolute sum. But India still has the highest bad-loan ratio among major economies; by comparison Italy, which has endured a major banking crisis, had a ratio of 9% at the end of last year. Yes Bank (YESB.NS) and IndusInd Bank (INBK.NS) have the largest direct exposure to the commercial real estate sector and would be susceptible to “asset-quality difficulties” if the real estate sector continues to slow, according to a Moody’s report in mid-September, which also said other banks such as ICICI Bank (ICBK.NS) and Axis Bank (AXBK.NS) are likely to feel the pinch. The four banks did not respond to requests for comment on potential difficulties arising from the real-estate exposure covered in the Moody’s report. The chief financial officer of a large public-sector bank said the problems emerging in real estate loan repayments were a major cause of worry. It is unclear what individual banks will do to address the problem. State-owned banks, which dominate the sector, have already received tens of billions of dollars from the government in recent years to shore up their finances. International banks have a very small presence in the Indian market. Indian banks’ bad debt pile ballooned as a result of out-of-control lending in 2006-11 when the economy grew rapidly, and beyond that. They under-reported their bad loans for years until they were forced by the central bank to recognize and address the issue in 2015. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das touched on the real estate issue this month, saying the central bank would be looking at the sector as part of its six-monthly report on the stability of the financial system. The next report is due to be released in December. The RBI declined to make any further comment on banks’ exposure to bad real estate loans. A rebound in the real estate market could alter the situation, but the outlook is looking increasingly bleak. Several industry sources said builders were struggling to offload properties, even though they are ready to offer buyers up to 25% discounts on listed rates. The situation now is so severe that real estate inventories across India are at an all-time high of nearly four years and property prices have not risen in most parts of the country in the last 4-5 years. Projects worth 1.8 trillion rupees ($25 billion) are stalled across India, according to property consultancy firm Anarock. As developers go to the wall, more than half a million direct jobs may be lost in the coming months, the National Real Estate Development Council said. The number of indirect job losses from related industries like cement and steel may be even higher. Slowing sales are piling on the pain, with buyers staying away because they increasingly can’t afford properties. The house price-to-income ratio, which measures the cost of housing versus the change in income levels, rose from 56.1 in March 2015 to 61.5 in March 2019, indicating home purchases have become less affordable. While consumers are staying away, investors are also wary of residential purchases due to low rental yields and meager-to-negative capital appreciation. “Sluggishness in sales is further raising concerns of the borrowers defaulting on the interest and EMI payments,” said Parth Mehta, Managing Director, Paradigm Realty. As the sector gets stressed further, repayments to lenders are likely to get further hit and banks will be increasingly unwilling to lend to property financiers and developers. Pankaj Kapoor, chief executive of real estate consultancy firm Liases Foras, described the cash crunch in the sector as a “bloodbath” that would deteriorate further. “This situation is likely to continue for another two years, which means builders may have to offer more discounts.” Reporting by Nupur Anand and Swati Bhat; Additional reporting by Valentina Za in Milan; Editing by Euan Rocha and Pravin Char",Reuters

2019,WHO hails 'triumph' as Merck's Ebola vaccine gets European green light,"LONDON (Reuters) - The world’s first Ebola vaccine was recommended for approval by European drugs regulators on Friday in a move hailed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a “triumph for public health” that would save many lives. The vaccine, developed by U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co, is already being used under emergency guidelines to try to protect people against the spread of a deadly Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo. It protects against the Zaire strain of the Ebola virus - the one that most commonly causes outbreaks. The shot is also being reviewed under a fast-track system by regulators in the United States, with a decision expected in the first quarter of next year. “This vaccine has already saved many lives in the current Ebola outbreak, and the decision by European regulators will help it to eventually save many more,” the WHO’s director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement. The Congo Ebola outbreak has killed more than 2,100 people since the middle of last year. It is the second-largest Ebola outbreak in history, after a 2013-16 epidemic in West Africa that killed more than 11,300. The Merck vaccine, which the company has now brand-named Ervebo, is likely to get a full marketing license from the European Commission in a few weeks. Roger Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Laboratories, said the company’s priority now was to get regulatory approval of its Ervebo manufacturing site in Germany so that licensed supply of the vaccine “can be used to support global public health preparedness”. Merck’s vaccine is being used in Congo in a so-called “ring vaccination” approach, in which people who may have been in contact with someone newly infected with Ebola are traced and offered the shot to protect them. Charlie Weller, head of vaccines at the Wellcome Trust global heath charity said the Merck shot had already saved “countless lives” in the country. “Having this vaccine available under research conditions has been key in preventing the ongoing outbreak in the DRC spiraling into a repeat of the 2014-16 epidemic, where 11,000 people died,” she told Reuters. Health authorities in Kinshasa said last week they planned to introduce an experimental second Ebola vaccine, developed by drugmaker Johnson & Johnson, in the country’s eastern provinces in November. The Ebola virus causes hemorrhagic fever and spreads from person to person through direct contact with body fluids. It kills around half of those it infects. There are currently no licensed treatments for the deadly infection, but scientists said in August they were a step closer to being able to cure it after two experimental drugs showed survival rates of as much as 90% in a clinical trial in Congo.

The United States plans to impose 25% duties on a range of European products, including Scottish whiskies, after it was authorized to by the World Trade Organization as retaliation for illegal EU aircraft subsidies. “I have made it very clear to the Americans that it is not helpful in terms of our relationship with them to see these tariffs placed on such an iconic industry,” Truss told parliament. “We are putting as much pressure as we can on the United States over this issue and we will also be looking at measures to help the industry here in the UK.” Reporting by Kylie MacLellan; Editing by Alistair Smout",Reuters

2019,Bolivia's Morales confident of election win despite count suggesting a run-off,"LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivian President Evo Morales shrugged off an early vote count showing Sunday’s election heading for a second round run-off, saying he was confident that uncounted rural votes would help propel him to an outright victory and congressional majority. Morales was seen leading the election with 45% of votes against 38% for chief rival Carlos Mesa, according to a preliminary account of nearly 84% of ballots by Bolivia’s electoral board, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE). However, that was short of the minimum 50% majority or 10-point lead over his closest rival Morales needed to avoid a Dec. 15 second round run-off to decide who will govern Bolivia, a landlocked country of 11 million people, from 2020 to 2025. Many people, including Mesa, considered the run-off a certainty but Morales, who has governed Bolivia since 2006, confounded them by heralding his victory at a news conference and saying rural votes should help see him home. “We won once again. Four consecutive elections we’ve won in Bolivia,” said Morales, South America’s longest-serving leftist leader. “We’re confident about the votes from the countryside.” An abrupt halt to vote counting by the TSE also sparked concern. One official observer, the Organization of American States, called on it to explain why transmission of the data had stopped. Brazil’s Foreign Ministry said on its Twitter account it was watching the election in Bolivia and was worried about the “unexpected interruption” of the official reporting of results. A La Paz-based diplomatic source told Reuters that vote counting had been “abruptly shut down,” raising fears about the count being manipulated to avoid a second round. The source said that would be a “very dangerous path.” The TSE, which was not expected to announce more results until Monday morning, declined to comment. Mesa had celebrated the preliminary count amid cheering supporters. “We’re in the second round,” he said. “Democracy is the most important value for which we are fighting,” said Mesa, 66. “We’re not going to lose it.” Mesa said in a post after the count was halted his party “is not going to allow manipulation of a result which clearly takes us into a second round.” A second-round vote would be risky for Morales, who is looking to extend his administration to 19 years. He won his last two elections with more than 60% of the vote in the first round. Quick non-binding ballot counts by two other pollsters - the Jubileo Foundation and officially sanctioned ViaCiencia - showed a tight race, with about 44% for Morales and 39% for Mesa. Votes from rural areas that tend to favor Morales were still coming in but many people said they would not be enough for Morales to avoid a runoff. Morales is running in defiance of term limits and despite a 2016 referendum in which Bolivians voted against allowing him to seek a fourth consecutive term. A local court ruling allowed him to run anyway. He has promised to retire after the next five-year term, as he did in the 2014 election. Chi Hyun Chung, the right-wing Christian Democratic party’s candidate, was running third with close to 9% of the vote, indicating his support base would be a key target for Morales and Mesa in any second round. He and “anti-Evo” rival Oscar Ortiz both said they would back Mesa in a run-off. Morales, a former union leader for coca growers, has managed to hang on to power as most other leftist presidents in South America elected in the previous decade were succeeded by right-leaning leaders. He has overseen a long stretch of political and economic stability for Bolivia, the continent’s poorest country. However, support for him has slipped amid slowing economic growth and concerns about government corruption and anti-democratic practices. Whoever wins will likely have to govern without a majority in Congress and with a gloomier economic outlook. The commodities-fueled boom that drove rapid economic growth in Bolivia in recent years has ended as its important natural gas reserves dwindled.

2019,Drivers wait six days to buy fuel in Venezuela border region,"MARACAIBO/SAN CRISTOBAL, Venezuela, Oct 15 (Reuters) - V enezuelans in border areas are waiting up to six days to fill their cars and some report paying bribes to jump ahead in lines, signaling a return of crippling fuel shortages that have dogged the struggling OPEC nation for much of the year. Despite having the world’s largest oil reserves, Venezuela’s hyperinflationary economy is suffering widespread fuel shortages resulting from slumping oil output and chronic refinery problems that have worsened since U.S. issued a broad set of sanctions. “I paid $40 to a National Guard officer at a service station in the municipality of San Francisco to fill my gas tank,” said Ana Maria Ojeda, a 56-year-old merchant who had spent six days in line in an area near the city of Maracaibo. “I couldn’t take it anymore,” she said. Venezuela in 2019 has suffered intermittent fuel shortages, which tend to be worse in border areas. Heavy subsidies, which make gasoline almost free, creates an opportunity for lucrative smuggling to nearby nations where fuel is much more expensive. It is not immediately evident why the shortages have become more acute in recent days. Neither the information ministry nor state-owned oil company PDVSA immediately responded to requests for comment. The government of President Nicolas Maduro has blamed U.S. sanctions for weakening the country’s economy and crippling its oil industry. His adversaries say dysfunctional economic policies and rampant corruption are to blame for the problems. Between January and August, Venezuela’s crude production fell 60%, according to unofficial PDVSA figures seen by Reuters. Gasoline is so cheap that drivers rarely bother to pay for it. Any payment typically comes in the form of a tip to the service station employee. Luis Gonzalez, 41, a baker, spent three days waiting to fuel his car in the Andean city of San Cristobal near the Colombian border. He said fuel tankers often arrive with 14,000 liters, which fuels around 150 cars. His Ford Fiesta had the number 180 written on the windshield to mark his place in line. “I’m unsatisfied as a Venezuelan citizen, it’s not fair,” said Gonzalez. “Here we are at risk of someone stealing a car battery, a tire or even taking our lives.” (Reporting by Mariela Nava in Maracaibo, Anggy Polanco in San Cristobal, Mircely Guanipa in Punto Fijo, Deisy Buitrago in Caracas, Tibisay Romero in Valencia, María Ramírez in Bolívar; Editing by Bill Berkrot)",Reuters
2019,Explainer: Democrats Warren and Sanders want wealth tax; economists explain how it works,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - From 1982 to 2018 the share of U.S. wealth held by the 400 richest Americans is estimated to have grown from 1% to around 3.5%, or probably around $3 trillion. According to Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, the University of California at Berkeley economists who developed that estimate, that is in part because the wealthiest American families declare only a small portion of their actual economic gains in any given year as income, while leaving the rest invested in stocks and other assets, to grow in value. Saez has been involved in a series of what are considered groundbreaking studies of U.S. income, inequality and economic mobility that involved both developing techniques to impute income based on holdings of wealth, and extensive access to U.S. Internal Revenue Service records. He and Zucman have collaborated on several papers on the topic since 2014, and recently published “The Triumph of Injustice: taxjusticenow.org/# How the Rich Dodge Taxes How to Make Them Pay.” ""The greatest injustice of the U.S. tax system today is its regressivity at the very top: billionaires in the top 400 pay less (relative to their true economic incomes) than the middle class,"" the economists wrote in a September paper brook.gs/2OWp9wx. Their work might have been little more than a provocative read on the economics circuit, had the idea of a wealth tax not been picked up by the two progressive politicians now vying with former Vice President Joe Biden for first place in the Democratic Party’s nominating contest for the November 2020 presidential election. Not only are Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren’s wealth tax proposals remarkably similar, both proposals have been vetted by Saez and Zucman. Taxing wealth, not income, became a hot-button topic during the Democratic debate in Ohio on Oct. 15, with several of the other 10 candidates on the stage rejecting it as too radical. Entrepreneur Andrew Yang said that implementing such a tax would be impractical. Former U.S. Representative Beto O’Rourke called it “punitive.” Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota senator, said “when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump,” suggesting that it would be so unpopular it could help the Republican president’s re-election. Warren and Sanders, however, have pitched it as a solution to the United States’s social and economic woes. “So understand, taxing income is not going to get you where you need to be the way taxing wealth does,” Warren said during the debate, adding the richest billionaires “are making their money off their accumulated wealth, and it just keeps growing.” The two politicians have slightly different proposals, but the aim is the same - to rebalance the distribution of wealth in the U.S. to fund the social programs like free college tuition that they are promising voters. Warren would apply a 2% tax on every dollar of net worth for households worth $50 million or more, and a 3% tax on every dollar of net worth beyond $1 billion. According to tables in a recent paper by Saez and Zucman, this would apply to around $11 trillion of holdings this year, producing revenue of at least $220 billion. Sanders’ “extreme wealth tax” would levy a 1% tax on the first dollar of net worth above $32 million. That tax would rise in increments, to 2% on net worth between $50 million to $250 million all the way up to 8% on wealth above $10 billion. Sanders’ campaign estimated the plan, which would tax just the top 0.1% of U.S. households, would raise an estimated $4.35 trillion over the next decade. Saez and Zucman say their research points to the wealth tax as an effective way to equalize the amount of tax paid by people with massive fortunes like investor Warren Buffett and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos with the middle-class, and then seed the proceeds through the economy. Had the Warren proposal been in place since 1982, the share of wealth held by the top 400 would still have risen - but only to 2%. A higher tax rate of 10% on holdings above $1 billion, meanwhile, would have kept that group’s share of national wealth stable. In more individual terms, the 3% rate on holdings above a billion would mean Bezos would be worth just $86 billion this year, versus $160 billion. At the bottom of the top 15, casino mogul Sheldon Adelson would have $18 billion, versus $35 billion. A dozen European nations used to have wealth taxes but most have done away with them. France, one of the last, abolished its wealth tax in late 2017, after thousands of millionaires relocated to neighboring, lower-tax countries. Saez and Zucman argue that Europe’s history with wealth taxes is not relevant to the United States because those countries set their wealth tax bar too low, and because it is easier to relocate within the continent for favorable tax laws. The U.S. tax system, on the other hand, essentially taxes all citizens, no matter where they live.

2019,LIVESTOCK-Live cattle futures climb on hopes for higher cash trade,"CHICAGO, Oct 16 (Reuters) - U.S. live cattle futures closed modestly higher on Wednesday, extending a five-week rally tied to expectations of strong prices this week for cattle in the cash market, traders said. “Cash is $1 to $2 higher every week, better than what people anticipated,” said Scott Varilek, a broker at Kooima and Kaemingk Commodities Inc. Chicago Mercantile Exchange December live cattle settled up 0.425 cent at 113.875 cents per pound after reaching 114.200 cents, the contract’s highest since July 29. CME feeder cattle futures closed narrowly mixed, with the November contract down 0.150 cent at 145.925 cents per pound and the January up 0.200 cent at 142.375 cents. Cash cattle traded in Iowa this week at about $111 per cwt, at the high end of last week’s trade, but cash trade in the big Texas and Kansas markets had yet to develop, traders said. Despite a month-long rally in CME live cattle, traders cautioned that open interest in live cattle futures has been declining - a sign of traders exiting short positions, rather than establishing bullish new long positions. CME lean hog futures closed lower on Wednesday, backing down from Tuesday’s strong surge, on technical selling and uncertainty about pork demand from China, traders said. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that China had agreed to purchase $40 billion to $50 billion worth of U.S. agricultural goods in a first phase of an agreement to end a 15-month trade war. However, China would make the purchases only if Trump rolls back levies put in place since the trade war began, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. Trump said on Wednesday that he likely would not sign any trade deal with China until he meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping at a forum in Chile being held Nov. 11-17.

2019,Italy's economy probably remained stagnant in third quarter: Bank of Italy,"ROME (Reuters) - Italy probably posted little or no economic growth in the third quarter, continuing the flat trend of the last 18 months, the Bank of Italy said on Friday. “Economic activity in Italy seems to have remained almost stationary in the summer quarter, held back by the persistent weakness of the industrial cycle in the euro area as a whole,” the central bank said in its quarterly economic bulletin. The bank said that the economy was probably supported between July and September by some moderate growth in the services and construction sectors. The euro zone’s third-largest economy has been broadly stagnant for the last six quarters. Gross domestic product rose 0.1% in the second quarter from the previous three months and was also up 0.1% on a year-on-year basis. The government of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the centre-left Democratic Party forecasts that full-year 2019 growth will come in at just 0.1%, leaving Italy in its customary position among the euro zone’s most sluggish economies. Industrial output probably fell 0.5% in the third quarter from the previous three months, the Bank of Italy said. The bulletin said trade tariffs announced by the United States will apply to a relatively limited share of Italian exports, but the indirect impact could be “significant”. It cited the effects “transmitted through trade with our partners in the euro area or as a result of European firms revising their plans.” Reporting by Giselda Vagnoni, editing by Gavin Jones",Reuters

That is up from the July’s mid- to high-single digit growth estimate. The new forecast sets a high bar for Swiss rival Novartis (NOVN.S), which reports results next week. Over a decade, China has gone from Roche’s 10th biggest market to its second-largest behind the United States, with 4.5 billion Swiss francs ($4.5 billion) in 2018 sales. The trend has accelerated, with growth in China topping 50% over the first nine months, about double 2018’s rate. Cancer has been on the rise in China, driven by air pollution and high rates of smoking. Water pollution and excessive use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides have also been blamed for an increase in rural cancer rates. [reut.rs/2BePein] Roche, the world’s biggest cancer drug maker, is profiting as China approves more products from western pharmaceuticals makers, including the Swiss company’s Rituxan/Mabthera, Herceptin and Avastin, and as the nation expands treatment beyond urban centers. “We’re benefiting from the fact that we have a major geographic expansion of both Herceptin and Mabthera, especially into rural areas,” Roche drugs division head Bill Anderson said on a call, adding rapid Chinese sales growth this year was likely a “high-water mark.” “We’ve got our new medicines launching in China at an increasing pace, so we look forward to continued strong growth,” Anderson said. “But greater than 50% is hard to achieve in an ongoing fashion.” Roche shares were 0.7% higher at 0930 GMT and are now up about 20% this year. That tops the 16% rise of Novartis. Third-quarter sales rose 13% to 15.6 billion francs, Roche said. It does not report quarterly profit figures. Biosimilar copies of Roche’s patent-expired Rituxan and Herceptin have taken their toll in Europe and are just now arriving in the United States. Still, Chief Executive Severin Schwan has pledged to more than offset that erosion with newer medicines including multiple sclerosis drug Ocrevus, haemophilia A treatment Hemlibra and lung cancer drug Alecensa, all of which saw sales rise steeply over the first nine months of 2019. “The long-feared skid marks caused by biosimilars in the U.S. market are not visible,” said Zuercher Kantonalbank’s Michael Nawrath, who raised his rating to “overweight” from “market weight” on Wednesday.

2019,DP World chairman says Djibouti dispute hurt company's ability to borrow,"KIGALI (Reuters) - Global ports operator DP World (DPW.DI) has struggled to borrow from banks to finance new investments since a port it partially owns in Djibouti was seized by the government there in 2018, its chairman said on Monday. “We are investing but it is costing us more. That’s the damage,” DP World Chairman Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem told Reuters in Rwanda’s capital Kigali, where the company opened a $35 million logistics platform on Monday. “Fewer banks will lend us money today,” he said, without giving further details. “Every bank that will lend you money will say, ‘What if the country you invest in will do like Djibouti?’ So Djibouti put a...bad precedent.” The government of Djibouti seized the Doraleh Container Terminal from Dubai government-controlled DP World in February 2018 over a dispute dating back to at least 2012. DP World called the seizure illegal, and the London Court of International Arbitration ruled in August 2018 that the company’s contract in Djibouti was valid and binding. Sulayem said the company is continuing to operate legally in Djibouti, although the government has claimed that the company’s operations have ceased. He said the company is also active in Somalia, Mozambique, Senegal, and Mali and has signed an agreement to develop a port in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). He said the company’s new platform in Kigali will further landlocked Rwanda’s efforts to become a trade hub for neighboring countries including DRC and nearby Kenya, reducing the costs of importing and exporting via the Indian Ocean ports in Mombasa and Dar es Salaam.

2019,"Alitalia gets qualified thumbs-up from Atlantia, state railways","MILAN (Reuters) - Italian loss-making airline Alitalia won a commitment from toll-road operator Atlantia (ATL.MI) and state railways Ferrovie dello Stato (FS) on Tuesday to come to its rescue provided a number of conditions were met. The green light will avert the threat of liquidation hanging over the ailing carrier as an Oct. 15 deadline set by the industry ministry for a deal expires. Two sources close to the matter said the Industry Ministry was expected to extend the deadline to give the sides time to iron out certain issues. It was not possible to obtain an immediate comment from the ministry. Several hurdles still must be overcome before the third turnaround attempt in Alitalia’s history can be launched. The state-driven plan involves setting up a new company to hold the good assets of Alitalia and receive a cash injection expected to be around 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) from the rescuers. In two separate statements on Tuesday Atlantia, controlled by the Benetton family, and FS said they would proceed with binding offers for the airline as long as a leading carrier was also willing to invest in the flagship carrier. Atlantia and FS have been in talks since July with Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) but on Tuesday mentioned neither the U.S. carrier nor German carrier Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) which has recently said it could be interested. The two Italian investors said they were each ready to take a minority stake in the new Alitalia but added more work was needed to find a deal on a business plan and a governance structure. An investment by Atlantia in the airline could help mend fences with Rome following threats by the ruling coalition 5-Star Movement to revoke the group’s motorway concessions after a bridge collapse last year that killed 43 people. Atlantia runs half of Italy’s 6,000 kilometers of toll roads through its ASPI unit which generates one-third of core profit. In their statements on Tuesday, Atlantia and FS asked for European Union clearance for financing provided to Alitalia by the state since 2017, which amounts to 900 million euros ($992.8 million) so far. Sources have said the airline might need more cash to survive until the rescue plan kicks in. The two companies also asked for further help from the government for possible job cuts relating to the turnaround of Alitalia. Alitalia has been run by special administrators since May 2017 after going through two previous unsuccessful rescue attempts in 2009 and 2014.

Alitalia received a commitment on Tuesday from Italian toll-road operator Atlantia (ATL.MI) and state railways Ferrovie dello Stato (FS) to each take a stake provided a number of conditions were met.

2019,UPDATE 1-Randstad's Q3 core profit tops estimates as markets stabilize,"(Adds details, quotes from CFO, and background) AMSTERDAM, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Netherlands-based staffing company Randstad posted a 2% drop in its third-quarter core profit on Tuesday, but beat analysts’ expectations as European markets stabilized amid a global industrial slowdown. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxation and amortization (EBITA) came in at 298 million euros ($332.4 million) in the three-month quarter ended September, while analysts polled by Randstad had on average forecast EBITA of 291 million euros. Randstad’s organic revenue slipped 2.5% to just over 6 billion euros ($6.69 billion), largely due to a decline in the automotive sector, which is reeling under the impact of the Sino-U.S. trade tensions and global political uncertainties, including Britain’s potential departure from the European Union. The Netherlands-based company’s sales in Germany dropped 14%, roughly similar to the previous quarter, as Europe’s industrial powerhouse cooled. “Germany is actually stabilising on a low level,” Chief Financial Officer Henry Schirmer said in an interview. “The entire minus of 2.5% top line is automotive,” he said. “In Germany, it is part of a wider industrial issue and in the coming two quarters we do not expect to see dramatic improvement.” Schirmer said activity in the Benelux region of the Netherlands and Belgium has also slowed, resulting in a 5% decline in revenue, as the German industrial downturn tricked through. At the same time, Randstad saw its free cash flow more than double to 468 million euros in the three-month period. “We are well-positioned at Randstad to end the year stronger. We are working in a macro environment, which is more subdued than last year, but you will not see us cutting down on very important strategic investments.” $1 = 0.8966 euros

2019,Pakistan denies entry to Committee to Protect Journalists official,"KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - Authorities at Pakistan’s Lahore airport denied entry to the Asia coordinator of the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), saying his name was on blacklist managed by the Ministry of Interior, a statement from the New York-based organization said. An immigration officer at Lahore’s international airport told Steven Butler that his journalist visa was valid, but it was voided because his name was “on a stop list of the Interior Ministry”, the CPJ statement quoted Butler as saying. The spokesperson for the Ministry of Interior Ministry did not respond to Reuters calls seeking comment. Butler had traveled to Lahore to participate in the Asma Jahangir Conference–Roadmap for Human Rights in Pakistan, an event named after a Pakistani lawyer and rights activist who died last year. Pakistan’s press has had a turbulent relationship with successive governments and the powerful military over many years. Some in the media complained of a severe crackdown in the run-up to the 2018 general election that saw Prime Minister Imran Khan’s PTI party sweep to power. The CPJ has been critical of what it says are government moves to curb press freedom in Pakistan and has been issuing statement’s demanding an end to a crackdown on the media. Airport authorities at Allama Iqbal International Airport confiscated Steven Butler’s passport and put him on a flight to Doha, Qatar, The CPJ said. When he arrived in Doha, he was placed on a flight to Washington D.C. Butler, who communicated with the CJP while in-flight, said he was in a kind of “restricted custody”, with the flight crew in possession of his passport and boarding pass, said the CPJ. “The Pakistani authorities’ move to block Steven Butler from entering the country is baffling and is a slap in the face to those concerned about press freedom in the country,” said Joel Simon, CPJ’s executive director, in the statement. “Pakistani authorities should give a full explanation of their decision to bar Butler from entering and correct this error,” the statement added.

2019,Drug firms offer to settle U.S. opioid suits with $50 billion package: sources,"(Reuters) - Five drugmakers and distributors are offering $22 billion in cash as well as drugs and services they value at $28 billion to resolve lawsuits alleging the industry fueled the U.S. opioid crisis, two sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. The drug industry faces roughly 2,600 lawsuits brought by state and local governments, hospitals and other entities seeking to hold drugmakers and distributors responsible for the toll of opioid abuse. Local governments seek funds to cover costs of services in their communities. Distributors McKesson Corp (MCK.N), AmerisourceBergen Corp (ABC.N) and Cardinal Health (CAH.N) have offered to pay $18 billion in cash over 18 years, while drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) would pay $4 billion in cash, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA) has offered to give away medications it values at $15 billion as part of the deal and provide distribution services it values in the billions, one of the people said. Both said that Teva’s proposed agreement would run over 10 years and had a total estimated value of around $28 billion. However, it is not clear how the valuation was reached, and one source said some states are asking whether Teva should pay cash as well. The negotiations are being led by the attorneys general for Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, one person said. Teva and the three distributors are all defendants in a landmark trial set to begin in federal court in Cleveland, Ohio, on Monday. U.S. District Judge Dan Polster, who has long pushed for a global settlement of the litigation, will preside over the trial. The distributors, accused of failing to halt and report suspicious drug orders, are pushing for a settlement to be agreed to before the trial begins on Monday, one source said. The second source added that a sticking point was compensation for lawyers who typically are paid a percentage of settlements and represent many of the state and local plaintiffs. The sources cautioned that there was no guarantee a deal would be struck. One source said lawyers for the thousands of cities and counties with cases pending in federal court have not yet agreed to back the proposal the states are negotiating. In a joint statement late on Wednesday, the lead attorneys for the cities and counties pursuing federal lawsuits - Joe Rice, Paul Farrell and Paul Hanly - called media reports that they were tentatively supporting the settlement proposal “inaccurate.” “We await the fine print of the settlement framework so that we can work alongside the 2,600 communities we represent to determine the best path forward,” they said. Jury selection went ahead on Wednesday in anticipation of opening statements on Monday. Other defendants in the trial are Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) and Henry Schein Inc (HSIC.O). Opioid addiction claimed roughly 400,000 lives in the United States from 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The companies did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. J&J had said on Tuesday it was open to a settlement.

2019,UPDATE 1-Azeri police release opposition party leader after detention,"(Writes through after release of opposition party leader) BAKU, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Police in Azerbaijan have released the leader of the main opposition Popular Front, Ali Kerimli, after detaining him earlier on Saturday, Kerimli’s party said on social media. He was detained along with scores of protesters at the start of a planned rally against low salaries, corruption and a lack of democracy in the energy-rich ex-Soviet state. It was not immediately clear whether others were released. The protesters have voiced a wide range of demands, including higher salaries for state employees and fair and independent elections in a country long accused by human rights groups and Western governments of a lack of transparency. Kerimli told reporters before his own detention that some 50 people, mostly organisers of Saturday’s unauthorised rally, had already been detained earlier in the week. “We demand our constitutional rights and freedoms to be protected,” Kerimli said. “We are not afraid of this government and we will fight till the end.” Police detained Kerimli soon after he began walking to the venue of the protest rally in central Baku. More than 80 other protesters were detained after him, a Reuters witness at the scene said. The deputy head of the Baku police, Sakhlab Bagirov, confirmed to Reuters that some people had been detained, but declined to provide a number. Before the protest, police cordoned off several streets in central Baku, a couple of metro stations were temporarily shut and there were problems with internet connection. Azerbaijan has been governed by President Ilham Aliyev since 2003 when he succeeded his late father. Western nations have courted Azerbaijan because of its role as an alternative to Russia in supplying oil and gas to Europe, but various European bodies and rights groups have accused Aliyev of muzzling dissent and jailing opponents, charges Baku denies.

2019,Chicago teachers picket across the city on first day of strike,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Chicago teachers went on strike on Thursday and set up picket lines outside many of the city’s 500 public schools, as union leaders and officials of the third-largest U.S. school district pushed ahead with negotiations over a new contract. The work stoppage forced officials to cancel classes for more than 300,000 students, but school buildings stayed open for children who need a place to go during the strike. Thousands of people including teachers and some parents who support their cause walked the picket lines, many of them wearing red shirts, carrying signs demanding “a fair contract” and chanting “Whose schools? Our schools.” Thousands of teachers and supporters also gathered downtown for an afternoon rally and march. “I’m hopeful. I’m here to stand up for teachers and the future teachers,” said Pamela Wasson, a bilingual special education teacher in her 34th year of teaching as she picketed in front of her North Side elementary school. The strike is the latest in a recent wave of work stoppages in school districts across the United States in which demands for school resources have superseded calls for higher salaries and benefits. In Chicago and elsewhere, teachers have emphasized the need to help underfunded schools, framing their demands as a call for social justice. In addition to wage increases, the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) wants more money to ease overcrowded classrooms and hire more support staff such as nurses and social workers, two perennial issues plaguing the district. On Thursday afternoon, union President Jesse Sharkey said that union and district made progress at the bargaining table. “We have in our possession now something in writing about class size,” he said during a news briefing. “It’s a shame that it took a work stoppage to actually get that document.” He did not specify the details of the class size proposal. The district’s proposal would grant a 16% raise over five years, set enforceable targets for reducing class sizes and add more support staff across the district, according to Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who was elected in April. “We certainly believe that we can get a deal done,” she said on Thursday. Lightfoot has previously said that the union’s full list of demands would cost the district an additional $2.5 billion annually. Wall Street credit rating agency Moody’s Investors Service, which rates the district’s debt in the junk level, said on Thursday that the outcome of labor negotiations will have “substantial ramifications on whether CPS’ financial recovery continues, given its limited financial flexibility and narrow reserves.” Teachers from Newton Bateman Elementary School on Chicago’s north side blanketed the blue-collar Irving Park neighborhood, waving signs and beating drums. “This is not really a dollars-and-cents strike,” said James Phelps, a 59-year-old American history teacher. “The mayor literally campaigned on equal distribution of resources. Why hasn’t she agreed to that?” A veteran of three strikes and a lockout over his 29-year teaching career, Phelps said swelling class sizes and a shortage of nurses and social workers at schools mainly on Chicago’s south and west sides justified the labor action. Schools administrators were providing activities and meals at the schools while community organizations across the city promised to keep their doors open for children and parents. “I’m just scrambling, looking for options,” said Tia Cochran, who was dropping off her son, a first-grader, at Newton Bateman Elementary. The strike comes seven years after 29,000 Chicago teachers walked out for seven days over teacher evaluations and hiring practices. In 2016, teachers staged a one-day walkout to protest the lack of a contract and failures to stabilize the school system’s finances.

2019,"Former Thomas Cook boss defends record, pay after firm's collapse","LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - The former chief executive of bankrupt travel firm Thomas Cook on Tuesday said he understood public anger over his pay but defended his record, saying he had worked tirelessly to try and save the company. Thomas Cook collapsed last month, stranding over a hundred thousand passengers as its UK business went into liquidation. Appearing before a British parliamentary committee, Peter Fankhauser again apologised to customers, staff and suppliers for the firm’s collapse but did not say if he would hand back any of his pay. Asked about his salary, Fankhauser said he did not set his own pay or decide his bonus. “I fully understand the sentiment in the public,” he told the committee. “However, what I can say to that is that I worked tirelessly for the success of this company and I’m deeply sorry that I was not able to secure the deal.” He said that a 750,000 pound ($949,950) bonus he was paid in 2017 could theoretically be clawed back, but 30% was paid in shares which were now worthless. Fankhauser said that his efforts to transform the company on his appointment in 2014 had been constrained by its debts, and that responsibility for the collapse was shared between multiple parties who tried, and failed, to agree a restructuring plan. The firm collapsed after it became unable to service its debts and failed to convince banks to back a rescue plan in the face of changing customer habits and intense competition from low-cost airlines and internet companies.

2019,China plans to end illegal hazardous chemical dumping by 2025,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China will step up efforts to end the illegal dumping of hazardous chemical waste over the next six years, raising its monitoring and treatment capacity and blacklisting violators, the environment ministry said on Monday. China’s chemical sector came under heavy scrutiny this year after a factory explosion in the province of Jiangsu killed 78 people. The blast triggered a nationwide safety crackdown as well as a plan to relocate 80% of producers of toxic chemicals away from residential areas. All regions must create a comprehensive hazardous chemical monitoring system by the end of 2025 and ensure they have sufficient treatment capacity, the ecology and environment ministry said in its notice on Monday. Hazardous waste treatment will also be one of the criteria in a new corporate environmental credit system that will lead to public blacklisting and denial of financing for firms that violate rules, it added. Local authorities will also have to draw up plans to build integrated waste disposal facilities and set up funding mechanisms for transfers of hazardous waste. To improve waste management, local governments will also be encouraged to set up more integrated “industrial bases” in sectors such as petrochemicals and nonferrous metals. The ministry will also encourage the use of cement kilns or blast furnaces at steel plants to dispose of hazardous chemical waste. The Yangtze river delta, including the commercial hub of Shanghai and the neighboring provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, will be forced to adopt the measures by the end of next year, the ministry said. Regions along the length of the Yangtze, together with the economic areas of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and the Pearl River delta, will have to comply with the new rules by 2022. The current safety crackdown on the chemical sector is already expected to force hundreds of smaller, private players out of the market, leading to consolidation. The campaign should drive more efficient production practices and help modernize the huge but fragmented chemical industry, S&P Global Ratings said in a report on Monday.

2019,How a small aluminum maker won U.S. trade protection,"HAWESVILLE, Ky. (Reuters) - When Donald Trump won the White House, the sprawling aluminum smelter that hugs the Ohio River here was operating at less than half its capacity, and most of its skeleton crew of 270 remaining workers were fearful about their future. But Trump’s tariffs have saved it, at least for now. How a tiny industry - only 4,000 U.S. workers are directly involved in making primary aluminum currently - won protection is a testament to savvy lobbying, and one firm’s ability to get the Trump administration to view it as a sector that would soon be gone without a government intervention. Century Aluminum Co (CENX.O), which operates the Hawesville smelter and ranks as the second-largest aluminum maker in the United States, spearheaded the fight. Almost everyone else that touches the metal, from the industry’s main trade association and consuming businesses from beer maker MillerCoors to Alcoa Corp (AA.N) - the country’s largest aluminum maker - were staunchly opposed to tariffs. U.S. aluminum prices are based on a global benchmark—with a premium added on in the US to cover transportation and insurance. Since last year, the premium has included the 10% Trump tariff. Century and other domestic producers don’t pay the tariff, but still charge the same premium, giving them a pricing edge. But what is good for Century hurts most other parts of the industry. Automaker General Motors Co (GM.N) estimated metal tariffs would add $1 billion to its costs in 2019. Heavy equipment maker Deere & Co (DE.N) laid off 163 workers in Illinois and Iowa as the trade war drove up its costs and at the same time hurt demand for tractors from farmers facing diminished exports. The fight between Century and almost every other firm in the aluminum industry underscores a divergence that has occurred over the last two decades. Many sectors of the U.S. aluminum business are thriving, including processors who take raw aluminum and shape it into parts for everything from airplanes to washing machines. But makers of primary metal - its most basic form - have struggled. The United States was once the world’s biggest producer of primary aluminum. But by the time Trump took office, production had dwindled to the level last seen in 1951 and capacity utilization, a gauge of industry health, stood at just 37%. There were only five operating primary aluminum smelters left, down from 23 in 2001. What hobbled the business was a combination of energy prices, new technology and globalization. The drastically diminished U.S. footprint of primary aluminum helps explain how the industry was able to make its case for protection, say industry leaders, trade attorneys who fought for the tariffs, and analysts who track the business. Century, based in Chicago, began its fight in 2015 when it hired the Washington law firm Wiley Rein LLP to help it press for protection. The company had already announced plans to shutter the Hawesville plant entirely, but opted instead to cut output to a fraction of its potential as it waited to see how its case would play out, company executives told Reuters. The Obama administration filed a case with the World Trade Organization during its last week in office, accusing China of unfairly subsidizing its aluminum industry and harming domestic producers like Century. But by then, a new wind of protection was blowing in Washington, and Century saw the chance to tie its case closely to other basic industries seeking tariffs, particularly steel. Century’s lobbyists emphasized that unlike steel, which still produces about 80% of U.S. needs at domestic plants, primary aluminum smelters were on the brink of disappearing entirely. They found a receptive audience at the Commerce Department, said Jesse Gary, Century’s general counsel. Century also emphasized its unique role as the only U.S. operation that can make metal needed for military equipment like advanced armor used to shield Humvees and other military vehicles. “We’re the only volume producer of high purity aluminum in the Western Hemisphere and among NATO allies,” said Gary, adding that other main sources are China, Russia and the Middle East. A spokesman for the Commerce Department confirmed that steel was a far bigger target for their investigation into the case for tariffs on imported metals. “But in terms of fragility of the industry, relatively speaking, aluminum was in a worse position than steel,” said the spokesman, given the low capacity utilization. Industry giant Alcoa has argued that tariffs are the wrong way to address the problem facing domestic smelters, which is low global prices of primary aluminum caused by massive overproduction by China. The company has acknowledged tariffs have helped its remaining U.S. smelters. Speaking to investors in April, Alcoa CEO Roy Harvey said “tariffs have not solved the industry’s challenges, which stem from high subsidized smelting capacity in China that has resulted in surplus production.” Meanwhile, Century’s Hawesville plant has become a poster child for tariffs. After the tariffs were announced last year, the company said it would spend $150 million modernizing and reopening parts of the plant, moves that will eventually lead to a doubling of the workforce to over 600. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross famously downplayed concerns about metal tariffs hurting consumers by going on CNBC holding a can of Campbell’s soup and saying the tax would barely register in the cost of such goods. Ross last year attended a ribbon-cutting at the gritty, smoke-filled Hawesville plant, where he reassured workers that the protection would not be fleeting. Tariffs are a frequent topic of conversation here for workers on the factory floor, where work is underway to restart production lines. Greg Lester, who came out of retirement last year to help train new workers being hired at the plant, said he considers it almost a miracle that this mill did not die like all the others he has worked for. Lester notes that he spent much of his four-decade career helping U.S. companies build smelters in other countries, while smelters back home fell like dominos. “I’ve been in West Africa, I’ve taught Russians how to make super-pure aluminum,” said Lester. “The only place that didn’t seem to want smelters was the U.S.” One place where the tariffs are viewed a bit more skeptically is the storefront near Hawesville occupied by United Steelworkers local 9423, which represents workers at the plant. Andy Meserve, president of the union, said workers have welcomed the investments and new jobs. They recognize that tariffs could hurt other parts of the aluminum industry. “But it was great for Hawesville,” he said. Reporting by Timothy Aeppel; editing by Simon Webb and Edward Tobin",Reuters
2019,Cargill resumes receiving cattle at Kansas beef plant after blast,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Cargill resumed receiving cattle for slaughter at its Dodge City, Kansas, beef plant on Monday after an explosion last week, a company spokesman said. The explosion, which occurred Oct. 17 in a stand-alone building outside the main facility and injured two workers, prompted the company to suspend some shifts last week and stop receiving livestock. However, the plant continued to package beef from carcasses it had on hand at the time of the blast. Chicago Mercantile Exchange live cattle futures fell on Friday due in part to fears that the interruption at the plant, which can process up to 6,000 head per day, would cause cattle supplies to back up at feedlots. A fire in August at a Tyson Foods Inc slaughterhouse in Holcomb, Kansas, with similar processing capacity depressed cattle futures while boosting beef prices, sending margins for the U.S. beef industry to a record high.

2019,Martin Luther King's daughter tells Facebook disinformation helped kill civil rights leader,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Disinformation campaigns helped lead to the assassination of Martin Luther King, the daughter of the U.S. civil rights champion said on Thursday after the head of Facebook said social media should not factcheck political advertisements. The comments come as Facebook Inc (FB.O) is under fire for its approach to political advertisements and speech, which Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg defended on Thursday in a major speech that twice referenced King, known by his initials MLK. King’s daughter, Bernice, tweeted that she had heard the speech. “I’d like to help Facebook better understand the challenges #MLK faced from disinformation campaigns launched by politicians. These campaigns created an atmosphere for his assassination,” she wrote from the handle @BerniceKing. King died of an assassin’s bullet in Memphis, Tennessee, on April 4, 1968. Zuckerberg argued that his company should give voice to minority views and said that court protection for free speech stemmed in part from a case involving a partially inaccurate advertisement by King supporters. The U.S. Supreme Court protected the supporters from a lawsuit. “People should decide what is credible, not tech companies,” Zuckerberg said. “We very much appreciate Ms. King’s offer to meet with us. Her perspective is invaluable and one we deeply respect. We look forward to continuing this important dialogue with her in Menlo Park next week,” a Facebook spokesperson said.

2019,Chiefs QB Mahomes (knee) to miss limited time,"An MRI exam confirmed Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes dislocated his right kneecap in Thursday night’s game against the Denver Broncos, but he sustained no other significant damage, according to multiple reports on Friday. ESPN’s Adam Schefter, citing league sources, tweeted that the MRI result was a “best-case scenario.” That means a limited absence for the reigning league Most Valuable Player of “about three games,” Schefter reported. With his team up 13-6 and facing a fourth-and-1 at the Denver 5-yard line with 10 minutes left in the second quarter, Mahomes ran a sneak to convert the first down. But Mahomes remained on the ground, and when trainers came out, they appeared to be straightening his right knee. Mahomes was able to walk off the field with assistance, then once he was off the field, was able to walk without assistance down the tunnel toward the locker room. When he met the media Friday afternoon, head coach Andy Reid confirmed Mahomes underwent the MRI but said he didn’t have the results yet. The 24-year-old Mahomes entered the game playing on a tender left ankle he sprained in the season opener and aggravated several times, including Sunday in a home loss to the Houston Texans. The Chiefs defeated the Broncos 30-6 on Thursday to move to 5-2 and retain their lead in the AFC West. Mahomes began the night leading the NFL with 2,104 passing yards. He was 10-of-11 passing for 76 yards and a touchdown before exiting versus Denver. After the injury, the Chiefs turned to veteran backup Matt Moore, who completed 10 of 19 pass attempts for 117 yards and a touchdown. Reid confirmed that Moore would start Kansas City’s next game on Oct. 27 at home against Green Bay. In 10-plus NFL seasons with the Carolina Panthers, Miami Dolphins and Chiefs, Moore, 35, has completed 59.4 percent of his passes for 7,055 yards with 46 touchdowns and 36 interceptions. Another veteran backup, 34-year-old Chad Henne, remains on injured reserve as he recovers from surgery after breaking an ankle in the preseason. The Chiefs signed Moore, who sat out the 2018 season, after Henne’s injury. Henne can’t come off the IR until after Week 8, but there’s no guarantee he’ll be ready to play then. Reid said the Chiefs were considering elevating quarterback Kyle Shurmur, an undrafted rookie from Vanderbilt, from the practice squad. Mahomes’ injury made an immediate impact with oddsmakers. The Chiefs went from 8-1 at many sportsbooks to 10-1 by PointsBet and 11-1 by DraftKings. —Field Level Media",Reuters
2019,'Joker' remains Box Office ruler with $55 million,"LOS ANGELES, (Variety.com) - Joaquin Phoenix is king of the North American box office once again as “Joker” scores an easy victory in its second weekend with $55 million at 4,374 sites. “Joker” dominated a trio of new entries with animated comedy “The Addams Family” leading the rest of pack with $30.3 million at 4,007 venues, topping forecasts. Will Smith’s “Gemini Man” wound up under expectations with $20.5 million at 3,642 locations. Adam DeVine’s artificial intelligence comedy “Jexi” generated little interest with $3.1 million at 2,332 screens. “Joker” showed plenty of traction, declining only 43% from its impressive opening of $96.2 million, the fifth-largest domestic launch of 2019 despite worries about the negative impact of the film’s darker themes. Moviegoers have stayed strongly engaged with a 10-day total of more than $192 million. The psychological thriller has already become hugely profitable for Warner Bros., which partnered with Village Roadshow and Bron on the $55 million project. And with a solid international performance of $351 million, “Joker” has hit $543 million at the worldwide box office in less than two weeks. “The Addams Family,” handled through MGM’s United Artists Releasing, had been projected to earn $21 million to $27 million. The PG film, which has been marketed toward family audiences, follows Morticia, Gomez, Wednesday, Pugsley and Uncle Fester as they bring their love of the macabre to 21st century life in New Jersey. Pre-release forecasts had placed “Gemini Man” between $24 million and $29 million, but competition from “Joker” plus downbeat reviews — the film currently sits at 26% on Rotten Tomatoes — yielded a disappointing result, given the $138 million price tag for Paramount, Skydance Media, Fosun and Alibaba. The film follows Will Smith who battles a younger clone of himself, which director Ang Lee achieved through hyperrealistic visuals. “Jexi” opened at the lower end of modest expectations. Adam DeVine stars as a man addicted to his phone, whose life changes thanks to a digital life coach named Jexi. The movie is the last theatrical release by CBS Films before it’s absorbed into CBS Corporation’s Entertainment Group. The top two films continue the recent trend of solid overall performances in North America, according to Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst with Comscore. “‘Joker’ continues to enthrall audiences, spark conversation and generate interest as reflected by a very modest drop of 43% in its second weekend,” he said. “‘The Addams Family’ found favor with family audiences that were excited by the Halloween season friendly and nostalgia generating animated film.”",Reuters
2019,Exclusive: Political jitters drive U.S. to biggest fall in global social entrepreneurs poll,"NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Opportunities to build businesses with a mission to do good in the United States have plummeted since 2016 due largely to a decline in government support, according to the second global poll on the best countries for social entrepreneurs on Tuesday. The United States fell the most out of 45 countries in the Thomson Reuters Foundation survey of about 900 social enterprise experts, diving to 32nd place from the top ranking in the inaugural survey three years ago. The poll found the United States fell the most of all nations when respondents were asked if government policy supported social entrepreneurs, and came last in a combined ranking about women’s leading role in running such businesses. It also suffered the biggest drop of all countries when asked if social entrepreneurs could access investment, plummeting 38 places to be ranked third last. Richard Parker, a professor of economics and expert in social entrepreneurship at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, said while any number of factors could be responsible, the nation’s political climate stands out. He said the “shock of the Trump administration” had rattled the view that small and mid-sized businesses can do good and tackle social problems. “For lots of liberals who are going to be associated with social entrepreneurship, the sense is that the sky is falling,” Parker told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “It’s not a time to talk about the green shoots when the sky is falling.” A social entrepreneur is typically someone who uses commercial strategies to tackle social and environmental problems, combining social good and financial gain. The United States was previously cited as a leader for promoting social enterprise, with President Barack Obama setting up a global entrepreneurship summit and bringing in a law allowing crowdfunding used by small investors with social aims. But Obama also promoted social entrepreneurship as a form of foreign policy and that did not extend into the Trump administration, said Jennifer Kushell, founder of EYP Ventures that creates online learning programs about youth employment. “The funding dried up, the focus on international dried up,” she said. “We lost a lot of momentum.” When Donald Trump took office in 2017, a list of social entrepreneurs opposed a travel ban that blocked people from seven majority-Muslim nations - Iran, Chad, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria and Yemen - from entering the United States. The ban “will make our work to foster peace, sustainability, opportunity and inclusiveness much harder ... giving our organizations still more challenges to overcome,” the social entrepreneurs wrote in a public letter. Trump’s administration also moved to undo a program - the International Entrepreneur Rule - designed to encourage entrepreneurs to move to the United States to start businesses. Immigrants are nearly twice as likely to start businesses as native-born Americans, according the Kauffman Foundation, a non-profit focused on education and entrepreneurship. Trump’s decision to cut cash to the U.N.-backed Green Climate Fund and pull out of the Paris climate agreement have also been widely criticized and seen as withdrawing support for businesses focusing on clean energy and zero carbon. Representatives at the U.S. Department of Commerce, which oversees entrepreneurial programs, did not respond to requests for comment on the Thomson Reuters Foundation’s poll findings. But the department pointed to a program giving grants totalling $23 million to several dozen groups to boost entrepreneurship and increase access to capital. The United States fell the most of all nations surveyed when respondents were asked if conditions were favorable for social entrepreneurs, dropping to 22nd place from top slot in 2016. They reported it had become more difficult to sell to governments and to businesses. Parker said brewing trade tensions between the United States and China have also created uncertainty. The United States and China, the world’s top two economies, have been in a 15-month trade war that the IMF said is partly to blame for a sharp slowdown in global growth. “A lot of people are going to the sidelines,” said Parker. “They just aren’t sure where this is all going to end up.” But the United States came in fifth place for seeing more young people getting involved in the sector. “If you can get into the right room and capture the right attention and have the right people advocating for you, the possibilities are endless,” said Thomas Brennan, who launched The War Horse in 2016, a non-profit newsroom focused on the human impact of war. But he said: “People are becoming a lot more risk averse. “There’s so much vitriol that’s floating in the air. That has a direct impact on who and how much of a commitment a person might be willing to make.” The poll of social entrepreneurs, academics, investors and support agencies, supported by Deutsche Bank, found Canada was the best country for business leaders seeking to tackle social problems, then Australia and France.

2019,Financial services firm Freedom Holding considers Moscow listing after Nasdaq debut,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Freedom Holding Corp FRHC.O, a financial services firm focussed on East Europe and Central Asia, is considering a Moscow listing, after its shares began trading on New York’s Nasdaq. Shares in Freedom Holding Corp initially climbed more than 2% before easing back to trade flat on its Nasdaq debut on Tuesday at $14.15, its closing price on the OTCQX exchange where it was listed since July 2018. Timur Turlov, Freedom Holding Corp’s 31-year-old founder and chief executive, told Reuters his company was considering a rouble-denominated listing on the Moscow Exchange. “I hope it will happen this year,” he said in his Moscow office. Turlov said the company had taken five years to prepare for the Nasdaq listing to broaden its investor base. “We are getting on the radar of a large group of investors who do not work with a company that is not listed,” he said. A Moscow listing would put the firm’s shares in Russia’s small-cap indexes Russel 2000 or 3000, putting the company “into the sight of investors who are looking at our region,” he said. The firm’s Kazakh unit, Freedom Finance, is one of the biggest and most active brokerages in Kazakhstan. The company also became a major investor in Kazakh mobile operator Kcell KCEL.KZ last year, building up a stake of more than 10% through open market purchases. It halved that investment to about 5% before the Nasdaq listing. Turlov said the shares were sold at a profit. Freedom Finance is now setting up a subsidiary in Kazakhstan’s Astana International Financial Centre (AIFC). It has also been active in neighboring Uzbekistan.

2019,"Indonesia steps up security, bans protests ahead of inauguration","JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia will deploy more than 30,000 police and military personnel to ensure security for Sunday’s inauguration of President Joko Widodo and will not allow demonstrations over the period, police said on Tuesday. Security has been stepped since the chief security minister, Wiranto, was stabbed by a suspected Islamist militant last week during a visit to a provincial town. He is recovering in hospital. The Southeast Asian country, which has the world’s biggest Muslim population, has also seen anti-government rallies, led by students, in recent weeks in Jakarta and other cities in opposition to new laws that have turned violent at times. Argo Yuwono, a spokesman for Jakarta’s police, said the decision not to issue permits for rallies was intended “to maintain the dignity of the state”, particularly given the inauguration would be attended by foreign leaders. Since the attempt on Wiranto’s life, authorities have raised security for officials. Police said on Monday they had arrested 22 suspected militants in various places as part of a preventive strike by the counter-terrorism unit. Separately, national police spokesman Dedi Prasetyo said police had arrested two members of the Islamic State-linked militant group Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) who were plotting suicide bombings in the cities of Solo and Yogyakarta. He said the plot was not linked to the inauguration. Prasetyo said 31,000 military and police would guard the inauguration of Widodo, who won a second term in an April election, with leaders from neighboring countries such as Australia and Malaysia expected to attend. Indonesia scrambled to tighten its anti-terrorism laws after a series of suicide bombings linked to the JAD group killed more than 30 people in the city of Surabaya last year.

2019,"China September exports, imports in deeper contraction as tariffs take toll","BEIJING (Reuters) - A slide in China’s exports picked up pace in September while imports contracted for a fifth straight month, pointing to further weakness in the economy and underlining the need for more stimulus as the Sino-U.S. trade war drags on. Analysts say it could take time for Chinese exports to recover given slowing global growth, despite tentative signs of a thaw in tense trade relations between the world’s top two economies. On Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump outlined the first phase of a deal to end the trade war with China and suspended a threatened tariff hike set for Oct. 15. But existing tariffs remain in place and officials on both sides said much more work needed to be done. September exports fell 3.2% from a year earlier, the biggest fall since February, customs data showed on Monday. Analysts in a Reuters poll had expected a 3% decline after August’s 1% drop. “The headline figures suggest that global demand softened last month, adding to the pressure from the U.S. tariffs that went into effect in September,” said analysts at Capital Economics. Economists also attributed the export slowdown to a fading in the so-called “front-loading” effect. Some Chinese firms had rushed to ship goods to the United States ahead of the September deadline, supporting overall July and August export readings. “We expect shrinking exports will likely be one of the biggest drag on China’s economic growth in the coming months, as the tariff impact will be further in place, along with the pay-back effects,” said Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura. Total September imports fell 8.5% after August’s 5.6% decline, the lowest since May, and were expected to fall 5.2%. Some sectors held a silver lining. China’s industrial metals imports, including iron ore and copper, surged in September fueled by firm demand at steel mills. But analysts at ANZ noted volumes were buoyed by recovery from recent disruptions in Australia and Brazil, and may also have been lifted by restocking ahead of China’s 70th anniversary celebrations, suggesting overall demand remains weak. Nomura’s Lu pointed to subdued imports in the raw material processing sector and softening global commodity prices possibly playing a role in depressing overall imports. Despite more than a year of growth boosting measures, China’s domestic demand has remained stubbornly weak as economic uncertainty weighs on business and consumer confidence and discourages fresh investment. Downward pressure on China’s economy is increasing and the government will make good use of counter-cyclical adjustments to keep economic growth within a reasonable range, state television quoted premier Li Keqiang as saying. China reported a trade surplus of $39.65 billion last month, compared with a $34.84 billion surplus in August. Analysts had forecast $33.3 billion. Its trade surplus with the United States stood at $25.88 billion in September, narrowing from August’s $26.96 billion. China’s exports to the United States fell 10.7% from a year earlier in dollar terms in January-September, while U.S. imports dropped 26.4% during that period, the customs data showed. September had marked a major escalation in the trade row, with Washington imposing 15% tariffs on more than $125 billion in Chinese imports from Sept. 1, and Beijing hitting back with retaliatory levies. Though President Trump had agreed not to proceed with a hike in tariffs set for Tuesday, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said Trump had not made a decision about tariffs that were subject to go into effect in December. Analysts are also skeptical that the “mini deal” would mark a major breakthrough. “It is difficult to take that much comfort from the latest signs of progress given that we’ve had plenty of apparent truces in recent months end abruptly in a sudden further escalation in trade tensions,” said analysts at Capital Economics. Customs spokesman Li Kuiwen told a news conference on Monday China’s stable domestic economy had provided a strong cushion against external challenges, but added that trade development in the future was still complicated and severe. Economists at UBS expect further pressure on China’s job market as the impact of the latest U.S. tariff escalations filter through to struggling manufacturers. “We think the time to watch for potentially significant job losses is from December this year until March 2020, assuming all announced tariff hikes are implemented. Job losses may be more concentrated in a few sectors that have higher exposure to foreign final demand, such as textiles, computers and electronics and electrical equipment, among others.” Analysts believe China’s economic growth cooled further in the third quarter from a near 30-year low of 6.2% hit in April-June, and is threatening to breach the lower end of the government’s full-year target of 6.0-6.5%. A growing number of economists are forecasting growth could fall into the upper 5% range in 2020 due to lingering trade tensions and a combination of cyclical and structural factors.

2019,Suicide attempts rising among black teens,"(Reuters Health) - Suicide attempts are rising among black teens in the U.S. even as they fall among youth from other racial and ethnic groups, a study suggests. Researchers examined nationwide survey data from nearly 200,000 high school students collected between 1991 and 2017. While the overall proportion of teens reporting suicidal thoughts or plans declined for all racial and ethnic groups during the study period, the proportion of black teens attempting suicide surged by 73%. “Whatever is happening to result in a downward trend among teens in the general population is missing black teens,” said Michael Lindsey, lead author of the study and executive director of the McSilver Institute for Poverty Policy and Research at New York University. Overall, 7.9% of teens attempted suicide during the study, and 2.5% sustained injuries as a result. Almost one in five teens reported suicidal thoughts and 14.7% planned a suicide, researchers report in Pediatrics. Self-reported suicide attempts rose in black teenagers, even as they fell or followed no significant pattern in white, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaska Native teenagers, the study found. While suicide attempts decreased among teen girls overall, they increased among black teen girls. There was also a surge in injuries from suicide attempts among black teen boys. More research is needed to determine why traditional precursors to suicide attempts like thinking about or planning a suicide are decreasing while actual attempts are going up, Lindsey said by email. The current study can’t explain why suicide attempts and injuries are rising among only certain groups of youth. “We believe that it’s important for parents, mental health service providers and school personnel to learn the signs of depression in black youth,” Lindsey said. “We know that suicidality can stem from untreated depression and, in addition to the classic signs of depression, such as becoming withdrawn or having a depressed mood, black teens may present with physical complaints, such as persistent headaches or stomach aches or with interpersonal challenges, such as angry outbursts, which may be construed as behavioral problems rather than cries for help.” A separate study in Pediatrics looked at suicide rates for cisgender teens - youth whose gender identity matches their sex assigned at birth - and for transgender teens - whose gender identity does not match their sex assigned at birth. This study examined online survey data from 2,020 teens ages 14 to 18, including 1,134 who identified as transgender. Compared to their cisgender counterparts, trans teens were more than twice as likely to report having a death wish or suicidal thoughts. Trans youth were also 82% more likely to plan a suicide and 65% more likely to attempt suicide. “Trans teens are under much greater potential societal pressure, such as parental disapproval, bullying, and difficulty in finding romantic and other friends,” said Dr. Benjamin Shain of NorthShore University HealthSystem in Deerfield, Illinois and the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine. Teens are increasingly in danger for suicide and from related mental health problems such as depression, Shain, author of an editorial accompanying the studies in Pediatrics, said by email. Parents should keep an eye out for evidence of depression, severe mood changes, substance misuse or suicidal thoughts or behaviors, Shain advised. Other warning signs may involve changes in how teens behave in school or in relationships with friends and peers, Shain said. In particular, parents should get help for teens when they see a “change in functioning such as lower grades, less interest in activities, isolating from friends and/or family, or dangerous or impulsive behaviors,” Shain added.

2019,France under fire for 'historic error' of blocking Balkan EU hopefuls,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Senior European Union officials, worried by growing Chinese and Russian influence in the Balkans, accused France on Friday of making a “historic error” by refusing to let North Macedonia and Albania start talks on joining the EU. North Macedonia, Albania and four other Balkan countries - Bosnia, Kosovo, Montenegro and Serbia - are trying to join the world’s biggest trading bloc following the ethnic wars of the 1990s that led to the disintegration of Yugoslavia. But though the 28 EU governments see Balkan membership as inevitable one day, French President Emmanuel Macron opposed the start of entry talks with Albania and North Macedonia in what one envoy said was an emotional six-hour debate at an EU summit. Macron later told reporters that the membership bids could not progress until the EU, with its complex decision-making structures, changed - though he did not say how it must do so. He said the EU in its current shape was not able to face today’s challenges or handle another financial crisis, let alone allow in two more states from the Balkans, a region scarred by wars in the 1990s and struggling with crime and corruption. “We need a reformed European Union and a reformed enlargement process, a real credibility and a strategic vision of who we are and our role,” Macron told a news conference, referring to the long process of admitting new members, which involves candidate countries meeting targets in areas such as the economy and law and order. His position frustrated other leaders because Macron had long urged the EU to think strategically and go beyond internal squabbles, envoys said. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the executive European Commission, said France’s decision was a “historic error”. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte had used the same phrase earlier on Friday and added: “We had to start membership talks, I’m very disappointed.” European Council President Donald Tusk, who chaired the EU gathering, regretted a “mistake” had been made. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she hoped EU leaders could review the matter at a summit next year when Croatia holds the EU’s rotating presidency. The move also received criticism from outside the EU, with the U.S. State Department saying in a statement: “We are disappointed the European Council did not recognize each country’s very strong reform efforts by agreeing to open accession negotiations at this time.” Croatia joined the EU in 2013. The European Commission wants other former Yugoslav republics and Kosovo brought into the EU fold to shield them from what they see as the growing influence of China and Russia. After Skopje agreed to end a dispute with Greece over the country’s name - changing from Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to Republic of North Macedonia - Germany’s Merkel urged Paris to at least allow it to start talks. “When we promise something, set certain specifications, Europe needs to be predictable ... I think it’s in our interests to have these countries bound into the European Union. If you look at the map, you see how important this is,” Merkel said. Macron said EU countries could show more meaningful support for the region with investments and by deepening cultural ties. On the eve of the summit, North Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev came to Brussels to warn that China and Russia would “fill in the vacuum” left by the Europeans and urged EU leaders “not to fade out the bright stars” of the European Union flag. All countries have to agree before approval is given for accession talks. Over dinner at the summit, everyone except Macron backed opening membership talks with North Macedonia, which is judged to have met EU targets for a host of reforms and ending disputes with its neighbors. There was slightly less support for Albania. France won support from Denmark and the Netherlands in its resistance to giving Albania’s bid the green light, citing a need to deep measures to tackle corruption and organized crime.

2019,"UBS, Simmons Energy pare bankers as shale M&A slows: sources","NEW YORK/HOUSTON (Reuters) - UBS Group AG and the energy arm of Piper Jaffray Companies have cut staff in their oil and gas investment banking teams, three people familiar with the matter said on Monday, as U.S. dealmaking continues to dry up. Mergers and acquisitions activity within the shale business is at its lowest level in a decade, excluding Occidental Petroleum Corp’s purchase of Anadarko Petroleum Corp, as shareholders squeeze producers to focus on returns and develop existing acreage rather than expansion. The decline has left investment bankers that advise on such transactions without enough work. UBS declined to comment. Simmons Energy, which is a division of Piper Jaffray, did not reply to requests for comment. Those departing UBS and Simmons Energy were focused on sales of acreage and smaller assets, known in the industry as the acquisitions and divestitures (A&D), and left in the last couple of weeks, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the information is not public. Among those departing the Swiss bank are Managing Directors David Edwards and Miles Redfield, among the most senior names in the unit. Around half of the A&D team at UBS was dismissed, which previously consisted of around a dozen bankers, according to one of the sources. A second source said the number who left was fewer than 10. Edwards and Redfield were among a 15-person team that joined UBS from Bank of Montreal’s investment banking arm in 2015. The move was acrimonious with both men, along with two others, subject to a lawsuit from the Canadian bank over their switch. At Simmons, around two-thirds of their upstream A&D team was laid off, including Phillip Ream, a managing director who joined the firm in 2018 from Barclays. Piper Jaffray did not reply to requests for comment. In total, around seven people at Simmons are set to leave, two of the people said. The head of A&D for Simmons, Jay Boudreaux, has been asked to retire at the end of the year, according to one of the sources. Boudreaux has been with Simmons since 2005, according to his biography on the company’s website. He did not reply to requests for comment. These job cuts are the latest in the Houston investment banking community: Last month, Jefferies Financial Group laid off 15 people, mostly focused on A&D, while Wells Fargo & Co. cut 7% of its energy investment banking team in the city.

2019,CORRECTED-European shares dip after flood of earnings,"(Corrects direction of move in headline) Oct 22 (Reuters) - European shares inched lower on Tuesday as investors sifted through a mixed bag of corporate earnings and eyed latest developments on U.S.-China trade talks and Britain’s progress towards some form of orderly departure from the European Union. Germany’s DAX and Switzerland’s SSMI both bucked the trend, with the latter helped by a 1% gain for drugmaker Novartis after it raised its 2019 targets and reported better-than-expected revenue. Another Swiss company, Apple supplier AMS also climbed 6% as demand from smartphone makers boosted operating profit. French specialty minerals company Imerys slipped 6% after cutting its outlook for 2019, while Norway’s Aker BP moved marginally lower as it slashed its full-year oil output target. British household goods maker Reckitt Benckiser was moored to the bottom of the pan-European STOXX index with a 5% fall after it cut its full-year sales forecast for the second time this year. The STOXX was down just over 0.1% by 0728 GMT. Shares of UBS led gains among banking stocks after Switzerland’s biggest bank reported a smaller than expected loss in quarterly profit. Swedish defence firm Saab rose 7% to top the STOXX 600 after reporting third-quarter operating earnings well ahead of market forecasts and affirming its view that operating cashflow this year would improve versus 2018.

2019,Turkey says Russia promised to keep Kurdish militia away from border: BBC,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Russia has promised Ankara that the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, which Turkey’s military is targeting, will not be in the Syrian territories across the border, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu was quoted as saying on Thursday. Russia “promised that the PKK or YPG will not be on the other side of the border,” Cavusoglu said in an interview with the BBC. “If Russia, accompanied by the Syrian army, removes YPG elements from the region, we will not oppose this.” Earlier on Thursday, Russia’s foreign ministry spokeswoman said Syria should get control over its border with Turkey as part of any settlement of the conflict in the region, as Turkey pressed on with its offensive into northeastern Syria.

2019,Hong Kong's securities regulator chief to step down next year,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Ashley Alder, CEO of Hong Kong’s securities regulator, will step down in September next year at the end of a third three-year term in the post, a spokesman for the regulator said on Monday. During his tenure, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) took a more active, interventionist role as part of its so-called “front loaded approach” to policing Hong Kong’s capital markets after a series of stock crashes and wild price swings threatened to undermine the market. The SFC also imposed larger penalties for wrongdoing by the companies it regulates in recent years than it had done previously, in line with global trends. In March this year, it banned UBS (UBSG.S) from leading initial public offerings in Hong Kong for a year and fined it and rivals including Morgan Stanley (MS.N) a combined $100 million for due diligence failures on a series of IPOs. “Mr Alder has been at the helm of the SFC for eight years during which the organization has pursued a set of intensive policy and operational reforms to tackle market risks as well as setting itself as a tough, competent and effective market regulator,” the SFC spokesman said in an email. “The changes which have been put in place are now embedded and institutionalized and Mr Alder believed it is the right time to hand over to new leadership.” Alder is also the chair of the global securities regulators association, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).

2019,Latitude CEO disappointed KKR pulled IPO due to low price,"(Reuters) - Private equity giant KKR & Co (KKR.N) and its partners canceled what was to be Australia’s biggest listing of the year, lender Latitude Financial, because investors would not pay a price that reflected its value, the Latitude CEO said on Wednesday. In what was to be their second attempt at listing in just over a year, KKR, Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and Varde Partners pulled the expected A$1 billion ($676.20 million) offering late on Tuesday, according to sources, even after finding buyers for all its shares. In an email to Latitude staff on Wednesday, reviewed by Reuters, Latitude Chief Executive Officer Ahmed Fahour confirmed the Initial Public Offering was canceled but said the company would continue as a private enterprise. “Feedback from investors has been overwhelmingly positive and although demand has been strong, some investors have not been prepared to offer a price per share that reflects a fair value given the strength and performance of our business,” Fahour wrote in the email. “For this reason our shareholders have decided not to proceed with the listing process at this time, a decision that’s in the interests of our business, our people, our customers and partners,” Fahour added. A Latitude spokesman told Reuters the email was authentic. Speaking on behalf of the company’s three major shareholders, Chairman Mike Tiley confirmed the decision and said the board of directors were concerned about the performance of the shares. On Tuesday, Reuters reported the decision had been made because a large proportion of demand for shares was coming from hedge funds rather than desired long-term investors, and therefore the owners did not want to risk “an adverse after-market outcome”. “Despite extensive engagement with prospective investors the Board and shareholders have determined not to proceed with the offer,” Tiley said in an emailed statement. “The Board and shareholders were conscious of the importance of ensuring a strong after market for the company.” Latitude had filed a prospectus with the regulator last month valuing the company at between A$2 and A$2.25 per share but over the weekend decided to discount the offer price by as much as 20.9% due to low demand, Reuters reported. That would have valued the company at about A$3.1 billion. But even after the discount, investors and analysts remained cautious about the risks facing the company, including the potential for rising bad debts and high competition in the digital and installment payment sector, where Latitude wants to grow. The company, which offers easy-access loans and credit cards with minimal paperwork, and its bookrunners were due to finalize the raising on Wednesday and shares in the new company were due to begin trading Oct. 18. KKR, Deutsche Bank and Varde Partners founded Latitude in 2015 when they bought GE Capital’s Australian and New Zealand consumer lending arm for A$8.2 billion. Last year, Latitude deferred a planned IPO that would have valued the business at about A$5 billion due to market conditions and a management change, while the country’s financial industry was also being scrutinized by a national misconduct inquiry. “While it is disappointing that we are not in a position to progress a public listing at this stage, we will continue to execute on the growth strategy with the support of our shareholder group.” Fahour said in a separate statement emailed to Reuters.

2019,MIDEAST STOCKS-Banks weigh on Saudi; other Gulf markets mixed,"Oct 21 (Reuters) - Most Gulf stock markets moved marginally on Monday, with the Saudi index snapping a three-day winning streak dented by losses in financials and petrochemical sectors. In Saudi Arabia, the benchmark index dropped 0.7% with Al Rajhi Bank losing 1% and Riyad Bank easing 1.6%. Yanbu National Petrochemicals Co declined 3% after the company’s profit more than halved in the third quarter, compared with the same quarter last year. Separately, Saudi Aramco (IPO-ARMO.SE) has put off the planned launch of its initial public offering (IPO) in hopes that pending third-quarter results will bolster investor confidence in the world’s largest oil firm, Reuters reported on Friday citing two sources familiar with the matter.

2019,"U.S. homebuilding retreats, manufacturing still struggling","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding tumbled from more than a 12-year high in September, but single-family home construction rose for a fourth straight month, suggesting the housing market remains supported by lower mortgage rates even as the economy is slowing. The moderation in economic growth was underscored by other data on Thursday showing manufacturing output falling last month and factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region decelerating in October. The economy is being constrained by a 15-month trade war between the United States and China, which has dented business sentiment and caused a drop in capital expenditures. Ironically, manufacturing has borne the brunt of the trade tariffs, which the White House argues are necessary to protect industries from what it says is unfair foreign competition. Other parts of the economy are also starting to show cracks from the trade war, with retail sales dropping in September for the first time in seven months and services sector growth slowing. For a graphic on U.S. housing starts, building permits DataStream Chart: here Many economists expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates for the third time later this month to limit the drag on the economy from the trade war and keep the longest expansion on record, now in its 11th year, on track. “It inches them forward to taking out a little more insurance to help support the economy that continues to face the headwinds of reduced world trade from tariffs,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. Housing starts declined 9.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.256 million units last month as construction in the volatile multi-family housing segment dropped, the Commerce Department said. Data for August was revised higher to show homebuilding accelerating to a pace of 1.386 million units, which was the highest level since June 2007, instead of marching to a rate of 1.364 million units as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts decreasing to a pace of 1.320 million units in September. Housing starts rose 1.6% on a year-on-year basis in September. The housing market, the most sensitive sector to interest rates, has perked up in recent months as mortgage rates have plunged from last year’s multi-year highs. But the sector, which accounts for about 3.1% of the economy, continues to be hampered by land and labor shortages. A survey on Wednesday showed confidence among homebuilders jumped to a more than 1-1/2-year high in October. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped more than 135 basis points to an average of 3.57%, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. Economists expect a mild rebound in residential investment in the third quarter after it contracted for six straight quarters, the longest such stretch since the 2007-2009 recession. Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, rose 0.3% to a rate of 918,000 units in September, the highest level since January. Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment plunged 28.2% to a rate of 338,000 units in September. U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors focused on news that Britain had clinched an eleventh-hour deal on its exit from the European Union. The dollar weakened against a basket of currencies, while stocks on Wall Street rose. U.S. Treasury prices fell. For a graphic on U.S. jobless claims: here In a separate report on Thursday, the Fed said manufacturing production fell 0.5% last month as a strike by about 48,000 workers at General Motors (GM.N) hammered motor vehicle output. Production at factories increased 0.6% in August. Excluding motor vehicles, manufacturing output dropped 0.2% after surging 0.7% in August. Manufacturing has also been hurt by an inventory glut, especially in the automobile sector, and design troubles at Boeing (BA.N). The fading boost from last year’s $1.5 trillion tax cut package is also compounding manufacturing’s woes. Though President Donald Trump announced a temporary truce in the trade war last Friday, which delayed additional tariffs that were due this month, economists saw little change in fortunes at factories without all import duties being rolled back. Manufacturing production rebounded at a 1.1% rate in the third quarter after declining for two straight quarters. While the increase in the so-called hard data could offer hope that the manufacturing downturn could be close to an end, factory surveys, which are considered leading indicators, remain weak. “As we would not expect this disconnect to last for long, there remains a downside risk that hard data could weaken further,” said Veronica Clark, an economist at Citi in New York. In a third report, the Philadelphia Fed said its business conditions index for the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware fell to a reading of 5.6 in October from 12.0 in September. The survey’s measures of new orders and employment rose. Its six-month business conditions index jumped to a reading of 33.8 this month from 20.8 in September. The survey’s six-month capital expenditures index increased to 36.4 from a reading of 25.9 in the prior month. Despite the slowing economy, companies are holding on to their workers. In a fourth report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 214,000 for the week ended Oct. 12. Last week’s claims data covered the survey period for the nonfarm payrolls component of October’s employment report. Claims rose 4,000 between the September and October survey period, suggesting little change in the moderate pace of job growth this month. But the General Motors strike could weigh on payrolls in October. Striking workers, who did not receive a paycheck during the payrolls survey period, are counted as unemployed. GM and the United Auto Workers union reached a tentative deal on Wednesday to end the month-long strike. “The claims data may be sending an overly optimistic signal about the upcoming October payroll report,” said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. “The near 50,000 workers that have been on strike recently likely will be removed from the October payroll count.” For a graphic on jobless claims: here Reporting By Lucia Mutikani, additional reporting by Lindsay Dusmuir; Editing by Andrea Ricci and Chris Reese",Reuters

2019,Shareholders' lawyers to 7th Circuit: Trial judges have no power to police mootness fees,"(Reuters) - In a newly filed brief at the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, shareholders' lawyers contend that trial judges have no inherent power to oversee the private fees that plaintiffs' counsel receive from defendants in exchange for dropping M&A class actions. The brief, filed by Daniel Geyser on behalf of the shareholders' firms Monteverde & Associates and Kahn Swick & Foti, argues that U.S. District Judge Thomas Durkin of Chicago had no business throwing out a $325,000 mootness fee that they and other plaintiffs' firms received from the pharma company Akorn. Akorn paid the fee after agreeing to make additional proxy disclosures about its then-pending merger with Fresenius. Plaintiffs' lawyers, in turn, agreed to dismiss prospective class actions challenging the deal. Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast. These “mootness fees,” as you probably know, have become a key business model for plaintiffs' lawyers in the years since Delaware Chancery Court cracked down on fee awards in so-called disclosure-only M&A class action settlements. (A reminder: In disclosure-only settlements, shareholders get no money at all - just additional proxy disclosures.) After Delaware’s 2016 ruling in In re Trulia, shareholders' lawyers shifted to federal court for class actions challenging M&A transactions. They also stopped, for the most part, settling cases on a classwide basis. Instead, most federal-court M&A class actions in the last few years have been voluntarily dismissed by individual shareholders before substantive litigation even takes place. In many cases, when those dismissals have been accompanied by beefed-up proxy disclosures, defendants have agreed to pay mootness fees to shareholders’ lawyers. In a study earlier this year of the mootness fee phenomenon, law professors Matthew Cain and Steven Solomon of Berkeley, Jill Fisch of Penn and Randall Thomas of Vanderbilt estimated that in 2017 alone, shareholders’ lawyers received $23 million in such fees. Unlike class action settlements, which must be approved by trial judges, mootness fee deals are generally outside of the court’s reach. Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, plaintiffs do not have to obtain judges’ approval to dismiss cases before a defendant has answered the complaint or moved for summary judgment. And even though these shareholder M&A challenges are filed as class actions, the class action rules allow plaintiffs to dismiss cases without court approval as long as the class has not been certified. Critics such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, as I’ve reported, have accused shareholders' lawyers of abusing the leverage of class action litigation by filing complaints on behalf of all shareholders yet evading judicial scrutiny of their fees by settling on behalf of individual plaintiffs. In Judge Durkin’s June 2019 ruling in the Akorn case, the judge concluded that he had the inherent power to review Akorn’s mootness fee payment to shareholder lawyers because plaintiffs’ original class action complaints should have been dismissed out of hand. The judge concluded that the additional disclosures shareholders sought in those original filings were immaterial. Plaintiffs' lawyers deserved no fee for obtaining immaterial disclosures, he said, citing the 7th Circuit’s 2016 decision in In re Walgreen Co. Stockholder Litigation. In that case, the appeals court decried the “racket” of shareholder M&A class actions and struck down a fee award to plaintiffs' lawyers who obtained only additional disclosures in a class action settlement. But in their new brief, the shareholder firms appealing Judge Durkin’s Akorn decision argued that Walgreen precedent gave the trial judge no authority to review a mootness fee. In Walgreen, the brief argued, the 7th Circuit was reviewing fees awarded to plaintiffs’ lawyers who settled on behalf of a class of shareholders. By contrast, according to the brief, Judge Durkin inserted himself into a private agreement between Akorn and lawyers representing individual shareholders who did not need the court’s approval to dismiss their claims. He had no jurisdiction over the mootness fee agreement, the brief said, and no authority to void it. “This court has repeatedly held that inherent authority must be exercised sparingly,” the brief said. “Courts may not rely upon their inherent authority to side-step applicable rules, statutory regimes and established principles of law. Yet that is precisely what the district court did here.” It’s worth pointing out that Geyser previously rescued shareholders' lawyers at the U.S. Supreme Court in last term’s Emulex v. Varjabedian. The case ostensibly presented the question of the proper pleading standard for shareholder allegations of inadequate tender offer disclosures, but Emulex and its amici also asked the Supreme Court to consider whether shareholders even have a private right to sue under federal securities laws governing tender offers. Geyser argued that Emulex had waived the right to assert that broad argument. Last April, the justices dismissed the case as improvidently granted, leaving intact, as least for now, shareholders’ ability to file class actions challenging tender offer disclosures. Class action watchdog Ted Frank of the Hamilton Lincoln Law Institute has moved to be appointed as an amicus in the 7th Circuit appeal to defend Judge Durkin’s ruling. Frank, an Akorn shareholder, sought unsuccessfully to intervene in the litigation before Judge Durkin, but his protest of the mootness fee agreement ultimately prompted Judge Durkin to invalidate the deal. Frank’s brief to the 7th Circuit said that Akorn does not intend to argue in favor of Judge Durkin’s ruling at the appeals court. I emailed Akorn counsel Sohil Shah of Polsinelli to confirm that assertion but didn’t hear back. The views expressed in this article are not those of Reuters News.",Reuters

The data showed growth in the world’s second-largest economy marked a further loss of momentum in the third quarter, casting gloom over global equities. Helping to prop up markets was a 1.6% premarket rise in shares of Coca-Cola Co after the company beat analysts’ expectations for quarterly sales. Oilfield services provider Schlumberger NV also gained 1.8% following a quarterly profit beat. The reporting season kicked off on a strong note this week, with solid results from major banks, healthcare giants and streaming pioneer Netflix Inc. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average indexes were on pace to cap their second week in gains. But the gains could be short-lived as analysts see third-quarter S&P 500 earnings falling by 2.9%, according to Refinitiv data, marking the first contraction since mid-2016. Wall Street investors took comfort in the string of corporate earnings beats and encouraging geopolitical developments on Thursday, which soothed some concerns about a downturn in the U.S. economy. A 15-month long trade war between Washington and Beijing and slowing domestic manufacturing growth have also weighed on buyers’ sentiment. At 7:15 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 5 points, or 0.02%.

Patterson passed for 194 yards, while Hassan Haskins gained 125 yards on 12 carries and scored his first career touchdown. Zach Charbonnet added 116 yards rushing on 18 carries for Michigan (5-1, 3-1 Big Ten), which nearly squandered a 28-point lead. Matt Robinson passed for one score and ran for another for Illinois (2-4, 0-3). The Wolverines led 28-7 at halftime. They required five running plays to cover 65 yards in their first possession. Haskins scored on a third-and-1 situation from the Illinois 29-yard line, breaking a tackle five yards downfield and outracing other defenders. Michigan scored again before the end of the quarter. Haskins had a 28-yard run to set up Patterson’s 25-yard pass to tight end Luke Schoonmaker. Jordan Glasgow’s punt block early in the second quarter gave the Wolverines the ball at the Fighting Illini 7. On the next play, Charbonnet scooted through the defense to make it 21-0. Ronnie Bell’s 71-yard catch-and-run set up the Wolverines’ fourth touchdown. A 4-yard pass from Patterson to Nick Eubanks completed that drive with 4:33 left in the half. Michigan gave up its first touchdown in three games during the final minute of the half. Illinois completed a 67-yard drive on Robinson’s 23-yard pass to Josh Imatorbhebhe. Illinois made it 28-10 on James McCourt’s 50-yard field goal. Robinson’s 35-yard pass to Imatorbhebhe was the big play on an 80-yard drive that Robinson capped off with a 1-yard plunge later in the third quarter. Tru Wilson’s fumble in the opening seconds of the fourth quarter was recovered by the Illini. Dre Brown’s 1-yard run finished off that 36-yard drive and his two-point conversion run cut Michigan’s lead to 28-25 with 12:50 remaining. The Wolverines scored on their next possession. Patterson tossed a 5-yard touchdown pass to Donovan Peoples-Jones two plays after Patterson ran for a first down on a fourth-and-2 situation from the Illini 13.

2019,METALS-Copper drops as China trade data reinforces negative mood,"* Weak demand weighs on copper tmsnrt.rs/2LT2gIL * GRAPHIC-2019 asset returns: tmsnrt.rs/2jvdmXl (Updates prices) By Pratima Desai LONDON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Copper prices fell on Monday as trade data from top consumer China reinforced concerns about demand for industrial metals while signs of progress on U.S.-China trade talks elicited a cautious response. Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange was untraded in official rings but bid down 0.8% at $5,750 a tonne. Prices of the metal used as a gauge of economic health are down more than 10% since the 2019 high above $6,600 a tonne. “Chinese trade data shows demand domestically and globally is weak and though it looks as if we are are moving in the right direction on the trade talks, there was nothing specific for metals,” said BMO Capital markets analyst Kash Kamal. “However, preliminary numbers showed rising imports of copper concentrates ... domestic demand in pockets is improving because of the stimulus that has been injected into the Chinese economy through the year.” TALKS: U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday outlined the first phase of a deal to end the trade war with China and suspended threatened increases to tariffs, but officials on both sides said much more work needs to be done before an accord can be agreed. TRADE: A slide in China’s exports gathered pace in September while imports contracted for a fifth straight month, pointing to further weakness. AUTOS: Highlighting the weakness in Chinese growth and demand were September auto sales that fell 5.2% year on year, representing a 15th consecutive month of declines. DATA: Chinese data on loans, investment and industrial production this week will be closely watched by metals markets for clues on demand prospects. TECHNICALS: Copper prices are expected to struggle to break above the 100-day moving average of $5,835, while support is at $5,760, where the 50-day moving average currently sits. PERU: Support for copper came from news that Chinese miner MMG might halt production at its Las Bambas mine in Peru because protesters are blocking access to the site. Also on the radar is the prospect of a strike from next Wednesday at small Chilean copper mine Antucoya, owned by Antofagasta Minerals, after contract negotiations broke down. SPREAD: The premium for cash nickel over the three-month contract closed at an elevated $187 a tonne CMNI0-3 on Friday, close to the $214 hit on Oct. 1, its highest since April 2009. The rise is because of falling stocks of the stainless steel ingredient in LME-registered warehouses, which have dropped below 100,000 tonnes to their lowest in more than seven years. Three-month nickel was down 1.9% at $17,220 a tonne. PRICES: Aluminium was down 0.4% at $1,715, zinc fell 0.4% to $2,409, lead slid 2.3% to $2,132 and tin gained 0.2% to $16,550.

2019,Novartis gets lift from $2.1 million gene therapy Zolgensma,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Novartis (NOVN.S) boosted its 2019 forecasts on Tuesday after beating third-quarter expectations, a feat helped by the sales debut of gene therapy Zolgensma, the world’s most expensive one-time treatment. CEO Vas Narasimhan’s bet on the potential cure for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) has drawn scrutiny, initially due to its $2.1 million price and since August over a data manipulation scandal that has prompted a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigation. But Zolgensma sales in the third quarter netted Novartis $160 million, half from patients switching from another therapy, Narasimhan said. “We’re very pleased with the uptake,” Narasimhan told reporters on a call. The only other approved drug for the genetic disease SMA is Spinraza from Biogen (BIIB.O), which reports third-quarter results on Tuesday and is expected to show an impact after Zolgensma sales began following its approval in May. Novartis reported a 17% rise in third-quarter core net income to $3.2 billion. Sales rose 13% at constant exchange rates to $12.2 billion, topping the $11.7 billion average in a Refinitiv poll, helped by higher sales of psoriasis medicine Cosentyx and heart drug Entresto. Novartis said now expects its overall annual sales to grow by a high single-digit percentage, raising a “mid-to-high single-digit” forecast made in July. Core operating income is forecast to growth by mid- to high-teen percent, up from a previous expectation for low double-digit to mid-teen percentage growth. Zuercher Kantonalbank analysts called Zolgensma sales “a strong start”. But Novartis tempered expectations for its approval in Europe and Japan, pushing projections back to 2020 from this year. Narasimhan said those regulators are focused on manufacturing, not data manipulation, which Novartis has blamed on scientists who it said doctored early study results at AveXis, a company it bought in 2018 for $8.7 billion. AveXis founder Brian Kaspar, who Novartis fired this year, has denied wrongdoing. “The written questions have not related specifically to any of the data topics,” Narasimhan said regarding European and Japanese regulators. “They were primarily related to the manufacturing issues, as well as interest in doing additional inspections of our various manufacturing facilities.” Zolgensma is a one-time infusion for patients born with SMA, a rare muscle-wasting hereditary disease that historically killed many victims before their second birthday. Narasimhan said 99% of young patients who are eligible for Zolgensma have received treatment, either under insurance that cover it or following appeals to payers without specific policies. “Access has been one of the key drivers,” he said. Despite the data manipulation allegations, the U.S. FDA has said the therapy is safe and effective. Reporting by John Miller; editing by Michael Shields and Jason Neely",Reuters
2019,"LIVESTOCK-Lean hogs drop on burdensome supply, export jitters","CHICAGO, Oct 22 (Reuters) - U.S. lean hog futures slumped on Tuesday, pressured by abundant near-term hog supplies and concerns that U.S. pork export demand would not be large enough to absorb the expected surplus of meat produced. Hopes for a jump in Chinese demand for U.S. pork have supported hog futures at times in recent months. China’s demand for imported pork has risen this year as a deadly hog disease known as African swine fever has decimated its domestic herd. But U.S. shipments to the world’s top pork consuming country have been largely disappointing and steep retaliatory tariffs on U.S. shipments remain in place. Meanwhile, massive U.S. hog supplies have weighed down cash hog prices, which are at a large discount to futures. The average cash hog price in the closely followed Iowa and southern Minnesota market were down $1.04 per cwt on Tuesday at $56.35 per cwt. Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) December lean hog futures , the most active contract, settled down 2.325 cents at 65.500 cents per pound. “We have questions about the demand, while at the same time the supply looks ridiculously large,” said Rich Nelson, chief strategist with Allendale Inc. “We see a 4.5% increase in fourth-quarter production. That’s an extra 1.1 billion pounds shoved onto this market. Any concerns about China not buying means we’ve got some mispricing in these December futures,” Nelson said. CME live cattle futures ended mostly lower, with spot October futures dragged down by a wave of deliveries against futures which indicate futures are overpriced. October live cattle ended down 1.075 cents at 109.875 cent per pound while actively traded December live cattle settled down 0.175 cent at 113.700 cents per pound. CME November feeder cattle futures were up 0.650 cent at 143.500 cents per pound, while actively traded January was up 0.700 at 139.800 cents. Cold storage data released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture after the close appeared supportive to both hogs and cattle due to declines in beef and pork stocks in September, normally a stock-building month.

2019,French power output down 4.7 GW as EDF workers protest restructuring,"PARIS (Reuters) - Around a quarter of employees at French utility EDF downed tools on Thursday in protest at a plan to restructure the state-controlled company, reducing power generation at several nuclear, hydro and gas-fired plants. EDF said the production cut was likely to continue until the end of the national strike later on Thursday evening. The cut in electricity production does not impact the grid or affect households, but reduced generation is costly for the heavily indebted EDF as it has to import any shortfall to supply its clients. The data showed that electricity production was down at five nuclear reactors and two gas-fired generators. Power generation was down at EDF-operated hydropower stations by 1.4 gigawatts (GW), with the cumulative outage due to the strike at 4.7 GW by 1413 GMT, according to EDF data. EDF unions said in a statement that the strike had cut power generation by 7 GW across the country, with over 30% of workers joining the strike. French power grid operator RTE’s data showed that peak electricity demand in France was expected at around 55.9 GW on Thursday. Total available generation capacity was at 54.8 GW. The walkout is the second called by EDF’s four main unions to protest the restructuring project following a Sept. 19 demonstration, when a third of the company’s workforce went on strike and cut French power production by over 10%. EDF workers are against plans steered by the French government to restructure and potentially split the group, with its nuclear power generation business set to be partly nationalized. The unions, which want to see the restructuring plan abandoned, said in the statement that the French president’s office had agreed to meet them on Oct. 28, and they would jointly push for the plan to be withdrawn. EDF has said the restructuring proposals, originally scheduled to be presented by year-end, would likely slip into next year, as it awaits broader reforms of power regulations, which need to be co-ordinated with the European Commission.

2019,Norway posts first monthly trade deficit since 2017 as gas exports plunge,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway recorded its first monthly trade deficit in almost two years last month, triggered by a sharp fall in sales of natural gas and a decline in the price of crude oil, its two most important exports. The gap for September was 1.2 billion Norwegian crowns ($132 million), Statistics Norway (SSB) said on Tuesday. It was the first negative monthly trade balance since November 2017 and only the third in the last 20 years. Europe’s second-largest energy exporter, after Russia, saw gas output decline by 27% from August to a nine-year low, the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD) said separately, missing the industry regulator’s forecast by 35%. Crude output lagged expectations by a smaller 7.7%, the NPD added. SSB’s numbers showed the value of those oil exports fell 19% as prices declined. While oil and gas normally contribute about half of Norway’s export revenues, their combined share declined to around 39% of the total in September, SSB’s data showed. The value of gas exports declined 68% year-on-year as prices fell and volumes dropped, which SSB and the NPD said was primarily caused by maintenance work and some technical problems at offshore platforms and distribution terminals. But the sharp fall in volume also indicated that producers had held back production to prevent a further price decline, Sparebank 1 Markets analyst Teodor Sveen-Nielsen said. “We guess the low gas production is explained by low gas prices in Q3 and that operator Equinor (EQNR.OL) therefore has reduced the flex gas production at Troll,” he said, referring to the North Sea’s largest gas field and a key swing producer. Troll was completely shut for four full days in September, and the field’s maintenance schedule shows its capacity reduction for the month was about four times larger than a year ago, according to gas pipeline operator Gassco. State-controlled Equinor, which is due to report third-quarter earnings on Oct. 24, declined to comment. The company has said in the past that it could increase or reduce gas production at its Troll and Oseberg fields to maximize its revenues. Equinor this month began production from its Johan Sverdrup oil field, the largest North Sea crude discovery since the 1980s, which is expected to provide a significant boost to exports. The year-to-date trade surplus fell to 106.3 billion crowns from 206.4 billion in 2018. Writing by Terje Solsvik; Editing by Catherine Evans",Reuters

2019,Kings no match for Golden Knights' power play,"Paul Stastny had two goals and two assists and Max Pacioretty added a goal and two assists to lead the visiting Vegas Golden Knights to a 5-2 victory over the Los Angeles Kings on Sunday night. It was the 250th goal of Pacioretty’s career. Reilly Smith and Mark Stone also scored goals for Vegas, which converted all three of its power-play chances. The Golden Knights had entered the contest just 3 of 17 on the power play. Marc-Andre Fleury finished with 36 saves for Vegas and Shea Theodore added a pair of assists. It was also the 250th NHL coaching victory for Golden Knights coach Gerard Gallant. Austin Wagner and Dustin Brown scored goals for Los Angeles. Jonathan Quick, who has allowed 19 goals in three starts this season, had 31 saves. Vegas scored two goals 77 seconds apart in the first 6:59 to take a 2-0 lead. Smith scored the first one with a wrist shot into the top corner off a pass from William Karlsson for his fourth goal of the season. Pacioretty followed with a power-play goal, roofing a wrist shot from the right dot that pinged in off the right post. The Kings cut it to 2-1 on Wagner’s first goal of the season when he fired a wrist shot from the middle of the left circle over Fleury’s left shoulder at 7:49 of the first. Vegas then took control in the second period, outshooting the Kings 23-8 while adding a pair of power-play goals by Stastny. The first came when he deflected Pacioretty’s pass toward the front of the net. The second came off a quick pass from Jonathan Marchessault from the left side of the goal that Stastny slapped past Quick’s blocker side for his third goal in two games. Los Angeles closed to 4-2 less than five minutes into the third period when Brown tapped in a cross-crease pass by Anze Kopitar for his third goal of the season. But Vegas needed just 17 seconds to go back ahead by three goals when Stone backhanded a pass from Stastny into the slot past Quick for his fourth goal of the season. —Field Level Media ",Reuters
2019,"Newlat IPO book covered, bourse debut expected on Thursday: sources","MILAN (Reuters) - Italian food group Newlat has received sufficient orders to sell all the shares in its initial public offering in the planned price range, two sources with knowledge of the matter said on Monday, bucking recent weak demand for Italian listings. Luxury yacht maker Ferretti and high-end audio equipment group RCF pulled their share sales last week due to poor investor demand but Newlat is pressing ahead and plans to debut on the Milan bourse later this week. Italian and international asset managers have placed relevant orders for Newlat shares, one of the sources said, adding the final price for the IPO would likely be below the mid-point of the 5.80-7.30 euro-per-share range. The group is based in the northern town of Reggio Emilia and owns a portfolio of more than 20 food brands including pasta label Delverde and dairy brand Polenghi Lombardo. It is offering 17 million new shares, corresponding to around 41% of the company’s capital following the offer, to raise fresh funds for acquisitions and to improve its existing plants. Newlat said previously that the indicative valuation range corresponded to a valuation before the capital increase of between 157 million and 197 million euros ($220 million). The share sale is due to close on Tuesday afternoon and the company plans to debut on the Milan bourse on Oct. 24. Equita SIM, HSBC and Societè Generale are global coordinators for the share sale.

2019,"UPDATE 1-France's Thales issues 2019 sales warning on space, defence woes","(Adds details, background) PARIS, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Thales cut its 2019 revenue growth forecast on Thursday due mainly to slow sales of commercial satellites and production delays with an Australian military vehicle project. Bringing forward part of a quarterly results announcement scheduled for Oct 22, the French company reported flat nine-month revenues of 10.87 billion euros. Europe’s largest defence electronics company now expects full-year revenues to grow around 1% on an organic or like-for-like basis, rather than a previous goal of around 3%. All other financial targets remain unchanged and Thales will communicate its quarterly order intake figures next Tuesday as previously planned, Finance Director Pascal Bouchiat said. Thales builds satellites through Thales Alenia Space, two-thirds-owned by Thales and the rest by Italy’s Leonardo . French newspaper La Tribune reported earlier this year that it faced job cuts after losing market share to rivals. Thales said the market was poised to recover, but not quickly enough to start bringing in the amount of revenue originally anticipated in the final quarter. “Our space business is faced with a reduction in orders by the satellite operators. We think this market is gradually recovering but orders are a little slow to materialise,” Bouchiat told reporters on a conference call. Thales is involved in the final stage of four significant commercial satellite tenders, whose conclusion is expected in the coming weeks, the company said. In the defence business, Bouchiat cited delays in increasing production for the Hawkei Australian military vehicle programme, as well as delays in some unspecified contract signings. Delays in building the light protected vehicles will result in some revenue landing in 2020 instead of 2019, Bouchiat said. Asked about civil aerospace, where Thales supplies in-flight entertainment systems and avionics, Bouchiat said activity was “completely satisfactory” and in line with expectations.

2019,Secret abortions spike in Nigeria with Boko Haram chaos,"MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Kellu became pregnant after a Nigerian soldier offered her food and shelter in exchange for sex. But the destitute teenager - who lost her family when Boko Haram militants attacked her village two years earlier - did not want to have the baby. After moving to a camp for displaced people in northeastern Borno state, where she relied on neighbours for food, 18-year-old Kellu wanted an abortion but did not know where to go - like a growing number of women since the Islamist insurgency began. “If I continue with this pregnancy, it will ruin my life,” Kellu, who guessed she was about two months pregnant, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, sitting on a mat in a building pock-marked with bullet holes. “Everyone will know what I did. They will stigmatise me for having a baby without a husband. Also, I have no money to take care of myself. How am I supposed to look after a child?” asked Kellu, who declined to publish her real name. Nigeria has some of the world’s most restrictive abortion laws, which only allow abortion to save the life of the mother. The Johns Hopkins University estimates that 2.7 million abortions are carried out in Nigeria each year, the majority performed secretly and in dangerous conditions, with poor, uneducated women most at risk. Health and aid workers say unsafe abortions have surged in northern Nigeria since the start of the Boko Haram conflict in 2009, which has driven 1.8 million Nigerians from their homes, according to the United Nations. At least 40 women and girls come in for emergency post-abortion care each month, said Aminu, a senior nurse in a busy government clinic in Yobe state - west of Borno state - about three times the average of 10 to 15 a month a decade earlier. Nigeria has the fourth highest maternal mortality rate globally, according to the World Health Organization, with about 100 women and girls dying each day. Death rates in the northeast - where clinics and hospitals have been destroyed as armed groups fight to create an Islamic caliphate - are the worst in Nigeria, government data shows. Women and girls go to pharmacies, vendors of locally made drugs and older women to terminate pregnancies, using medication, herbs or tools like sticks, Aminu said. Fatima, is was in her 40s, went to an aunt who gave her herbs that caused a miscarriage in a few hours. “It wasn’t a choice, I had to end it,” said Fatima, who declined to publish her real name, who was raising five children and four grandchildren in a displaced camp in Borno state. “Men say it’s immorality. But they are not the ones who have to give birth and look after the babies. When your children are telling you they are hungry, how can you have another one?” she asked, adding foetuses are often found in the camp’s toilets. Nigerian officials insist the law is upheld. “Regardless of circumstances, abortion is prohibited except for medical reasons,” said Ali Grema, deputy director of emergency medical response in the health ministry in Borno state. “It is not allowed for social reasons.” With many husbands missing, detained or dead, more women are having sex outside marriage, aid workers said. While some women choose to get into new relationships, the United Nations has recorded thousands of cases of sexual violence and transactional sex, particularly by women and girls who lack food, shelter or money. “Many people who are displaced live with hosts who take advantage of them. If they say no, they may lose their housing,” said Maryam Aje, head of the African Youth for Peace Development and Empowerment Foundation, which gives women business grants. Pointing to a poster in a Maiduguri camp encouraging women to space their children, Hadiza - a nurse working in a nearby clinic - said family planning messages focused on married women because of conservative attitudes. “Women will ask for contraception but they don’t want husbands to know,” said Hadiza, who declined to publish her real name. “(They) come at night, when nobody is around.” Hadiza said she often received calls or visits from young women after working hours, asking for the morning-after pill. “It’s better to prevent such pregnancies than try and deal with them when they happen,” she said. Many girls do not even know sex can make them pregnant, said Lucy Dlama of Women in New Nigeria, which supports rape survivors with health care. “Our culture means it is taboo for parents to discuss sex education with their daughters,” said Dlama, who encourages mothers to teach girls about their bodies. “They can think it is stomach pain, give birth and then panic.” Aminu, the nurse, said most of his patients needing post-abortion care were teenagers who tried to abort after several months because they did not know they were pregnant or hid it. “They do not die if we admit them to hospital,” he said. “But there are so many more cases where women and girls take herbs on their own, do not come to the hospital and die because they do not want to expose themselves.” Pregnancy outside marriage is a taboo, even when it is the result of rape by soldiers, militias or camp officials. “They consider you to be a whore and your child to be a bastard. You have spoiled your family name,” Aminu said. Another factor is a decades-old U.S. government policy, known as the global “gag rule” and reinstated by President Donald Trump in 2017, barring clinics that receive federal funds from talking to patients about abortion. “We see young girls and women requesting abortion,” said one aid worker who worked to support health clinics across Borno state and spoke on condition of anonymity. “But we are constrained by concerns about legal risks, community reactions and by our U.S. funding which prohibits us from providing abortion information or services.” Turning desperate women away is dangerous, said Hauwa Shekarau of IPAS, an advocacy group promoting safe abortion. “If the hospital will not help, she will go elsewhere - even if it is unsafe. We bury our heads in the sand and women continue to die,” she said. Reporting by Chitra Nagarajan; Editing by Katy Migiro.

2019,UPDATE 1-Senators urge U.S. retirement fund to reverse China investment decision,"(Adds details, quotes from Rubio, FRTIB response) By Lawrence Delevingne and John McCrank Oct 22 (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. senators on Tuesday again asked a federal retirement fund to reverse a decision to track a popular index provided by MSCI Inc, saying a failure to act would lead to U.S. pension savings being funneled to companies controlled by the Chinese government. The request is the latest effort by Republican Senator Marco Rubio, and Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, to stem U.S. investment in specific Chinese companies and it included signatures from other lawmakers, including Senator Mitt Romney, indicating the issue is gaining traction. It also comes amid heightened U.S.-China trade tensions, as the U.S. government considers limiting the flow of U.S. capital to Chinese companies due to security concerns about their activities, Reuters has reported. “If implemented, the decision will effectively use these retirement savings to fund the Chinese government and Communist Party’s efforts to undermine U.S. economic and national security,” Rubio said a statement accompanying a letter to the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB.) The letter was also signed by Republican senators Romney, Josh Hawley, and Rick Scott, as well as Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. The letter was the second from Rubio and Shaheen outlining concerns about specific companies included in the MSCI All Country World ex-U.S. Investable Market Index, which the Thrift Savings Plan’s (TSP) International Stock Fund is set to begin tracking. These companies “assist in the Chinese government’s military activities, espionage, and human rights abuses, as well as many other Chinese companies that lack basic financial transparency,” the letter said. FRTIB spokeswoman Kim Weaver told Reuters both letters had been received and that “we are continuing to review the matter.” The latest letter ratchets up the pressure ahead of an Oct. 28 FRTIB meeting where the matter is expected to be discussed. The TSP is a retirement savings plan, similar to a 401(k) plan, for federal employees and members of the military. As of July 2019, TSP assets totaled around $599.5 billion. MSCI, which is one of the world’s largest index providers, with trillions of dollars tracking its benchmarks, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. It, along with other index providers, like FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones Indexes, has in recent years increased the weighting of Chinese-listed companies in some of its indexes as China’s economy has opened more, following consultations with large asset managers eager to invest in the country. New York-based MSCI had earlier responded to Rubio’s criticisms in a letter dated June 28 seen by Reuters. “Currently there is no U.S. law or regulation that prohibits an index company from creating an index containing China A securities or U.S. investors from trading in the China A market,” MSCI’s Chief Executive Officer, Henry Fernandez, said, referring to China-listed stocks. Fernandez said indexes are simply measures of markets’ performances and that investors can use that information as they like. MSCI does not manage any funds, he added. Rubio said MSCI failed to adequately address his concerns. Companies highlighted in the FRTIB letter included the Aviation Industry Corporation of China and China Unicom, which supply military aircraft and telecommunications support to militarized artificial islands in the South China Sea; Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology , which was recently added to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Entity List; and ZTE Corporation, which was fined last year for violating U.S. sanctions laws.

2019,Fallout from Trump's trade wars felt by economies around the world,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The collateral damage of the United States’ trade wars is being felt from the fjords of Iceland to the auto factories of Japan. Central bank governors and finance ministers traded grim tales of suffering economies at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank fall meetings in Washington this week. Some also noted how far U.S. policy had shifted from the 1940s, when Washington co-founded the IMF. At that time, “the world economy had been hammered for over a decade by high tariff barriers, depression and war,” prompting then-U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau to champion a global economic system, World Bank President David Malpass told attendees at a session this week. The U.S. message then, Malpass said, was: “First, there’s no limit to prosperity. Second, broadly shared prosperity benefits everyone.” As the IMF’s gathering of 189 member-nations drew to a close, the unintended negative impacts of the trade wars were becoming clear, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said. “Everybody loses.” The United States, the world’s largest importer, started a bitter tariff war with China, the world’s largest exporter, 15 months ago. U.S. President Donald Trump is also in the midst of renegotiating, and sometimes upending, trade relationships with many of Washington’s top trading partners. The fallout will slow global growth in 2019 to 3.0%, the slowest pace in a decade, the IMF estimated this week. This pain is not being shared equally. The United States remains the least exposed of the world’s 20 largest economies to a drop in exports in part because of its massive domestic consumer spending base. (For a graphic that shows the impact of tariffs in the United States and around the world, click here ) The damage is being particularly felt in European countries which “rely on exports and are open to trade,” the European Union’s Economic and Financial Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said. More than 40% of Germany’s GDP was derived from exports in 2018, the most of any major global economy. Uncertainty in the business community is widespread, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told reporters. German trade group BGA recently revised down its growth forecast for German exports in 2019 to just 0.5%, from 1.5%. As a result, many companies are scaling back their investment plans, something that will have repercussions for years to come. Scholz said concerns over Britain’s impending departure from the EU and the bloc’s trade dispute with the United States were clearly dampening global economic growth. “The most important problem remains those factors that we cannot measure – specifically the reluctance to invest,” Scholz said. The pain is being felt in countries that don’t rely on exports too, such as Iceland, which became the first developed economy to seek aid from the IMF after a 2008 banking collapse. Since then, it has rebuilt its economy in what’s been called a miraculous recovery. Now, that is threatened. “We have become dependent on tourism,” explained Ásgeir Jónsson, the governor of Iceland’s central bank, with annual visitors growing five-fold to 2.5 million since the crisis. Foreign arrivals, however, have plummeted since the trade wars started, and are down 15.6% this summer from the year before. Iceland, with a population of about 300,000, built foreign currency reserves on the back of the increase in visitors, he said, but those are dropping too. Trade links between countries have led to a more peaceful world in recent decades, but recent experience shows “you can never take global trade for granted,” Jónsson said. On Friday, Japan’s Cabinet Office, which helps coordinate government policy, downgraded its assessment of factory output in October. The softness in production was largely due to car exports to the United States turning weaker, after growing steadily until the spring, a government official said at a briefing. “The pick-up in global growth is being delayed,” Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said. “Japan’s economy is seeing exports weaken significantly and that’s affecting factory output.” The United States hasn’t been immune from the impact of the trade wars. American farmers have been particularly hurt by Chinese tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, prompting the Trump administration to give billions in aid to the farm belt. Washington’s imposition of steel and aluminum tariffs and uncertainty about passage of a new North American free trade deal - the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement - have also stalled local economic development. Christopher Cabaldon, the mayor of West Sacramento, California, said bids for a $100 million infrastructure project in the city came in 80% higher than expected in part because of construction firms’ need to factor in higher costs and the risk of additional tariffs in the future. “Even in small cities like my own, we see the impacts of trade. We have come to realize the deep integration of our local economies in the global system,” Cabaldon told Reuters ahead of the IMF and World Bank meetings. “Most of my economic development plans ... are playing out on a global stage, not down the freeway.” The trade tensions are helping to spur a push among African nations to create a more self-reliant continent. “We must take it upon ourselves to grow trade among ourselves,” said Ukur Yatani Kanacho, Kenya’s acting cabinet secretary for treasury. Abdoulaye Daouda Diallo, the finance minister of Senegal, told reporters the U.S.-China trade tensions would affect African nations in the energy sector and cut funds available on financial markets. The dispute underscored the importance of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, he said. Other emerging markets are also coming under pressure. “Ukrainian exporters faced worsened conditions in global commodity markets,” which drove down steel prices, said Kateryna Rozhkova, the deputy governor of the country’s central bank. Making matters worse, “the intensification of geopolitical conflicts led to rising oil and natural gas prices in the world,” she said. Bahrain’s Finance Minister Sheikh Salman bin Khalifa Al Khalifa said the Gulf region was also affected by trade tensions and the resulting slowdown in investment, although geopolitical concerns – about Iran, for example – were another major factor. “Trade tensions create uncertainty and nobody is insulated from uncertainty,” he told Reuters. Peru cut its 2019 economic growth estimate to 3% in August, from 4.2%, citing trade factors. Mexico is edging closer to a recession that its officials say might be more difficult to reverse than during the last downturn more than a decade ago. “The Great Recession basically caught everybody by surprise, but economies were willing to cooperate and work together to pull it out,” Mexican Finance Minister Arturo Herrera said. “This slowdown is taking nobody by surprise, but there is very little appetite for cooperation.” Additional reporting by Leika Kihara, Christian Kraemer, Jan Strupczewski, Rodrigo Campos and David Lawder; Editing by Paul Simao",Reuters
2019,"Saudi's SALIC, Russian fund team up on agri projects","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian sovereign wealth fund RDIF and Saudi Arabia’s SALIC have signed an agreement to team up in searching for investment projects in the Russian agricultural sector, RDIF said in a statement on Monday. President Vladimir Putin visited Riyadh on Monday for the first time in over a decade, seeking to capitalize on growing influence borne of military advances in Syria, strong ties with regional rivals and cooperation on energy policy. SALIC - Saudi Agricultural and Livestock Investment Co - and RDIF will jointly search for investment projects in the Russian agricultural and livestock industries, RDIF said. “I am confident we will begin working on our first joint projects in the near future,” Kirill Dmitriev, RDIF chief executive, said in the statement. SALIC, formed in 2011 to secure food supplies for the kingdom through mass production and foreign investments, has been looking at expanding in Russia and Ukraine, both major Black Sea grain producers and exporters, for several years. SALIC is considering investing in Russian agriculture projects near the Black Sea, the RIA news agency quoted SALIC Managing Director Khaled al-Aboodi as saying. “We believe that the Black Sea region of Russia is a very important region, and we want to invest there,” he said. In RDIF’s statement, al-Aboodi said that “RDIF is the natural partner of SALIC in entering the Russian market”. A year ago, SALIC agreed to buy Ukrainian farming company Mriya, which defaulted on its debts in 2014 and then went through a debt restructuring. In 2017, Russian conglomerate Sistema (AFKS.MM) said SALIC would consider investing in RZ Agro, a Russian grain producer owned by Sistema and members of the Louis-Dreyfus family, but the deal has not yet happened. “There is a lot of politics in their deals, while the improvement in our relationship is relatively new,” Dmitry Rylko, head of agriculture consultancy IKAR, said when asked why SALIC had not yet bought anything in Russia. The cooperation agreement between RDIF and SALIC comes less than two months after the kingdom agreed to relax specifications for wheat imports, opening the door to Black Sea imports. Russia, the world’s largest wheat exporter, had long been seeking access to the Saudi market. Russia also wants Saudi Arabia to open its market to Russian meat, Interfax news agency quoted Russian agriculture minister Dmitry Patrushev as saying on Monday. Russia and Saudi Arabia also signed a memorandum on expansion of mutual food exports on Monday, the Kremlin said.

2019,"UPDATE 1-Resurgent Quebec separatist party rattles Canada election, helps strip Trudeau of majority","(Adds details) By David Ljunggren OTTAWA, Oct 22 (Reuters) - A Quebec separatist party that softened its demands for independence reaped the reward on Monday, mounting a remarkable comeback in Canada’s election that helped deprive Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of a majority. The Bloc Quebecois, revitalized under new leader Yves-Francois Blanchet, jumped to 32 seats from 10 seats in the predominantly French-speaking province, according to provisional results. Quebec accounts for 78 seats in the House of Commons, second only to Ontario. “We have come far but we will go further,” Blanchet told jubilant supporters in the early hours of Tuesday. The ruling Liberals went into the election seeking to add 10 seats to the 40 they held in Quebec. But the Bloc’s resurgence meant they lost seven, helping Trudeau fall 14 seats short of a national majority. Blanchet’s party will not be a kingmaker in the new Parliament, however, since the Liberals look set to govern with the left-leaning New Democrats. Surveys show support for Quebec independence is far below the levels it hit in 1995, when a referendum on breaking away from Canada only just failed. Blanchet has muted talk of separatism, positioning the Bloc as a party that wants to stand up for Quebec’s interests and the French language in the federal Parliament in Ottawa rather than actively seeking to break up the country. “The strength Blanchet brings is he projects an image that is not quite as hardcore as the previous leaders. That allows him to draw on a much wider slice of the electorate,” said University of Montreal professor Pierre Martin. The 54-year-old former provincial minister and media personality said the Bloc wanted to make Parliament work and would back any proposed legislation that was good for Quebec. “I don’t believe Quebecers and Canadians elected a minority government with the goal of going back to the ballot boxes in 18 months,” he said. Blanchet - repeating comments he made over the weekend - said Quebec could one day “give itself all the attributes of sovereignty,” while making clear it would not happen during the lifetime of this federal Parliament. “Our job is not to make Canadian federalism work. Our job ... is also not to cause problems,” he said, adding the party would not be servile. At one point, the crowd chanted: “We want a country,” prompting Blanchet to say: “I do as well ... but this time, achieving sovereignty is not in our mandate.” Blanchet is particularly close to Quebec’s nationalist Coalition Avenir Quebec government, which brought in legislation earlier this year banning some public employees from wearing religious symbols. Trudeau said during a French-language campaign debate that he would be prepared to challenge the law, prompting Blanchet to accuse him of not respecting Quebec. Jon Pammett, a professor of political science at Carleton University, said Quebec voters were often less predictable than those in other parts of the country. “There tends to be a kind of movement toward a party which seems to be working to further Quebec’s interests ... people are volatile in terms of their party alignments,” he said.

2019,Uganda denies plans to impose death penalty for gay sex amid global concern,"NAIROBI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Uganda will not impose the death penalty for gay sex, a presidential spokesman said on Monday, after major aid donors said they were monitoring a plan by the African nation to reintroduce a bill colloquially known as “Kill the Gays”. Uganda’s Ethics and Integrity Minister Simon Lokodo last Thursday said the government planned to re-introduce an anti-homosexuality bill in parliament within weeks to curb the spread of homosexuality in the east African nation. Lokodo’s statement was widely reported across the world and international donors such as the European Union, World Bank, the United States and the Global Fund said they were monitoring the situation closely and stood by the rights of LGBT+ people. A spokesperson for President Yoweri Museveni on Monday said the government has no plans to introduce the legislation that would impose the death penalty for gay sex. “There are no plans by the government to introduce a law like that,” Don Wanyama, President Museveni’s senior press secretary told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “We have the penal code that already handles issues of unnatural sexual behavior so there is no law coming up.” Lokodo told the Thomson Reuters Foundation and local press last week that the bill was about to be tabled in the largely conservative Christian country where gay sex is currently punishable with life imprisonment under British colonial law. This prompted major aid donors on Friday to voice concerns, and a government spokesman took to Twitter on Saturday to deny any such plan. It was not possible to confirm any link between the donors’ concerns and the government spokesman’s statement on Saturday. When asked why Lokodo had made the statement, Wanyama said: “Ask him. I don’t know where he got this idea from. There is no plan by government to introduce a law of that nature.” Lokodo said the bill - that was nullified five years ago on a technicality - was being resurrected and would be voted on by the end of the year. “Our current penal law is limited. It only criminalises the act,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “We want it made clear that anyone who is even involved in promotion and recruitment has to be criminalised. Those that do grave acts will be given the death sentence.” Lokodo did not immediately respond to calls and messages from the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Monday. Earlier this year, Brunei in Southeast Asia sparked international outcry over plans to impose the death penalty for gay sex, backtracking only after intense criticism. African countries have some of the world’s most prohibitive laws governing homosexuality with same-sex relationships considered taboo and gay sex deemed a crime across most of the continent, with punishments ranging from imprisonment to death. Uganda is seen as one of the most difficult countries in Africa to be in a sexual minority with members of the LGBT community facing prejudice in getting jobs, renting housing or seeking medical care or education. LGBT+ rights groups report that three gay men and one transgender woman had been killed in homophobic attacks in Uganda this year - the latest on Oct. 4 when a gay man was bludgeoned to death. Rejected by their families and fearful for their lives, hundreds of LGBT+ Ugandans have fled over the last five years to seek refuge to countries such as neighboring Kenya. Human rights groups said Lokodo’s comments would inflame homophobic attitudes further. “This is an example of how Uganda’s politicians are stoking dangerous intolerance and bias against LGBTI people,” said Joan Nyanyuki, Amnesty International’s director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes, in a statement.

2019,Irish PM says flawed Northern Ireland assembly veto should be overhauled,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - A veto mechanism in Northern Ireland’s devolved parliament that was intended to prevent discrimination toward one community over another should be overhauled in talks to restore the local assembly, Ireland’s Prime Minister said on Wednesday. The British province’s power-sharing executive collapsed over 2-1/2 years ago and the assembly remains suspended, with Northern Ireland currently largely administered from London. On-off talks to restore self-rule which resumed in May after a hiatus of more than a year have made little progress. The potential role of the assembly in how Northern Ireland is treated after Brexit emerged as one of the sticking points in Wednesday’s last-ditch talks between the European Union and Britain to seal an amicable divorce from the bloc. Initial proposals by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier this month would have handed pro-British unionist politicians, led by Johnson’s allies in the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), a veto over any regulatory divergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. Contentious votes require the approval of a majority of both Irish nationalist and pro-British members of parliament if a mechanism in Northern Ireland’s 1998 peace deal known as the ‘petition of concern’ is triggered by one-third of lawmakers. The socially conservative DUP have used this to block the introduction of same-sex marriage and wider access to abortion in Northern Ireland, which Irish premier Leo Varadkar focused on when describing the mechanism as “flawed”. “Restoration of the Northern Ireland assembly and Northern Ireland executive shouldn’t be restoration of business as usual,” Varadkar told Ireland’s parliament. “Among changes I think need to be part of our consideration is changes to the petition of concern, which has been used in a way that I don’t think was ever anticipated when the Good Friday Agreement was signed, for example to block marriage equality, even though the vast majority of the Northern Ireland Assembly and people in Northern Ireland wanted that to be legal. “One of the real flaws in double majorities in a system of cross-community consent is not just that it allows one community or even one party within that community to have a veto, it totally discounts and reduces to nothing the votes of those who are designated as ‘others’,” Varadkar said.

2019,PGA Tour suspends Every 12 weeks for failed drug test,"Matt Every was suspended for 12 weeks on Friday by the PGA Tour for a violation of the Tour’s Conduct Policy for “drugs of abuse.” The Tour did not specify what substance Every tested positive for and said it will have no further comment on the suspension at this time. Every, who will be eligible to return to competition on Jan. 7, 2020, said in a statement to GolfChannel.com that he tested positive for cannabis. “I have been prescribed cannabis for a mental health condition by my physician whom has managed my medical care for 30 years,” he told GolfChannel.com. “It has been determined that I am neither an acceptable candidate to use prescription ‘Z’ class drugs nor benzodiazepines. “Additionally, these classes of drugs can be highly addictive and harmful to the human body and mind. For me, cannabis has proven to be, by far, the safest and most effective treatment.” The 35-year-old from Daytona Beach, Fla., who currently resides in Jacksonville, is a two-time winner on the PGA Tour, with the most recent victory coming in 2015 when he repeated as the Arnold Palmer Invitational champion. However, the former top-50 player has struggled with his game since, finishing the next three years ranked 558th, 707th and 583rd. Every has missed nine of 21 cuts in 2019, but did tie for second at the AT&T Byron Nelson in May — his best finish since that 2015 victory. After a string of three missed cuts and a withdrawal in four events beginning with The Northern Trust to kick off last season’s FedEx Cup Playoffs, Every tied for 18th at the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open and tied for 28th at the Houston Open earlier this month. Every is currently ranked 256th but is fully exempt for the 2019-20 PGA Tour season after qualifying for last season’s playoffs. He said he has “no choice but to accept this suspension and move on,” and will be eligible to return the week of the Sony Open. “I don’t agree with it for many reasons, mainly for my overall well-being, but I’m excited for what lies ahead in my life and career,” he told the GolfChannel.com. “Over the last few years I have made massive strides and I know my best is still in front of me. I can’t wait to come back better than ever in January.” —Field Level Media",Reuters
2019,"DP World reports lower quarterly global cargo volumes, Dubai down again","DUBAI (Reuters) - Port operator DP World (DPW.DI) reported on Tuesday a third quarter decline in cargo handled across its global portfolio as volumes fell in Dubai for a sixth consecutive quarter. The operator said it handled 18 million twenty foot equivalent unit (TEU) containers in its ports in the three months to Sept. 30, down 1.6% on the same period a year ago. It said a global trade row created a challenging environment. The United States and China have been locked in a trade row that has cast a shadow over global economic prospects. At its flagship Jebel Ali port in Dubai, the Middle East’s largest trans-shipment hub, and the smaller Mina Rashid port volumes fell 1% to 3.6 million TEUs. DP World Chairman Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem said volumes at Jebel Ali had been stabilizing, adding: “We remain focused on profitable origin and destination cargo.” Tensions in the Middle East have escalated in the wake of attacks on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia and tankers in Gulf waters, a key shipping artery for the global oil trade. Global volumes were flat in the first nine months of the year, while those handled at Jebel Ali were down 5.5%.

The Cardinals (2-3-1) blew a 17-point third-quarter lead before Murray guided them to their second straight game-winning, fourth-quarter drive. Murray ran for 5 yards on third-and-5 with 1:38 remaining after the Falcons (1-5) used all their timeouts, enabling the Cardinals to run out the clock.

2019,Boeing 777X delays may affect Emirates fleet plans - Clark,"LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Delivery delays to Boeing’s 777X jetliner are holding back Emirates’ growth and could affect the Gulf carrier’s fleet plans, airline President Tim Clark said on Thursday. Dubai-based Emirates has 150 of the new model on order, of which eight were originally slated for delivery next year, and has yet to firm up orders for 40 of Boeing’s mid-size 787 jets. In an interview, Clark said launch customer Emirates no longer expects to receive the first 777X before “April or the second quarter” of 2021. “That has conditioned everything else,” he told Reuters on the sidelines of the Airlines 2050 conference in London. “First of all I want to know when the thing’s going to come,” he added. “Our fleet plans are very much driven by when these aircraft are going to be delivered to us.” (Reporting by Laurence Frost, Additional reporting by Tracy Rucinski, Editing by Tim Hepher)",Reuters

2019,"Regulator expects to hire adviser for Fannie, Freddie capital overhaul by November","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The nation’s top housing regulator said on Wednesday that he hopes to hire an outside financial adviser by next month to help the government devise a plan to remove mortgage giants Fannie and Freddie from government conservatorship. Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mark Calabria said he expects the adviser to help the regulator assess plans to overhaul Fannie and Freddie’s capital structure and raise billions of dollars in new cash. He added that he also expects Fannie and Freddie to hire their own advisers ahead of potentially massive initial public offerings or other capital raisings that could prove to be a big payday for Wall Street firms that win the mandate. “Fannie and Freddie will be the ones raising capital, but how do we allow them to set that path and how do we make sure that what they come up with as suggestions to raise capital are doable?” said Calabria at an event in Washington. “My expectation is that Fannie and Freddie are going to be able to get their own financial advisers, and we can start to work.” The FHFA earlier this month posted a solicitation for an outsider adviser, and applications were due Wednesday. Calabria said the adviser will help the regulator assess capital plans put forward by Fannie and Freddie. The pair, which guarantee more than half of the nation’s mortgages, have operated under a government conservatorship since being bailed out by taxpayers in 2008. The Trump administration has renewed efforts to release the pair from government control, issuing a report in September calling for them to be recapitalized and released. Calabria on Wednesday emphasized that the pair will not be allowed to escape government control without raising a significant amount of capital. To that end, Calabria said he expects to announce in the coming weeks whether the FHFA will re-propose a rule outlining capital requirements for the pair. Analysts expect that regulation must be finalized before the pair could realistically exit. “If Fannie and Freddie aren’t able to leave, then they don’t leave. Quite simply they have to be ready to get out,” said Calabria. Reporting by Pete Schroeder; Editing by Michelle Price and Steve Orlofsky",Reuters
2019,Amazon fish wears nature's 'bullet-proof vest' to thwart piranhas,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One of the world’s largest freshwater fish is protected by the natural equivalent of a “bullet-proof vest,” helping it thrive in the dangerous waters of the Amazon River basin with flexible armor-like scales able to withstand ferocious piranha attacks. Researchers from the University of California, San Diego and University of California, Berkeley on Wednesday described the unique structure and impressive properties of the dermal armor of the fish, called Arapaima gigas. They said their findings can help guide development of better body armor for people as well as applications in aerospace design. The fish, also known as pirarucu, gets up to 10 feet (3 meters) long and weighs up to 440 pounds (200 kg). Arapaima, a fish that can breathe air and survive up to a day outside of the water, inhabits rivers in Brazil, Guyana and Peru infested with piranhas, known for razor-sharp teeth, incredible bite strength and deadly feeding frenzies. There long has been an evolutionary arms race in which predators develop ways to kill - like sharp teeth - and other animals develop ways to stay alive like the dermal armor seen in various fish, dinosaurs and mammals over time. Arapaima’s scales, the researchers said, possess all the best attributes of a bullet-proof vest, but the elements are better integrated into one solid piece combining imperviousness and flexibility. “Such lightweight and tough materials like fish scales are the sexy topics that materials scientists are pursuing,” said Wen Yang, a UCSD materials scientist who helped lead the study published in the journal Matter. “It is true that the natural armor is similar to artificial body armor because of the similar scale overlapping system. However, the natural armor such as these fish scales is tough and much lighter, without impeding body flexibility and locomotion,” Yang added. “Remember that the fish scales were developed through hundreds of millions of years. They are very advanced.” The researchers conducted laboratory tests of the scales. The scales, they found, have a hard mineralized outer layer to resist penetration that is bound to a tough-but-flexible inner layer by collagen – the main structural protein in skin and other connective tissues in the body. This structure means the scales can become deformed when bitten by a piranha but are not torn, broken or pierced, protecting the fish from injury. “We were able to see how the collagen fibers deform without a catastrophic failure including the mechanisms of twisting, folding, sliding, stretching, delamination,” Yang said. The study was backed by the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research. Reporting by Will Dunham; Editing by Sandra Maler",Reuters

2019,Travelers profit misses on higher reserves for claims,"(Reuters) - Insurer Travelers Cos Inc (TRV.N) reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday as it bolstered its reserves to cover asbestos-related and other claims, sending its shares down nearly 4% in trading before the bell. The insurer said it set aside an additional $220 million for asbestos claims reserves in its business insurance unit, compared with a year earlier. It also set aside higher claims reserves in its commercial auto business. Travelers Chief Executive Officer Alan Schnitzer flagged an “increasingly challenging tort environment” and “higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses” for weak results. Earned premiums rose 4.3% to $7.18 billion, while combined ratio improved to 101.5% from 96.6%. A ratio below 100% means the insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims. Catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, fell $23 mln to $241 million from a year earlier, after wildfires and hurricanes hit its earnings last year. Net investment income fell about 4% to $622 million. Insurers typically invest money they get from premiums into stocks and bonds to earn profits. The company posted an underwriting loss of $149 million, compared with a gain of $198 million a year earlier. (reut.rs/2N0ugti) New York-based Travelers, a Dow component that is also seen as an industry bellwether, is among the biggest sellers of insurance to U.S. businesses and sells auto and property insurance to individual customers. Net income fell to $396 million, or $1.50 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from $709 million, or $2.62 per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.43 per share, while analysts were expecting $2.35 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

2019,Lebanon scraps WhatsApp fee amid violent protests,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Demonstrators and police clashed in Lebanon on Thursday as thousands of people rallied against the government’s handling of an economic crisis, in one of the biggest protests the country has seen in years. The government backed down from plans, announced hours earlier, to tax voice calls made through the Facebook-owned WhatsApp messaging software as people vented their anger at the political elite in the second nationwide protests in less than a month. Protesters blocked roads across Lebanon with burning tires and security forces fired tear gas at demonstrators in central Beirut early on Friday, Lebanese media said. Dozens of people were wounded, the Red Cross said. Lebanon’s internal security forces said 60 police were wounded. “I was sitting at home and I saw the people on the move and so I came out,” said Cezar Shaaya, an accountant protesting in Beirut. “I am married, I have mortgage payments due every month and I am not working. It’s the state’s fault.” Throughout Thursday night, crowds gathered in the capital Beirut’s Riad al-Solh square, some waving Lebanese flags and singing. “The people want to topple the regime,” they chanted. Nearby, dozens of young men on motorcycles circled a main crossroad and set tires on fire, some of them ripping out billboards to toss them into the rising flames. The protests have been fueled by stagnant economic conditions exacerbated by a financial crisis in one of the world’s most heavily indebted states. The government, which has declared a state of “economic emergency”, is seeking ways to narrow its gaping deficit. A protester burning tires in the southern village of Tel Nhas said: “We are asking for jobs, for our rights, electricity, water, we are demanding education”. Lebanon faces high debt, stagnant growth, crumbling infrastructure and reduced capital inflows. The Lebanese pound, pegged against the dollar for two decades, has been under pressure. Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri’s government of national unity is seeking to approve a 2020 budget, a step that may help it unlock billions pledged by international donors. But donors want to see Beirut implement long-delayed reforms to curb waste and corruption. “We are not here over the WhatsApp, we are here over everything: over fuel, food, bread, over everything,” said a protester in Beirut who gave his name as Abdullah. The education ministry said schools would close on Friday after the protests. Public administration employees declared a strike so that workers could join protests expected for Friday. The government unveiled a new revenue-raising measure earlier on Thursday, agreeing a charge of 20 cents a day for calls via voice-over-internet protocol (VoIP), used by applications including WhatsApp, Facebook (FB.O) calls and FaceTime. Information Minister Jamal al-Jarrah said ministers also would discuss a proposal to raise value-added tax by 2 percentage points in 2021 and a further 2 percentage points in 2022, until it reached 15%. But as protests spread across Lebanon, Telecoms Minister Mohamed Choucair told journalists the proposed levy on WhatsApp calls had been revoked. Hariri had said the measure was expected to net about $200 million in revenue for the state each year.

2019,Bank of Korea seen cutting rates this week: Reuters poll,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea’s central bank will likely cut its policy interest rate this week to support slowing economic growth and weak price pressures, a Reuters poll showed. All but one of 31 analysts surveyed by Reuters expect the Bank of Korea (BOK) to cut its seven-day repurchase rate KROCRT=ECI by 25 basis points to 1.25% at its monetary policy board meeting on Wednesday, matching a record-low rate seen until late 2017 and the second cut in three months. A slim majority of 17 respondents see a third cut coming by the third quarter of 2020, while seven others forecast the bank standing pat throughout next year. While signs of progress in U.S.-China trade negotiations have provided some cause for optimism in South Korea, analysts say it won’t be enough to reduce the need for more immediate policy support. “Though the rate cut will only have limited effect, the BOK should cut the rate now in order to add even a slight support to the economy,” said Cho Yong-gu, economist at Shinyoung Securities, who sees a rate cut on Wednesday and another to come in the third quarter next year. U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday outlined the first phase of a deal to end a trade war with China and suspended a threatened tariff hike, but officials on both sides said much more work needed to be done before an accord could be agreed. Freya Beamish, chief Asia economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, believes the worst of the South Korea’s economic slowdown may already be over, which could give the central bank some room to pause. “We believe that the bank will want to wait for the third quarter GDP report due out next week,” said Beamish. “The bar for additional easing is high, at least judging by Governor Lee’s comments, which suggest that the growth slowdown would have taken another leg down for the BOK to consider cutting again.” The BOK began its easing cycle in July when it cut the key interest rate for the first time in three years, but it held the rate on hold at its last meeting on Aug. 30. Global investment banks have downgraded their forecasts for South Korea’s 2019 economic growth, with some expecting growth to slow below 2% from 2.7% set last year. Inflation is also seen missing the central bank’s 2% target by a significant margin. Last month, BOK Governor Lee Ju-yeol said economic growth this year would likely miss the bank’s 2.2% forecast but stopped short of formally revising down growth projections or affirming market expectations for further rate cuts this year. The BOK is scheduled to release third quarter gross domestic product estimates on Oct. 24. The economy grew 1.9% during the first half of this year over a year earlier.

2019,Poland's biggest bank PKO will consider bid for Commerzbank's mBank: CEO,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland’s biggest bank, state-run PKO BP (PKO.WA), will consider a bid for Commerzbank’s (CBKG.DE) Polish unit mBank (MBK.WA) if it is officially put up for sale, its Chief Executive Zbigniew Jagiello said on Monday. Commerzbank is sounding out potential buyers for its stake in mBank ahead of a formal sale process which is expected to launch in the coming months. “If mBank is formally presented as an asset for sale, then it is PKO BP’s responsibility to analyse these assets,” Jagiello said. “Naturally, we will look at it, although looking does not automatically mean a desire to buy.” Reporting by Anna Koper; Writing by Agnieszka Barteczko; Editing by Jan Harvey",Reuters
2019,"Norway at top, Yemen at bottom of rankings for women's quality of life","NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Norway and Switzerland are the best countries to be a woman and Yemen and Afghanistan the worst, said research on Tuesday which found the state of women’s rights is not “all doom and gloom” around the world. While life for women has improved in some 60 countries, it has deteriorated in Yemen and other war-torn nations, research organizations Georgetown University’s Institute for Women, Peace and Security and Peace Research Institute Oslo concluded. The researchers looked at 167 countries since 2017 when the first Women, Peace and Security Index was compiled, weighing variables such as access to bank accounts, jobs and security. Rounding out the top of the list were Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Austria, United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Sweden and Netherlands tied for ninth place, followed by Canada. At the bottom were Yemen, Afghanistan, Syria, Pakistan, South Sudan, Iraq, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic, Mali and Libya. “There are important areas of progress. It’s not all doom and gloom,” said Jeni Klugman, managing director of the Georgetown Institute and lead author of the index. Gains were strongest in women’s access to financial accounts, either mobile or at conventional banks, in fewer discriminatory laws and through increasing legislative representation. “A national election can bring about big changes, both positive and negative,” Klugman told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “We have a number of countries which boosted the share of women in their national legislatures. We also had several countries which went the other way,” she added. Iceland lost its top spot from 2017 after elections brought a drop in the number of women in parliament. The United States inched up to No. 19 from No. 22 two years ago, in part due to 2018 elections when a record number of women were elected to Congress. But Klugman said the United States continues to lag in the area of domestic violence. The research is intended to inform and inspire action, Klugman said, noting that the factors it weighed are integral to the global development goals adopted unanimously by the United Nations in 2015. “It’s not like it’s something we invented out of thin air. It’s something which is grounded in those long, hard-negotiated agreements, so we’re holding them to account for that.” The U.N. adopted 17 goals, including gender equality and an end to hunger, poverty and other ills, to be achieved by 2030. The new research found deterioration in women’s lives was often linked to security, which worsened in almost 50 countries. As to legal reforms, Moldova moved up 22 places owing to changes in its sexual assault laws. Saudi Arabia persisted in having the most extensive legal discrimination against women, followed by Yemen, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates and Syria. The report said legal discrimination means about 2.7 billion women globally are restricted from working in the same jobs as men.

2019,"Holiday Inn-owner IHG hit by weak China, Hong Kong bookings","(Reuters) - Holiday Inn-owner InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG.L) blamed lower business bookings in China and Hong Kong protests for a 0.8% fall in third-quarter revenue per room on Friday, the latest company to be pinched by weaker global travel. The hotel industry in general is feeling the impact of slowing global growth, which is denting business travel. Rival Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (HLT.N) warned that lagging growth in China and the China-U.S. trade war would hurt revenue. Raffles owner AccorHotels (ACCP.PA) narrowed its full-year profit guidance, citing uncertainty on China-related issues. Four months of protests in Hong Kong have taken a toll on tourism, while weak economic data from China has been discouraging. IHG reported a 6.1% fall in revenue per available room (RevPAR) in Greater China during the quarter, with a 36% drop in Hong Kong. (reut.rs/35Lf0Jl) “While we are certainly not at the stage where business travel has been scaled back on a large scale, the cracks are certainly showing,” AJ Bell’s Investment Director Russ Mould said. Shares in IHG, which has nearly 5,800 hotels including the Crowne Plaza and Regent Hotels & Resorts brands, fell nearly 2% in early trade on Friday. The company has been putting more money into China, its fastest-growing market, using new loyalty programs, digital payment options and revamping rooms at Holiday Inn to woo local business travelers. Of the 13,000 rooms IHG opened across its brands in the quarter, 4,100 were in China. But Chief Financial Officer Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson said the company was seeing more leisure than business travelers, who tend to spend less money on bookings. Edgecliffe-Johnson said the company had also seen some pressure in the United States as U.S. manufacturing businesses cut spending on conference halls bookings during the third quarter.

2019,Hollywood visual effects firm DNEG plans London IPO as Brexit looms,"(Reuters) - Oscar-winning special effects firm DNEG aims to start taking investor orders in early November for its London listing, a source familiar with the transaction said, as the Oct. 31 deadline for Britain’s departure from the European Union loomed. The company, which produces digital visual effects and has worked on the Harry Potter films and the Avenger series, said on Tuesday it would publish a registration document with Britain’s regulators for an initial public offering (IPO) in London. Pending approval, it would likely publish an “intention to float” document next week, the source said. DNEG boss Namit Malhotra and senior management would embark on a roadshow until late October and, barring any issues related to Brexit, they would open the book for orders from investors in early November, the source said. “I think by then, management will have an idea of where we stand with Brexit and what the investor feedback is like,” said the source. “The deal is not going to be launched in the week of Brexit if the situation is still uncertain.” Britain is due to leave the European Union on Oct. 31 with or without a deal, unless it has secured an extension to the deadline. Sterling strengthened on Tuesday on a report that British and the EU were close to a draft deal. DNEG’s management have already met investors in early stage meetings, known as “pilot fishing”, receiving enough interest to encourage it to proceed with the IPO process. JP Morgan Cazenove is global coordinator and joint bookrunner. The other bookrunners are Deutsche Bank, Numis, Santander and BNP Paribas. DNEG has said it planned to raise 150 million pounds ($191 million) in primary proceeds. The source said it was likely to seek a $1 billion valuation, with a deal size potentially as high as $300 million. DNEG has worked on shows such as Black Panther, Deadpool and the Avengers series, and has offices in India and the United States, although the listed company would be based in Britain. Its clients include 20th Century Fox, Disney and MGM. The source said the management viewed its relationships with video streaming services such as Amazon and Netflix as major areas for potential growth. For the fiscal year ended 31 March 2019, DNEG said it generated total income of $309.0 million, profit of $20.7 million and adjusted earnings before interest, tax, deductions and amortisation (EBITDA) of $69.6 million, resulting in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.5%. The company said it intended to use net proceeds from an issue of new shares to finance growth plans and reduce net debt. Reporting by Abhinav Ramnarayan; Editing by Edmund Blair",Reuters

The cabinet had agreed to impose a fee on calls over WhatsApp and other similar applications, as part of efforts to raise revenues in the country’s 2020 draft budget.

2019,Plane carrying UK's William and Kate twice aborts Pakistan landing in severe turbulence,"LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - Britain’s Prince William said he and his wife Kate were fine after a Royal Air Force plane carrying the royal couple was forced to abort a landing in Islamabad twice on Thursday and return to Lahore after being caught in a severe thunderstorm. The RAF Voyager plane carrying the royals, who are on a four-day official visit to Pakistan, tried to land twice, at Rawalpindi air base and Islamabad international, before it decided to return to Lahore. William, who has previously worked as a search and rescue helicopter pilot, told reporters after they landed that he and Kate were fine, joking that the problems had been caused because he was flying the plane. A Reuters photographer, who was on board, said there had been no issues before the plane took off but the flight, which was due to take just 26 minutes, became very turbulent as they attempted to land. The journey eventually took more than two hours and the photographer described it as the most turbulent flights he had ever been on in 25 years of regular flying.

2019,Explainer: What happens next after UK PM Johnson loses Brexit vote?,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s parliament voted to withhold its approval of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal on Saturday, triggering another law that requires him to request a delay to the country’s departure from the European Union. Johnson has been defiant that he will not negotiate a Brexit delay beyond the scheduled Oct. 31 departure date, saying the law does not “compel me to do so”, deepening uncertainty over how and even whether Britain will leave the EU. Following is a rough guide to what could happen next: The law, the so-called Benn Act after one of its authors, requires the prime minister to “seek to obtain” an extension until Jan. 31, 2020, if parliament has not passed a withdrawal deal or approved Britain’s departure without an agreement by Oct. 19. It sets a deadline of 2300 GMT on Saturday for the prime minister to write a letter and dictates the terms of what he should write. “Dear Mr President, The UK Parliament has passed the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019. Its provisions now require Her Majesty’s Government to seek an extension of the period provided under Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, including as applied by Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty, currently due to expire at 11.00pm GMT on 31 October 2019, until 11.00pm GMT on 31 January 2020. I am writing therefore to inform the European Council that the United Kingdom is seeking a further extension to the period provided under Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, including as applied by Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty. The United Kingdom proposes that this period should end at 11.00pm GMT on 31 January 2020. If the parties are able to ratify before this date, the Government proposes that the period should be terminated early. Yours sincerely, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland” After his government lost a vote on a proposal that withheld approval for his agreement until formal ratification legislation has passed, Johnson is required to send the letter. But he told parliament: “I will not negotiate a delay with the EU and neither does the law compel me to do so.” “I will tell our friends and colleagues in the EU exactly what I have told everyone else in the last 88 days that I have served as prime minister: that further delay would be bad for this country, bad for the European Union and bad for democracy.” His defiance has stirred suspicions in parliament that he may send a second letter asking the EU to ignore the first, or that he may simply not comply with the law, which means the case could head to the courts. Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the lower house of parliament, or House of Commons, said on Saturday the government planned to put Johnson’s exit deal to a debate and vote on Monday. But the speaker of the House, John Bercow, said he would rule whether that would be allowed after several lawmakers said it would break with parliamentary convention that the same question cannot be put twice during the same session. Scotland’s highest court, the Court of Session, is also due to consider on Monday a legal challenge that sought to force Johnson to comply with the Benn Act. Anti-Brexit campaigners had asked the court earlier this month for it either to issue an order forcing Johnson to ask for a delay if he failed to secure approval for a deal by Oct. 19, or for it to instruct that a letter be sent to the EU on his behalf if he refused. The campaigners also said he should face penalties including a fine or even prison if he did not comply with the Benn Act. The court, has not yet ruled on the matter and was waiting to do so pending developments up to Oct. 19. But it said this month that government lawyers had given formal legal statements - averments - that he would abide by the Benn Act and it would be a serious matter if he did not. “It would be destructive of one of the core principles of constitutional propriety and of the mutual trust that is the bedrock of the relationship between the court and the crown for the prime minister or the government to renege on what they have assured the court that the prime minister intends to do,” judge Paul Cullen, known as Lord Pentland, said. Johnson also told parliament that “next week the government will introduce the legislation needed for us to leave the EU with our new deal on October 31”. That would suggest that the government will try to force through the legislation required in order to leave the EU on Oct. 31, which would also give lawmakers the opportunity to bring changes to that legislation. Such changes could include adding a need for a confirmatory referendum on the agreement, as sought by the Labour Party and throwing open the possibility of Brexit not even happening — although it is not clear whether there would be sufficient numbers among lawmakers to back such a plan. Both the governing Conservatives and main opposition Labour Party say they want a new election, but Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he will not back any move to hold one until a no-deal Brexit is ruled out.

2019,Lidl to spend $19 billion over five years with British suppliers,"LONDON (Reuters) - German-owned discount supermarket Lidl GB has vowed to spend 15 billion pounds ($19 billion) with British suppliers over the next five years, committing to increase sales of local meat, poultry and fresh produce. Lidl and rival Aldi have changed the shape of the UK grocery sector, stealing market share from industry leader Tesco (TSCO.L), Sainsbury’s (SBRY.L), Asda (WMT.N) and Morrisons (MRW.L) by offering cut-throat prices in no-frills stores. To deepen its relations with British suppliers, Lidl, part of the Schwarz retail group, said it would introduce longer-term contracts with suppliers to help them invest and expand. “Our business is only ever as good as our suppliers’, so our investments and commitments are key to ensuring that they can invest and expand with us,” said Ryan McDonnell, Chief Commercial Officer at Lidl GB. Lidl GB currently trades from 770 stores and has a market share of 6%. It is planning to open 50-60 new stores across 2019. Its sales rose 8.2% in the 12 weeks to Oct. 6, according to industry data published on Tuesday. Reporting by Kate Holton, editing by James Davey",Reuters

Earlier, Johnson said he would end an attempt to win parliamentary approval for the legislation that would enable Britain to leave the European Union and instead press for an election if lawmakers rejected the timetable. After the vote, Johnson said he would pause the process to determine the EU’s position on a Brexit delay after he was forced to ask for one by the parliament on Saturday.

2019,Season of discontent: protests flare around the world,"(Reuters) - Another day, another protest. On Monday it was Bolivia - angry people clashed with police after the political opposition said it had been cheated in an election won by incumbent President Evo Morales. Last week, the streets of the Chilean capital Santiago descended into chaos, as demonstrators enraged by a hike in public transport fares looted stores, set a bus alight and prompted the president to declare a state of emergency. Earlier this month, Ecuador’s leader did the same after violent unrest triggered by the decision to end fuel subsidies that had been in place for decades. And that was just South America. Hong Kong has been in turmoil for months, Lebanon’s capital Beirut was at a standstill, parts of Barcelona resembled a battlefield last week and tens of thousands of Britons marched through London at the weekend over Brexit. Protests have flared around the world in the last few months. Each has had its own trigger, but many of the underlying frustrations are similar. Globalization and technological progress have, in general, exacerbated disparities within countries, said Sergei Guriev, former chief economist of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, while noting that not all of the current protests were driven by economic concerns. Digital media has also made people more acutely aware of global inequalities, said Simon French, chief economist at UK bank Panmure Gordon. “We know that the economics of happiness is largely driven by a relative assessment of your position versus your benchmark,” he said, a benchmark that now stretched way beyond the local community. In at least four countries hit by recent violent protests, the main reason for the uprising is economic. Governments in Chile and Ecuador have incurred their people’s wrath after trying to raise fares and end fuel subsidies. As clashes engulfed Quito, Ecuadorean President Lenin Moreno reached out to indigenous leaders who had mobilized people to take to the streets. Within minutes, chief protest organizer Jaime Vargas had rejected that outreach. “We’re defending the people,” Vargas said in a live Facebook video from the march in Quito. His response, visible to millions of people, underlines an added challenge authorities have when trying to quell dissent: social media has made communication between protesters easier than ever. Tens of thousands of people have flooded Beirut in the biggest show of dissent against the establishment there in decades. People of all ages and religions joined to protest about worsening economic conditions and the perception that those in power were corrupt. Similar factors were behind deadly civil unrest in Iraq in early October. More than 100 people died in violent protests across a country where many Iraqis, especially young people, felt they had seen few economic benefits since Islamic State militants were defeated in 2017. Security forces cracked down, with snipers opening fire from rooftops and the internet being shut to stem the flow of information among protesters. Hong Kong has been battered by five months of often violent protests over fears Beijing is tightening its grip on the territory, the worst political crisis since colonial ruler Britain handed it back to China in 1997. There have been few major rallies in recent weeks, but violence has escalated at those held, with militant activists setting metro stations ablaze and smashing up shops, often targeting Chinese banks and stores with mainland links. Police have fired thousands of rounds of tear gas, hundreds of rubber bullets and three live rounds at brick- and petrol bomb-throwing activists. The events in Hong Kong have drawn comparisons to Catalonia in recent days. There, too, people are angry at what they see as attempts to thwart their desire for greater autonomy from the rest of Spain, if not outright independence. Protesters set cars on fire and threw petrol bombs at police in Barcelona, unrest sparked by the sentencing of Catalan separatist leaders who sought to declare an independent state. Demonstrators also focused on strategic targets to cause maximum disruption, including the international airport, grounding more than 100 flights. That came several days after similar action in Hong Kong, suggesting that protest movements are following and even copying each other on social media and the news. “In Hong Kong they have done it well, but they are crazier,” said Giuseppe Vayreda, a 22-year-old art student at a recent Catalan separatist protest. On Thursday, Hong Kong protesters plan a rally to show solidarity with those demonstrating in Spain. In some cases, individuals rise to the forefront of protest movements, using social media to get their message across. In Egypt, where demonstrations last month were relatively small yet significant in their rarity, the catalyst of dissent against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was an Egyptian posting videos from Spain. Greta Thunberg, a Swedish teenager, inspired millions of people to march through cities around the world in September to demand that political leaders act to stop climate change. Tens of thousands gathered in a New York park to listen to her speech. “If you belong to that small group of people who feel threatened by us, then we have some very bad news for you,” she said. “Because this is only the beginning. Change is coming whether they like it or not.” Reporting by Reuters correspondents; Additional reporting by Andrea Shalal and Heather Timmons in Washington; Writing by Mike Collett-White; Editing by Nick Tattersall and Sonya Hepinstall",Reuters

2019,Consumer banking powers Citigroup's profit beat,"(Reuters) - Citigroup Inc (C.N) reported higher-than-expected earnings on Tuesday off the back of its global consumer business, showing consumer spending and sentiment remain high. Citi, the most global of the U.S. banks, said profit in its consumer unit rose 13% excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, outpacing its institutional client business where revenue inched up 1%. The consumer business was helped by more U.S. credit card customers beginning to pay interest as promotional periods wore off. North America branded card revenue jumped 11% in the third quarter, and profit in the U.S. consumer business jumped 9%. Expenses in the consumer business fell 2%, partially offset by rising credit costs which have increased every quarter this year. Citi has been leaning on its U.S. credit card business, which accounts for more than 60% of its global consumer banking revenue, to help it grow deposits by pitching checking and savings accounts to card holders. Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said that strategy has helped them earn more than $4 billion in digital deposits this year, most of which came from areas where the bank does not have a physical presence. The U.S. consumer proved to be more resilient than the corporate sector where clients continued to show more caution reflecting macroeconomic uncertainty. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) also reported strong results in its consumer business. Trading revenue fell 1% as a decline in equities offset stable revenue in fixed-income trading. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) both reported a rise in revenue from bond trading. Citi also reached a key profitability target. The third-largest U.S. bank by assets hit a return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) of 12.2%, above the goal of 12% it has promised investors for the year. ROTCE is a widely watched measure of how well a bank uses shareholder money to generate profits. Citi has been focused on building credibility with investors after missing targets in recent years. Estimates often hovered below the bank’s stated goals, indicating Wall Street analysts were skeptical management could reach the targets it had set. The performance on ROTCE may be hard to replicate in the fourth quarter without the one-time tax benefit which boosted earnings by 10 cents a share. Net income applicable to the bank rose 6% to $4.9 billion, or $2.07 per share, in the third quarter from $4.6 billion, or $1.73 per share, a year earlier. Excluding a tax benefit, the bank earned $1.97 per share. Revenue was up about 1% at $18.57 billion. Analysts were expecting a profit of $1.95 per share and revenue of $18.5 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

The lira closed the week at 5.8850 on Friday, as Turkey pressed on with a cross-border operation against Kurdish militants in northeastern Syria, after Trump decided to withdraw some U.S. troops from the region and opened the way for Ankara’s incursion.

The Nationals began the night with a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series. Robles, who was batting eighth, singled to lead off the third inning and scored the game’s first run on a two-out single by Adam Eaton. The 22-year-old Robles, who batted .255 with 17 homers, 65 RBIs and 28 steals in 155 games this season, has missed five straight postseason games since suffering the injury in Game 2 of the NL Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. —Field Level Media",Reuters

2019,Stephen Jones: Cowboys coach Garrett safe,"The Cowboys’ third straight loss, to the previously winless New York Jets on Sunday, hasn’t changed the thoughts of Dallas executive vice president Stephen Jones about the future of head coach Jason Garrett. “Absolutely not,” Stephen Jones said on his radio show Monday on 105.3 The Fan. “We’re ready to go. I think this team just needs to get a win under its belt, and I still think we can have a great year and feel good about it and feel great about Jason and his staff and feel like we’ll go to work here this week and move forward.” Jones was echoing the sentiment of his father, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who said Garrett is in no danger of losing his job. The elder Jones said his vision of the future was shorter term, when the Cowboys host the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. The teams are 3-3 and tied for first atop the NFC East. “I haven’t even come close to those future-type considerations,” Jerry Jones said Sunday after Dallas’ 24-22 loss to the Jets. “I’m looking at future as next week against those Eagles. I’m looking next week against our division.” Stephen Jones said Monday he isn’t faulting his players’ effort. “I think you turn on the tape, and our guys are playing hard. I just think go back to the word execute,” Stephen Jones said. “We just have to execute better. We’ve got to get off to a faster start. “I know everybody is going to want to read into that and try to figure what you say when you say that, but I don’t think it’s really that complicated. We just have to get out there and execute and hopefully get a little more healthy as we move forward and play better.” —Field Level Media",Reuters
2019,Rams dominate Falcons 37-10; QB Ryan hurt,"EditorsNote: Edits throughout Todd Gurley caught a touchdown pass in his return and the Los Angeles Rams’ defense dominated on the road in a 37-10 victory Sunday against the Atlanta Falcons. The Rams ended their three-game losing streak, while the Falcons lost their fifth in a row and saw quarterback Matt Ryan leave in the fourth quarter with an ankle injury. Rams quarterback Jared Goff passed for 268 yards one week after he was held to 78 yards in the air as the Rams (4-3) won in their return to Atlanta, where they lost Super Bowl LIII to the New England Patriots to end last season. Gurley caught a 13-yard TD pass from Goff in the second quarter after missing a game because of a quadriceps injury. He rushed for 41 yards on 18 carries. Goff scored his own TD on a 1-yard run in the third quarter. Ryan was 16 of 27 for 159 yards in the loss. He was knocked out of the game with a right ankle injury after he was sacked by Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald and fumbled. He hobbled into the locker room and was declared of the game. This was the first time on the season that Ryan, who started his 153rd consecutive game, did not pass for at least 300 yards. The Falcons (1-6) have not won since defeating the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. The Falcons’ frustrations appeared to boil over after Ryan threw an interception in the third quarter. Running back Devonta Freeman was ejected for throwing a punch at Donald after the play ended. New Rams cornerback Jalen Ramsey, who was acquired in a trade with the Jacksonville Jaguars on Tuesday, forced a first-half fumble in his Los Angeles debut. Neither team was particularly effective on offense in the first half, with the Rams getting a pair of Greg Zuerlein field goals in the first two quarters, along with Gurley’s TD catch. The Falcons were held to 108 total yards in the first half and one Matt Bryant field goal. The Rams built a 27-3 lead on third quarter TDs from Gerald Everett on an 8-yard TD pass and Goff’s TD run. Zuerlein added a 20-yard field goal in the fourth quarter. Falcons backup QB Matt Schaub led the Falcons on their only TD drive, hitting Austin Hooper on a 10-yard score with 2:41 remaining. The Rams added a TD with 11 seconds remaining when Darious Williams recovered a Russell Gage fumbled punt return in the end zone. —Field Level Media ",Reuters
2019,Eurohold defends its plans to buy CEZ's Bulgarian assets,"SOFIA, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Bulgarian company Eurohold on Tuesday attempted to alleviate the concerns of the country’s competition regulator over its plans to buy Czech utility CEZ’s Bulgarian assets. The Commission for Protection of Competition opened an in-depth inquiry into Eurohold’s 335-million-euro deal signed in June, saying it might give the new group a serious competitive advantage over the energy market in Bulgaria. The regulator said that Eurohold, which has interests in insurance and asset management, has a significant share of the market in insurance guarantees, while some of CEZ’s Bulgarian companies are active in energy trade, which requires bank and insurance guarantees. Eurohold filed documents with the regulator that highlight that its insurance companies do not have a leading market position in insurance guarantees and do not currently offer such guarantees to energy traders. Eurohold said that if the deal gets approval from the regulator, the energy companies and the insurance companies will be related parties in a new group, and deals between such companies are restricted and even banned over a certain level under European Union and Bulgarian regulatory rules. “That is why there is no way for the energy traders from the new group to get or receive any competitive advantage in the form of insurance guarantee from an insurer, part of the group,” Eurohold said in a statement. The competition regulator has four months to complete its investigation. (Reporting by Tsvetelia Tsolova. Editing by Jane Merriman)",Reuters

2019,German economy may have contracted again in third quarter - Bundesbank,"FRANKFURT, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The German economy may have contracted in the three months to September, and a slowdown in exports is now threatening to affect the domestic economy as well, the Bundesbank said on Monday. The euro zone’s largest economy has slowed sharply in the past year as its traditional engine of growth - exports - bore the brunt of a global trade war. “Germany’s economic output could have shrunk again slightly in the third quarter of 2019,” the country’s central bank said in a monthly report. “The decisive factor here is the continued downturn in the export-oriented industry.” This downturn was starting to cast a shadow on the rest of economy, the Bundesbank said, adding however that it did not expect an outright recession. “Early indicators currently provide few signs of a sustainable recovery in exports and a stabilisation of the industry,” the central bank said. “This raises the risk that the slowdown extends to a greater extent to more domestically oriented sectors.” (Reporting by Francesco Canepa; Editing by Hugh Lawson)",Reuters

2019,CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Fidelity to review ties with money manager after 'inappropriate' comments,"(Corrects name in par 7 to Fisher) By Ross Kerber BOSTON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments criticized money manager Kenneth Fisher on Tuesday over what it called inappropriate remarks he made at an investment conference last week, saying it was reviewing the $500 million Fisher’s firm manages for the mutual fund giant. “We are very concerned about the highly inappropriate comments by Kenneth Fisher. The views he expressed do not align in any way with our company’s values,” Fidelity spokesman Vincent Loporchio said. “We do not tolerate these types of comments at our company.” Fisher Investments manages money within the $8 billion Fidelity Strategic Advisers Small-Mid Cap Fund. His firm manages more than $100 billion, including at top U.S. public pension funds. A Fisher spokesman did not immediately return a message seeking comment. Boston-based Fidelity’s review underscores building pressure on Fisher. He has already apologized for comments he made at a California investment conference on Oct. 8. An attendee, Alex Chalekian, chief executive of a financial advisory firm, called attention to the unsavory comments the day after the conference in a video posted on Twitter that went viral. He said Fisher had spoken about genitalia, “picking up on a girl” and financier Jeffrey Epstein, who committed suicide in August while being held in jail awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. “It was a true debacle,” Chalekian, who referred to other unacceptable remarks, said in his Twitter video. On Oct. 10, Michigan’s $70 billion retirement system dropped Fisher Investments over the remarks, according to a letter sent to the state’s investment board. Fisher had managed $600 million for the retirement system, money that will now be managed internally. Fisher Investments is also a sub-adviser on the $600 million Goldman Sachs Multi-Manager Global Equity Fund. Goldman Sachs spokesman Patrick Scanlan declined to comment. (Reporting by Ross Kerber.

2019,Aramco listing was delayed to rope in anchor investors -sources,"* Cornerstone investors help to bolster IPO demand * Valuation concerns remain a sticking point * Aramco wants anchor investors to cover no less than 40% -source By Hadeel Al Sayegh, Marwa Rashad and Rania El Gamal DUBAI/RIYADH, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Oil giant Saudi Aramco’s much-vaunted stock market listing was delayed after deal advisers said they need more time to lock in cornerstone investors, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. After a false start last year, preparations gathered momentum this summer with approaches to sovereign wealth funds, rich Saudis and large foreign fund managers as potential cornerstone investors only for plans to unravel for a second time. The world’s biggest oil company had been expected last week to launch the domestic sale of a 1-2% stake, but the signing up of marquee backers has been hampered by continuing valuation concerns exacerbated by recent attacks on Aramco’s Abqaiq and Khurais plants. Aramco was unable to answer valuation questions fully during initial talks with investors, said one Gulf institutional investor who has been involved in the discussions. Sovereign funds in the oil-rich Gulf region typically shy away from energy exposure, he added, looking to diversify their investment portfolio. Two of the sources said that an Aramco committee overseeing the planned flotation had therefore recommended to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman last Wednesday that the launch of an initial public offering (IPO) scheduled for Oct. 20 be postponed. The prince, the kingdom’s de facto ruler, has made the Aramco IPO a pillar of an ambitious economic reform drive. He wants the company to be valued at about $2 trillion, though bankers and company insiders put the value closer to $1.5 trillion. Aramco declined to comment and the Saudi government media office did not respond to a Reuters’ request for comment. Banks involved in the offering received news of the delay on Thursday evening. An email from top advisers said that a call with bankers on Friday to discuss strategy to secure investors was cancelled, as was the Sunday launch, said one banker who saw the email. The rationale was that third-quarter results, which one of the sources said could come before the end of October, would bolster investor confidence after the Sept. 14 attacks initially halved Aramco’s output and shook oil markets. Talks have taken place with Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Singapore’s GIC and other funds, sources have told Reuters. Newly appointed Aramco chairman Yasir al-Rumayyan, who also heads Saudi wealth fund PIF, is pushing banks to achieve the top valuation, said a fourth source familiar with the IPO plan. Anchor, or cornerstone, investors such sovereign wealth funds are considered key to secure demand. In 2016 state-owned Postal Savings Bank of China sold 77% of its $7.4 billion IPO to such backers. “They (Aramco) will want anchor investors to cover no less than 40% of the offering. Anything below that won’t be enough,” said one of the three sources close to the deal. The latest delay in the plan to hold what could be one of the world’s largest public offerings — potentially raising upwards of $20 billion from the sale of 5% of Aramco in total — has revived debate on whether Saudi Arabia can ever realise its valuation target given moribund oil prices. “The current oil price environment is not favourable for the $2 trillion target,” said Steffen Hertog, associate professor at the London School of Economics. “Aramco expects the oil market to recover over the coming few years. Another longer delay would, however, test the patience of the market; the optics would not be ideal.” Additional reporting by Clara Denina, Stephen Kalin and Saeed

2019,"Ex-U.S. biotech executive fined for lying to auditors, charges dropped against CFO: SEC","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The former chief business officer of U.S. biotechnology company Osiris Therapeutics Inc has agreed to pay a $40,000 civil penalty for lying to auditors, the Securities and Exchange Commission said on Thursday. The SEC had alleged that Bobby Dwayne Montgomery prompted Osiris to book fake revenue and give false information to auditors. Montgomery agreed to a judgment that enjoins him from future violations of securities law, the SEC said in a statement. “Our client is pleased to have resolved this matter on a no-admit no-deny basis, and looks forward to moving on with his life,” said Stephen Crimmins, Montgomery’s lawyer. The biotech firm previously paid a $1.5 million penalty to settle charges of overstating company performance and issuing fraudulent financial statements for nearly two years, the regulator said. The SEC said it last month dismissed charges against one of Osiris’s former chief financial officers, Gregory I. Law. Litigation against two other executives is ongoing, the agency said. “The SEC deserves credit for belatedly recognizing that Greg is innocent, but it doesn’t change the fact that he shouldn’t have been charged to begin with,” said Aitan Goelman, counsel for Law.

2019,UPDATE 2-U.S. energy chief says departure has 'absolutely nothing' to do with Ukraine,"(Adds details on Perry pushing for July 25 call, Perry’s thoughts on Rudy Giuliani’s involvement in Ukraine) Oct 18 (Reuters) - U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said on Friday the controversy over the Trump administration’s handling of Ukraine had nothing to do with his resignation, adding he did not know whether he would cooperate with House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry. Perry’s departure was announced by U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday. He has found himself engulfed in Congress’ impeachment investigation into whether the Republican president improperly withheld nearly $400 million in military aid for Ukraine in exchange for Kiev investigating his Democratic political rivals. “It has absolutely nothing to do with Ukraine,” Perry said of his planned departure in a Fox News interview, adding he was looking to return to Texas for “the next adventure in life.” Last week, the three Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives committees leading the impeachment probe issued a subpoena for Perry to turn over documents by Friday regarding any role he played in Trump’s alleged bid to pressure Ukraine. Asked if he would meet House Democrats’ deadline, Perry deferred to his legal team. “Our general counsel is taking a look at that right now and when they send their answer at the end of the day, whatever their decision will be, I’ll follow that,” Perry said. The impeachment probe centers on Trump’s alleged efforts to pressure Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a July 25 call to investigate his unsubstantiated allegation that former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, improperly tried to aid his son Hunter’s business interests in Ukraine. Trump also asked Zelenskiy for “a favor” to look into a debunked conspiracy theory about the 2016 U.S. election involving a Democratic National Committee computer server and the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. Perry told Fox he had pushed Trump to make the July call, agreeing with a characterization the president had made earlier. Perry said he urged Trump to talk in the call about corruption and providing Ukraine an alternative to natural gas from Russia, in the form of shipments of U.S. liquefied natural gas. Biden never came up in any discussions Perry had with Zelenskiy or the White House, he said. Perry also said he had no problems about being told to consult with Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on Ukraine matters. “I’ve worked with him. I trust him,” Perry said. When Perry was governor of Texas, he added, “I used people outside of government all the time to give me information.” (Reporting by Jan Wolfe, Susan Heavey and Timothy Gardner; Editing by Pravin Char and Chris Reese)",Reuters
2019,Trask's 4 TD tosses lift No. 9 Florida over South Carolina,"EditorsNote: Several tweaks throughout Florida quarterback Kyle Trask tossed four touchdown passes as the No. 9 Gators scored 21 unanswered points in a 38-27 win over South Carolina in Columbia, S.C., on Saturday. Trask produced three of his four scores in the second half as the Gators rebounded from last week’s 42-28 loss at LSU to outscore the Gamecocks 28-10 after trailing three times. The junior completed 21 of 33 passes for 200 yards and also threw one interception for the Gators (7-1, 4-1 SEC). Dameon Pierce rushed for 87 yards on seven carries with a score, and Jacob Copeland had a game-high 89 yards receiving and a score on three catches. True freshman quarterback Ryan Hilinski was 17 of 35 for 170 yards with one score, and Tavien Feaster rushed for a game-best 175 yards on 25 carries and one score for South Carolina (3-4, 2-3). South Carolina marched on an eight-play, 75-yard drive in 5:01 to take a 7-0 lead on the opening series of the 40th meeting between the schools. Florida appeared to make a stop on third-and-goal on a bad snap, but the drive was kept alive when a Gators defender lined up offsides. Mon Denson plunged in from a yard out on the next play. The Gators followed with a 44-yard drive that ended with Evan McPherson booting a 48-yard field goal at 4:06, but Parker White answered with a 49-yarder early in the second quarter. Florida responded at 10:08 when Copeland caught his second touchdown of the season on an underthrown ball from Trask for a 37-yard score to tie it at 10. The game’s first turnover — an interception by Jammie Robinson — set up the Gamecocks to start the second half. Feaster converted a third-and-11 on a draw play for a 21-yard rushing score, but Florida tied the score at 17 on the next play from scrimmage on a 75-yard run by Pierce. White kicked a 31-yard field goal at 3:16 for a 20-17 lead, but Florida grabbed its first lead when Trask tossed a 25-yard score to Freddie Swain for a 24-20 lead with 9:54 remaining. Trask threw his third TD pass, a 5-yarder, to Kyle Pitts at 7:53, then added the final one on a 5-yard pass to Trevon Grimes at 4:02.

2019,"Chile's Codelco ditches 'green copper' push, eyes wider mine clean-up in two years","SANTIAGO (Reuters) - In 2017, the world’s largest copper producer - Chile’s Codelco - announced a plan to sell “green copper” at a premium price to customers using more sustainable practices like renewable energy and recycled water to cut its carbon footprint. The project has run aground however, Codelco insiders and an executive said, as the miner realized it would struggle to guarantee its copper’s sustainability once it left the mine to be melted down and taken to market. Without that, traders said, higher prices were unjustifiable. Now, the world’s largest miner of the prized red metal told Reuters it would drop the “green copper” plan piloted in one of its smaller mines in favor of a broader initiative to make its product more sustainable. The move by the influential copper giant could, if successful, pave the way for more significant industry-wide sustainability standards for the historically high-polluting copper mining trade, analysts said. But the failure with more ambitious “green copper” also represents something of a setback for Codelco, which is already struggling with aging mines and lower copper prices due to the U.S.-China trade war. Jorge Sanhueza, Codelco’s newly minted chief of climate change and traceable copper, told Reuters in an exclusive interview at the firm’s Santiago headquarters that it would instead seek to ensure that all its production, upwards of 1.7 million tons a year, could be tracked and measured for sustainability within two years. “We have to get the deadlines approved by the board of directors but this is more ambitious than what we had before,” said Sanhueza. Codelco’s latest bid to ride the sustainable wave comes just weeks before Chile is due to host the United Nations’ annual environmental summit, COP25, in December. Codelco did not disclose the estimated cost of the effort. Heavy industry globally and the South American nation’s miners particularly are under pressure from governments and environmental groups to cut carbon emissions and make operations less resource-hungry. Customers are also demanding products with a lower carbon footprint as scientific evidence mounts that emissions are driving climate change. NOT WORRYING ABOUT PRICE - FOR NOW A source linked to Codelco’s commercial strategy said that the original plan had been to sell the “green copper” at a higher price, but that initiative was shelved. Copper traders told Reuters that Codelco had struggled to be able to certify its copper as traceable because once the ore left the mine, it still had to be driven to its markets, and transformed into cathodes in smelters largely powered by coal. “Since there was no approved, industry-wide methodology (for sustainability) we were not willing to pay more for this copper,” one trader, who asked for anonymity so as not to affect his commercial relationship with the firm, said. “That is why Codelco had to continue selling its copper without attracting a premium.” Sanhueza confirmed Codelco would set aside price differentiation for now. “We’ve refocused to an extent to be able to make a reality the issue of traceability within the short term and from that point move towards a copper which is produced with a lower carbon footprint and social cost,” he said. Rachael Bartels, a senior managing director at consultancy firm Accenture, said Codelco was “ahead of their time” with its initiative at the one small mine but the company’s eagerness could still give it an advantage. “You need a tipping point and we’re not quite there yet,” she told Reuters in London. “They may not get a premium for it, but they may become the preferred supplier.” To “trace” its copper, the company has set 75 parameters including water and clean energy use, gender equality and compliance with international labor regulations. As there is at present no international benchmark for sustainable production of copper, it reviewed standards for other products such as aluminum and used guidelines from the industry-funded International Copper Association (ICA), Sanhueza said. Codelco is building a $1 billion desalination plant to supply its operations in the north of the country, and assessing its energy contracts for ways to strip carbon emissions from them, albeit without a set deadline to migrate completely to clean energies, Sanhueza said. “The good news is that one way or another, Codelco’s contracts are going to be decarbonized,” he said. The state-owned miner faces another challenge to improve water recycling levels in its production processes. Although some of its mines in Chile’s north have rates of almost 90%, that drops to 54% and 62% in its key Andina and El Teniente mines. As well as its internal targets, Codelco and other miners have been told by government to provide concrete plans to cut emissions before the spotlight of COP25 arrives. In recent weeks there has been a flurry of announcements. BHP Group Ltd has said that the world’s largest copper mine, Escondida, will be run entirely on renewable energy while Anglo American Plc and French utility Engie have unveiled plans for hydrogen-powered lorries. Juan Carlos Guajardo, head of Santiago consultancy Plusmining, said Codelco’s adventures in green copper highlighted that the industry was still grappling with sustainability best-practice. “I still don’t see a standard in place,” he said.

2019,Volvo Cars aims to be climate neutral by 2040,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Volvo Cars, owned by China’s Geely Holding, is targeting a 40% reduction in the carbon footprint of each car it manufactures by 2025 as it bids to become fully climate neutral by 2040, it said in a statement on Wednesday. The company aims to reach the 2025 targets through a string of measures, including generating 50% of global sales from fully electric cars and having a 25% share of recycled plastics in new vehicles by that time, both of which have been previously announced. It is also aiming for a 25% cut in carbon dioxide emissions related to its global supply chain and its overall operations, including manufacturing and logistics, by 2025. “At Volvo Cars we will address what we control, which is both our operations and the tailpipe emissions of our cars,” Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson said in a statement. “And we will address what we can influence, by calling on our suppliers and the energy sector to join us in aiming for a climate neutral future.” Volvo also said it aims for its global manufacturing network to be fully climate neutral by 2025. Germany’s Daimler said earlier this year it aimed to have a carbon neutral new car fleet by 2039, while Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) targets carbon neutrality by 2050.

2019,China September soybean imports ease on falling animal feed demand,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s soybean imports in September fell 13.5% from the previous month, customs data showed on Monday, as an epidemic of African swine fever that has slashed China’s pig herd reduced demand for soymeal. China, the world’s top market for soybeans, brought in 8.2 million tonnes of the oilseed in September, down from last month’s 9.48 million tonnes, according to data released by the General Administration of Customs. Still, the figure was above 8.01 million tonnes in the same month a year ago, with importers stepping up buying of Brazilian beans on worries of supply shortages amid a festering Sino-U.S. trade war. “The volume of soybeans crushed in September was relatively small as crush margins and demand for soymeal have fallen due to African swine fever,” said Xie Huilan, an analyst with Cofeed, an agribusiness research firm. China’s pig herd shrank by 38.7% in August versus a year ago, according to data published by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs in early September. Many in the industry believe the reduction could be much larger than official data suggest. China is also stuck in a trade war with the United States, curbing shipments from traditionally its second-largest supplier of soybeans. Beijing slapped 25% tariffs on a list of U.S. products including soybeans in July last year, in a response to similar measures by Washington. “The figures were within expectation, as crushers increased imports of quite some beans from South America in August, mainly on worries that the (Sino-U.S.) trade negotiations would not go well,” said Monica Tu, analyst with consultancy Shanghai JC Intelligence Co. Ltd. In the past few weeks, Chinese importers have bought more U.S. soybeans, following a government waiver on extra tariffs, as part of a goodwill gesture ahead of trade talks between the two countries. For the first nine months of the year, China bought in 64.511 million tonnes of soybeans, down 7.9% from the same period last year, customs data showed. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that China had agreed to make purchases of $40-$50 billion in U.S. agricultural goods, as the two sides agreed on the first phase of a deal to end a months long trade war.

2019,Egypt to press ahead with sale of stakes in state companies - govt adviser,"CAIRO, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Egypt is fully committed to its programme to sell minority stakes in state companies and is tackling a number of issues that have held it up, a government advisor on the share sales said on Thursday. The government has been talking for years about selling the stakes but has repeatedly postponed the programme, raising doubts among some economists about its commitment to privatisation. “From the meetings I attend on a weekly basis, the government is as keen as I have ever seen them on proceeding with the privatisation programme,” Mohamed Metwally, CEO of NI Capital, told Reuters. “There has never been slack on this. It’s just a matter of sometimes you face things that take longer to prepare than expected,” said Metwally in his first interview with the media since taking over as NI Capital’s CEO in July. The government set up NI Capital in late 2015 as a state-owned financial services company to help it navigate financial markets. The government announced in 2016 that it was selling company stakes, with some to be sold by the end of that year. Since then it has sold only 4.5% of one company, tobacco monopoly Eastern Company in a transaction in March. Metwally said the delays had been caused by weak markets, legal hurdles, the readiness of each company’s financial documentation and in the case of some companies a downturn in the business cycle. Egypt last year released a list of 23 state-controlled companies to be brought to market as an initial batch. The first sales will be companies already trading on the Egyptian Exchange, most likely Abu Qir Fertilisers and Chemicals Industries and Alexandria Container and Cargo Handling Co., sources familiar with the planned transactions told Reuters. Metwally, citing reasons of financial compliance, declined to discuss individual companies before they reached the market. He said stake sales could raise around 40 billion Egyptian pounds, roughly equal to 5% of the stock market’s current capitalisation of 750 billion-800 billion pounds. Among the hurdles bringing companies to market has been a tangle of ownership structures, with different entities requiring different legal processes for selling their assets. “We had a few transactions that were held up by this process, but now it’s behind us,” Metwally said. A potential future delay to the Egyptian share sales could be the initial public offering of Saudi Arabia’s state oil company Aramco, which may be announced as early as next week. “Right now liquidity is being sucked out of the market because of anticipation of the Aramco offering,” Metwally said. If the Aramco sale raises more than $25 billion, it would make it the world’s biggest IPO. “Now should it (the Egyptian sales) happen, let’s say, in November, or wait till January or February when the Aramco IPO is out of the way?” he said. Another stumbling block has been the trade war between China and the United States, which by creating a glut in products sold by some of the companies reduced their prices by 30-40% and temporarily lowered valuations, Metwally said. He said these issues were all being resolved, paving the way for a possibly rapid roll-out. “Progress is happening in every single transaction,” he said. “That might put us in a high-quality problem in the future, in which they’re all ready at the same time, and we’ll just have to schedule them one after the other as part of our capital markets management process.” (Reporting by Patrick Werr; Editing by Susan Fenton)",Reuters
2019,Belarus briefly detains Russian accused of U.S. election meddling,"MINSK (Reuters) - Belarus briefly detained a Russian national accused by Washington of taking part in Russian attempts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Belarus’s interior ministry said on Tuesday. Anna Bogachyova was detained at a hotel in the capital Minsk and later released, it said in a statement. Her arrest had been requested by the United States, Russian state news agency RIA said, citing an unnamed source familiar with the situation. Belarus is a close ally of Russia. Following her release, the Belarusian prosecutor general’s office said it was considering removing her name from the country’s list of internationally wanted people. The United States has said Bogachyova worked briefly for Internet Research Agency (IRA) in 2014, which has been referred to as a Russian “troll factory”. Her name appeared in a report by former U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigated Russia’s role in the 2016 U.S. election campaign. According to the report, which was released in March, Bogachyova and her colleague travelled to the United States in 2014 as IRA employees for an “intelligence-gathering mission”. She was one of several Russians sanctioned by the United States last year for malicious cyber activity. Bogachyova did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.

2019,Exclusive: Indian buyers slash Malaysian palm oil purchases fearing duty hike - traders,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian refiners have stopped buying Malaysian palm oil for shipment in November and December fearing New Delhi could raise import taxes or enforce other measures to curb imports from the Southeast Asian nation, five traders told Reuters on Monday. Lower purchases by India, the biggest buyer of Malaysian palm oil so far in 2019, could lead to higher inventories and put pressure on Malaysian palm oil prices FCPOc3. It could also help rival Indonesia increase its shipments to India. India is considering restricting imports of some products from Malaysia including palm oil after Kuala Lumpur criticized New Delhi for its actions in Kashmir, Reuters reported on Friday. India’s government has not made any public remarks about Malaysian palm oil. The Commerce Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. “We need clarity before doing business with Malaysia,” said a Mumbai-based dealer. His trading firm was about to buy 5,000 tonnes palm oil on Friday from Malaysia for November shipment but decided not to proceed after reading about potential disruptions. If the government did not provide clarity in coming days, the trader said he would buy from Indonesia. Malaysian palm oil futures slumped for a second straight day on Monday due to concerns about the possible Indian import restrictions and weakness in related edible oils. “Traders are confused on both sides. They don’t know how to plan their shipments,” said Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive of Sunvin Group, a Mumbai-based vegetable oil importer. “On the cautious side, buyers are preferring Indonesian shipments to avoid any possible impact of higher duties,” he said. Palm oil accounts for nearly two-thirds of India’s total edible oil imports. India buys more than 9 million tonnes of palm oil annually, mainly from Indonesia and Malaysia. In the first nine months of 2019, India bought 3.9 million tonnes of Malaysian palm oil, with monthly imports of about 433,000 tonnes, Malaysian Palm Oil Board data showed. Most October import contracts have already been signed, said a Mumbai-based dealer with another trading firm, adding imports would plunge from November as traders shunned new contracts with Malaysian sellers. Malaysia traditionally cornered the bulk of India’s refined palm oil shipments, while Indonesia dominated crude palm oil supplies, said Govindbhai Patel, managing director of trading firm G.G. Patel & Nikhil Research Company. Indonesia usually sold palm oil at a discount to Malaysia but that could be narrowed or wiped out if all Indian palm oil buying switched to Jakarta, said Bajoria of Sunvin Group. India, the world’s biggest importer of edible oils, also buys soyoil from Argentina and Brazil, and sunflower oil from Ukraine. Malaysia’s Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Sunday his government would monitor the trade situation with India. India’s government was angered after Mahathir said at the United Nations last month that India had “invaded and occupied” Jammu and Kashmir and asked New Delhi to work with Pakistan to resolve the issue. Muslim-majority Kashmir is divided between India and Pakistan, which both claim it in full and have twice gone to war over the territory. India revoked the special constitutional status of its portion of Kashmir in August, imposed a communications clampdown in the region and made mass arrests.

2019,General Motors strike to slash U.S. October payrolls: JPMorgan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A month-long strike at General Motors (GM.N) could cut U.S. job growth by as much as 75,000 in October, JPMorgan economist Daniel Silver said on Friday, an unwelcome development amid financial market fears of a recession. Silver said in a research note that the estimated hit to nonfarm payrolls would be the result of both direct and indirect effects of the strike by about 48,000 workers at the automaker. The estimate draws comparisons with the 1998 strike at GM, which JPMorgan estimated depressed payrolls in July of that year by about 150,000 jobs. That strike spilled over to other parts of the auto industry. The Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which compiles the closely watched employment report, treats striking workers, who did not receive a paycheck during the survey week, as unemployed. The October report is due Nov. 1. Last week was the survey period for the nonfarm payrolls component of October’s employment report. The BLS’ strike report on Oct. 25 will offer details on the likely payrolls impact of the work stoppage that started in mid-September. “The near-50,000 workers on strike at GM plants starting in mid-September should be removed from the October nonfarm employment count,” said Silver. “We therefore look for the total drag on employment coming from the strike to be only somewhat larger than the direct effects, likely around 75,000.” GM and the United Auto Workers union reached a tentative deal on Wednesday to end the strike. On Thursday, the union said workers would stay off the job while they vote on the proposed contract. The strike depressed manufacturing output in September. The household survey from which the unemployment rate is derived would likely consider the striking workers as employed. “We don’t think that any upward pressure on the unemployment rate from the strike will be clearly visible,” said Silver. “We would need to see unemployment increase by 164,000 for the unemployment rate to rise 0.10 percentage point with a steady labor force.” Though likely to be temporary, any drop in October payrolls could rattle financial markets already on edge following slower job growth in September. Payrolls increased by 136,000 jobs last month, below the monthly average of 161,000 this year. The three-month average gain in private employment fell to 119,000, the smallest since July 2012, from 135,000 in August. A spate of weak data, including September retail sales and manufacturing production, have also cast a cloud on the longest economic expansion on record. The expansion, now in its 11th year, is being hamstrung by a 15-month trade war between the United States and China, which has eroded business confidence and weighed on business investment.

The country’s flag carrier also said it will stop the lower-performing Los Angeles-to-London route by the same date, which would allow it to direct the freed-up capacity to faster growing markets. “Air New Zealand is strongest when operating direct flights to and from our home base and this reset will put us in the best possible position to take advantage of increasing demand across the Pacific Rim,” acting Chief Executive Officer Jeff McDowall said in a statement. McDowall added that the route withdrawal would result in the disestablishment of Air New Zealand’s London cabin crew base consisting of around 130 people and about 25 roles in its Hammersmith sales office and ground team.

2019,UPDATE 2-UK stocks recoil as Brexit optimism fades; buyout spurs Sophos,"* FTSE 100 down 0.5%, FTSE 250 down 0.6% * UK indexes ease after Friday’s rally * Sophos jumps on buyout deal, leads peer Avast higher * Royal Mail drops as threat of Christmas strike looms (Adds details, quotes, graphic, updates to closing prices) By Shashwat Awasthi Oct 14 (Reuters) - London-listed companies with exposure to the domestic economy retreated on Monday as last week’s euphoric optimism gave way to doubts over whether a timely Brexit deal could be clinched, while cybersecurity firm Sophos surged 36% after a buyout offer. The FTSE 250 ended slightly off the day’s lows but still shed 0.6%, handing back part of the more than 4% gain it had recorded in the previous session which was its best in nearly a decade. Britain and the European Union said over the weekend that a lot more work would be needed to secure a Brexit agreement. JP Morgan’s UK domestic plays index, tracking about 30 UK stocks that make all or most of their revenue at home, pulled back nearly 1%. It had jumped almost 8% on Friday, its best day since the basket was created nearly three years ago. Blue-chip banks like Lloyds and Barclays and housebuilders skidded, dragging the FTSE 100 0.5% lower. “On balance I feel the situation here is still fairly unpredictable... I think it’s far from clear we have a pathway yet,” said Paul O’Connor, head of the UK-based Multi-Asset Team at Janus Henderson. The main index was also hurt by a drop in miners after disappointing imports and exports data from top metals consumer China. Mid-cap Sophos Group scaled its highest level in more than a year at 586.8 pence, after private equity firm Thoma Bravo said it would take the company private in a 583 pence per share deal. Shares of its peer Avast also rose 2.6%. Sentiment around the U.S.-China trade situation also tempered somewhat after a rally in global stocks last week on signs of progress in negotiations that culminated with President Donald Trump outlining the first phase of a deal and suspending a threatened tariff hike. “We welcome it but it’s a very fragile truce. The fact that it wasn’t written down is the most important thing. It shows what a challenge it is to converge on a hard agreement,” O’Connor said. Ad firm WPP, which lost 4% in the previous session after French rival Publicis cut its sales view for the second time, ended 2.8% higher. Royal Mail, relegated to the FTSE 250 earlier this year, slipped 2.4% after a report here that the company was facing the threat of an employee strike over Christmas.

2019,Countdown to divorce: Meetings that will decide Brexit,"LONDON (Reuters) - The following events will determine whether Britain exits the European Union as planned on Oct. 31 or the three-year-old Brexit saga takes another twist. Oct. 13 - German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron meet at the Elysee Palace to prepare for upcoming summits where Brexit will top the agenda. If the EU is to make a breakthrough concession on the terms of Britain’s exit from the bloc, it will require the blessing of the bloc’s two most influential members. Oct 13-14 - The 27 EU ambassadors are briefed by EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier after a weekend of intensive, so-called “tunnel” talks with Britain.     Oct. 14 – British parliament reconvenes, setting the stage for further attempts by lawmakers to ensure the Oct. 31 deadline for withdrawal is extended, regardless of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s promise that the UK will leave on that date, deal or no deal. Johnson’s legislative agenda will be set out by the British monarch in the traditional Queen’s Speech. - French President Macron meets European Council chief Donald Tusk in Paris to discuss issues including Brexit. Oct. 15 - European affairs ministers from the EU27 discuss the state of play of Brexit with an update from Barnier to prepare the leaders’ summit of Oct. 17-18.     Oct. 16 - France and Germany hold their annual summit. It is an opportunity for ministers from both countries to discuss a range of bilateral issues, but Brexit will be sure to figure prominently in these discussions.     Oct. 17-18 - EU government leaders meet in Brussels for a European Council summit. If a Brexit agreement is struck, it will have to be approved by the British parliament. The summit agenda also includes the bloc’s next long-term budget from 2021, its troubled relationship with Turkey, the EU membership prospects of Albania and North Macedonia, as well as ambitious climate policies.     Oct. 19 – The British parliament will hold a special Saturday sitting to decide what to do - or to vote on a deal. If the stalemate is not broken at this point, a law recently passed by the parliament dictates that London must ask the EU to extend the Oct. 31 deadline to Jan. 31 – a period in which a national election may be held to try to break the Brexit deadlock. If parliament approves a deal, then it will rush to approve additional legislation needed for Brexit to take place in an orderly way. The last time parliament sat on a Saturday was in 1982 after Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic. Opponents of Brexit will march through central London to demand another referendum. Late October – EU diplomats and officials expect an extraordinary summit of EU leaders before Oct. 31. If there is no deadline extension and no agreed divorce, they will use such a summit to make final preparations for a rocky, no-deal split. Oct 31 – Unless this deadline is extended, Britain will cease to be an EU member at 2300 GMT. Writing by Mark Bendeich and Guy Faulconbridge; Editing by Mark Heinrich",Reuters

2019,BoE's Ramsden sees scope for higher rates after Brexit deal - Bloomberg,"LONDON (Reuters) - Bank of England Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said he still saw a case for a gradual increase in interest rates if Britain manages a smooth departure from the European Union, maintaining a slightly more hawkish tone than some of his colleagues. Britain’s parliament is due to vote on Saturday on a new transition deal Prime Minister Boris Johnson agreed with Brussels, which would maintain existing trade arrangements for more than a year while longer-term trade barriers are discussed. “The kind of guidance we’ve been giving - in the world ofa deal it still applies,” Ramsden said in an interview with Bloomberg News published on Friday. “We’re not saying over what timeframe, but limited and gradual (rate increases) is a reasonable qualitative framing,” he added, referring to the BoE’s longstanding guidance on rates. Sterling edged higher against the dollar following Ramsden’s remarks, which differ from the position of others on the BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee, who have said a rate cut could be needed if there is uncertainty after a Brexit deal. Ramsden said he believed a transition deal could create some pick-up in investment and productivity if it brought clarity to businesses. Brexit uncertainty up to now had damaged business investment and productivity, he said, lowering the rate at which it could grow without generating excess inflation, which in turn weakens the case for a rate cut. “(This) all adds up to me to be quite a weak position on the supply side, which, for us, then limits the speed limit in which the economy can grow,” he said, echoing remarks in an interview with the Daily Telegraph newspaper published online on Sunday. Other BoE officials, such as external MPC members Michael Saunders and Gertjan Vlieghe, have identified less of a hit to the economy’s supply capacity, pointing instead to a need for lower interest rates to help restore growth to its potential. Britain’s economy shrank by 0.2% in the three months to June, its first fall since 2012. Ramsden said the BoE would keep a close eye on currency markets after Saturday’s vote, where Johnson will need support from opposition politicians to pass his deal.

2019,"'I don't look for records, they look for me': Ronaldo after 700th goal","(Reuters) - Cristiano Ronaldo has lost count of the number of records he has broken, the Portugal forward said after scoring the 700th goal of his career during a 2-1 defeat to Ukraine on Monday. “The records come naturally, I don’t look for them, the records look for me,” he told reporters after scoring his 95th goal for his country. “It’s not for anyone to reach this number and I thank everyone, team mates, colleagues, coaches and everyone who helped Cristiano become the player that he is.” However, Ronaldo said that the defeat to Ukraine in a Euro 2020 qualifier took some of the shine off the achievement. “It’s a nice moment in my career but there was a bitter taste because we didn’t win,” he said. “We played well, but we didn’t win. We did everything we could and we had plenty of chances.” Ronaldo is the all time leading scorer in the Champions League with 127 goals, holds the record for the most goals in a single Champions League season, is Real Madrid’s all time highest scorer and Portugal’s most capped player and record scorer. The first five goals of Ronaldo career were scored for Portugal’s Sporting in 2002-03. He then scored 118 goals in 232 appearances during six seasons with Manchester United and, remarkably, averaged over a goal a game for Real Madrid, scoring 450 in 438 appearances over the course of nine seasons. In just over one season with his current club Juventus, he notched a further 32 goals in 51 matches. Despite the defeat, Portugal remained second in Group G with 11 points from six games, one ahead of Serbia, and will qualify for Euro 2020 if they win their remaining matches, at home to Lithuania and away to Luxemburg. “We played too much with our hearts and not enough with our heads,” said coach Fernando Santos.

2019,IN BRIEF: E-filing now mandatory in NLRB cases,"National Labor Relations Board General Counsel Peter Robb on Tuesday officially made electronic filing of documents in board cases mandatory, more than two years after the agency first said it was going paperless. In a memo, Robb directed regional directors to no longer accept submissions if they are not made through the NLRB’s e-filing system. Unfair labor practice charges and representation petitions may still be filed by mail or in person, but any affidavits, correspondence, position statements, and documentary evidence must be e-filed.

2019,Brexit insolvency fears boost demand for trade credit insurance,"LONDON (Reuters) - Companies are stepping up purchases of insurance to protect themselves against insolvencies in Britain, industry sources say, in part due to concerns about the impact of Brexit. The UK economy is feeling the pinch from the political uncertainty, which has hit consumer spending and led to a drop in the value of the pound. This has contributed to high-profile company collapses like that of travel firm Thomas Cook, which also suffered under the weight of its debt pile. UK insolvencies rose by 12% in the second quarter compared with a year earlier, according to government figures, bringing insolvencies to their highest level in five years. This has fueled interest in trade credit insurance. Companies buy such insurance if they supply goods or services to other businesses on credit, to protect against the risk they will not get paid, or will be paid very late. An example could be a Dutch flower seller supplying a British supermarket chain, buying insurance in case of non-payment. “The demand for credit insurance is incredibly high,” said Graham Bristow, managing director in credit solutions for insurance broker Aon, one of the largest firms arranging such deals. “There is no doubt Brexit is one theme, people are nervous.”    The insurance broker has seen double-digit percentage growth in demand for trade credit insurance compared with 2018, and a similar increase in enquiries on top of that, Bristow added. Richard Marriage, managing director in trade credit at insurer Nexus, said the firm had seen a 10% rise in enquiries this year, with the prospect of Britain failing to reach a negotiated withdrawal from the European Union - a so-called no-deal Brexit - one factor in the increased interest. EU exporters to Britain were interested in the insurance, in addition to UK buyers, Marriage said. Insurer Atradius has seen a 5.5% rise in its customers this year, and credit periods have shortened in Britain. The demand for quicker payment is another sign of the concern about Brexit, said Stuart Ramsden, Atradius’ head of UK & Ireland Commercial. There were 14,000 trade credit policies in place last year, the most since the 2008 financial crisis, the Association of British Insurers said. The number of claims rose 60% from 2017. Bristow and Marriage said premiums were rising, but declined to give a figure. Another insurance source said rates were up by single digit percentages, helped by a broader trend for rising insurance premiums. There were double-digit price rises in sectors such as retail, the source said. In addition to sterling’s fall, which has pushed up the cost of imports, a switch to online shopping and food delivery and high business rates have brought pain to British retailers such as Debenhams and restaurant owners such as Jamie Oliver. Agriculture was another area of concern, with Brexit likely to lead to the removal of farming subsidies currently provided by the EU. “Some politicians have said ‘we will replace them’, but when and how?” Bristow asked. Other industry sources pointed to construction, logistics such as delivery firms, the auto industry and food wholesalers as also at risk. If there is a no-deal Brexit, supply chains are likely to be disrupted, risking more insolvencies. Alexis Garatti, head of macroeconomic research at trade credit insurer Euler Hermes, predicts UK insolvencies could rise by 15% next year under a no-deal Brexit. He put the probability of a no-deal Brexit at 40%. British insolvencies, seen by Euler Hermes as rising by 11% in 2019, are running ahead of the global average of an 8% increase, Garatti said. Despite the risk, small businesses find it hard to buy trade credit insurance because of the cost, industry sources say, as they often have to insure the whole of their order book. Lack of insurance could hit small business growth, according to Nimbla, which insures individual invoices against default. A survey by Nimbla showed more than half of UK small and medium-sized firms turned down new business because they were worried about its credit quality.

2019,Zimbabwe cancels deal with Transnet JV to recapitalise state rail firm,"HARARE, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Zimbabwe has cancelled a deal struck with South African logistics group Transnet and its partner to recapitalise state-owned National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ), citing a failure to meet timelines and funding issues, a government official said. The joint venture of Transnet and Diaspora Infrastructure Development Group (DIDG), a consortium of Zimbabwean investors living abroad, won the bid to recapitalise the financially struggling NRZ with $400 million in August 2017. Nick Mangwana, permanent secretary in the information ministry, said the consortium had missed several timelines to provide proof of funding. Mangwana also said differences had emerged between the consortium partners, which led to DIDG presenting a funding structure that excluded Transnet. “(The) government indulged the consortium by working with them outside the framework agreement. Regardless, they failed to present a common position,” said Mangwana. “The exclusion of Transnet had a legal impact on the tender which had been awarded to them as a consortium. In light of the foregoing, (the) government took a position to issue a new tender.” DIDG chairperson Donovan Chimhanda told Reuters that the group had not been informed of the government’s decision. Transnet was not immediately available to comment. NRZ was one of the single largest employers in Zimbabwe, but its fortunes waned after an economic crisis between 2000-2008 that nearly halved the southern Africa country’s economy.

2019,"Oil falls more than 2% on U.S.-China trade deal doubts, stronger dollar","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices lost about 2% on Monday on worries that global crude demand could stay under pressure as few details about the first phase of a U.S.-China trade deal did little to assure a quick resolution to the tariff fight. Oil prices also felt pressure as the U.S. dollar .DXY, which has an inverse relationship with crude prices, gained as waning trade deal hopes and ongoing concerns over Britain’s exit from the European Union attracted safe-haven investments. Brent crude LCOc1 settled at $59.35 a barrel, shedding $1.16, or 1.92%, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 settled at $53.59 a barrel, losing $1.11, or 2.03%. “The complex is in (the) process of relinquishing a major portion of the late week trade inspired gains as conflicting indications out of the U.S. and China regarding trade progress is reducing risk appetite,” said Jim Ritterbusch of Ritterbusch and Associates. Late on Friday, Washington and Beijing outlined the first stage of a trade deal and suspended this week’s scheduled U.S. tariff hikes. Brent and WTI rose more than 3% last week, their first weekly increase since the week starting Sept. 20, on signs of progress toward a trade deal that would boost crude demand. But optimism that the trade negotiations would prove successful faded, as China indicated further discussions were needed and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the next round of tariffs on Chinese imports are still set to take effect on Dec. 15 if a deal has not been reached by then. But existing tariffs remain in place and officials on both sides said much more work was needed before an accord could be agreed. A good portion of the gains last week came after the United States announced on Friday it was deploying more troops to Saudi Arabia, and after an Iranian oil tanker was attacked in the Red Sea. Oil prices had drawn some support from worries that further escalation along the Syrian and Turkish border could affect output or exports from Iraq. Syrian troops entered a northeastern town on Monday. The Saudi energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, said oil exporters were showing serious commitment to global output cuts in a deal between OPEC and its allies, a grouping known as OPEC+. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said there were no talks underway to change the OPEC+ deal. Kuwait’s oil minister said it was too early to discuss a possible buildup in oil inventories in 2020. Khaled al-Fadhel said a price range of $50 to $70 per barrel would be acceptable. The compliance of OPEC+ producers with the supply-reduction agreement was seen at above 200% in September, sources familiar with the matter said. Bin Salman also said on Monday that Saudi Arabia’s oil production will recover in October and November to levels above those seen before attacks on its energy installations in September, which weighed on oil prices.

2019,"U.S., Turkey agree Ankara to primarily control Syria 'safe zone'","ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey will primarily enforce a “safe zone” in northern Syria, according to a joint statement with the United States after high-level talks in Ankara at which the sides agreed the Turkish military would pause attacks against a Kurdish militia. Under the agreement the NATO allies reached on Thursday, Turkey would stop its operation for five days in northern Syria against the Kurdish YPG militia, while it withdraws from a region along the Turkish border. Speaking after four hours of meetings between delegations from both sides, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Ankara had gotten what it wanted. “We will pause Operation Peace Spring for PKK/YPG to leave the safe zone. This is not a ceasefire - ceasefires can only happen between two legitimate sides,” he told a news conference. “When the terrorist elements completely leave the safe zone, we can stop the operation,” Cavusoglu said. Ankara considers the YPG a terrorist organization with links to Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants in Turkey. YPG was a main U.S. ally in the fight against Islamic State. Cavusoglu said the two sides had agreed for heavy arms to be taken from the YPG and for their positions to be destroyed - fulfilling a long-held request by Ankara. Contradicting separate remarks in Ankara by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, Cavusoglu also said Turkey had given no guarantees regarding the Syrian border town of Kobani. He said Turkey would discuss the town of Manbij and other regions with Russia, which, along with the Syrian government forces, have deployed in several positions vacated by the United States. Cavusoglu was quoted earlier on Thursday as saying Moscow had promised Ankara that the YPG militia will not be in the Syrian territories across the border.

2019,Brexit deal will minimize short-term economy hit: Irish finance minister,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Brexit deal struck by Britain and the rest of the European Union will minimize much of Brexit’s short-term impact on the economies of Ireland and Northern Ireland, Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said on Thursday. “There is no form of Brexit that is as good as the United Kingdom deciding to stay in the European Union, but we respect the views of the British people,” Donohoe told reporters. “I do believe that this deal, if ratified and put in place, will minimize many of the short-term impacts on the Irish economy and on the all-Ireland economy.” The longer-term consequences of Brexit on Ireland would only be clear once the future trading relationship between Britain and the EU is hammered out, he said. Donohoe spoke before giving a speech at the Brookings Institution think-tank in Washington where he was attending meetings of the International Monetary Fund. Earlier on Thursday, Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party said it could not support the Brexit deal struck by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the EU, putting it in jeopardy.

2019,Man held after Dutch family found locked away in secret farmhouse room,"RUINERWOLD, Netherlands (Reuters) - A man who paid the rent on a Dutch farmhouse where six members of a family were found locked away in a secret room will appear in court on Thursday on charges of unlawful detention and harming others’ health, prosecutors said. Five siblings, estimated to be aged between 18 and 25, and a man they identified as their ailing father were found at the farm near Ruinerwold, a village in the province of Drenthe where they had apparently lived in isolation for years. The 58-year-old suspect, who lived nearby and whose name has not yet been released by authorities, was to be brought before a judge on Thursday, prosecutors said in a statement. “The man is suspected at this stage of the investigation of involvement in unlawful detention and injuring the health of others,” the statement said. The mayor of Ruinerwold, Roger de Groot, said the suspect was not the father of the family. “The man is still in custody and is being questioned,” said Drenthe police spokeswoman Grietje Hartstra. “A lot is still unclear and we are investigating exactly what happened there.” The family was discovered after one relative, a 25-year-old man and the eldest of the siblings according to local media, sought help at a nearby cafe. In a statement, police said they found the family in a “small space in the house which could be locked” and that it was unclear whether they were being held against their will. Investigators have not commented on published reports that the family may have held apocalyptic “end of days” beliefs. “There is a lot of speculation in the media about what happened, but as police we deal with facts. We still have a lot of unanswered questions,” Hartstra said. The mother of the children was believed to have died before the family moved to the Dutch farm in 2010, De Groot told reporters. None of the family members was registered as a resident with the municipality, the police statement said. The farm is located on a secluded plot of land on the outskirts of the village. Residents were surprised that anyone could have been hidden away for so long in their tiny community without being noticed. “It’s possible here ... (it) is such a remote spot, in the middle of fields,” said neighbor Roelie van Dijk. “You see it can happen anywhere. Not only in a big city but also in the countryside. And perhaps even more in the countryside, where you can hide completely.” Van Dijk said she and her husband had seen a man driving in and out of the property for years and doing construction work. He always kept the gates closed and never socialized, she said. Her husband Sjon said he once asked to see how the renovations were coming along, but the man yelled “no” and sped off. “We tried to make contact, my husband just last week, with the man in the car...(But) he drove on. He went through the gates and locked them again.” The siblings had apparently lived in makeshift rooms inside the farm and survived partly on vegetables and animals from a secluded garden on the property, local TV RTV Drenthe reported.

2019,Russia's Rosatom may buy controlling stake in Chile lithium project,"MOSCOW/SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Uranium One Group, a subsidiary of Russia’s state nuclear company Rosatom, may buy a controlling stake in a lithium project in Chile’s Atacama salt flat from Wealth Minerals Ltd (WML.V), the Canada-listed company said on Tuesday. Under a deal struck with Wealth, the Russian nuclear firm has the option to purchase up to a 51% stake in Wealth’s Atacama project in northern Chile, the statement said. Chile’s Atacama salt flat, home to leading lithium producers SQM (SQMa.SN) and Albemarle (ALB.N), accounts for around one-third the world’s supply of lithium, a key ingredient in the batteries that power electric vehicles, tablets and cell phones. Rosatom’s interest in Chile’s lithium industry comes as electric automakers and governments scour the world for the metals needed to power the quickly expanding industry. Chile, the world’s second biggest producer of lithium, has been slow to ramp up production further amid concerns that mining the white metal, which is found in brine pools beneath the desert floor, could sap scarce water supplies. The Atacama is the world’s driest desert. Rosatom, the world’s biggest nuclear company by foreign orders, previously offered Chile’s government technology it said could sustainably boost lithium output without taxing water resources, lobbyist transparency filings showed in December. “Partnering with U1G (Uranium One) will help Wealth accelerate the development of lithium projects by using modern technology and moving away from outdated solar evaporation to a more efficient and environmentally friendly sorption technology,” Wealth President Tim McCutcheon said. Wealth in August said Chilean environmental regulators had reviewed its plans to explore for lithium beneath the salt flat and had determined the company could proceed with exploration without filing an environmental impact study. The project has nonetheless met resistance from the Atacama Indigenous Council, which represents 18 local communities. The council previously told Reuters it would move to block any new mines at Atacama because the impact on water supplies was unclear. If the transaction with Wealth is closed, Uranium One would have the right to purchase 100% of the project’s production. Several regulatory hurtles remain before Wealth can begin producing lithium from the Atacama salt flat. Besides further environmental permits, Chile also requires private miners to partner with the state or obtain a special permit known as a CEOL to mine lithium on their own. They also need to obtain a quota to export the lithium from Chilean nuclear agency CCHEN. Rosatom said in June it planned to triple its revenue by 2030 thanks to foreign projects from Belarus to Bangladesh and new product areas.

2019,"China unexpectedly keeps LPR lending benchmark unchanged, but outlook for rates down","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China on Monday unexpectedly kept unchanged its new benchmark lending rate, suggesting Beijing is keen to avoid overly loosening monetary policy for fear it may push up already-high debt levels across the economy. The one-year Loan Prime Rate (LPR) CNYLPR1Y=CFXS remained at 4.20%, steady from the previous monthly fixing. The five-year LPR CNYLPR5Y=CFXS was fixed at 4.85%, unchanged from September. A Reuters poll last week had forecast the rate would be cut again following reductions in August and last month. Frances Cheung, head of Asia macro strategy at Westpac in Singapore, said Monday’s decision does not point to an end to the downward adjustment in the LPR. “That said, the outcome is likely to reinforce the somewhat risk-on sentiment today,” Cheung said. “Looking ahead, we still see each monthly LPR re-set as providing an opportunity for a baby-step reduction.” Investors in China’s financial markets took the rate decision in stride. Benchmark 10-year treasury futures for December delivery CFTZ9, the most-traded contract, were barely moved after the data release. A separate Reuters poll of 83 analysts showed that the central bank is expected to slash the one-year LPR to 4.00% by the end of 2019, down by 20 basis point from its current level. The decision to keep the LPR steady came just days after China reported its third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth cooling to near 30-year low. Economists and China observers say a recent bath of weak data showing a further loss of momentum in the world’s second-biggest economy underlined the need for further monetary policy support. A bruising 15-month long Sino-U.S. trade dispute was also one of the key factors fueling the easing expectations. U.S. President Donald Trump has outlined the first phase of a deal to end a trade war and suspended a threatened tariff hike, though officials on both sides said much more work needed to be done. All the same, some policy insiders have said the room for the government to step up stimulus measures could be limited by its worries about rising debt risks and possible property bubbles. Data earlier on Monday showed new home prices in China grew at a steady pace in September, with fewer cities reporting price gains, giving the authorities some breathing room as they refrain from over-stimulating the property sector. Beijing has leaned more heavily on fiscal stimulus to address the current downturn, announcing trillions of yuan in tax cuts and special local government bonds to finance infrastructure projects. Monday’s fixing was the third since the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) unveiled the new lending benchmark, which is set by 18 banks. The new LPR is linked to the rate on PBOC’s medium-term lending facility (MLF), which is determined by broader financial system demand for central bank liquidity. The one-year MLF rate, last cut in February 2016, now stands at 3.3%. The PBOC unexpectedly injected 200 billion yuan ($28.29 billion) through MLF loans last week while keeping the lending rates unchanged.

2019,"Uniqlo ad sparks protest, parody as South Korea-Japan dispute flares","SEOUL (Reuters) - A commercial by Japanese clothing brand Uniqlo has stirred a consumer backlash in South Korea amid accusations that it mocks victims of wartime forced labour and brothel workers, reopening deep wounds from Japan’s colonial past. A YouTube video created by a South Korean student parodying the ad has gone viral and protesters have targeted Uniqlo stores, demanding an apology from the company. In the Uniqlo commercial, Iris Apfel, a 97-year-old American style icon with more than 1.4 million Instagram followers, is in an animated conversation with 12-year-old fashion designer Kheris Rogers. When Rogers asks how she used to dress as a teenager, Apfel says: “I can’t remember that far back!” Instead of a literal translation of that line, the commercial that aired in South Korea carried subtitles saying: “Gosh! How can I remember something that goes back 80 years?” Gaining more than 101,000 views in two days, the 19-second parody video posted on Saturday depicts a likeness of the Uniqlo TV commercial, which the company began airing this month in South Korea and other markets. In the parody, South Korean college student Youn Dong-hyeun stands with Yang Geum-deok, a 90-year-old woman who had been a forced labourer for Japan’s Mitsubishi during World War Two. Youn, a history major, asks how hard it was for Yang when she was young. “It is impossible to ever forget that awfully painful memory,” she replies. Youn has posted the video with subtitles in English and Japanese. Uniqlo, owned by Japan’s Fast Retailing Co Ltd, pulled the ad in South Korea on Saturday. “There was no intention to touch on the issue of comfort women or the South Korea-Japan dispute,” a Uniqlo official in Seoul told Reuters, asking not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation. “Comfort women” is a euphemism for girls and women, many of them Korean, who were forced to work in Japan’s wartime brothels. Relations between the two countries are at their poorest in decades after a ruling by South Korea’s top court last year ordering Japan’s Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to compensate wartime forced labourers. In July, Japan tightened controls on exports of three key high-tech materials to South Korea. Seoul accused Tokyo of taking the step in retaliation to the court ruling, prompting a wide-ranging boycott of Japanese products. South Korea and Japan share a bitter history dating to the Japanese colonisation of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945, including the use of comfort women. South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon travelled to Japan on Tuesday to attend Emperor Naruhito’s enthronement ceremony on behalf of President Moon Jae-in. Lee’s office said he planned to meet Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday, which would be the highest-level contact between the two countries since July’s export curbs. Uniqlo has already seen its South Korean sales hit and a sharp drop in customers at its stores as part of the boycott. The translation for the ad’s subtitles, which was carried out in South Korea, was meant to help convey the message of the original commercial, the official said. She declined to identify who had performed the translation. Student protesters took to the streets as the outcry against the commercial grew, demanding an official apology from Uniqlo. Bang Seulkichan, 22, was among those picketing a Uniqlo store in Seoul, holding a sign that read: “Colonial rule 80 years ago – we remember!” Park Young-sun, South Korea’s minister for small and medium enterprises, told a parliament committee on Monday the ad controversy was “very upsetting”.

2019,K-pop singer decries cyber bullying after death of 'activist' star Sulli,"SEOUL (Reuters) - Sulli, a former South Korean singer-actress, was a rare taboo breaker in a world where K-pop stars’ every move is strictly monitored by their management, but her death has exposed the dark side of the industry that propelled a global craze. She unveiled her romantic relationship at the height of her career as a member of top girl group f(x) and was vocal about not wearing a bra, defying both the K-pop world’s careful brand management and conservative social attitudes towards young women - and provoking a stream of online comment. Before her death on Monday aged 25, Sulli, whose real name was Choi Jin-ri and who police said was suffering from severe depression, spoke out strongly against cyber bullying. Colleagues and experts said her death revealed the constant barrage of malicious online comments faced by young female artists in the public eye. “She wasn’t just an issue-maker but I hope she will be remembered as a women’s rights activist who was free-spirited, who could truly speak her mind,” said Kwon Ji-an, a fellow South Korean singer and painter. Sulli’s most recent public appearance had been in a television programme in which K-pop stars spoke about their experiences with malevolent online postings. Kwon, 35, better known by her stage name Solbi, was also subjected to cyber insults in 2009, when she was a member of K-pop group Typhoon, after being wrongly identified in a sex video that went viral online. The incident triggered intense depression, social phobia and panic disorder, Kwon said. She sought therapy and learned painting, which was meant to be a way of “survival” but eventually became another career. “I was too young and socially immature to digest all the glamour and changes in the environment, and there’s no self-medication whatsoever,” Kwon said. “Then how do you respond to all of those vicious online comments? If you explain, they’ll dismiss it as an excuse, and if you fight, they’ll dislike you even more.” Kwon called for a change in the anonymous comment culture on the Internet, which critics has long blamed for cyber bullying. In South Korea, local web portals such as Naver and Daum are a major channel of news consumption, which allow users to leave comments without revealing their real names. In the wake of Sulli’s death, fans flocked to the website of the presidential Blue House to file a petition urging the adoption of a real-name online comment system. A spate of related bills have for years been pending in parliament amid heated debate. A poll by survey firm Realmeter released on Wednesday showed nearly 70% of South Koreans supported the scheme, while 24% opposed. “The freedom of expression is a vital value in democratic society, but insulting and hurting someone else’s dignity is beyond that limit,” said Lee Dong-gwi, a psychology professor at Yonsei University in Seoul. “There need to be far harsher penalties for those who violate that law.” The number of cases of cyber defamation or insult has almost doubled from 2014-18, police data shows. An association of South Korean entertainment management companies issued a statement on Wednesday vowing to pursue sterner legal action for “verbal violence” online. Kwon has now found peace thanks, in part, to painting. When she released a new single album in 2017, she even sought to express her sufferings by dousing herself with black paint on the stage like a performance artist. “I’d gotten treatment out of desperation that I really wanted to live,” Kwon said. “I don’t get hurt any more even though I see those malevolent online comments, but now is time to discuss it as a serious social issue.” Reporting by Hyonhee Shin and Hyun Young Yi; Additional reporting by Youngseo Choi; Editing by Alex Richardson",Reuters

But analysts believe a slowing domestic economy and uncertainty over developments abroad will force the Riksbank to postpone its plans. All 30 analysts in the poll saw no change in rates when the Riksbank announces its policy decision on Oct. 24. Rate-setters may not be ready to abandon their near term rate-hike plans just yet, however. “We think they will signal they will raise rates in February-April not December-February,” said Andreas Wallstrom, Head of Forecasting at Swedbank. Other analysts believe the Riksbank may wait until December before lowering the rate path. Weaker economic data will force the Riksbank into further delays. The median forecast among 27 analysts was for rates to remain unchanged through 2020. After years of strong growth, the economy has come off the boil, hurt by a trade war between the United States and China, worries about Brexit and a slowdown in the European Union. Recent PMI figures showed both the manufacturing and services sectors in Sweden contracting. The Federal Reserve in the United States and the European Central Bank have already loosened policy. Rate-setters in Sweden, however, are keen to distance themselves from negative rates - in place for more than five years - and have argued that the domestic slowdown is mild. After a sharp dip in August, inflation in September was broadly in line with the Riksbank’s forecast - though far from the 2% target - leaving the door open for a near term hike. The Swedish crown has strengthened since the inflation data and banking group SEB said in its survey of fixed income and foreign exchange markets, 45 percent of respondents now expected a near-term rate hike from the Riksbank. EURSEK= Should inflation remain close to the Riksbank’s forecasts in the coming months, it will give rate-setters confidence they can move away from negative rates. But a hike would be hard to justify should inflation surprise on the downside. October and November inflation figures are due before the Riksbank’s Dec. 19 policy announcement. While all the analysts in the Reuters poll ruled out tighter policy in December - two analysts forecast a cut - five of 27 expected the Riksbank to hike rates in the first quarter of next year. Six of 27 saw rates at zero by the end of 2020, with four expecting the Riksbank to have cut rates again to -0.50% by the turn of next year.

2019,Dark web child porn bust leads to 338 arrests worldwide,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Law enforcement officials said on Wednesday they had arrested hundreds of people worldwide after knocking out a South Korea-based dark web child pornography site that sold gruesome videos for digital cash. Officials from the United States, Britain and South Korea described the network as one of the largest child pornography operations they had encountered to date. Called Welcome To Video, the website relied on the bitcoin cryptocurrency to sell access to 250,000 videos depicting child sexual abuse, authorities said, including footage of extremely young children being raped. Its upload page specifically stated, “Do not upload adult porn.” “Darknet sites that profit from the sexual exploitation of children are among the most vile and reprehensible forms of criminal behavior,” U.S. Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski said. Officials have rescued at least 23 underage victims in the United States, Britain and Spain who were being actively abused by users of the site, the Justice Department said. Many children in the videos have not yet been identified. The site’s vast library - nearly half of it consisting of images never seen before by law enforcement - is an illustration of what authorities say is an explosion of sexual abuse content online. In a statement, Britain’s National Crime Agency said officials were seeing “increases in severity, scale and complexity.” Welcome To Video’s operator, a South Korean named Jong Woo Son, and 337 users in 12 different countries, have been charged so far, authorities said. Son, currently serving an 18-month sentence in South Korea, was also indicted on federal charges in Washington. Several other people charged in the case have already been convicted and are serving prison sentences of up to 15 years, according to the U.S. Justice Department. Welcome To Video is one of the first websites to monetize child pornography using bitcoin, which allows users to hide their identities during financial transactions. Users were able to redeem the digital currency in return for “points” that they could spend downloading videos or buying all-you-can watch “VIP” accounts. Points could also be earned by uploading fresh child pornography. “These are the bottom feeders of the criminal world,” said Don Fort, chief of criminal investigation at the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, which initiated the investigation. The Justice Department said the site collected at least $370,000 worth of bitcoin before it was taken down in March 2018 and that the currency was laundered through three unnamed digital currency exchanges. Darknet websites are designed to be all-but-impossible to locate online. How authorities managed to locate and bring down the site isn’t clear, with differing narratives by different law enforcement organizations on the matter. Fort said the investigation was triggered by a tip to the IRS from a confidential source. However, Britain's National Crime Agency said they came across the site during an investigation into a British academic who in October 2017 pleaded guilty here to blackmailing more than 50 people, including teenagers, into sending him depraved images that he shared online. In a statement, British authorities said the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit deployed “specialist capabilities” to identify the server’s location. The NCA did not immediately return an email seeking clarification on the term, which is sometimes used as a euphemism for hacking. The U.S. Justice Department gave a different explanation, saying that Welcome To Video’s site was leaking its server’s South Korean internet protocol address to the open internet. Experts pointed to the bust as evidence that the trade in child abuse imagery could be tackled without subverting the encryption that keeps the rest of the internet safe. Officials in the United States and elsewhere have recently begun prodding major technology firms here to come up with solutions that could allow law enforcement to bypass the encryption that protects messaging apps like WhatsApp or iMessage, citing the fight against child pornography as a major reason. Welcome To Video’s demise “is a clear indication that in cases like this, where there’s very low-hanging fruit, breaking encryption is not required,” said Christopher Parsons, a senior research associate at Citizen Lab, based at the University of Toronto’s Munk School. He said the bust showed that law enforcement could also track criminal activity that employs cryptocurrency transactions. “There’s a lot of a people who have this perception that bitcoin is totally anonymous,” Parsons said, “and it’s been the downfall of many people in many investigations.” Reporting by Andy Sullivan; Editing by Steve Orlofsky and Bernadette Baum",Reuters
2019,"China to scrap business curbs on foreign banks, brokerages","BEIJING (Reuters) - China will remove business restrictions on foreign banks, brokerages and fund management firms, a cabinet meeting chaired by Premier Li Keqiang said on Wednesday, state television reported. But the move, which comes nearly 18 years after China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO), could have limited impact on the competitive landscape of an industry dominated by China’s state firms. China has stepped up efforts to open its financial sector amid a festering trade war with the United States, with increased access to its financial sector among a host of demands from Washington. Last week, China announced a firm timetable for opening its futures, brokerage and mutual fund sectors fully to foreign investors next year, as Beijing and Washington reached a tentative deal to resolve their trade dispute. The cabinet did not elaborate on what effect the removal of the curbs would have. On Tuesday, the cabinet relaxed management rules for foreign insurers and banks, giving them easier access to China, and wider business scope. China will also support local governments’ efforts to attract more foreign investment and allow foreign companies to be more flexible in choosing how they borrow funds from abroad, the cabinet said. China will not allow forced technology transfers by foreign firms, it said. Stabilizing foreign investment is part of Beijing’s policies to support the slowing economy that has been hit by the country’s trade war with the United States. In 2007, HSBC Holdings (HSBA.L), Standard Chartered Bank (STAN.L), Bank of East Asia (0023.HK) and Citigroup (C.N) became the first foreign banks allowed to set up locally-incorporated subsidiaries in China as Beijing gradually opened up the sector. But hampered by numerous restrictions on business scopes and operations such as outlet openings, the roughly 40 foreign banks with local units operating in China account for a tiny fraction of a market dominated by state-owned rivals such as Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (601398.SS) and Bank of China (601988.SS). “Many people say ‘the wolves are coming’, but my observation is that...through opening, Chinese regulators intend to introduce technology and talents, but it doesn’t mean foreign players can grab a big market share in China,” Xin He, Societe Generale’s (SOGN.PA) China head of global markets told a financial conference over the weekend. He added that the French bank has retreated from its retail business in China after realizing that “foreign banks cannot compete with Chinese players in this business segment.” In the securities sector, China last year relaxed rules to allow foreign brokerages to own a majority stake in Chinese ventures. China said last week foreign ownership limits in the sector will be scrapped completely on Dec. 1, 2020. UBS Group (UBSG.S), JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and Japan’s Nomura Holdings (8604.T) have obtained regulatory approval to set up majority-owned China ventures. But China has yet to open more sensitive areas of its financial industry. U.S. payments card giants Mastercard Inc (MA.N) and Visa Inc (V.N) are still awaiting regulatory approval to conduct yuan clearing business in the country. China’s economic growth is expected to slow to a near 30-year low of 6.2% this year and cool further to 5.9% in 2020, a Reuters poll showed, even as Beijing steps up policy stimulus. The government has been leaning heavily on fiscal stimulus to support the economy, including rolling out big tax cuts and increased spending on infrastructure investment. Tax and fee cuts amounted to 1.5 trillion yuan ($211.32 billion) in the first eight months, which has helped ease the burden on firms, boost incomes and employment, with full-year reductions set to exceed 2 trillion yuan, the cabinet said. The government will also support local governments facing fiscal difficulties to ensure wage payments, the cabinet said.

2019,Morgan Stanley executives offer cautious outlook after profit beat,"(Reuters) - Morgan Stanley (MS.N) reported a higher-than-expected profit on Thursday, bolstered by strength in bond trading and M&A advisory, but executives were careful not to sound too optimistic about the rest of the year. Like other big banks, Morgan Stanley had to navigate falling interest rates, volatile markets and recession signals during the third quarter, and fared relatively well. Its overall profit rose 3%, topping Wall Street expectations by a healthy margin. However, the factors that created such a difficult operating environment during the quarter have not gone away, Chief Executive James Gorman and Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said on a call to discuss earnings. They suggested the trade dispute between the United States and China, further central bank easing, an unknown Brexit outcome and other geopolitical tensions could pressure results further. Although Gorman said the fourth quarter was “off to a good start,” that could change. “We remain cautious today as trade talks swirl and interest rates continue to be debated,” Gorman said. Although Pruzan said CEO confidence has remained high, it is unclear whether companies that are planning initial public offerings will proceed. Morgan Stanley led some of this year’s biggest IPOs, but signs of a possible downturn have slowed activity. “Conversion from pipeline to realized remains highly dependent on market conditions,” he said. During the quarter, Morgan Stanley swallowed heavy losses from stakes in companies that went public. Investment revenue plummeted to $33 million from $340 million. Nonetheless, Morgan Stanley shares were up 2.7% in afternoon trading, with analysts celebrating the results. The bank beat KBW’s revenue forecasts in each business line, analyst Brian Kleinhanzl wrote in a note to clients. Overall, Morgan Stanley’s profit rose to $2.2 billion, or $1.27 per share, from $2.1 billion, or $1.17 per share in the year-ago quarter. Net revenue inched up to $10 billion from $9.9 billion. Analysts were expecting a profit of $1.11 per share on revenue of $9.6 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The sixth-largest U.S. bank capped three days of results from Wall Street heavyweights. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N) also topped expectations, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) disappointed. Sales and trading revenue rose 10% to $3.5 billion. Gains came from a 21% jump in bond trading as equities trading fell slightly compared to a year ago. Morgan Stanley typically ranks No. 1 in equities trading, but after years of market-share gains it has been facing tougher competition lately. Its investment banking business, which includes advising on deals and helping corporations raise money, posted a 5% rise in revenue to $1.5 billion. Wealth management’s $4.4 billion in revenue was down 1% from a year ago. That business has been a stabilizing force for Morgan Stanley during volatile times. The business is trying to add new clients in Asia and lend to them more, Gorman said. Morgan Stanley’s loan book grew 8% rise in the third quarter, but net interest income stayed flat due to declining rates. In investment management, its smallest business, Morgan Stanley reported a 17% rise in revenue, to $764 million. Gorman complimented Morgan Stanley’s trading and investment banking businesses for being resilient in a shaky quarter, and said management is focused on keeping the bank stable and prosperous over the long term. “There remains tremendous upside here,” he said.

2019,Queen Elizabeth sets out PM Johnson's October 31 Brexit priority,"LONDON (Reuters) - Queen Elizabeth set out Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s agenda for his government on Monday, including an Oct. 31 Brexit, a new deal with the European Union, and a host of domestic policies designed to win over voters ahead of an expected election. The so-called Queen’s Speech is the highlight of a day of elaborate pageantry in Westminster and is used to detail all the bills the government wants to enact in the coming year. It is written for the 93-year old monarch by the government. But, with Brexit in the balance before a crucial week of talks, and an unpredictable election likely in the near future, rival parties said Johnson was misusing the politically-neutral queen by asking her to set out his election agenda. The speech and accompanying notes set out an overview of more than 20 bills, including the legislation that is required to implement a Brexit deal - if Johnson is able to reach agreement with the EU this week. “My government’s priority has always been to secure the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union on 31 October,” the queen said from parliament’s gilded House of Lords debating chamber. “My government intends to work towards a new partnership with the European Union, based on free trade and friendly cooperation”. The government’s plans included an outline of Johnson’s proposed post-Brexit immigration system, criminal justice reforms, healthcare changes, and a promise to invest more from the public purse to stimulate growth. “People are tired of stasis, gridlock and waiting for change,” Johnson said in a written statement accompanying the speech. “And they don’t want to wait any longer to get Brexit done.” But Johnson’s political future and his ability to implement any of this agenda is highly uncertain. He runs a minority government and has been unable to win a single vote in parliament since taking power in July. All parties want an early election, but disagree over when it should be held. The opposition Labour Party said the queen was being used to promote a Conservative Party election manifesto. “What we’ve got in effect is a party political broadcast from the steps of the throne,” Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said in a Sky News interview broadcast on Sunday. The speech is now subject to several days of debate, concluding with votes to approve it. While not an official vote of confidence, these could be used to further destabilise Johnson’s position.

2019,UK Labour leader supports referendum on PM Johnson's Brexit deal,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had agreed a worse Brexit deal than his predecessor Theresa May, which was overwhelmingly rejected by parliament, after Britain and the EU agreed an amended agreement. Labour is likely to vote for a second referendum if it is added to any deal proposed by Johnson, a party source said, although it was keeping its options open until it knew exactly what Johnson would ask parliament to vote on. The government intends to call lawmakers to a special sitting of the House of Commons on Saturday in the hope of getting the outlines of a new Brexit deal approved. “From what we know, it seems the Prime Minister has negotiated an even worse deal than Theresa May’s, which was overwhelmingly rejected,” Corbyn said. “This sell-out deal won’t bring the country together and should be rejected. The best way to get Brexit sorted is to give the people the final say in a public vote.” Corbyn, who voted against Britain joining the EU back in 1975 and gave only reluctant backing to the “remain” campaign in the 2016 referendum, has previously only signaled lukewarm backing for another referendum. Saturday’s sitting will take place against the backdrop of a large march through central London in favor of a second referendum. Reporting by Andrew MacAskill; editing by Stephen Addison",Reuters
2019,UPDATE 1-Italy's CIR calls Carlo De Benedetti's bid for Gedi stake inadequate,"(Updates with CIR statement) MILAN, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Italian holding company CIR has rejected an offer from veteran businessman Carlo De Benedetti to buy 29.9% of its stake in publishing group Gedi, calling it totally inadequate. In a statement on Sunday CIR said the offer for the publisher of Italy’s two leading dailies - La Republica and La Stampa - was “clearly unacceptable since... it did not recognise the real value of the stake to CIR and its shareholders”. De Benedetti made an all-cash offer for the stake on Friday through his holding company, Romed, at 0.25 euros per Gedi share, the equivalent of Thursday’s closing price, newswire Ansa reported on Sunday, citing the businessman. “This move ... is aimed at relaunching the group I have been associated with for a long part of my life and that I presided over for 10 years, promoting its extraordinary potential,” Ansa quoted De Benedetti as saying. In its statement, CIR said the offer could not guarantee the sustainable long-term future of Gedi which it said it had always been committed to. Gedi is 43.4% owned by CIR. The Agnelli family is also a shareholder. De Benedetti, one of Italy’s best known businessmen, owned a stake in CIR but transferred his shares to his three sons about seven years ago. They own 52% of CIR. It was not possible to reach De Benedetti for immediate comment. La Repubblica said on its web page on Sunday its journalists would meet on Monday to discuss the offer for Gedi. According to Ansa, the offer is conditional on the board members nominated by CIR resigning with the exception of Exor head John Elkann and Carlo Perrone. In the past there has been speculation over a possible sale of Gedi, including rumours it could be sold to France’s Le Monde group. Reporting by Stephen Jewkes; Editing by Emelia

2019,Former chairman of Brazil's Banco Bradesco dies at 93,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Lázaro de Mello Brandão, the former chairman of Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4.SA) died on Wednesday at 93, after decades of building the bank into Brazil’s second-largest private-sector lender. Brandão had stepped down two years ago after a 75-year career at the bank. He joined Bradesco in 1942 and worked alongside founder Amador Aguiar. The bank confirmed in a statement that he had passed away at a hospital in Sao Paulo. Brandão long kept a tight grip on the lender, serving as chief executive from 1981 to 1999 and chairman from 1990 to 2017. Even after leaving his job as chairman, Brandão was seen almost daily at his desk in the bank’s head office. “He had an intense and vigorous working rhythm, which was contagious for all of us,” Bradesco CEO Octavio de Lazari Junior said in a statement. “He used to be one of the first ones to arrive at our headquarters every day.” Under Brandão’s leadership, Bradesco acquired more than 20 financial institutions, including the Brazilian unit of HSBC Holdings (HSBA.L) in 2015. The bank held 1.41 trillion reais ($338 billion) in assets in June, behind only Itau Unibanco Holdings (ITUB4.SA) among private-sector banks in Brazil. “The Brazilian financial system lost one of its best-known executives,” Bradesco Chairman Luiz Carlos Trabuco Cappi said in a statement. Brandão championed the idea that Bradesco should open its branches to Brazilians of all classes, even as some rivals focused on upscale clients and cities to improve profitability. “Brandão was a key man not only for building one of the world’s largest banks, but also for helping Brazil’s economic development in the recent decades,” Itau CEO Candido Bracher said in a statement. Sergio Rial, CEO of Banco Santander Brasil SA (SANB11.SA), said Brandao “led the Brazilian financial industry for a long time and left a valuable legacy.” Reporting by Carolina Mandl, Tatiana Bautzer and Gabriela Mello; Editing by Brad Haynes and Bernadette Baum",Reuters

2019,Dam collapse kills at least 15 gold miners in Siberia,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - At least 15 gold miners were killed on Saturday when a dam collapsed, flooding an artisanal mining encampment in a remote part of Siberia, officials said. Heavy rains had weakened the dam and water broke through, sweeping away several cabins where the artisan miners lived, about 160 km (100 miles) south of the city of Krasnoyarsk. President Vladimir Putin ordered all necessary measures to be taken to help those affected, to identify the cause of the disaster and prevent any impact on a nearby residential area, Interfax quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying. Russia is one of the world’s top gold producers with most of its output coming from large professional industrial mines. However, alluvial production, which is usually operated by small firms, still contributes some of the country’s gold. Alluvial or artisanal gold mining in Russia is usually small-scale, but is still conducted by officially registered firms which are supposed to abide by health and safety rules. Krasnoyarsk officials said in a statement that water released by the dam partially flooded two dormitories of the rotational camp in which 74 people lived, adding that 13 people were still missing. A Russian investigative committee said it had launched a criminal probe into violation of safety rules at the gold mining spot, while local authorities said the collapsed dam was not registered by official bodies. Interfax said the miners were part of Siberian privately-held Sibzoloto, which unites several artisanal mining teams. Sibzoloto was not immediately available for comment. Sibzoloto produced about 3 tonnes of gold in 2018, Sergei Kashuba, the head of Russia’s Gold Industrialists’ Union, a non-government producers’ lobby group, told Reuters. Sibzoloto is not a member of the union, he added. Russia produced 314 tonnes of gold in 2018.

2019,"Nissan on gradual recovery path, incoming CEO Uchida tells staff","BEIJING (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co’s incoming chief executive Makoto Uchida told employees on Friday that his mission is to “restore business performance and regain trust in Nissan”. “Nissan is on the right path for recovery ... although it might be a gradual process,” Uchida, who is Nissan’s China chief, said in a video message posted on an internal company website. Someone who saw the video made details of it available to Reuters. Uchida is expected to formally take up the CEO post by Jan. 1, 2020. His appointment was announced in early October, along with decisions by the board of Japan’s second-biggest automaker (7201.T) to name Mitsubishi Motors (7211.T) executive Ashwani Gupta chief operating officer and Nissan executive Jun Seki vice chief operating officer. The three will take the helm of a company that has been shaken by turmoil following the downfall of former chairman Carlos Ghosn last year and the departure of former CEO Hiroto Saikawa last month. Nissan’s profits have nearly evaporated and its business has weakened globally but especially in the United States. To restore profitability, the Yokohama-based automaker is in the process of laying off some 12,500 employees globally and is trying to mend frayed ties with its alliance partner, Renault SA (RENA.PA). Following various internal meetings, Uchida told employees in the video he was convinced that Nissan was on the right path for recovery, though it might be a gradual process. “However, please understand that I cannot do it alone,” he said. “The most important thing right now is to have trust and full contribution from each one of you.” Uchida said he was poised to use all his experience to turn the company around, which he stressed also “will include the building of alliance partnerships”. In picking Uchida as the new global head of Nissan, the company’s board has chosen an executive known internally for close ties to top shareholder Renault and for a frank, straight-talking manner that has marked him as an outsider. According to one long-time associate, who spoke on condition of anonymity, Uchida is known for his unflagging work ethic and relentless focus on cost control. The source described Uchida as direct and to the point in conversations, a “foreigner with a Japanese face”. Uchida joined the car maker mid-career in 2003, a rarity in a country where top executives usually spend their entire working lives at the same company.

2019,Libyan government raises commercial price for kerosene as first step in reforms,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libya’s internationally recognized government said on Wednesday it was sharply increasing the price of kerosene for industrial and commercial use as a first step to reform costly fuel subsidies and tackle smuggling. The price will rise to 0.85 Libyan dinars ($0.6) per liter, which is also the production cost, the economy ministry of the Tripoli-based government said in a decree published online. The price of kerosene for domestic use would remain at the old level of 0.15 dinars “until the lifting of the in-kind subsidy and its replacement with a cash subsidy for other products like petrol and diesel, which will be issued soon,” it said. “The aim of this decision is primarily to combat the smuggling of this substance, which is purchased at the subsidized price and smuggled abroad,” the ministry said in an additional statement shared with Reuters. Oil-rich Libya has some of the world’s most generous fuel subsidies, leading to rampant smuggling within the country and across its borders. The illicit trade has benefited criminal networks that have flourished during years of political and armed conflict since the North African country’s 2011 uprising. Reforming the subsidies and replacing them with a cash payment is part of a package of economic reforms long promised by the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA). Armed forces aligned with the GNA are currently locked in a battle with factions linked to a rival administration based in eastern Libya. The eastern-based forces launched an offensive against the capital in April. The statement from the Tripoli ministry noted that kerosene was distributed through the Brega fuel distribution unit, a subsidiary of the state-run National Oil Corporation (NOC), but made no reference to a row over control of Brega. Libya’s oil and gas industry, which earns almost all the North African country’s income, is run by the NOC in Tripoli, an institution that key foreign powers see as crucial to preventing Libya’s divisions from deepening. Eastern authorities recently set up a parallel board at Brega after accusing Tripoli of not sending sufficient fuel supplies, especially jet fuel, to areas under its control, a charge strongly denied by NOC. Kerosene is used for jet fuel. Eastern-based factions have tried to market oil independently and have been blocked from doing so by international sanctions, though the row over Brega has presented a new threat to the NOC’s unity. Tim Eaton, a Libya analyst at Chatham House and author of a recent report on fuel subsidies, said singling out kerosene for early reform suggested a connection with the Brega dispute, particularly as the GNA had indicated its economic reforms would have to wait until the conclusion of the current conflict. He also noted that much of the kerosene might be going to the internal black market, where the subsidy cut could push up prices. Editing by Sonya Hepinstall",Reuters
2019,NextEra Energy's quarterly profit rises 12% as investments pay off,"(Reuters) - NextEra Energy Inc (NEE.N), the world’s largest producer of wind and solar energy, reported a 12% rise in profit on Tuesday as its investment in electric utility Florida Power & Light Company paid off and it cut costs at the recently-acquired Gulf Power. The Florida Power & Light unit, which serves more than 5 million customers in Florida, reported net income of $683 million in the quarter, up 4.4% from a year earlier. Juno Beach, Florida-headquartered NextEra said its cost cuts at and investment in Gulf Power remain on track. NextEra Energy Resources, the company’s subsidiary which uses renewable sources such as wind and solar to generate energy, added 1,375 megawatts of renewables projects, bringing the total to 12,300 megawatts.

2019,Spanish coders harness tech to track health risks for firefighters,"BARCELONA (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - As fires gobble up forests from California to the Amazon, a small team of volunteers based in Barcelona is hoping to deploy cutting-edge technology at home and further afield to protect the health of those on the frontline: the firefighters. After winning a global coding challenge backed by tech giant IBM in New York last weekend, they will receive financial and technical support to deploy more widely their open-source application, named Prometeo after the Greek god of fire Prometheus. The system uses artificial intelligence and the internet of things to help keep firefighters safe using a device the size of a smartphone that is strapped to their arms. It has sensors that monitor temperature, smoke concentration and humidity in real-time, and can send colour-coded alerts via a Cloud platform to command centres. That information can then be used to pull firefighters out if the situation gets too dangerous, as well as tracking their long-term exposure. “What we are doing here is taking care of the health of firefighters, and we hope that with our project we will be able to... get a better life expectancy (for them),” said Josep Ràfols, an IT worker who leads the Prometeo development team. He said the goal was to help realise the dream of veteran Catalan firefighter Joan Herrera, who had struggled to find a way to track the rising health risks facing his profession. Herrera - after suffering headaches and breathing problems from smoke inhalation, and seeing other firefighters die in his arms - launched an effort over a decade ago with emergency nurse Vicenç Ferrés Padró to collect data by following teams in the field. But new IT devices and technology mean that painstaking task can now be done more cheaply and efficiently, said Ràfols. As the threat of forest fires intensifies on a warming planet, firefighters are being called in to battle bigger and more frequent blazes everywhere from Spain to Brazil. U.N. disaster risk reduction chief Mami Mizutori, one of the IBM competition’s judges, said authorities in Europe had recorded more than 2,000 wildfires so far this year, three times higher than the average over the past decade. “It’s more important than ever that we do everything we can to protect firefighters, as they risk their lives to protect us,” she said in a statement on the award. In 2019, “Call for Code” - a five-year, $30-million philanthropic project - focused on creating solutions to ease the impacts of disasters and enable first responders to better support survivors. Daniel Krook, chief technology officer of the IBM Code and Response initiative, said it would work with Prometeo to make the open-source technology available to firefighting teams across Europe, North and South America, and Australia. The application stood out among the other entries, from 165 countries, because it could make “a direct impact on the lives of the people addressing the natural disaster”, and could be deployed fast at a large scale, Krook told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Ràfols, who has worked on Prometeo on a pro bono basis with two other IT services specialists, said the plan was to talk to Catalan authorities about rolling it out there first. The region has experienced very dry weather in recent years, he noted, and will need “happy and healthy” firefighters both to battle wildfires and prevent them with controlled burning. “We are IT guys... maybe not the typical heroes that fight fires or chase criminals, so we decided to do what we know how to do,” he said. “It is the only way that we can contribute.” Reporting by Megan Rowling @meganrowling; editing by Laurie Goering.

2019,"Vertex prices cystic fibrosis combo treatment at $311,000-per-year","(Reuters) - Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc has priced its three-drug combination for cystic fibrosis (CF) at $311,503 per year, after winning early U.S. approval on Monday. Shares of the drugmaker, which also raised its 2019 sales forecast for CF products, were up 3% in after-hours trading. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, which comes five months ahead of the agency’s previously announced action date, greatly expands the percentage of cystic fibrosis patients that Vertex can treat. The drugmaker boosted its guidance range for CF products sales to between $3.70 billion and $3.75 billion, from $3.60 billion to $3.70 billion. The treatment, Trikafta, is a combination of three drugs that target a defective protein responsible for the life-threatening disease that causes the build up of thick mucus in body parts such as the lungs and digestive tract. (bit.ly/2MxqCrJ) Trikafta is the first approved treatment that is effective for patients 12 years and older, who have a genetic mutation which affects 90% of CF patients or roughly 27,000 people in the United States, the agency said. The backbone drugs in Trikafta are ivacaftor and tezacaftor, which make up Vertex’s previously approved CF drug Symdeko. Ivacaftor is also sold as a standalone treatment, Kalydeco, and is part of another double combination CF product called Orkambi. Trikafta improved lung function by around 14% in clinical trials, compared with a roughly 3% improvement in patients treated with Orkambi. Orkambi has a list price of around $272,000 per year, while Symdeko lists at around $292,000. Analysts expect the early approval to accelerate the launch date for Trikafta, which they expect will make $630 million in 2020. However, the approval comes at a time when the drugmaker has been receiving push back from healthcare payers for the price of its existing CF therapies. England’s government-run healthcare system has been holding out on agreeing to pay for Vertex’s Orkambi on the grounds that the price that Vertex is demanding from the country is too high. The rebates that Vertex offered in the negotiations have not been publicly disclosed. CF is a chronic, progressive, and frequently fatal genetic disease, primarily affecting the respiratory and digestive systems in children and young adults.

2019,'Broken system' starves U.S. oil boom of immigrant workers,"HOBBS, N.M. (Reuters) - New Mexico oil man Johnny Vega laid out his predicament as his crew hoisted pipes from a well during the biggest oil boom in U.S. history. The son of a Mexican guestworker, Vega cannot find enough legal workers to meet demand for his oil well service rigs. There is no shortage of Hispanic and Latino immigrant workers without work permits he could hire in Lea County, New Mexico - the No.2 oil-producing county in the United States. But Vega says he wants to play by the rules, not least because of a heightened risk of company audits by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) under President Donald Trump. As a result, he has equipment that could be generating $700,000 a month standing idle in his yard. “They’re demanding more rigs, more swabbing units, but you don’t have enough employees,” said Vega, who runs Mico Services with around $17 million in annual revenues. “It’s a lack of a system to get legal workers, to have more of a workforce to pull from.” Employers like Vega in the Permian Basin oilfields of New Mexico and Texas say they feel caught between Trump’s support for their industry and his policies focused on tougher immigration enforcement. It’s a dilemma faced in other sectors of the U.S. economy that depend on foreign workers after ICE reported surges of between 300% to 750% in worksite investigations, audits and arrests in fiscal year 2018. Visas for temporary jobs in sectors like agriculture and hospitality have increased during the Trump administration. Oil companies complain of difficulties gaining work permits for immigrant oil workers, who do not qualify for these temporary visas. The Permian Basin, by far the most productive oil field in the United States, has helped make the country a net exporter of oil. Its output growth has recently slowed, but production is still at all time highs. The number of rigs drilling for oil in New Mexico hit a record 115 in early October and labor shortages are felt most keenly in service companies like Vega’s that help keep the oil flowing. The Permian Basin is short 15,000 workers, with demand met by paying overtime and shipping workers in and out, according to data from the Permian Strategic Partnership alliance of 19 energy companies. Thousands of immigrants, mainly from neighboring Mexico, have thronged to the decade-long boom. They often fill the hardest and most dangerous jobs few Americans want, such as using heavy equipment to lift oil well tubing or lay pipeline. For Bob Reid, immigrants provide a solution to labor shortages and a chance for boom-bust oil towns like Hobbs, New Mexico to build a more stable future. “The problem is a broken system that’s preventing them from coming in legally in a way that allows them to pursue a path to citizenship,” said Reid, head of the JF Maddox Foundation, a Hobbs charity. In Lea County, Hispanics and Latinos now account for as much as 70 percent of the population, compared with 40 percent 20 years ago, based on county school enrollment and other data. About two years ago, ICE stepped up operations in the Permian area, according to Lea County employers. “I know people, my peers, that have been hit by immigration audits, and they were told, specifically, that the Permian Basin was targeted because of the vast amount of workers that were coming here,” said Finn Smith, president of Hobbs-based Watson Hopper Inc. ICE did not respond to requests for comment on its Permian operations. Two companies in Hobbs, the largest city in Lea County, were recently audited: Mesa Well Services and paving contractor Ramirez & Sons, according to a person with knowledge of the situation and a Ramirez & Sons official. Mesa Well officials were not available for comment. Ramirez & Sons Senior Superintendent David Gallegos said the company was paying around $40,000 in legal fees to apply for work permits or U.S. citizenship on behalf of five of the employees laid off after the audit. “They’re worth fighting for,” said Gallegos, a Republican New Mexico state representative, of the “long term” employees who had bought homes in the area. ICE operations, and Trump’s threats of raids, have left many immigrants in Lea County fearful. Some bolt from job sites at rumors of ICE activity, said Maria Romano of New Mexico-based immigrant rights group Somos Un Pueblo Unido. More companies are using the government’s E-Verify immigration background checks to vet new hires, said Romano, whose organization helps immigrants get on a pathway to citizenship. “It’s now getting very difficult here for anyone who isn’t documented,” said Juan, an unemployed pipeline worker who immigrated to the United States illegally 11 years ago. He asked that his last name not be used to protect his identity. About a third of all immigrants in New Mexico and Texas lack valid working papers, according to a Pew Research Center study based on 2016 U.S. census data. Hobbs Mayor Sam Cobb says he is frustrated by the failure of political leaders at the national level to create a pathway to citizenship for immigrants he generally finds hardworking and law abiding. “The very people who have suffered from that are the people who are here growing our community, adding to the economic welfare of the community,” said Cobb, a Democrat, sitting in his office surrounded by paintings of oil wells and cowboys. Yet plenty of employers in Lea County still hire undocumented workers. “What we do is we don’t ask,” said Lorena, a Mexican immigrant whose family has built up a small oil field services business. She estimated that more than 90% of her employees were Mexican immigrants and that only 5% to 10% had genuine working papers. Her last name was not used to protect her identity. Vega’s labor woes are pushing him to reorient his oil well service business toward hiring out his equipment. “We have to rely on some of these immigrants, in this neck of the woods, to produce the workforce that we’re needing,” said Vega, who said he supports Trump “100%” but wishes he would “tone down” his rhetoric against immigrants. “Why not allow them to be documented?” Reporting By Andrew Hay in Hobbs, New Mexico; Additional reporting by Gary McWilliams in Houston; Editing by Bill Tarrant and Daniel Wallis",Reuters
2019,India's Reliance reaps record profit from consumer-facing growth,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian oil-to-telecoms conglomerate Reliance Industries (RELI.NS) said strong growth in its consumer-facing businesses lifted second quarter net profit by 18.3% year-on-year to a record total. Consolidated net profit rose to 112.62 billion Indian rupees ($1.58 billion) in the three months ended Sept. 30, the country’s largest company by market value said on Friday. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 111.71 billion rupees, according to Refinitiv data. “The company has reported a record net profit for the quarter,” Reliance’s billionaire Chairman Mukesh Ambani said, adding that the results also reflect the rapid scale-up of its consumer businesses. Its telecom business, Jio, posted operating revenue of 123.54 billion rupees, while revenue at its organized retail business jumped to 412.02 billion rupees. The consumer business rose to represent 33% of Reliance’s overall operating profit, almost on par with its refining arm for the first time, Joint CFO V Srikanth told a press briefing, underscoring Ambani’s shift towards retail and technology. Meanwhile, gross refining margin, profit earned on each barrel of crude oil processed, was reported at $9.4 per barrel. This is higher than the previous quarter, but a whisker below $9.5 per barrel posted in the same quarter of last year. Reliance runs a 1.4-million barrels per day (bpd) refining complex in western India. As new marine fuel regulations are set to kick in next year, more vessels are opting for diesel, pushing up prices of the fuel and benefiting refiners. Reliance has invested billions of dollars in the last few years to boost its income from consumer-facing businesses as it looks to bring it on par with traditional refining and petrochemicals business. “Our investment cycle is now coming to an end with all the projects in our energy business close to completion and the major investments in our network for our digital business also being made,” CFO Alok Agarwal said separately. Jio’s net profit jumped 45.4% to 9.9 billion rupees because it added some 24 million customers during the quarter. Its retail operations continued on a strong growth trajectory and posted an earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of 20.35 billion rupees, the company said. Reliance has not decided what its effective tax rate will be after India’s corporate tax cut last month, Srikanth said, adding it is not seeing too many “headwinds” in retail, despite Indian economic growth being at around six-year lows.

2019,"PRECIOUS-Gold steady as trade optimism ebbs, palladium hits record high","(Adds details, updates prices) * Palladium hits record high of $1,726.74/oz By Karthika Suresh Namboothiri Oct 15 (Reuters) - Gold held steady on Tuesday as optimism surrounding U.S.-China trade talks faded and investors awaited the outcome of crucial discussions that will determine how Britain leaves the European Union, while deficit-hit palladium touched a record high. Spot gold edged down 0.1% to $1,490.70 per ounce as of 0711 GMT. U.S. gold futures were 0.2% lower at $1,494.80 per ounce. “Markets enjoyed a good risk-on rally, but on Monday news came out saying that China required more negotiation and talks before they find any deal, which is very disappointing,” said Margaret Yang Yan, a market analyst at CMC Markets. A Bloomberg report on Monday, citing sources, said China wants more talks as soon as the end of October to hammer out the details of U.S. President Donald Trump’s phase 1 deal before Chinese President Xi Jinping agrees to sign it. Sombre data from China reinforced the case for Beijing to unveil further stimulus as manufacturing cools on weak demand and U.S. trade pressures. China’s factory gate prices declined at the fastest pace in more than three years in September. Late on Friday, the United States outlined the first phase of a trade deal and suspended this week’s scheduled tariff hikes on Chinese goods, but existing tariffs remained in place and officials on both sides said much more work was needed before an accord could be agreed. Asian stocks and Wall Street futures inched higher as some investors held out hope that Britain still had a chance to avoid a messy exit from the European Union. Officials from Britain and the EU will meet at a make-or-break summit on Thursday and Friday that will determine whether Britain is headed for a so-called no-deal Brexit. “The Brexit narrative seems to be playing as a basic risk on/off catalyst, with echoes into bond yields driving near-term gold swings,” said Ilya Spivak, a senior currency strategist at DailyFx. “The markets remain priced for a far more dovish Fed outlook than the central bank has signed up for.” The U.S. Federal Reserve will meet later in the month and the markets are on the lookout for signs the central bank will cut interest rates, earlier than the expected December cut. Palladium jumped to a peak of $1,726.74 an ounce. Concerns that supply of the metal used in car exhaust systems could run out has helped lift prices more than 36% this year. Silver dropped 0.2% to $17.61 per ounce and platinum declined 0.1% to $891.77. (Reporting by Karthika Suresh Namboothiri in Bengaluru; Editing by Dale Hudson)",Reuters
2019,Merkel ally under police protection after 'Heil Hitler' death threat,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German police said on Monday they were protecting the leader of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives in the eastern state of Thuringia, which holds an election in six days, after he received a death threat that ended “Heil Hitler!”. Mike Mohring said suspected neo-Nazi extremists threatened to stab him in the neck or attack one of his rallies with a car bomb if he did not stop campaigning for the Oct. 27 regional election. The message, in an email sent on Saturday, concluded with the greeting “Sieg Heil and Heil Hitler”! It was signed by the “Musicians of the State Coup Orchestra”, who described themselves as a “group of globally connected right-wing extremists”. Police and intelligence agencies are under pressure to take action against right-wing extremists after an anti-Semitic neo-Nazi militant killed two people earlier this month in attacks on a synagogue and a kebab restaurant in the eastern city Halle. A police spokeswoman said the serious crime unit in Thuringia was investigating the death threat against Mohring. Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) are vying for second place with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) in the Thuringia election, where polls also show the ruling far-left Linke party will come first. The AfD in Thuringia is led by Bjoern Hoecke, an anti-immigrant former history teacher who has drawn criticism from Jewish leaders and mainstream politicians for calling Berlin’s Holocaust memorial a “monument of shame” and demanding that schools highlight German suffering in World War Two. Jewish leaders and politicians said after the attacks in Halle that the AfD’s anti-immigrant rhetoric was contributing to an atmosphere of hate that encouraged political violence. The Halle attacks and the deadly shooting of pro-immigration CDU politician Walter Luebcke in June by a far-right extremist have exposed the need for more security and judicial measures against individuals plotting political violence. “This is a warning and there will not be a second one,” read the email sent to Mohring from an address ending @hitler.rocks. “This applies to all the leftist and ecological pussies out there, we will enslave you first and then exterminate you.” Reporting by Joseph Nasr; Editing by Angus MacSwan",Reuters

2019,China's factory prices post steepest fall in three years,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s factory gate prices declined at their fastest pace in more than three years in September, reinforcing the case for Beijing to unveil further stimulus as manufacturing cools on weak demand and U.S. trade pressures. The producer price index (PPI), considered a key barometer of corporate profitability, dropped 1.2% year-on-year in September, National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data showed on Tuesday. That marked the steepest decline since July 2016 but matched forecasts in a Reuters survey of analysts. In contrast, China’s consumer prices rose at their fastest pace in almost six years driven mostly by the surge in pork prices as African swine fever ravaged the country’s hog herds. However, core retail inflation pressures remain modest, giving policymakers room to introduce measures to prop up demand. “We continue to anticipate further loosening in the next few quarters as demand-side pressures remain muted and factory-gate deflation deepens,” Martin Lynge Rasmussen, China Economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note. The grim outlook is unlikely to change even as tensions in the year-long trade war between Beijing and Washington have eased somewhat. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday the two sides had reached agreement on the first phase of a deal and suspended a tariff hike, but officials said much work still needed to be done. Weak prices were mainly seen in oil and raw material sectors. PPI deflation could deepen due to weakening domestic demand, falling energy and raw material prices and the value-added tax cut that became effective in April this year, analysts at Nomura said. Some analysts expect China’s GDP growth rate to slip below 6% in the third quarter. The government has set a growth target of 6.0%-6.5% this year. Trade data released on Monday showed contractions in both exports and imports as U.S. tariffs implemented on Sept. 1 came into effect, underscoring the continued impact of the bilateral dispute. China has taken a cautious approach in dealing with the slowing economy. Stimulus to date has largely avoided dramatic increases in government spending and the central bank has also mainly used the reserve requirement ratio for banks instead of sweeping interest rate cuts. Chinese central bank governor Yi Gang said late in September there was no urgent need to implement large interest rate cuts following Beijing’s reiteration that it would not use “flood-like” stimulus measures. Analysts say they expect greater stimulus measures at the end of the month, however, when China’s Politburo, the top decision making political body, is expected to meet. “Since there is very limited policy autonomy at ministries, local governments, and SOEs (state-owned enterprises), the policy decision pass-through has to come from the above,” said analysts last week in a note from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The People’s Bank of China cut a reserve ratio for banks in September, freeing up $126 bln for loans. Data released by NBS Tuesday showed China’s consumer price index (CPI) rose 3% from a year earlier, higher than 2.9% tipped by analysts and marking the fastest increase since October 2013, when it rose 3.2%. While September’s data showed headline inflation at China’s official target of around 3% and core CPI growing a benign 1.5%, food costs continue to soar, driven mainly by rising pork prices as African swine fever diminishes hog supplies. A 69.3% surge in pork prices in September year-on-year pushed the food price index up 11.2%, accelerating from 10% in the previous month. In August, pork prices rose 46.7% from a year earlier. China has been fighting the devastating African swine fever and has implemented a series of policies to try to replenish its herds, including flying in 900 breeding pigs from Denmark. Many analysts still expect pork prices to trend higher in the coming months as the disease spreads and hog stocks get slashed, despite a flurry of government measures to ramp up supply to the market. But few expect that would have a material impact on China’s monetary policy-making for now. “We do not think the pork-price-driven CPI inflation will have a significant impact on the PBoC’s monetary policy stance, as the pork price inflation was caused by a supply shock rather than a monetary phenomenon,” said analysts at Nomura.

2019,Russia's Yandex releases rival to China's TikTok app,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian internet firm Yandex on Monday released a short video app for fashion and style that it hopes will compete with China’s TikTok app. The Yandex app is called Sloy, the Russian word for layer, the company said in a statement. It is currently only available in App Store in Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan.
