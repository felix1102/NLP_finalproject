2017,Variety: Acrostic,"Wordplay VARIETY PUZZLE — How do you solve an acrostic, if this is your first time diving into one of these puzzles? Elementary, my dear solver, especially if you are solving online, which I highly recommend. You begin by scanning the clue list for things you know, like CAPOTE for “Author of a 1966 ‘true crime novel,’” or FISHEYE for “Wide-angle, as lenses go.” You can put in CLUB for “Sandwich with many synonyms,” but the answer is really HERO. “What makes a man?” is wordplay for Y CHROMOSOME, which may be true from a biological standpoint, but is not a terribly inclusive way of saying it. I’m sure our friends in the transgender community would argue that point. Once you have a few gimmes in place, look at the grid — which now has some letters from your gimmes filled in — and see if you can complete some of the shorter words. _T has to be “IT” or “AT.” __R has to be “OR.” As you fill these in using context and process of elimination, note that some of the letters are being filled in next to the clues below to help you solve them. That’s what acrostic solvers call “toggling” between the grid and the clues, and this is what will help you solve the entire puzzle so you can read the acrostic quote. Let’s hear from our constructors: The Sherlock Holmes stories generate lovely acrostic-length passages. In December 2000 we featured this from “His Last Bow”: “His incredible untidiness, his addiction to music at strange hours, his … revolver practice within doors, his weird … scientific experiments, and the atmosphere of … danger … around him … made him the very worst tenant in London.” And as recently as 2014 we lifted this from “The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual”: “Although … methodical … [he] keeps his cigars in the coal-scuttle, his tobacco in the toe end of a Persian slipper, and his unanswered correspondence transfixed by a jack-knife into the very center of his wooden mantelpiece.” Now we’ll give the old sleuth a break for a spell.

2017,Variety: Acrostic,"Wordplay VARIETY PUZZLE — One of the things I love most about solving Emily Cox and Henry Rathvon’s acrostics is getting a peek at their reading list. It’s a fascinating mixture of topics, but I particularly love it when they read about science or history. Most of the time, I wind up researching the book from which their acrostic quote is derived and falling down a huge rabbit hole of books to put on my own list. Today’s book by science writer Zeeya Merali, “A Big Bang in a Little Room: The Quest to Create New Universes,” definitely falls into the “must read” category. I’m old enough to remember the “snow” between channels on my television, and my fascination with what existed in those netherworlds where there were faint glimpses of shows I couldn’t watch. With the advent of remote controls and digital programming, is it still possible to see that “snow”? I don’t believe so. And even more fascinating is this theory she presents that “one percent of that snow was actually radiation left over from the Big Bang”! How does that work? I guess I’ll have to read the book to find out. I don’t know what this says about me, but my gimmes were BEAR HUG, TWEETY, LOW TOP, GANACHE, AGNEW and REEFER. Today I learned that the winner of the INDY 500 race is given a bottle of milk to drink. I had AMIABLE before AFFABLE at entry K. All in all, a very nice mental tug-of-war with Ms. Cox and Mr. Rathvon, and I learned some new stuff. You can’t ask for more than that. Let’s hear from our constructors: It’s comforting to know there’s some radiation left over from the Big Bang. We would hate to waste it all. But then, couldn’t we say that everything is left over from the Big Bang? The same stuff just reinvents itself. Why, just the other day two neutron stars collided, and they spewed out all manner of heavy elements including gold — lots of gold, more gold than a thousand pirates of the Caribbean could carry. It was in the news. So let’s hear it for neutron stars! Your thoughts?",The New York Times
2017,Variety: Puns and Anagrams,"Wordplay VARIETY PUZZLE — Sam Ezersky is quickly growing on me as a puzzle maker, and I’m not saying this just because he sits next to me at work and allows me free access to his candy stash. Every constructor leaves a stylistic fingerprint on their puzzles, and I like Mr. Ezersky’s playful way with a clue. This is evident in today’s Puns and Anagrams, which is Mr. Ezersky’s second to be published (his debut PandA is here.) Not only does Mr. Ezersky use a variety of cluing types, which one would expect in a PandA, but the topics he covers are fun: solvers will encounter board games (L SEVEN for “Battleship”), animals at the zoo (OCELOTS), Egyptian goddesses (ISIS) and even made-up campaign slogans for rock stars (ELECTRIC). I also like the fact that he is not afraid to get corny. At 52A, the clue “Break __ (get d’party going)” for DICE (or “D ICE”) will elicit a grin. And I admire some of his catches: If you move the “S” to the front of EXCHANGES (15D), you get SEX CHANGE. A “Treatment in which beauticians dampen eyes” is MANI PEDI because that word contains two eyes (I’s) and an anagram of DAMPEN. That’s very cool. That will get you started, and I hope you’ll give this one a try, if you haven’t already. It’s a fun diversion for your weekend. Your thoughts?",The New York Times
2017,Variety: Split Decisions,"Wordplay VARIETY PUZZLE — Fred Piscop is one of the best in the business, so my eyes lit up when I heard that this weekend’s variety would be one of his signature Split Decision puzzles. Mr. Piscop sharpens our pattern recognition abilities with each construction, which I think is crucial to solving normal crossword puzzles, especially when the cluing is difficult. The best bit of advice I have about today’s puzzle is to be wary before entering letters to shorter word splits, and to instead search for unusual letter blends that bear less possibilities. For instance, take the seven-letter answer with the split ?MI????/?FF????. We know that the first letter must be a vowel, for no consonants can precede two Fs, and that the fourth letter is most likely a vowel as well. With these constraints, we can eventually deduce that the split is AMIABLE/AFFABLE. However, when the split is shorter, as with ?IX/?AY, it is important to keep all possibilities open where appropriate. Sure, S works well, but so do M, N, F and perhaps P. When ARSENAL/ARSENIC in the top-left corner becomes obvious, then the N will be filled in correctly, but until then, it’s best to refrain from guessing without some sort of logic behind it. Today I learned that POTPIES can be written as a single word, and that CODFISH and COMMISH are only two letters apart. As an avid fantasy football league manager, I enjoyed seeing the latter — the colloquial term for “commissioner” — in a New York Times puzzle. Your thoughts?",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Vary the Minimum Wage by Region?,"Letters To the Editor: Re “A Smarter Minimum Wage” (Op-Ed, Nov. 18): Jonathan Cowan and Jim Kessler’s argument for a regionally tiered minimum wage is poor policy that would leave too many workers behind. The minimum wage rates they recommend — an average of $10.90 initially for most regions of the United States and just $9.25 in lower-cost parts of rural America — are far too low and would not reach $15 an hour until about 2032 for most of the United States, and 2041 in rural America (assuming 2 percent annual inflation). While the $15 wage movement started in cities like Seattle and New York, paychecks have been flat all across America, and cost-of-living data show that in all 50 states single workers will need $15 an hour in just a few years to afford the basics. Beyond living costs, regional wage differences in low-paying industries have been declining, with the result that home health aides and waitresses in New Jersey today earn just a little more than they do in Mississippi. Our national economy therefore needs a strong and uniform national wage floor to lift workers across the country — and prevent a race to the bottom. PAUL K. SONN, NEW YORK The writer is general counsel at the National Employment Law Project. To the Editor: Jonathan Cowan and Jim Kessler correctly identify a serious problem with the national minimum wage: The cost of living varies greatly depending on where you live. However, their proposal for different minimum wages in a country with “hundreds of different micro-economies” is not only exceedingly complex but also avoids the fundamental question: Why have a minimum wage at all? The New York Times itself opined in a 1987 editorial, “The Right Minimum Wage: $0.00,” that the minimum wage prices the working poor out of the job market. It still does. But it’s also about choice. Shouldn’t adults have the freedom to decide the price at which they are willing to exchange their labor with other adults? If we are pro-choice, we should be supporting the right of adults to make choices in all aspects of their lives, personal and economic. ANDREW TERHUNE, PHILADELPHIA To the Editor: The interesting proposal by Jonathan Cowan and Jim Kessler misses an important point. Even in Oklahoma City, where a simple breakfast at a diner costs only $5.79, and in Fargo, N.D., where a dozen eggs costs only 93 cents, a wage of $15 an hour doesn’t go very far. The system we have now is not very different from the reasonable but complicated system that Mr. Cowan and Mr. Kessler propose. We now have a national minimum wage, and cities and regions where costs are higher are free to set their minimums higher. We need a $15 federal minimum wage because $15 is the minimum that a worker anywhere in the country should be paid. Cities and regions where the cost of living is more expensive will still be free to set higher minimums. The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour is a national disgrace. It was not sufficient when that rate was set in 2009. Doubling the minimum is right. And high-cost cities like New York and Seattle will want to go higher. The bigger national disgrace is the discrepancy in income between low-wage workers and the plutocrats. Nobody is thinking about setting a maximum income for the people at the very top. But at least we can use the concept of the minimum wage to take a small step toward reducing the outrageous disparity between the highest and the lowest incomes by making sure that everywhere in the country someone with a job will have enough to live on.

2017,Vast Indigenous Land Claims in Canada Encompass Parliament Hill,"PIKWAKANAGAN FIRST NATION, Ontario — Whenever Prime Minister Justin Trudeau or his cabinet ministers speak in certain parts of Ontario or Quebec, they begin by acknowledging they are on “unceded Algonquin territory.” That recognition is just one of the ways Mr. Trudeau’s government has been trying to signal a top priority: righting the wrongs Canada has done to indigenous people, especially over land that aboriginals say was taken from them unjustly. But finding common ground on this issue has proved to be one of Mr. Trudeau’s most difficult policy initiatives, and critics say efforts to resolve the land disputes have bogged down. But both sides agree on the importance of sorting out the claims. “The process of negotiating land claims should be an absolute pillar of reconciliation,” said Ken Coates, a historian at the University of Saskatchewan who studies treaties and is a consultant to indigenous groups. “This is our chance to get it right and if we don’t — boy, when will we get the chance again?” Of the many issues dividing Canada’s federal and provincial governments from its indigenous people, land claims are among the most symbolically important and economically consequential, often involving vast amounts of territory. Some claims involve hundreds of millions of dollars, and tribes are often interested in controlling the land at issue, by, for example, having a say over logging, oil exploration and mining. One claim by various Algonquin groups involves the 8.9 million acres of the Ottawa watershed — which includes Canada’s Parliament buildings and Supreme Court. The government thought it had settled that claim in principle a year ago, but it has ended up in litigation anyway. The claims are legally thorny, often requiring historians, archaeologists, geographers and geologists to give evidence sometimes stretching back before recorded history to support, or challenge, them. In some regions, land may have been occupied by different indigenous groups at different times, even changing hands after battles that were unrecorded. These groups may all assert rights, and claims can overlap. Then there is the problem of treaties. Some indigenous groups, like the Algonquins, never signed treaties giving up their land. The government says it is talking with about 140 indigenous groups in that situation. Others did sign treaties, and a government tribunal that deals with treaty disputes has 72 cases and is so overwhelmed that it cannot estimate how long it will take to resolve them. The result is that settlement negotiations occur at a frustratingly slow pace. “Because there’s so many cases that haven’t been dealt with over the years, there’s been such a big backlog, it’s going to take years,” said Regional Chief Craig Makinaw of the Assembly of First Nations, the country’s largest indigenous organization. “Nothing’s really moved.” But a few claims have been resolved. After 20 years of talks, Parliament in 2014 approved a deal with the Tla’amin First Nation, involving land along the coast north of Vancouver. It gave the members of this indigenous group ownership of about 21,000 acres, upfront payments of 42 million Canadian dollars and then annual compensation of more than 700,000 Canadian dollars for resources, like lumber, harvested from the land. The Supreme Court of Canada ruled last year that the Métis, people of indigenous and European ancestry, could also assert land claims in areas where they have traditionally lived. About a month later, Carolyn Bennett, the minister in charge of negotiations with indigenous groups, formally committed the government to settle with the Métis of Manitoba, who were promised about 2,150 square miles of land 147 years ago. That claim includes the city of Winnipeg, although the Manitoba Métis leadership has said that it does not intend to take land now owned by others. Ultimately, government land outside of the city will likely be transferred. Sabrina Williams, the spokeswoman for Ms. Bennett, said the government is trying its best to find a way to sort out the claims. “We believe that we need to do more to be able to construct a relationship that has never before been achieved with success,” she said. But Chief Makinaw, a Cree from Alberta, says the government’s figures for outstanding claims are understated and its processes fossilized. And other indigenous leaders are critical that the government has not set aside money indigenous groups say they need to assume control over their land after claims are settled. “This government is good at talking a lot but not very strong on action,” said Chief Jean Guy Whiteduck of Kitigan Zibi, an Algonquin reserve in Quebec about 70 miles north of Ottawa. Of all the outstanding land issues, the Algonquin claims involving the Ottawa watershed, a huge swath of territory in eastern Ontario and western Quebec, are perhaps the most complex in the country. The land conflict there started for the Algonquins in 1800, when a group of settlers established a town near the Chaudière Falls, just upstream from where Canada’s Parliament now sits. Over the years, the land the Algonquins controlled shrank to just a few reserves. Some groups of Algonquins were left with no land at all. About 25 years ago, Algonquin groups started formal talks with the federal government, and later the province of Ontario, about resolving their claims. Last October, the Algonquins of Ontario, and the provincial and federal governments, reached a land agreement in principle. About 4,000 Algonquins would get 117,000 acres of government-owned land and about 300 million Canadian dollars. They would also have a say over the management of an even larger area of government-owned land. But the Algonquins in Quebec declined to take part in the talks and rejected the deal. They are now in court in Ontario to try to rip up the agreement, and to get more money and an increased role in any future use of the land. “We want to be partners in Canada and not just stay on the reserve,” said Mr. Whiteduck, a former bush plane pilot. An Algonquin leader on the Ottawa side said he regrets the rift and wants to bring Quebec into the agreement. But Kirby Whiteduck (many unrelated Algonquins in the area share surnames), chief of the Pikwakanagan First Nation, west of Ottawa, said he was not prepared to spend years trying to heal the divide. “We don’t want to be sitting here 50, 100 years later when there’s five million people in the territory and just 50 acres of crown land left,” he said. Jean Guy Whiteduck said that even as the Quebec Algonquin push for a different deal, they recognize the reality of European settlement and are not interested in seizing or taxing homes on private property — or displacing politicians on Parliament Hill. But they still appreciate the symbolic importance of the claims in Ottawa. “Our action also includes Parliament and the Supreme Court land because we want to stir it up good to try and get some action from them,” he said. Some of the disputed land ended up in the hands of an Ottawa company, the Windmill Development Group, which is now, along with a financial partner, spending 1.4 billion Canadian dollars on a development project, known as Zibi, that includes condos, offices, restaurants and stores. The property encompasses parts of the banks of the Ottawa River in both Ottawa and Gatineau, Quebec. As a private company building on privately owned land, Windmill has no legal obligation to compensate indigenous groups or negotiate with them. But Jeff Westeinde, a principal at Windmill, believes that even as a private property owner, he has an obligation to reconcile with indigenous communities for past wrongs. “As private citizens I think we should do something,” Mr. Westeinde said. “We committed apartheid, there’s no ifs, ands or buts about it. Success for us will be a community where my Algonquin friends can come down here and say: ‘Yes, that’s my community too.’”",The New York Times
2017,Venezuela Appoints General to Tighten Grip on Oil Industry,"CARACAS, Venezuela — A day after President Nicolás Maduro named a general to lead Venezuela’s beleaguered state-owned oil company, analysts and opposition leaders on Monday described the appointment as a political move that threatened to worsen the country’s misfortunes. Mr. Maduro announced on Sunday that Maj. Gen. Manuel Quevedo would assume control of Petroleos de Venezuela, or Pdvsa, as well as of the oil ministry. As the government wrestles with declining production and crushing debt amid an unrelenting economic crisis, the president cast the appointment as an attack on rampant corruption that has bled Pdvsa of profits and undermined its operations. His opponents, however, described it as Mr. Maduro’s latest effort to purge the company’s leadership and consolidate control over the nation’s vital oil industry. The Maduro administration has arrested about 50 people associated with Pdvsa in the past several months as it has pressed an anti-corruption campaign within the public oil sector. “The time for a new oil revolution has come,” the president declared during a nationally televised broadcast. Opponents and some analysts said the appointment of General Quevedo, who was formerly the housing minister and has no known experience in the oil industry, appeared to be part of a strategy by the widely unpopular president to forestall dissatisfaction within his security forces. Left unchecked, that could threaten his grip on power. General Quevedo joins several current and retired military officials whom Mr. Maduro has named to leadership posts in his government, including a general who was put in charge of the Transportation Ministry on Sunday. General Quevedo replaces two civilians at the oil ministry. “Maduro identifies the military as his security blanket, and his almost five years in office have been marked by the military progressively getting more and more goodies,” said David Smilde, a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America. “He’s basically buying off the military.” Putting General Quevedo in charge of Pdvsa, Mr. Smilde said, is “the maximum expression” of this strategy, “the jewel in the crown.” Reuters reported on Monday that General Quevedo, who will be sworn in on Tuesday, planned to name more military officers to his senior management team. José Guerra, a member of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, said on Twitter that the appointment showed that the country “is in bad hands, that there is no planning for important positions.” The state-owned company has lost some of its most experienced managers through firings, imprisonments and emigration in recent years, and some analysts said that the ceding of control to military officers might accelerate the flight of talent. The reshuffling at the top of Venezuela’s energy sector came a week after Mr. Maduro’s attorney general announced the arrest on corruption charges of the acting president and five senior executives at Citgo, the United States refining subsidiary of Pdvsa. The company has directed its employees to cut costs in half as it faces possible default on billions of dollars in bond debt. Shannon K. O’Neil, a Latin America analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations, said, “Quevedo’s appointment can’t be good for stopping the current production declines.” “What it does is ensure military loyalists are now in charge not just of food distribution but also now of oil — the two main levers of power in Venezuela’s shrinking economy,” she said. “Despite Maduro’s rhetoric, this choice was all about political power and control, not the revitalization of production.” The Maduro administration, seeking to ease Venezuela’s dizzying economic crisis, is trying to restructure Venezuela’s $63 billion in bonds, most of them issued by the government and Pdvsa. Debt payments have helped drain the government’s coffers of foreign currency that might otherwise be used to import food, medicine and other critical imports. Once one of the leading oil producers in the world, Venezuela, despite having the largest oil reserves in the world, has seen its production levels plummet to 1.9 million barrels a day, down from 2.4 million barrels a year ago. Yet Pdvsa still accounts for nearly all of the country’s export earnings and roughly half of government revenues.",The New York Times
2017,"Venezuela Arrests 2 Former Oil Officials, Claiming Corruption","CARACAS, Venezuela — Masked government agents stormed the homes of two former top officials of Venezuela’s state oil company and arrested them on Thursday, a move that the prosecutor heralded as a blow against corruption but that others saw as a political purge to strengthen the country’s president. The accused men, Nelson Martínez and Eulogio del Pino, are the highest-level officials detained in a string of arrests that have shaken the country’s troubled oil giant, Petróleos de Venezuela, and its United States refiner, Citgo. More than 50 people so far have been detained in a widening net of charges from corruption to sabotage. Mr. Martínez, a former oil minister who led the oil company until this week, was detained early Thursday and charged with seeking debt refinancing contracts without getting government approval, said Tarek William Saab, the Venezuelan attorney general. Mr. Del Pino, Mr. Martínez’s predecessor, was arrested on a list of charges that included falsifying production figures and sabotage that resulted in millions of dollars in lost revenues, Mr. Saab said. Mr. Saab described the two men as running “a cartel” that he said “bit by bit was delivering blows to the oil industry and causing national damage.” In a video posted on Mr. Del Pino’s Twitter account and apparently recorded before his arrest, he said he had been the victim of an unjustified attack. Corruption at Venezuela’s state oil company has never been a secret, analysts say. What has changed, many argue, are the fortunes of President Nicolás Maduro, who is seeking to remain in power despite two years of food and medicine shortages and a looming, potentially catastrophic, default on its foreign debt. “Why the focus on this so suddenly?” said David Smilde, a political-science professor who studies Venezuela at Tulane University. “There’s a need to find a scapegoat for the country’s economic crisis.” The Venezuelan government is almost entirely dependent on oil revenues for income, and years of price declines combined with a production collapse at the company has taken a heavy toll. Now Petróleos de Venezuela, known as Pdvsa, is effectively in default on its $26.5 billion in unsecured bonds, and it faces claims of $60 billion in missed payments from contractors and service companies that drill and maintain its fields. Sanctions by the Trump administration are blocking the flow of money to Pdvsa. A disorderly default could prompt bondholders to seize the assets of Citgo. Amid the turmoil, Mr. Maduro appointed Manuel Quevedo, a military general, to lead Pdvsa this week. But far from setting the stage for a turnaround for the company, skeptics said, the move may deepen the company’s woes as it cements the allegiance of the armed forces to Mr. Maduro, allowing the military to profit from Pdvsa’s petrodollars. “Maduro is focused on the challenges of survival,” said Francisco J. Monaldi, a Venezuelan energy expert at Rice University. “This is not a move you make to calm the international markets that Pdvsa will need to reverse the collapse.” Some said the arrest of Mr. Del Pino in particular seemed to be motivated by politics. Mr. Del Pino, like many of the Pdvsa officials arrested recently, was close to Rafael Ramírez, another former top official of the oil company, who has publicly criticized Mr. Maduro this year from his post as Venezuela’s ambassador to the United Nations. On Wednesday, Reuters reported that Mr. Ramírez had been stripped of his post. The government did not confirm the ambassador’s status. “Maduro wants to send a message that there’s no room for political debate,” Mr. Smilde said. Mr. Monaldi said that while the company had not been transparent during the tenures of Mr. Del Pino or Mr. Martínez, transgressions such as filing inflated production figures were most likely ordered by the government itself to improve its balance sheet. “It’s largely a political vendetta,” he said of the charges. It was certainly a change of fortunes for the two men, whom Mr. Maduro praised on television in August when he named them to their positions. “Two cleanup hitters ready for the battle,” Mr. Maduro said, using a baseball reference. Mr. Del Pino smiled and Mr. Martínez clapped.",The New York Times
2017,"Venezuela Summons Bondholders, but Default Appears Closer","CARACAS, Venezuela — The Venezuelan government invited bondholders on Friday to begin negotiations later this month to restructure the country’s $120 billion foreign debt, which has put the country near bankruptcy. But bondholders and analysts said the offer was unlikely to draw much interest, moving the country closer to default. Vice President Tareck El Aissamí, who is a target of United States sanctions over allegations of drug trafficking, appeared on television to propose beginning talks on a restructuring in Caracas on Nov. 13. He made the invitation the morning after President Nicolás Maduro, announcing the debt strategy, appointed him to head a government team in such negotiations. In a defiant message, Mr. El Aissamí demanded that creditors agree to a restructuring of debt terms. He also said United States sanctions barring American banks from buying new bonds or negotiating loan deals with Venezuela amounted to “financial persecution” and an “insolent imperial policy of domination and economic asphyxia.” Venezuela promised on Thursday to make a $1.2 billion payment on a state oil company bond, but by initiating a call to restructure and refinance the country’s debts, President Maduro put future payments in doubt. Venezuelan bond prices sank in global market trading on Friday as investors spoke of an inevitable default. “The way in which this has been handled does not give confidence that refinancing or restructuring talks will start smoothly nor that there will be a quick solution,” said Stuart Culverhouse, head of sovereign and fixed-income research at Exotix Capital, an emerging-markets investment bank and broker that trades Venezuelan bonds. “It is not really clear what the government intends, nor whether it can do anything at all with U.S. sanctions in place.” Mr. Culverhouse said some investors might be willing to go to Caracas for negotiations, but he added, “I cannot see how American investors would, given the sanctions on Venezuela and on the vice president personally.” The United States has imposed a range of sanctions against Venezuela over its repressive policies, including a move in August that restricts trading of Venezuelan bonds sold by the government in the American financial markets. The sanctions against Mr. El Aissamí came in February, when the Treasury Department said he was involved in narcotics rackets from Colombia to Mexico. Financial experts say there is little or no benefit for Venezuela to go into default. While the country could save as much as $7 billion from not making debt payments over the next year, the savings could be offset by lost oil exports. Oil-service companies that go unpaid will curtail their work for the national oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, or Pdvsa, and bondholders could demand confiscation of Venezuelan oil payments in the United States. The only reason to default, many say, is that the nation’s $10 billion in reserves is not enough to cover debt obligations but could be used to import badly needed food and medicine. Experts say the Venezuelan government may try to get around the American sanctions. It could try to issue and market a new bond outside of the United States, but such bonds would probably be unattractive if they cannot be traded on American markets. It could also issue new bonds to pay for food and medicine imports, but such humanitarian bonds require monitoring to guarantee that the money is actually going where it is supposed to — and Venezuelan officials are unlikely to accept such strings. Alternatively, the government could pay the Pdvsa bonds on schedule but not other government bonds. “The key question then becomes whether authorities are willing to continue making debt payments in the absence of an agreement with bondholders,” Torino Capital, the New York-based investment bank, wrote in a report to investors. The bank noted that if Venezuela continued to make payments, “bondholders will have little incentive to participate in a deal,” but that if it stopped making payments, it would leave itself open to confiscations including money earned from oil shipments to the United States. The biggest immediate stumbling block to a renegotiation is Vice President El Aissamí himself, whose appointment puzzled many experts and makes negotiations with American investors impossible unless the Trump administration suddenly changes its policies toward Venezuela. “There are compliance restrictions for negotiations, because the head of negotiations on the presidential committee is a designated narco-trafficker,” said Siobhan Morden, a Nomura managing director who is head of the bank’s Latin America fixed-income strategy. “That’s a constraint, a nonstarter for any negotiations at this stage.” If negotiations break down, or never get off the ground, years of legal wrangling over Venezuelan assets, including oil tankers and even refineries in the United States owned by Citgo, a subsidiary of Pdvsa, could follow. “Pdvsa is really in a doom loop,” said Steve Hanke, a Johns Hopkins University economist who closely watches Venezuela. “At some point the bondholders will have to say, ‘Wait, what are you doing to us?’ and someone will exercise their legal rights. Pdvsa can’t just unilaterally dictate what is going to happen without some bondholder pushing back.”",The New York Times
2017,"Venezuelan Debt Crisis Widens, With Power Company in Default","Venezuela showed new signs of a financial unraveling on Friday, as the state electricity company was declared in default. The announcement of the country’s first bond default came three days before the government was to begin talks with investors to refinance and restructure more than half of its $120 billion in debt. “This is the first drizzle in a huge thunderstorm,” said Jose L. Valera, an international energy lawyer in the Houston office of the Mayer Brown law firm. “The whole country of Venezuela is bankrupt.” The electricity company, Corpoelec, based in Caracas, was unable to make a $28 million payment on a $650 million bond. The bond was originally issued by Electricidad de Caracas before it was nationalized as a Corpoelec subsidiary a decade ago. The default was announced in a notice by Wilmington Trust after bondholders complained that they had not received payment on a coupon that was due on Oct. 10 but had a grace period that ended on Thursday. Venezuela and its state-owned enterprises — including the oil company Petróleos de Venezuela, known as Pdvsa — have missed roughly $350 million in interest payments over the last month. The grace period on many of them will end in the next few days. “There are going to be so many different debtors from the sovereign to these different state-owned companies,” Mr. Valera said, “and they are all going to be defaulting at the same time.” President Nicolás Maduro announced last week that the government would refinance and restructure $63 billion in bonds, and invited investors to meet with a government committee led by his vice president. It is uncertain how many investors will take part, since United States sanctions restrict any negotiation or purchases of new bonds by American-regulated financial institutions. Monday could be a decisive day in Venezuela’s credit crisis. While President Maduro’s committee will offer restructuring proposals, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, a panel formed by the derivatives industry, will meet to discuss the Venezuelan debt situation. The panel will discuss whether late and partial payments of $1.2 billion due last week from Pdvsa constituted a “credit event” that could prompt bondholders to organize to seek payment. The creditors could pursue legal action to confiscate Venezuelan assets abroad, such as oil tankers or even refineries owned by the Pdvsa subsidiary Citgo.",The New York Times
2017,Venezuelan Debt Now Has the Vultures Circling,"For years, investing in Venezuelan bonds has been a popular play for the world’s largest investors — seduced by mouthwatering interest rates, despite the obvious risks. Now, as the bonds have plunged in value over fears that the Venezuelan government will finally default on its bond payments, many traditional investors are heading for the exits, replaced by a hardier band of funds that specialize in the debts of near-bankrupt nations. With steel stomachs and having survived numerous byzantine debt dramas — from Argentina in 2000 to Greece in 2012 — they see Venezuela as the next great debt-restructuring payday. “It is all about the price,” said Lee C. Buchheit, a debt specialist of 30 years’ standing at the law firm of Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton. “If you look at the behavior of distressed investors, they wait for the price to hit a certain threshold” — usually 20 cents on the dollar — “and we have now reached that.” Developments have moved quickly in recent weeks, with a call to restructure, missed interest payments, a default on a power company’s bonds and an inconclusive meeting with investors on Monday. But neither Venezuela’s sovereign debt nor that of its national oil company has been declared in default by creditors, though Standard & Poor’s says the conditions exist for a default. Investors taking the long view still believe that the government will find a way to keep paying what it owes. Their calculation, Mr. Buchheit said, is simple: whether the price of the bonds is below what might be recovered through a debt-restructuring agreement or as part of legal enforcement if Venezuela refuses to negotiate. With the country’s political and social disarray, United States sanctions, and recent demands from the government of President Nicolás Maduro that bond investors agree to a debt deal, Venezuelan bonds have plunged in price from over 30 cents to the low 20s. According to the data-gathering firm FactSet, established firms like Goldman Sachs, Fidelity and T. Rowe Price still sit on about $3.5 billion worth of bonds issued by the national oil company Petróleos de Venezuela, or Pdvsa. By far, these have been the favorite bonds for foreign investors because the company is seen as the country’s cash cow, with its steady stream of foreign-exchange earnings and its wealth of overseas assets. But as the Venezuelan economy continues to deteriorate, the risks of owning these bonds have grown significantly. The country’s foreign-exchange reserves have fallen below $10 billion — a level economists say comes close to insolvency — and experts say striking a debt deal will not be easy, especially with an unpopular government and dueling legislatures. And so the selling has begun. “We have significantly reduced our portfolio in Venezuela over the past year,” said Jan Dehn, the head of research at Ashmore Investment Management, an emerging-market specialist based in London. “This is a slow-moving train wreck.” For these experts in distress, or vulture investors, it is at this point that they get serious about committing funds. And those who have been through many such situations say Venezuela could become the most profitable of all. That is because many debt disasters occur in small countries in Africa and Latin America with limits on the bonds one can accumulate. And in larger countries like Argentina and Greece, profits were hard to come by as nations drove hard bargains. Venezuela is a special case for several reasons, debt experts say. Because of sanctions, it has been unable to hire a team of top bankers and lawyers who might help reach a favorable agreement with creditors. The haphazard nature of the government’s tactics was revealed this week when a ballyhooed session with bond investors in the capital, Caracas, produced few attendees and no results. Unusually, the government has asked bondholders to come up with a plan for restructuring the debt. In most cases when a sovereign nation runs out of cash, a debt proposal is imposed on investors. Also, Venezuela’s oil company has lucrative assets in the United States and Europe that holdout investors could try to seize through a lawsuit in a foreign court if the country stopped paying. Debt financiers also point out that for all its troubles, Venezuela is rich in resources, with the largest proven oil reserves in the world. Many billions of dollars have fled the country but could come back quickly if there was a change in government. While other investors have been selling, Hans Humes, the founder and chief executive of Greylock Capital, a fund that specializes in distressed debt, is looking to add to his positions. A veteran of debt deals in Argentina and Greece, he is contacting like-minded investors to fashion a unified negotiating strategy. Since it has been just two weeks since Mr. Maduro said he would renegotiate Venezuela’s debt, a vanguard of dedicated vulture funds has not yet formed, bankers say. But there is little doubt they are circling. One, in particular, has been David Martinez, a longtime and somewhat mysterious investor in distressed debt who was involved with Argentina and many earlier workout deals. Others, Mr. Humes believes, will soon follow. “Over the next five years, Venezuela will be the best emerging-market story out there — this is a fabulously wealthy country,” he said. “It’s all about mean reversion. We are not looking for Venezuela to become a Switzerland. It just has to stop being Zimbabwe.”",The New York Times
2017,"Venezuela’s Two Legislatures Duel, but Only One Has Ammunition","CARACAS, Venezuela — The national legislature has not passed a law all year, and its members — those still willing to go through the motions of representative democracy — have on occasion struggled to come up with enough lawmakers to conduct any business. Its administrative building is a wasteland of empty desks, inert computers and malaise. Hallways are cast in an ever-deepening dusk as light bulbs burn out and are not replaced for lack of money. The legislative information office, which prints documents for committees and outside groups, has no paper. Not that it matters much: The copy machines ran out of toner last summer. These are grim days for the National Assembly of Venezuela. The legislature, which has been led by the opposition since last year, was neutered over the summer when President Nicolás Maduro engineered the creation of a new lawmaking body composed entirely of his supporters, a move widely criticized in Venezuela and abroad as unconstitutional. The new entity, the Constituent Assembly, was formed to rewrite the Constitution, though its members quickly granted themselves wide-ranging authority to write and pass legislation, allowing the body to supersede the National Assembly. The move produced the bizarre scenario of a nation with dueling legislatures: one with absolute power, the other with none. They both use the same wing of the 19th century Capitol for their sessions, although at different times of day to ensure no unpleasant encounters occur in the corridors. Each body has accused the other of illegitimacy and of engaging in a pantomime of democracy. “It’s a total tragicomedy,” sighed Juan Guaidó, an opposition legislator in the National Assembly representing the state of Vargas. “It seems like a joke.” The political crisis has unfolded as Venezuela has sunk deeper into economic despair. The financial outlook became even murkier on Thursday when Mr. Maduro said he would seek restructuring of Venezuela’s enormous foreign debt, a move seriously complicated by American sanctions. The National Assembly’s demise was perhaps foretold when the opposition took control of the body after elections in December 2015. It was the first time in many years that the opposition had a legislative majority, ensuring a power struggle with Mr. Maduro and his United Socialist Party of Venezuela. The president and his allies started chipping away at congressional powers. The Supreme Court, stacked with judges loyal to Mr. Maduro, nullified nearly all pieces of legislation that the Assembly passed in 2016 and stripped it of its budgetary oversight powers, saying its leaders were in contempt of court for ignoring an order that barred the swearing-in of several opposition politicians whom the ruling party said had engaged in electoral fraud. Citing the contempt ruling, the Maduro administration squeezed the Assembly’s budget, cutting the salaries and expenses of its representatives, and legislators from his party stopped attending its sessions. The Supreme Court even transferred legislative powers from the Assembly to itself, but in the face of international condemnation reversed much of its decision. Mr. Maduro has also sought to silence dissent in other ways, including prosecuting opposition leaders. On Friday, the Supreme Court allowed the lifting of parliamentary immunity for Freddy Guevara, the National Assembly’s vice president, whom the government has accused of crimes for his involvement in street protests this year. Opposition legislators and the legislature’s staff liken the two-year ordeal to a prolonged strangulation. “It seems to be a strategy to see how much we can take,” said José Ángel, an administrative assistant in the National Assembly’s office building. Still, the legislature has continued to hobble along through sheer force of will, struggling to maintain legislative procedure and respond to constituents’ concerns. “Under no condition are we going to stop doing what the people have asked us to do,” said Delsa Solórzano, an opposition legislator. Mostly, though, the National Assembly has become a platform for the opposition to criticize the Maduro administration. A recent session was dedicated to allegations of government corruption in regional elections on Oct. 15. A commission hearing last month featured testimony about political prisoners. “It’s the little space that we have to resist,” Mr. Guaidó said. But sometimes it has failed to make the best of what little space remains. On Tuesday morning, dozens of National Assembly members and their aides gathered for a session at the Capitol. After a two-hour delay, it was canceled because not enough lawmakers showed up. The dispirited representatives slunk away. The legislature’s desperate condition is cause for glee among politicians allied with the Maduro administration. “The National Assembly in this moment doesn’t exist!” crowed Jesús Faría, a member of the Constituent Assembly and a former foreign trade minister under Mr. Maduro. “They are there. There’s the stage set. They pass some sorts of policies that aren’t pertinent. Nobody pays attention.” He added, laughing derisively: “We’re not even going to ignore them.” If these are the bleakest of times for the National Assembly and the fractured opposition, they could not get much brighter for the Constituent Assembly and the United Socialist Party. Buoyed by a lopsided victory in regional elections in favor of the Maduro camp, the Constituent Assembly voted last week to move up the date of municipal elections, in part to take advantage of the opposition’s disarray. The Constituent Assembly has also been passing resolutions with alacrity, and discussing an array of bills, representatives said. Critics, however, contend that the 545-member body, a big-tent congress intended to represent all sectors of society, is an artifice, and that its decisions are essentially controlled by Mr. Maduro and the assembly’s top officials. Constituent Assembly members say that while all the votes in the full sessions have been unanimous, genuine debates have unfolded in the committees, which are not open to the public. Sinecio Mujica, a member of the Constituent Assembly who runs a farming cooperative in the state of Zulia, said of the Maduro administration: “They have influence, undoubtedly. But they don’t decide, they propose.” On Tuesday afternoon, after the National Assembly representatives had forlornly left the Capitol, members of the Constituent Assembly arrived for their own meeting, first gathering amid the palm trees and colonnades of the building’s plaza for a homage to a popular singer. The constituents enjoyed a buffet of hors d’oeuvres and assorted beverages. Dance music blasted from speakers. Celebration was in the air. Even as the Maduro administration has allowed the National Assembly’s offices to fall into disrepair, it has been finishing the renovation of a building to serve as the Constituent Assembly’s administrative headquarters. The edifice is visible from the National Assembly’s building, and at night its facade is bathed in the glow of soft spotlights: a victors’ taunt. The National Assembly building was once abuzz with activity and energy, its corridors jammed and its conference rooms busy at all hours. Now, with legislative activity at a near-standstill, it is moribund, a portrait of decay and futility. Late on a recent morning, Adel Calzadilla, a legislator’s assistant, was sitting in front of his computer in a dreary, windowless room in the offices of the Carabobo state delegation. What had he been up to all day? “Nothing,” he replied. His depressing admission hung heavily in the air. “I have to tell the truth: All the personnel here don’t do anything.” “We’re going from bad to worse,” he added. “It’s very sad.” Staff members loyal to the opposition say they are motivated by the promise of a paycheck and by the faith, however slender, that whatever work they are able to accomplish may one day bear fruit in a post-Maduro political world. Javier Rivas, 25, a lawyer on the staff of the Domestic Policy Commission, is among the very few men in the building who still wear ties to work, a throwback to bygone days, before sports jerseys in the office became more common than sport coats. For him, the sartorial choice is a show of support for a beleaguered institution, an act of resistance against decay. “You can’t let the adversities of the government, or the social and economic situation, defeat you,” he said. It’s an increasingly lonely struggle, he acknowledges, but one he has no intention of abandoning.",The New York Times
2017,"Venus Williams Had $400,000 in Goods Stolen From Home During U.S. Open","Burglars broke into the Florida home of the tennis star Venus Williams, stealing $400,000 worth of items, while she was playing the United States Open this summer, the police said on Thursday. Ms. Williams’s home, a 10,000-square-foot estate in a gated community in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., was hit at some point between Sept. 1 and Sept. 5, a stretch when she was competing in the tournament in Flushing Meadows Corona Park, Queens. A report by the Palm Beach Gardens Police Department, which released it publicly on Thursday, said the total value of the items stolen was $400,000. It is unclear what exactly was stolen because the police blacked out the portion of the report that listed individual items. From Sept. 1 to Sept. 5, Ms. Williams played several matches at the U.S. Open and advanced to the semifinals, where she lost to the eventual champion, Sloane Stephens. Ms. Williams acquired the Florida property, which backs up to a golf course, nearly two decades ago, according to property records. Palm Beach Gardens in Palm Beach County is home to many professional athletes, including her sister, Serena Williams. The burglary came about three months after Ms. Williams was involved in a fatal car crash near her home. Ms. Williams was driving about 5 miles per hour, according to the police, when her sport utility vehicle collided with another vehicle in an intersection. The police initially said that she was at fault for running a red light but later said that surveillance video showed that Ms. Williams had “lawfully entered” the intersection. A passenger in the other car, Jerome Barson, died two weeks after the crash, and the Barson estate has sued Ms. Williams, claiming she had been negligent. Ms. Williams, 37, has won seven Grand Slam events and is ranked No. 5 in the world.",The New York Times
2017,"Vera Shlakman, Professor Fired During Red Scare, Dies at 108","Vera Shlakman, an influential economics professor who was fired by Queens College after she refused to tell Senate investigators whether she had ever been a card-carrying Communist — a punishment that brought an apology three decades later — died on Nov. 5 at her home in Manhattan. She was 108. Her death, which was not widely reported at the time, was confirmed by her friend Ellen J. Holahan. Dr. Shlakman was the last survivor among more than a dozen teachers at New York City’s public colleges who were ousted by the Board of Higher Education during the early stages of the Red Scare wrought by Senators Pat McCarran and Joseph R. McCarthy. A 42-year-old assistant professor when she was fired in 1952, Dr. Shlakman neither taught economics again nor wrote a sequel to her groundbreaking 1935 book on female factory workers. Thirty years later, 10 of the fired professors, including Dr. Shlakman, were indemnified with pension settlements after receiving an apology from college officials. “They were dismissed during and in the spirit of the shameful era of McCarthyism, during which the freedoms traditionally associated with academic institutions were quashed,” the trustees of the City University of New York declared in a resolution adopted unanimously in 1980. The trustees had succeeded the Board of Higher Education. No one doubted Dr. Shlakman’s political leanings. She had been named for the Russian revolutionary Vera Zasulich. Emma Goldman, the anarchist, was a regular guest in her family’s home. Dr. Shlakman was vice president of the college division of a Teachers Union local that was rebuked for being dominated by Communists. But when she was summoned before a public hearing of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, led by Senator McCarran, a Nevada Democrat, Dr. Shlakman invoked her constitutional guarantees of free speech and privilege against self-incrimination when asked about her membership in the Communist Party. “Do you believe that a member of the Communist Party can be a college teacher?” Robert J. Morris, the subcommittee counsel, asked Dr. Shlakman at the hearing, held on Sept. 24, 1952, at the United States Court House in Foley Square in Manhattan. She replied, “I think that any teacher must be judged on the basis of his performance in the classrooms; that if a teacher follows professional standards in the classroom, and is a scholar, he is entitled to teach as any citizen.” As an economist, Dr. Shlakman seemed to suggest that “communism” had become an overwrought term. She cited one example of what, by her reckoning, had once been branded radical but became an accepted staple of American life while leaving democratic institutions intact. “When the United States Post Office began to carry packages,” she said, “this activity was viewed as a challenge to private enterprise’’ and “a kind of socialistic or communistic activity.” Pressed about whether being a Communist would close a teacher’s mind to any deviation from the party line, she replied that similar speculations had been raised against devout Roman Catholics. “We don’t condemn people now — at least I assume we don’t — on the basis of guilt by association,” she said. As far as the committee and college administrators were concerned, though, by refusing to respond to the question about party membership, Dr. Shlakman became a “Fifth Amendment Communist.” She was fired from her professorship 12 days after the hearing under two New York regulations. One, authorized by the State Legislature in 1949, barred the school system from employing anyone who belonged to what was deemed a subversive organization. The other, a provision of the city charter enacted to thwart corruption, provided that a city employee’s refusal to testify about his or her official conduct, because doing so might be self-incriminating, was grounds for dismissal. Both provisions would be declared unconstitutional in the late 1960s. But they were enforced in Dr. Shlakman’s case, and as she told her fellow professors after she testified, her firing had left the academic community with a choice. “It must either grovel and accept the standards of orthodoxy prescribed by the McCarrans and the McCarthys, and those who have capitulated to them,” she wrote, “or it must resist.” She recalled that educators had resisted earlier congressional inquiries into reading requirements for college courses. “Is the dismissal of teachers,” she asked, “easier to accept than the burning of books?” But profiles in courage were few and far between during the McCarthy era. The British economist Mark Blaug, a former student of Dr. Shlakman’s, wrote in an essay in 2000 that she had been “scrupulously impartial and leaned over backward not to indoctrinate her students” — which was why, he added, as a college tutor he had endorsed a student petition demanding her reinstatement. Less than 24 hours later, he said, the Queens College president ordered him to resign or be dismissed. “For a day or two, I contemplated a magnificent protest,” wrote Professor Blaug, who died in 2011, “a statement that would ring down the ages as a clarion bell to individual freedom, that would be read and cited for years to come by American high school students — and then I quietly sent in my letter of resignation.” After leaving Queens, Dr. Shlakman was unemployed for a year. She then worked as a secretary and a bookkeeper and taught intermittently. She was placed on an F.B.I. watch list because she was, as an F.B.I. file put it, “reportedly” a member of the Communist Party from 1944 to 1946 and had invoked the Fifth Amendment before the subcommittee, according to Marjorie Heins’s “Priests of Our Democracy: The Supreme Court, Academic Freedom, and the Anti-Communist Purge” (2013). In 1960, Dr. Shlakman finally started teaching again at Adelphi University, a private institution on Long Island, in its School of Social Work. In 1966 she was hired by the Columbia University School of Social Work, where she taught full time until she retired as professor emerita in 1978. Dr. Shlakman was born on July 15, 1909, in Montreal, to Louis Shlakman, a tailor and shirtwaist factory foreman, and the former Lena Hendler, both Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. (Her sister, Eleanora, was named for Karl Marx’s youngest daughter; her brother, Victor, for Victor Hugo.) Dr. Shlakman never married and leaves no immediate survivors. In her last years, when she was homebound and blind, she was looked after by several friends, including Judith Podore Ward and her husband, Bernard Tuchman, and Ms. Holahan. They said they never asked, nor did Dr. Shlakman reveal, whether she had ever been a member of the Communist Party. Dr. Shlakman earned a bachelor’s degree in 1930 from McGill University in Montreal, and went on to receive a master’s in economics there. She earned her doctorate in economics at Columbia. Queens College hired her as an instructor in 1938, shortly after it was established. She taught courses there in labor, Social Security and the concentration of wealth. Dr. Shlakman’s doctoral dissertation, an analysis of female factory workers in 19th-century Chicopee, Mass., was the basis for her book, “Economic History of a Factory Town” (1935). Joshua B. Freeman, a distinguished professor of labor history at Queens College and the City University Graduate Center, said by email that her book had “extended the boundaries of American working-class history” and influenced a generation of historians. Alice Kessler-Harris, a Columbia history professor emerita, wrote in the journal International Labor and Working-Class History in 2006, “Shlakman raised the question of how a transformation in the meaning of work for female workers could, and perhaps did, alter the workplace environment and the nature of family life.” Professor Kessler-Harris said in an email that at a time when the field was dominated “by Jeffersonian myths about the harmonious interaction of labor and capital,” Dr. Shlakman’s study of Chicopee confirmed that capital and labor were at odds with each other in fundamental ways, and that labor protests were a check on the excesses of the marketplace. Dr. Shlakman’s firing from Queens banished her to academic obscurity. Professor Kessler-Harris said that her copy of “Economic History,” borrowed from Columbia’s library in 1951, was not taken out again until 1966. (The book was, however, reissued in 1969.) After City University offered its apology in 1980, Dr. Shlakman and another fired colleague, Oscar Shaftel, appealed to City Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin to resolve a dispute with the state over pensions or death benefits for former professors who had been dismissed during the Red Scare. In April 1982, the city announced a $935,098 settlement with seven living former professors and the estates of three who had died. Dr. Shlakman received $114,599 — the equivalent of almost $300,000 in 2017 money. “Do you feel you have gained your honor back with this?” Dr. Shaftel was asked at a ceremony where he was joined by Dr. Shlakman and two other former colleagues. “I never lost my honor,” he replied.",The New York Times
2017,Veterans Claiming Disability Pay Face Wall of Denials and Delays,"GAINESVILLE, Fla. — Jonathan Bey hurt his back while repairing buoys at sea in the Coast Guard, and after he was discharged, he filed what he thought would be a routine request for veterans disability benefits. That was 34 years ago. After repeated denials by the Department of Veterans Affairs, appeals by Mr. Bey, and more than a couple of letters saying that the department had lost his files, Mr. Bey is still waiting. “My adult life has been consumed trying to battle the bureaucracy,” said Mr. Bey, 61, who said he had to quit his civilian job 10 years ago as the injury grew worse. He now relies on his wife’s income and a steady supply of pain medication to get by. The veterans benefits system started more than a century ago, and in the time since — as new wars stacked on entitlements and new abuses stacked on reforms — it has grown into an unruly tower of regulations. It pays out more than $78 billion each year to nearly five million beneficiaries. But there are also more than 470,000 veterans who have been denied benefits and have appealed. When they do, they encounter an antiquated system where processing cases takes years — and sometimes even decades. “One of them,” Senator Johnny Isakson, chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, noted in a hearing this summer, has been waiting “25 years to get an answer.” Actually, scores have been waiting that long, according to the department. Another 22 have been waiting more than 30 years. And wait times keep growing. Recognizing the problem, Congress in August passed broad reforms to cut delays. President Trump quickly signed them into law, telling veterans gathered at the signing, “This is a big one.” While veterans groups largely praised the move, critics said it would do little to help veterans already in the appeals system. That is true for Mr. Bey, who was recently told it would be at least another 14 months before he heard anything about his case. “I hate to use a hackneyed expression, but they are rearranging the deck chairs and the ship is still sinking,” said John Wells, a retired Navy commander and lawyer who runs Military-Veterans Advocacy, a nonprofit. The main cause of delays, according to the department, was a design flaw that fed appeals with simple errors into a legal system that was meant to rule on complex cases. That led to thousands of cases with issues as small as a typo clogging up the flow of cases to be processed. “We tried to do everything in one stream and it couldn’t work efficiently,” said David McLenachen, who leads the department’s benefits appeals office. The new law triages appeals into three streams: A fast stream — like the express lane at a supermarket — to correct simple errors; a medium stream, in which a more experienced department specialist reviews more complex issues at a local level; and a final stream where veterans can take cases to an independent board of appeals. The agency plans to hire hundreds of additional claims processors with the goal of clearing each case within four months. But lawyers who represent veterans say the changes do not address the core problem: The department’s vast number of errors, which have generated hundreds of thousands of appeals. A 2017 report by the Government Accountability Office found nearly half of cases were plagued by mistakes and reached the Board of Veterans Appeals — the final authority for veterans benefits cases — only to be sent back for fixes. Cases that have been sent back can sit for years before they are addressed, then sit again as they wait for the board to read the revisions. Making a fair ruling on injuries of war is far from easy, and veterans advocates say some cases will inevitably take time to sort out. But as Mr. Bey’s case shows, even simple issues can languish, and recent changes by Congress have so far offered veterans like him no relief. Mr. Bey was working with a crew scraping barnacles off buoys in Chesapeake Bay in 1977 when his ship suddenly listed to port, causing a shelf holding heavy equipment to tip. Mr. Bey braced himself against the equipment to protect crew members working below, and held it until others could help him. The next morning he turned to grab his duffel bag and collapsed in agony. “It was like a dentist’s drill, but in my back,” he recalled. He spent four days in an Air Force hospital, military records show. They also reflect that during the five remaining years of his service, he was struck periodically by debilitating spasms. But in 1983, when Mr. Bey submitted a claim to get free medical care and a small pension for his back from the Department of Veterans Affairs, the department sent back a letter saying it could find no evidence in his exit physical exam that showed the injury. He appealed, asking that the department review his entire medical record. He was denied. He dug through the National Archives outside Washington, found records of his hospitalization, and submitted them. He was denied again. He got a civilian doctor to perform X-rays and write a letter documenting damage to his spine. He was denied again. He appealed to the Board of Veterans Appeals. His claim was denied. Each denial was punctuated by months or years of delay as paperwork sat waiting. In the meantime, Mr. Bey worked as a researcher for an intellectual property law firm, got married and raised his children. Because his claim had been denied, he was unable get medical care from a veterans hospital, and, he said, his back pain grew worse to the point that he was unable to work a full-time job. “We see hundreds of cases like this,” said Bart Stichman, a lawyer and the joint executive director of National Veterans Legal Services Program, a nonprofit advocacy group. “One veteran with diabetes spent years trying to prove her case. She lost a foot. The V.A. finally granted the benefit, but by that time she’d lost her other foot.” The veterans department said it was working to improve response time and reduce errors. “The problem isn’t the process,” Mr. Bey said as he sifted through stacks of files showing agency errors in his case. “It’s that the quality of work is so bad. If people had done their job right, this would have been over in the Reagan administration.” By 2016, Mr. Bey had exhausted all but his last appeal. He submitted the same evidence that had always led to a denial in the past, but, hoping to bolster his chances, sent it through the office of his senator, Bill Nelson of Florida. A few months later, his benefit was granted — sort of. A department error in the date of the original claim erased decades of back pay. Mr. Bey is appealing. The department has told him it could take a while.",The New York Times
2017,Veterans Groups Push for Medical Marijuana to Treat PTSD,"Among critics of the federal prohibition of marijuana — a diverse and bipartisan group that includes both criminal justice reform advocates and Big Alcohol — the American Legion and its allies stand out. For more than a year, the stalwart veterans group has been working to reframe the debate as a question of not only moral and economic imperatives, but also patriotic ones, arguing that access to medical marijuana could ease suffering and reduce suicide rates among soldiers who return from the horrors of war. “We’ve got young men and women with PTSD and traumatic brain injuries coming to us and saying that cannabis works,” Joe Plenzler, a spokesman for the group, which was established after World War I and has over two million members, said by telephone Wednesday. Mr. Plenzler said that veterans had turned to medical marijuana as an alternative to so-called “zombie drugs,” including opioids and antidepressants, that they said adversely affected their mood and personality, up to and including thoughts of suicide. In studies, cannabis has been shown to help alleviate chronic pain and reduce muscle spasms in multiple sclerosis patients. In 2016, the American Legion petitioned the government to relax federal restrictions on marijuana in two ways. The group asked Congress to remove the drug from the list of Schedule 1 narcotics — a class that includes heroin, LSD and other drugs that have “no accepted medical use” and a high potential for abuse — and reclassify it in a lower schedule. It also called on the Drug Enforcement Administration to license more privately funded growers to focus on medical research. Because marijuana is a Schedule 1 drug, there is surprisingly little rigorous research into its medical applications, as researchers have found themselves stymied by regulatory hurdles at federal health and drug agencies and short on a supply of federally approved product. The classification also means that veterans — many of whom rely on the federal Veterans Affairs Department for their health care — cannot get coverage for medical marijuana, even in the 29 states that have legalized it. On Thursday, The American Legion published a phone survey of over 800 veterans and veteran caregivers in which 92 percent of respondents said they supported research into medical cannabis for the purpose of treating mental or physical conditions. Eighty-two percent said they wanted cannabis as a federally legal treatment option. “Even in the states where it’s legal, there’s still the stigma associated with the federal ban,” said Louis Celli, the group’s national director of veterans affairs and rehabilitation. He noted that soldiers were regularly subjected to urinalysis and told to stay away from the drug. “It puts veterans in a very difficult position.” Though a Quinnipiac University poll released in April found that a record 94 percent of all Americans supported doctor-prescribed medical marijuana usage, veterans advocating research have run into the same roadblock as pro-cannabis activists around the country: the Justice Department. President Trump campaigned in support of medical marijuana and said that recreational usage should be a “state-by-state” issue. But his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, has been an outspoken critic of legalizing the drug for any purpose. Veterans groups draw a straight line from obstacles to medical marijuana research to the doorstep of Mr. Sessions. “He is putting politics, antiquated policies and his own personal opinion ahead of the health needs of veterans in this country,” said Nick Etten, executive director of Veterans Cannabis Project, referring to Mr. Sessions. A representative for the Justice Department declined to comment, but Mr. Sessions said during an oversight hearing with the Senate Judiciary Committee last month that he was considering expanding the supply of research-grade marijuana. Veterans groups say the fastest and most effective way to help veterans get access to treatment is to simply reschedule the drug. That would automatically lift the most onerous barriers to research and allow V.A. health care providers to immediately prescribe marijuana in states where it is legal. But getting the necessary legislation through a fractious, conservative congress may still be a pipe dream. Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida is one of a growing number of Republicans who have joined Democrats in trying to formally recast the government’s stance on marijuana. With Darren Soto, Democrat of Florida, Mr. Gaetz was co-author of a bill that would bump the drug down to Schedule 3 — the same classification as codeine and anabolic steroids. “I think my political party became too committed to this antiquated dogma of the ’70s and ’80s,” Mr. Gaetz said, referring to a time when cannabis was widely considered to be a “gateway” to more harmful drugs. “Now we’re having to pull the ostrich’s head out of the sand.” OpinionThomas James Brennan",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Vicente Fox: Borders Can’t Protect Us,"Turning Points Turning Point: Prototypes for a wall along the border between Mexico and the United States are unveiled. September brought great sadness, frustration and anger when the president of the United States, Donald Trump, called on Congress to phase out DACA, or the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program that assured the future of around 800,000 children from all over the world who are living in the United States, protecting them from deportation. Making up nearly 80 percent of that figure, Mexicans will be disproportionately affected by an end to the program. Latinos, particularly Mexicans, have been the main targets of President Trump’s constant racial attacks. According to Mr. Trump, we are guilty of all sorts of criminal acts. We have been called rapists, drug traffickers and thieves who steal American jobs. He has demanded that we pay for a wall to be built between our two nations that would prevent us from entering the United States. Many of these DACA recipients arrived as babies or toddlers and know no other home, yet they still acknowledge their birthplace and cherish their mother nation, adopting proud hybrid identities. Every country has its own Dreamers, as these young immigrants are known. As they grow up, study, build businesses and exchange ideas, they help fortify a globalized world where cultures mix. The residents of this modern world order endorse a new kind of citizenship and democracy. They don’t settle for voting, but are eager to protest when they believe they are being treated unjustly. They strive for self-sustaining economic growth. They are concerned with the major shifts in climate around the planet. These citizens of the world know their value. Regardless of skin color, upbringing or nationality, they are able to thrive in different types of environments. We see examples every day of these evolved people, who are fighting to end racism and bring equality, inclusion and representation to their governments. Immigration is nuanced and complicated, and there is no simple answer for how a government should deal with the issues of national security. Anyone who has ever led a nation, myself included, understands the priority of keeping citizens safe. The answer, though, is not to punish the men and women whose admiration and dedication to a country has served as the catalyst for their hard work and success. We have heard many stories of young people arriving in America with their parents, whose dreams of providing the best life possible for their children emboldened them to risk a hazardous border crossing into unknown territory. Those young people have gone on to acquire educations, careers and communities; helped their parents to fill out job applications and medical forms in English; and sent aid and guidance back to their birthplaces. They aren’t trying to hurt their adopted country — just the opposite. They’re just looking to be recognized. America is so admired because of what it seems to represent: equality and opportunity and heterogeneity. Rescinding DACA would be a huge step backward for a nation that has always prided itself on its forbearance. The potential damage to hundreds of thousands of lives is unquantifiable, and the upside is nonexistent. This change would punish the people who wanted so badly to live in a country that they risked everything they had to get there. If the future is bringing the notion of a global identity, and countries without borders, it remains imperative that we prioritize the preservation and celebration of our cultural traditions. Our customs provide us with an exciting mix of ideas, experiences and stories to contribute. As we honor what each individual brings to the table by way of their background, the term “minority” will become an anachronism. Each person has a unique story and skill set, effectively making all of us equal in our potential contributions to society. Conservative movements have risen in opposition to this cultural blending, not only in America, but all over the world, from the Brexit efforts in Britain to the far right party Alternative for Germany’s presence in this year’s election. Rapid change and disruption have brought instability and concern, and in response conservative leaders are promising tranquillity and security through protectionism and excessive nationalism. We cannot resort to this old answer to a new struggle. It is no longer feasible to shut our doors in a world that is commingled politically, economically, socially and culturally. Banning men and women from entering a country based on their religion is bigoted and hateful. Denying refugees and those seeking asylum the opportunities many of our countries are equipped to provide them is needlessly cruel and, as in the case of DACA, only serves to hurt our most vulnerable fellow humans.",The New York Times
2017,Victims of Canada’s ‘Gay Purge’ to Get Apology from Trudeau,"OTTAWA — Simon Thwaites was a master seaman analyzing radio signals and surveillance in a secret branch of Canada’s Navy in the 1980s when he was summoned by investigative officers. Strapped to a lie detector in an interrogation room, he was asked by two officers if medical records showing that he had contracted H.I.V. meant that he was gay. Mr. Thwaites confirmed that this was the case, and not long afterward his security clearance was revoked and he was assigned to work as a janitor. Eventually Mr. Thwaites was forced out of the military on a medical release without benefits, lost his house and filed for bankruptcy. “We were treated like something was wrong with us, but none of us did nothing wrong,” Mr. Thwaites said in a telephone interview from his home in Truro, Nova Scotia. “We did our jobs and we did our jobs well. It kind of undermines your sense of self.” Now, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau plans to formally apologize to Mr. Thwaites and thousands of other members of the military, the public service and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police who faced discrimination, lost their jobs and, in some cases, were imprisoned because of their sexual orientation. Some of the victims are believed to have killed themselves after their careers were ruined. The apology, which will take place next Tuesday in the House of Commons, is another step in a review the prime minister began last year into how to acknowledge the harm bought by what is sometimes called the “gay purge.” Working on the theory that gays and lesbians were vulnerable to blackmail by the Soviet Union, a special unit of the Mounties began its efforts to remove them from the public service in the late 1950s. The program continued in the military up until 1992; Mr. Thwaites’s reassignment as a janitor came in 1986. The Mounties and military police conducted extensive surveillance of gay bars in several cities and used threats to extract the names of gays and lesbians. During the early 1960s, the national police force commissioned a psychologist to secretly build a “fruit machine,” a failed attempt at a homosexuality detector. There is not a single known case of the Soviet Union or any other country having blackmailed a member of a sexual minority into turning over Canadian government secrets. Because the military in particular has blocked access to some reports on the investigations, citing national security, it is unclear how many people came under investigation and how many lost their jobs or security clearances, or were demoted. Several groups place the figure at about 9,000. Mr. Thwaites, 55, has been invited by the government to watch the apology from the gallery in the House of Commons in Ottawa. But the limited income provided by a disability pension means that he will be viewing on television at home in Nova Scotia. Mr. Twaithes said he will be listening carefully to determine if the apology is “acceptable.” He said, “It’s possible that it might not cover a lot of bases.” Mr. Trudeau has also promised to introduce legislation by the end of December that will expunge the criminal records of people who were convicted of engaging in homosexual acts. Mr. Trudeau’s father, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, acting first as justice minister and then prime minister, repealed laws against homosexuality in 1969, legislation he introduced by saying: “I think the view we take here is that there’s no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation.” It is not clear if next week’s apology will also come with financial compensation for surviving victims, some of whom, including Mr. Thwaites, have joined a class-action lawsuit against the government. Lawyers for the plaintiffs in those cases met with their government counterparts on Monday to see if an agreement could be reached before Mr. Trudeau apologizes. After the meeting, R. Douglas Elliott, the lead lawyer in the lawsuit, said two issues, which he declined to identify, remained outstanding. “I’m cautiously optimistic that we’ll be able to deliver both next week,” he said. “It was a difficult day of negotiations today. There was wailing and gnashing of teeth.” Cameron Ahmad, Mr. Trudeau’s spokesman, said the government was working toward resolving the lawsuit. “The apology, quite simply, is just one step,” Mr. Ahmad said. Most of the surviving victims are from the military or the Mounted Police, according to Gary Kinsman, a retired professor of sociology at Laurentian University in Sudbury, Ontario. He is the co-author, with Patrizia Gentile, of “The Canadian War on Queers” and a member of the We Demand an Apology Network, a group that has been pushing for the action Mr. Trudeau is now taking. But Professor Kinsman said the police action had a profound effect at one point on several branches of the public service, particularly Canada’s foreign ministry. Based on his research, he links the start of the crackdown to a 1958 episode involving a clerk, who was gay, in the Canadian embassy in Moscow. The Canadian ambassador sent him home as a potential security threat. The government’s concerns increased, he said, after a Canadian sailor, who was also gay, was murdered. “The United States security establishment was strongly encouraging of this campaign,” Professor Kinsman said. Among the diplomats who were caught up in it was Orde Morton, who joined the foreign affairs department in 1964, was posted to Brazil and then led a review of Canada’s policies in Latin America ordered by the elder Mr. Trudeau. He had anticipated being sent to another overseas post. But in 1969, after the laws against homosexuality had been repealed, he was summoned to a meeting with members of an internal security group. Mr. Morton was told that because he was gay, he was a security risk and would never be promoted. Rather than serve out his time in a meaningless job, he quit. Mr. Morton remade his life, attending doctoral studies at Oxford on a government grant, becoming an academic and, later, a writer. But he is participating in the lawsuit and says the government owes everyone caught up in the purge an apology. “It doesn’t mean a great deal to me as a person,” he said from his home in Toronto. “But I think it’s a very great thing to acknowledge that this happened. Letting people see that gay and other people are just like anybody else is important.”",The New York Times
2017,Victoria Beckham Raises $40 Million in Private Equity Investment,"LONDON — Victoria Beckham (the luxury empire, not the woman) is about to get a whole lot bigger. After years of speculation that her fast-growing namesake fashion brand was a prime takeover target, it was announced on Monday that Ms. Beckham had received £30 million, or almost $40 million, from the private equity firm Neo Investment Partners in exchange for an undisclosed stake in the business. Ms. Beckham, who founded her line in 2008 alongside her husband David Beckham and the former Spice Girls manager Simon Fuller, said that she was “thrilled” to have found a partner in Neo, which is run by the former Goldman Sachs banker David Belhassen. The Spice Girl turned fashion designer added that the investment would allow her company to expand its retail operations, both online and offline, to push into new product categories and to move its staff into larger headquarters in West London next spring. “As my business enters into its second decade of operation, this investment and partnership signals an incredibly exciting new chapter,” Ms. Beckham said. She said that she had been looking for an investor who understood her perspective on fashion and beauty business models and respected her determination to maintain an independent business. “I started my brand from a small room in Simon Fuller’s office with him and David believing in me and supporting my vision,” she said. “I now have an additional partner who is showing that same belief.” Known initially for its chic, sleek dresses with internal corsetry and more recently for collections centered on soft, slouchy tailoring, Victoria Beckham has moved in the past nine years from a single ready-to-wear line into accessories, eyewear and footwear. She has added a second line, Victoria by Victoria Beckham, flagship boutiques in London and Hong Kong, and a series of collaborations with the likes of the mass-market retailer Target and the cosmetics group Estée Lauder. 35 Photos View Slide Show › Earlier this month, the brand announced a new partnership with the athletics brand Reebok. Neo, also founded in 2008 and based in London, has a focus on the European luxury sector, with investments in Ami Paris, a contemporary men’s wear brand, and Valextra, the Italian luxury leather goods brand. “Victoria Beckham is one of the most exciting entrepreneurs I have the pleasure to work with,” Mr. Belhassen said in a statement following news of the deal. “She is an inspiration to millions of women around the world and she has built a unique, differentiated luxury brand with a strong identity and very high potential.” Mrs. Beckham’s fashion business is controlled by Beckham Brand Holdings, which is jointly owned by the Beckhams and Mr. Fuller. The investment by Neo is expected to give it a valuation of about £100 million. Yet despite a plum position on the New York Fashion Week schedule, strong sales across key geographical regions and considerable critical acclaim, the Victoria Beckham brand continues to be unprofitable and has been bolstered by funding from DB Ventures, the company that deals with Mr. Beckham’s many product endorsements. Revenues for the past two years have come in at around £36 million annually, although the company said revenues for the first half of the 2017 financial year “indicate double-digit growth on the year.” In 2015 — the last year for which full accounts have been filed — it posted a pretax loss of £4.3 million. It is expected that some of the cash from the Neo investment will go toward paying down accumulated debt. Still, Mrs. Beckham and her biggest supporters remained enthusiastic after news of the deal and what it could do for the company’s growth. Mr. Beckham said that he was “so proud” of his wife and that he expected the next decade “to be even more exciting” for her business, a sentiment echoed by Mr. Fuller. “2018 promises to be the most exciting year yet, with the 10th anniversary celebrations and move into new premises,” Mr. Fuller said. “This is a hugely positive time for Victoria Beckham. The continued growth and potential has never been so dynamic.”",The New York Times
2017,Video Shows Georgia Teacher Threatening Student: That’s How ‘You Get Shot’,"A science teacher in Georgia has been placed on paid administrative leave after a video appeared to show him threatening a high school student and betting that he would be shot in the head. In the video, Paul Hagan, a physics teacher at the Rockdale Career Academy in Conyers, Ga., can be heard addressing a student who is just out of frame. “Don’t smile at me, man, O.K.?” the teacher can be heard saying in the 26-second clip. “That’s how people like you get shot.” “I got a bet,” he continued. “I bet by the time you’re 21, someone’s going to put a bullet right through your head, O.K.? And it might be me, the one that does it.” The student’s mother, April Carr, said those words from Mr. Hagan, who is white, were especially hurtful because her son is black. “I was definitely surprised to see the video,” she said. “I definitely had to get my emotions together.” “The one thing that I never wanted for him was to feel any type of racism where he felt like he was being targeted simply because he’s an African-American male,” Ms. Carr said. It is unclear who took the video, which appears to have been recorded with a phone, and when. Ms. Carr said her daughter brought it to her attention on Nov. 2. Ms. Carr asked that her son’s name not be published because he is a minor and “not the type of kid that really likes a lot of attention.” She said he told her that he had been laughing with some friends during a physics lesson, and that the teacher had gotten frustrated. “I believe that he did like his teacher, and he believed that his teacher liked him,” she said, adding that Mr. Hagan apologized to her son. Mr. Hagan did not respond to phone calls or an email seeking comment on Wednesday. Ms. Carr said she contacted the Rockdale County Sheriff’s Department. A spokesman for the department said on Tuesday that a report had been filed, but he would not say whether the department was conducting an investigation of its own, referring the question to the school board. The Rockdale County school district is investigating the episode, said Cindy Ball, a spokeswoman. “Rockdale County Public Schools expects all employees to conduct themselves professionally and ethically to provide a positive teaching and learning environment for students and staff,” she added in an emailed statement. She confirmed that Mr. Hagan was on paid administrative leave. Ms. Carr is calling for Mr. Hagan to be fired. “I hate that my son had to be the example,” she said. “But this is about awareness and fairness. We don’t send our kids to school to be threatened. We send them to be educated and protected.”",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Vietnam Wants to Control Social Media? Too Late.,"Op-Ed Contributor HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam — When access to Facebook’s Messenger app went intermittent throughout Vietnam on Nov. 4 — an unusual occurrence, even in this repressive state — netizens were thrown for a loop. “Has it happened already?” some of my Facebook friends asked. Messenger was on the fritz in other countries as well, and earlier that day Typhoon Damrey had hit Vietnam’s central coast, hard. Yet some of my friends were attributing the service disruption to something else: a cybersecurity bill that had made headlines the day before. The bill was released for public consultation in June but only garnered wide attention recently, when as the National Assembly was reconvening, the Chamber of Commerce stated its objections. The proposed law requires foreign tech giants like Google, Facebook and Skype to set up offices and data servers in Vietnam. Although the National Assembly isn’t expected to vote on the bill until mid-2018, the prospect of it has already sparked fear among internet users, the business community and even some lawmakers. The government cites growing concerns over cybersecurity and fake news as reasons to exert more control over social-media platforms. But internet access has also served as an outlet for political activism and exposés denouncing corruption and government misconduct. Vietnam has one of the highest rates of social-media usage among countries with comparable per capita incomes. There are about 52 million Facebook active accounts here, for a population of about 96 million. Google and YouTube also are very popular. Like China, Vietnam hoped to rein in the internet from the outset. It, too, tried to block Facebook, in 2009, by ordering major local service providers not to carry it. But the government didn’t dare set up a firewall outright, for fear of driving away internet business and e-commerce; it permitted certain sites instead of blocking them outright as China had, banking that it could coax them into collaborating as needed. On occasion, the Vietnamese government has asked local service providers to remove certain sites from their list of known hosts, but that is easy enough to skirt by changing domain names. China built its online infrastructure with control foremost in mind; the system it developed is now more countrywide intranet than internet. Vietnam’s more mild approach has bred a hybrid infrastructure that keeps developing and adapting faster than the government’s ability to regulate and control it. One difference is that China is a much larger country, and the domestic market’s economy of scale allowed alternative indigenous platforms, like Weibo or WeChat, to develop. Not so in Vietnam: This country simply doesn’t have the financial or political wherewithal to match big-time Silicon Valley. YouTube and Facebook now account for two-thirds of the domestic digital media market. The government has at best been able to block Facebook at sensitive moments, such as when President Barack Obama visited Vietnam in May 2016 or during local protests over an environmental disaster. But only for a time, because tech-savvy Vietnamese internet users have always been able to find workarounds. In 2015, Nguyen Tan Dung, then the prime minister of Vietnam, said that it was impossible to ban social media and that the government should instead use such platforms to spread its own message. After Mr. Dung fell out of political favor in 2016, the Vietnamese government continued to tolerate Facebook while trying to police information published online. In an effort to seem responsive to the public’s concerns, in 2015 the government set up official Facebook pages to stream news conferences after cabinet meetings and announce new policies and regulations. At the same time, it has deployed groups known as “public opinion shapers” to spread its own views and defend the state against detractors, or what it calls “hostile forces.” Earlier this year, the information ministry issued a circular asking websites, social media and mobile applications with more than one million users in Vietnam to “collaborate” with the authorities and remove “ill-intended and toxic” content, ranging from ads for contraband merchandise or protected wildlife to state secrets. The ministry also asked Google to take down 2,300 YouTube clips it said defamed Vietnamese leaders; Google complied in part, removing nearly 1,500. Perhaps emboldened by this measure of success, and by increasing repression of the internet in other Southeast Asian states, the authorities want to go further still. But it’s too late for that. The bill currently being discussed, which appears to be modeled after legislation China adopted earlier this year, will only backfire. In August, President Tran Dai Quang — who once headed the Ministry of Public Security, the bill’s main proponent — stated the need “to prevent news sites and blogs with bad and dangerous content” partly because online campaigns “undermined the prestige of the leaders of the party and the state.” Yet the proposed law itself may hurt the prestige of the state even more. As some legal experts have pointed out, the bill is too broad, notably because it goes beyond cybersecurity to lapse into actual control over content. Facebook and Google have also argued that there are ample mechanisms already in place to flag and remove content that violates local laws; and so there is no need to store data locally, which their systems were not designed for anyway. Vietnam routinely draws international criticism for its poor record on human rights, especially free speech — for strictly controlling print, radio and television news, and for muzzling blogglers. Passing this internet bill would hardly help its reputation. The law would also fly in the face of Vietnam’s commitments to various trade agreements, including under the World Trade Organization, and would likely unnerve foreign investors. In November, Vietnam celebrated the 20th anniversary of the internet’s arrival in the country. Blocking ever-popular social media platforms now would seem like a retrograde move — and to a time of fuller controls that never even was. It would also most certainly trigger a popular backlash. The government sees the internet as a source of instability, but regulating it more strictly may be a source of instability as well — and even in an authoritarian state like Vietnam, some measure of popular support is crucial to a regime’s longevity.",The New York Times
2017,"Vietnam, in a Bind, Tries to Chart a Path Between U.S. and China","HANOI, Vietnam — Vietnam’s full-on war with the United States lasted a decade. Its tensions with its northern neighbor, China, have persisted for thousands of years — from a millennium of direct Chinese rule and a bloody border war in 1979 to more recent confrontations in the South China Sea. If geography is destiny, then the fate of Vietnam is to be an expert in bargaining with Beijing and balancing between superpowers. So with the rest of the world struggling to reckon with China’s assertive moves in the Pacific, the Vietnamese, hosts of this year’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, are offering guidance. “I would like to give advice to the whole world, and especially to the United States, that you must be careful with China,” said Maj. Gen. Le Van Cuong, the retired director of the Institute of Strategic Studies at the Vietnamese Ministry of Public Security. Like any good Communist soldier, General Cuong pays attention to the details of leaders’ abstruse speeches, and he noted that President Xi Jinping of China had referred to his homeland’s status as a “great” or “strong power” 26 times in a lengthy address last month. “Xi Jinping’s ambitions are dangerous for the whole world,” General Cuong said. “China uses its money to buy off many leaders, but none of the countries that are its close allies, like North Korea, Pakistan or Cambodia, have done well. Countries that are close to America have done much better. We must ask: Why is this?” As with other Southeast Asian nations acutely aware that they are positioned in China’s backyard, Vietnam is worried about American inattention. In the name of halting Communism, the United States once sent troops to Indochina and propped up dictators elsewhere in Asia. But the American-devised security landscape also created a stable environment in which regional economies expanded. Now, Mr. Trump’s decision to take the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, which would have given 11 other economies an alternative to a Chinese-led economic order, has left the Vietnamese feeling vulnerable. “As Vietnamese, we are always trying to find a way to balance China’s power,” said Nguyen Ngoc Anh, a professor at the Foreign Trade University in Hanoi. “For us, TPP isn’t just an economic issue. It’s also about geopolitics and social issues.” Ms. Anh noted that local liberals had cheered the trade pact because it would have forced Vietnam to adhere to international labor and government accountability standards that Hanoi might otherwise not meet. With the 11 other members of the pact agreeing to proceed without the United States, Washington’s withdrawal — not to mention Mr. Trump’s “America First” speech at the APEC meeting on Friday — leaves some nations wondering if their best option may be Chinese-backed trade pacts and financing deals that have fewer guarantees for workers and less official transparency. “We are both Communist countries, but people like me in Vietnam don’t want to develop the same way that China has,” said Ms. Anh, who studied economics in Soviet-era Czechoslovakia. “We want to follow the Western-oriented way.” While the United States is the largest market for Vietnamese exports, Vietnam’s biggest trading partner is China. Yet Vietnam runs a significant trade deficit with its populous neighbor, and Vietnamese economists worry that China doesn’t play fairly. “China is one of the few countries in the world that doesn’t observe international law in many areas,” said Le Dang Doanh, an influential economist who has advised members of the Vietnamese Politburo on trade. The Vietnamese watched in alarm last year when Beijing reacted to an international tribunal’s dismissal of China’s expansive claims over the South China Sea by ignoring — and even mocking — the judgment. Vietnam and four other governments have claims of their own on the resource-rich waterway that conflict with China’s. It is hard to overstate the level of Vietnamese antipathy toward China. In a country where public protest is rare and risky, some of the few large-scale demonstrations in Vietnam in recent years have been against the Chinese. But this national aversion puts Vietnam’s leadership in a bind. It cannot ignore China’s growing economic magnetism. For many members of APEC, China now ranks as their No. 1 trading partner. In return for investment and project financing — roads, railways, dams, airports and colossal government buildings — leaders of regional economies are increasingly doing Beijing’s bidding. Cambodia and Laos have given crucial support for Beijing’s South China Sea claims. Thailand has complied with Beijing’s demand that it return Chinese dissidents who once counted on it as a haven. Even the Philippines has appeared to yield, despite the fact it lodged the successful South China Sea suit at The Hague. Days before Mr. Trump’s visit to Manila this Sunday, it disclosed that President Rodrigo Duterte had ordered construction halted on a disputed sandbar in the South China Sea, a move widely regarded as intended to placate Beijing. Since taking office last year, Mr. Duterte has deemed the era of American military and economic pre-eminence over, and has called China his country’s best and faithful friend. He has been rewarded with billions of dollars in infrastructure investment from Beijing. “The U.S. has been playing catch-up to China’s charm offensive since the turn of the new century,” said Tang Siew Mun, who heads the Southeast Asia center at the Iseas-Yusof Ishak Institute, a think tank in Singapore. Vietnam, more than any other country, has grown practiced at divining when not to challenge the two Pacific powers — both of which it fought within the last half-century. In the 1970s and 1980s, China seized spits of land in the South China Sea that Vietnam had controlled or that were unoccupied but claimed by Hanoi. Yet perhaps sensing an American reluctance to confront China in the South China Sea, Vietnam has declined to take China to international court, as the Philippines did, even as the Chinese have turned disputed reefs and sandbars into militarized islands. Chinese pressure continues, despite the United States’ supplying the Vietnamese Coast Guard with a cutter and new patrol boats. This year, a Spanish company with prospecting rights from Vietnam suspended drilling in an oil block off the coast of Vietnam. Beijing claims part of the waters as its own. In 2014, the Chinese parked a state-owned oil rig off Danang, where Mr. Trump attended the APEC summit meeting on Friday, in a forceful incursion into what Hanoi considers its territorial waters. “Living next to China, which has ambitions to become the most powerful country in the world, is not easy,” said Vo Van Tao, a popular political blogger. “To lower the heat, Vietnam needs to withdraw from areas that belong to Vietnam.” Grand strategy is beyond the worldview of Vietnamese like Do Van Duc. In 1979, he was stationed on the border with China, as part of an antiaircraft artillery unit, when hundreds of thousands of People’s Liberation Army soldiers from China flooded south. The Vietnamese, while outmanned, put up an unexpectedly robust defense. Within a month, the Chinese, professing that they had taught the Vietnamese a lesson for interfering in regional geopolitics, withdrew. During the war with China, Mr. Duc was only 17 years old, but he came to understand one thing then that today, as a security guard living in Hanoi, he said he still clings to. “We cannot trust the Chinese,” he said. “They are our ancient enemy, and that will not change.” An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified two ships shown in the South China Sea. A U.S. Navy cruiser is the vessel in the foreground, and a Chinese frigate is in the distance — not the other way around.",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Vietnam: The Chemical War,"Vietnam '67 Just before dawn on Nov. 18, 1967, the men of the Army’s 266th Chemical Platoon awoke to reveille and assembled in formation. The platoon was attached to the First Infantry Division, and the men were stationed at the division’s base, deep in the red-clay hills north of Saigon. The men had a typically busy day ahead of them. Their tasks included obtaining 15 drums of Agent Orange to defoliate the base perimeter, firing mortars at an area just outside the base for an evening chemical drop, working at the bomb yard to prepare 24 drums of CS tear gas, making 48 white phosphorus fuses to detonate the drums, loading the drums onto a CH-47 cargo helicopter, and finally, that afternoon, dropping 24 drums of the gas from the helicopter’s rear hatch onto a target site. It was, by 1967, just another day in the life of the 266th Chemical Platoon, and in the American war in Vietnam — a war that was, in many respects, a chemical war. It didn’t start that way. But as the conflict deepened, it became obvious that chemical weapons could play a critical role. In the case of the First Division, that realization came as the Viet Cong dug in north of Saigon with a network of underground bunkers and tunnels that were forbidding, dangerous spaces where conventional weapons would have limited effect. That fall, the 266th and other chemical platoons began training to use CS and other chemicals to support combat operations. CS wasn’t the only tool in the platoon’s arsenal, and going after tunnels wasn’t its only mission. It handled anything related to chemicals, from spraying for mosquitoes to burning trash. It sprayed defoliants like Agent Orange and prepared napalm. Chemicals were everywhere, and their proliferation in the American war effort raised concerns that the United States was crossing a line in Vietnam, violating the 1925 Geneva Protocol’s prohibition against the first use of chemical weapons in war. Chemical weapons didn’t suddenly appear in America’s Vietnam arsenal. In 1918, in response to German gas attacks in World War I, the military created the Chemical Warfare Service (renamed the Chemical Corps in 1947) to develop gas and biological weapons as a response to enemy attacks. They developed defensive measures to protect soldiers from chemical, biological or radioactive weapons via decontamination agents. The armed forces also developed nonmilitary uses of nonlethal chemicals. It supplied tear gas (xylyl bromide) to police forces in the 1920s and ’30s to disperse angry mobs. (British military scientists developed CS as a more potent replacement in the 1950s.) During World War II, the military played a pivotal role in pioneering new chemicals that were both horrifically destructive and lifesaving. After successfully testing gelled gasoline on Harvard’s soccer field, the military coordinated production of napalm in incendiary grenades, flamethrowers and the bombs dropped over cities such as Tokyo and Dresden, Germany. Chemical units spread a newly discovered insecticide, DDT, across Italian towns and in soldiers’ sleeping bags to control mosquitoes and ticks that carried malaria and typhus. In 1943, the military opened a chemical and biological weapons lab at Fort Detrick, Md., to centralize research. It was there that scientists in the Crops Division tested combinations of herbicides, including a precursor to Agent Orange made with a blend of the herbicides 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T. Scientists in the 1930s had discovered that those chemicals mimicked a plant’s growth hormone, but they had been unsuccessful in harnessing its growth-inducing powers. Then in 1943, a botanist notified the Army that increased dosages turned the chemical into a plant killer, and the synthetic organic herbicide was born. Scientists at Fort Detrick tested the herbicides for possible use over the tropical vegetation covering Japanese-held islands in the Pacific, but the war ended before they could ramp up production. While the Chemical Corps continued to test all chemicals for military uses in the 1950s, it did so amid a postwar economic boom during which many of the same products became commercially available. Farmers, gardeners and groundskeepers used the newly available chemicals in their domestic “wars” against pests. The two herbicides in Agent Orange, 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T, were not secrets; rather, they were two of the most popular, widely available herbicides on the market. The government declassified its research on pesticides almost immediately in 1945, opening development for commercial markets. In May 1945, a chemist at the American Chemical Paint Company near Philadelphia received a patent simply titled “Herbicides,” listing over a dozen preferred chemical formulas including a 50-50 mix of 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D similar to Agent Orange. (He later claimed that he developed this blend to kill poison ivy, as his son was acutely allergic.) In 1948, the Department of Agriculture registered those new herbicides and insecticides as “economic poisons” and sales quickly took off. Because of this crossover identity in the 1960s, their use as offensive weapons in Vietnam drew little public reaction. Although the consequences of using herbicides like Agent Orange later became clear, they were always intended as nonlethal chemical weapons. The line was less clear with CS gas. Though it was officially intended to flush out tunnels, those caught inside were often asphyxiated, and even survivors suffered respiratory lesions. And there was no blurring of lines when it came to napalm. Men from the 266th platoon would net a dozen or more barrels of the gelled gasoline under a helicopter, which then flew several thousand feet above a target such as a bunker or camp. Once on target, the crew released the barrels. Fuses or strafing from nearby jets ignited the barrels just above the ground, releasing a giant fireball. Anything or anyone within several hundred yards was instantly incinerated while the firestorm sucked the oxygen out of tunnels and bunkers below. Chemical platoons began training in this new form of “combat support” in 1967, but after the Tet offensive in 1968 they were igniting thousands of gallons in “flame drops” every day. They had crossed the line. This rapidly intensifying use of chemicals in combat brought widespread international criticism, first from Communist countries but increasingly from American allies and eventually officials in the United States. Criticism had been building for years: When South Vietnamese helicopters began using 2,4,5-T to kill crops in Communist-controlled areas of the Vietnamese highlands in 1963, North Vietnam’s Liberation Radio accused the United States of violating the 1925 Geneva Protocol and likened the “poisonous spray” to Nazi gas chambers. But American leaders and their allies abroad paid little attention to these “poison” protests; military leaders countered the radio propaganda with South Vietnamese broadcasts explaining that the herbicides were harmless to humans and used commercially around the world. The international response, however, grew more serious with the CS drops. In 1966, a delegate from Hungary at the United Nations complained that the tactical use of the herbicides and CS in Vietnam was a blatant violation of the Geneva Protocol; he also noted that the United States had yet to join the protocol. With the advent of flame drops in 1968, the charges of chemical warfare continued to amplify and rattled the newly elected President Nixon. In November 1969, he pushed the Senate to ratify America’s commitment to the protocol, and he renounced first use of lethal chemicals (except napalm on military targets). While Nixon tried to assure the American public that napalm was not falling on civilians and that the herbicides in Agent Orange were safe, a report had surfaced in 1968 suggesting that the herbicide 2,4,5-T was highly toxic to animal fetuses. (Later research determined the toxicity stemmed from traces of the contaminant dioxin.) While chemical platoons continued pushing thousands of drums of CS and napalm out of helicopters in Vietnam, Nixon moved quickly to stem what he feared would be a domestic and international protest over a potentially toxic herbicide. The White House announced a partial ban on 2,4,5-T on April 15, 1970, and the Defense Department followed suit, banning all Agent Orange missions in Vietnam. Thousands of drums of the herbicide piled up at ports in the United States, at air bases in Vietnam and in small quantities at the drum yards of chemical platoons at Army camps. The military transferred the stockpile of Agent Orange in Vietnam, more than 25,000 drums, to Johnston Island in the Pacific in 1972, but the fate of CS and other chemicals at the camps was less clear. When American forces evacuated their camps and firebases at the war’s end, they again followed disposal manuals of the day: burning or burying unused or corrupted chemical stocks including CS, decontaminating agents, solvents and pesticides. The American military has never again used chemicals as extensively as it did in Vietnam. American military units no longer burn or bury chemical waste. But the legacy remains. Agent Orange destroyed the lives of thousands of Vietnamese and Americans. The international response to CS drops and flame drops set off heated discussions about the nature of chemical war that continues with debates over red lines, incendiaries and barrel bombs today. And caches of chemical weapons remain buried around Vietnam and on disused American sites around Southeast Asia and in the Pacific. America and Vietnam may be allies today, but few people on either side are willing to tackle the war’s total chemical footprint.",The New York Times
2017,Vietnamese Blogger Gets 7 Years in Jail for Reporting on Toxic Spill,"BANGKOK — A chemical spill that devastated the coast of central Vietnam last year claimed another casualty on Monday when a 22-year-old blogger was sentenced to seven years in prison for posting reports on the disaster. After a brief, closed trial in Ha Tinh Province, the blogger, Nguyen Van Hoa, was found guilty of spreading anti-state propaganda for producing videos and writing about protests over the toxic spill, news agencies reported. The discharge, which occurred when a new Taiwan-owned steel factory flushed cyanide and other chemicals through its waste pipeline, killed marine life and sickened people along a 120-mile stretch of coastline. It is one of Vietnam’s largest environmental disasters. Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch’s Asia division, denounced the verdict. “The sentencing of Nguyen Van Hoa shows how profoundly the government’s paranoid desire to maintain political control trumps notions of justice and human rights,” he said. He added: “How else can one explain that executives of an international firm that poisoned the ocean, ruining the coastal economy in four provinces, are free to go about their business while this idealistic young journalist is heading to prison for helping expose their misdeeds?” In June, a court sentenced another blogger, Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh, better known as Mother Mushroom, to 10 years in prison, also for blogging about the fish kill. Initially, the government provided little information about the spill, withholding the names of the toxic agents even from poisoning victims and the doctors who were treating them. The company, Formosa Ha Tinh Steel Corporation, a subsidiary of the giant Formosa Plastics Group, was eventually found to be responsible for the spill. It was ordered to pay $500 million for causing the catastrophe, and company officials apologized. Critics accused the government of attempting to protect the company, which they said had received a special deal from officials when acquiring prime coastal property for the factory. The toxic spill deprived coastal fishermen of their livelihoods and set off major protests along the central coast, which is unusual in tightly controlled Vietnam. Mr. Hoa, who was arrested in April, is one of a growing number of activists in Vietnam who use Facebook and other online platforms to post videos, photographs and commentary that are contrary to the government’s official position.",The New York Times
2017,Vikings Top Lions and Tighten Grip on N.F.C. North,"Vikings 30, Lions 23 Case Keenum stood in the pocket to take a hit, dipped his right shoulder to slip out of a sack and shuffled his feet to give his receivers more time to get open. Looking like a savvy winner instead of a journeyman, he picked apart Detroit’s defense with his arm and made plays with his legs to help the Minnesota Vikings beat the Lions, 30-23, on Thursday. Keenum threw for two touchdowns and ran for a score in the first half to give the Vikings a double-digit lead, and they went on to win a seventh straight game. They took a huge step toward winning the N.F.C. North by taking a three-game lead over the second-place Lions. Keenum, undrafted out of Houston in 2012, is suddenly 7-2 this season after going 9-15 in his time with the Houston Texans and the Rams. “I want to be great, and I have confidence in myself that I can be great,” he said. The Vikings signed him to be a backup, and he has made the most of his opportunities with Sam Bradford injured and Teddy Bridgewater recovering from a knee injury. Keenum was 21 of 30 for 282 yards, with both touchdown passes going to tight end Kyle Rudolph. “Case is amazing because he does so many small things to pick up first downs and keep drives alive,” Rudolph said. “Every time he finds a way to convert another third down, it means we’ve got three more plays to attack the defense. With the number of big-play guys we’ve got now, we can do a lot of damage with those three plays.” Detroit (6-5) made mistakes in every phase of the game, and Minnesota took advantage. Keenum’s first touchdown pass to Rudolph, a 1-yard strike in the first quarter, was made a little easier because the Lions had just 10 defenders on the field. Keenum scored on a 9-yard run later that quarter after Matthew Stafford fumbled while trying to hand off to Ameer Abdullah. A victory would have put the Lions a game behind Minnesota in the standings and given them a potential tiebreaker. Instead, the loss dealt a blow to their chances of making a second straight postseason appearance. “Don’t count us out just yet,” Detroit Coach Jim Caldwell said. “We’ve got a lot of football yet to play.” Xavier Rhodes sidetracked Detroit’s comeback hopes with an interception at the Detroit 37 late in the game. Detroit’s Darius Slay blocked a field goal with 1 minute 15 seconds left, and his teammate Nevin Lawson recovered the ball and ran it 77 yards into the end zone. However, the play was negated because Slay was offside, and the penalty quieted a roaring crowd. Minnesota wide receiver Adam Thielen, who had eight receptions for 89 yards, deflected credit to his quarterback. “Case Keenum is one tough human being,” he said. “When he’s hanging in there — giving you time to get open — you feel like you’re letting him down if you can’t do it. He’s willing to get crushed to make a play, and that makes us want to come though on our end.” Everson Griffen had two sacks for the Vikings, tying his career high with 12 on the season. Stafford struggled even before he was hurt late in the game, missing open receivers and finishing 20 of 35 for 250 yards with two touchdowns and an interception, which came on fourth down with just under three minutes left. Marvin Jones had six catches for 109 yards and two touchdowns. The Lions were held to a total of 53 yards rushing.",The New York Times
2017,Viktoria Rebensburg Beats Mikaela Shiffrin in a World Cup Giant Slalom,"KILLINGTON, Vt. — With an unrelenting charge in the final 100 yards, Viktoria Rebensburg of Germany on Saturday won her second consecutive World Cup giant slalom of the season, surging past the American Mikaela Shiffrin by 67-hundredths of a second. Four weeks ago, Rebensburg, the 2010 Olympic champion in giant slalom, also won the World Cup season-opening race in Sölden, Austria. “I knew I would have to push hard all the way to the bottom because I knew Mikaela would, and did,” said Rebensburg, who was the last racer out of the gate after Shiffrin had surged into the lead seconds earlier. Rebensburg’s winning time after two runs was 1 minute 57.63 seconds. Manuela Moelgg of Italy was in third place. For Shiffrin, Saturday’s runner-up finish was a comeback performance after a disappointing fifth place in Sölden. “This is a step in the right direction after Sölden,” said Shiffrin, last season’s winner of the women’s overall World Cup title. “I felt confident today.” Shiffrin blamed herself for the Sölden result, saying she had not raced with the same precision as she had in training, something she called a mental mistake. But, she said, coming from behind for a while may be to her advantage. “Right now, I’m still feeling like I’m chasing, which is my favorite place to be,” Shiffrin said. Shiffrin will have another opportunity for her first victory of the season on Sunday when she races in her specialty, the slalom. Shiffrin, whose formative years as a ski racer were spent in New England, will once again be the hometown favorite of the huge crowds that have flocked here to the Killington resort since last year, when World Cup racing returned to the Eastern United States for the first time in a quarter-century. On Saturday, Killington officials said the crowds that filled two grandstands numbered about 18,000, which would make the race one of the best attended on the women’s Alpine circuit in several years.",The New York Times
2017,Vince Gill Loves All Kinds of Guitars (and Mountains),"Q&A “I’m just an overgrown cheerleader for cool, old guitars,” said Vince Gill, the Grammy-winning country star and songwriter. “They shaped my life. They’re my DNA. They’re my whole reason for making me want to be musical.” That passion led Mr. Gill to join the new Songbird Guitar Museum as ambassador, which primarily involves helping bring attention to the museum. Tucked into the Chattanooga Choo Choo complex in the southern Tennessee city, the museum houses a massive collection of rare and vintage guitars that showcases the evolution of the instrument. “It’s fun to be around other people who are that interested in guitars,” Mr. Gill said. “They’re just like art, but they make a joyful noise. When something can be that beautiful and entice you to write a song, it’s game over for me.” Below are edited excerpts from a conversation with Mr. Gill. Tell me what you like about the Songbird Guitar Museum. It was a private collection and no one really knew about it. The [anonymous] gentleman that started it has been amassing it for twenty years. It’s just stunning. It’s all really top-notch, high-quality instruments. They’re instruments that shaped our musical history. They have prototypes of great Fenders. They have the custom colors that Gibson did every once in a while. They were like a great paint job on an old car. They have a D45, which is considered the holy grail of acoustic guitars. There are some that are so rare it’s just something to see. Why Chattanooga? It is an out-of-the-way place. But this area of the world is pretty historic. Country and blues has deep roots in this whole region. And it’s where the guy lives that acquired the collection. It’s neat that he’s willing to share and doing something for the community. I think there are a lot of great museums in places you wouldn’t expect. There’s the National Music Museum in South Dakota. And there’s a new one in Nashville at Belmont University [the Gallery of Iconic Guitars]. What are some of your other favorite museums? I’m not really the museum type. Unfortunately. The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland is pretty cool. I was just in my hometown, Oklahoma City, and they have a cowboy museum [National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum] that was interesting. Here in Nashville we’ve got the Frist museum, which is wonderful. It’s a funky little thing. The Country Music Hall of Fame is my absolute favorite. I’m so astounded by what they’ve accomplished there. They just made it free for all kids under 18. It has a big education component to it. It’s a beautiful space. Nashville is home for you. What are some of your other favorite spots there? I go to eat breakfast at the same place every morning. It’s called Noshville. Everyone’s on a first-name basis. It’s “Cheers” with a side of eggs. Do you have favorite restaurants when you’re on the road? I’m a pizza nut. If I go to New York all I eat is pizza. The first job I ever had was making pizza as a kid. I don’t eat it much around here, but when I go to New York I’ll have it for breakfast and dinner. In Oklahoma City, I go to Ted’s Escondido. It’s about my favorite Mexican meal. You travel a lot for your tours. What’s the best and worst part of working the road? The best part is that you’re knocking around on a bus with your friends. You’re laughing a lot. You’re playing music every night. It’s completely intoxicating. There’s nothing better. The downside is your family life. You don’t get to have as much time with them as you’d like. But no whining allowed. Where are your favorite places to perform? There’s Red Rocks in Colorado. It’s one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever played music. The Gorge in Washington State is a magnificent place. I’ve gotten to play Carnegie Hall, Royal Albert Hall. I’ve played a few ballparks over the years: Wrigley Field, Comiskey Park and Dodger Stadium. The Troubadour in Los Angeles is a historic place where a lot of people got started — James Taylor, Linda Ronstadt. It was neat to play there 30 or 40 years later. It’s nice when something holds a great memory for you — a place, a friend. Every Monday night I play in a 10-piece band, the Time Jumpers, at 3rd and Lindsley [in Nashville]. It’s fun when you can be part of a place that’s a destination. But our Ryman Auditorium is probably my favorite place to play. There’s something magical about how music sounds in that place. It’s a tabernacle. [Mr. Gill and Ms. Grant play a series of “Christmas at the Ryman” concerts in November and December.] Where would you like to go again? I played at a cowboy bar in Jackson Hole, Wyo., for a few weeks when I was 18 or 19. I went out on the river. That mountain climate was magical. About two years ago Amy [Grant, Mr. Gill’s wife] and I went back and spent four or five days there. I went back to the bar, bought a T-shirt and told him I played here in 1976. It was really neat to reminisce. And the mountains were still magical.",The New York Times

2017,"Violence Against Transgender People Is on the Rise, Advocates Say","On Oct. 21, a body was found off a county road west of Corpus Christi, Tex., with bullet wounds to the chest, abdomen and shoulders. The victim was Stephanie Montez, a transgender woman. But because the police misidentified her as a man, it was not until last week that Ms. Montez, 47, was known to be among the more than two dozen transgender Americans killed this year. Even as transgender people have scored political victories and turned public opinion in favor of more protections, violence has risen, especially against black and Hispanic transgender women. And Ms. Montez’s case shows the difficulties advocates face in tracking killings and other hate crimes. The full death toll is impossible to determine, but by rights groups’ estimates, each of the past three years has become the deadliest on record. The Human Rights Campaign has documented the killings of 25 transgender people in the United States so far in 2017, compared with 23 last year and 21 in 2015. Other organizations, like Glaad and the Transgender Law Center, have slightly different tallies, but the trend holds. Transgender people have been killed this year in Chicago and in Waxahachie, Tex.; in the Ozarks of Missouri and on the sidewalks of Manhattan. They have been shot, stabbed, burned and, in at least one case, pushed into a river. On average, one to two have been killed somewhere in the United States every week. And experts say these numbers almost certainly understate the problem. Local officials are not required to report such killings to any central database, and because the police sometimes release incorrect names or genders, it can be difficult to know that a homicide victim was transgender. So advocacy groups are left to comb news reports and talk to victims’ friends or family. Even so, Sarah McBride, a spokeswoman for the Human Rights Campaign, said the rough numbers strongly indicate that violence against transgender people is increasing. Beverly Tillery, the executive director of the New York City Anti-Violence Project, said that since the 2016 presidential election, her organization had recorded “a spike in incidents of hate violence” — both homicides and other crimes — against transgender people as well as members of the broader gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community. “There is an increased climate of hate that is, in some cases, being allowed to grow,” Ms. Tillery said. Advocates say the violence is inseparable from the social climate: that anti-transgender violence and anti-transgender laws — like so-called bathroom bills, which aim to police who may use gender-specific public facilities — are outgrowths of the same prejudice. Sixteen states have considered bathroom bills this year (though none have passed), and six have considered legislation to invalidate local anti-discrimination protections, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Advocates also point to actions by the Trump administration, including the rescinding of federal protections for transgender students, an effort to bar transgender troops and a Justice Department decision to stop applying workplace discrimination protections to transgender people. Yet the administration did help with the successful prosecution of a man accused of killing Kedarie Johnson, a gender-fluid Iowa teenager. “The same stigma and the same sort of fear that is trying to be embedded in our society are the driving factors of the extreme forms of violence that are taking place,” said Isa Noyola, deputy director of the Transgender Law Center. “A lot of these cases are happening in regions where there are a lack of protections and there’s a lack of understanding and infrastructure for trans folks to live their daily lives.” In some sense, experts said, the increased awareness that leads to more acceptance also draws the attention of would-be perpetrators. “There’s no question that transgender people and the trans community have seen an increase in our profile and in our visibility,” Ms. McBride said. “In many cases, that is a good thing. It results in more hearts and minds opening. It allows for progress legally, socially.” But it may also stir up violent opposition, she said. Almost all the murder victims in the past several years have been nonwhite women. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, the annual murder rate for Americans ages 15 to 34 is about one in 12,000. But an investigation by the news organization Mic found that for black transgender women in the same age group, the rate was one in 2,600. “We know that when transphobia mixes with misogyny and racism, it can often have fatal consequences,” Ms. McBride said. Yet Ms. Noyola also said the brutality had brought the community together in a powerful way. “That resilience and that power and that wisdom,” she said, “is also a part of the story.”",The New York Times
2017,Violence Flares as Nepal Heads to Landmark Elections,"KATHMANDU, Nepal — Days before Nepal’s most important elections in years, Maoist militants have opened fire on politicians, blown up vehicles, planted land mines and targeted civilians in dozens of attacks, injuring at least 17 people, some seriously. “We want this election to be dismissed,” said Om Prakash Pun, a leader of a splinter political party leading the attacks. This month’s elections, held in two stages starting on Sunday, will fill hundreds of positions at the national and regional levels in what political observers call the largest democratic exercise ever in this small Himalayan nation. Nepal, a landlocked country between China and India, has struggled to maintain stability in the past two decades. In 2006, an insurgency led by Maoist sympathizers ended after rebels agreed to a peace agreement and the country transitioned from monarchy to democracy. More than 17,000 people had been killed over 10 years of fighting. But political discord delayed the adoption of a constitution until September 2015. By then, a series of devastating earthquakes had rattled the country, killing nearly 9,000 people and destroying hundreds of thousands of homes. Nepal has found it hard to rebuild from the quakes, in part because top leaders rotate out of their positions quickly, leading to chronic instability. Nepal has had 10 prime ministers in less than a decade. But despite the instability and violence, the voting has been seen as a potential bright spot. This year, Nepal held local elections for the first time in two decades. Now, voters are set to fill more than 800 seats in Nepal’s Parliament and state assemblies. “They’re a huge milestone in the country’s history,” Bhojraj Pokharel, the former chief election commissioner, said of the elections, calling them part of “a transformation from the old Nepal to a new Nepal.” Activists hope that new leaders will deliver justice to thousands of victims who filed wartime grievances after the end of the Maoist insurgency. To date, only a handful of verdicts have been reached, in part because many politicians in power today were involved in the fighting. Ahead of the elections, K.P. Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal, two former prime ministers who belong to communist parties, have formed a coalition. Shifting allegiances are common in Nepal, but the coalition surprised some here because Mr. Dahal had aligned himself with the current prime minister, Sher Bahadur Deuba, during this year’s local elections. In an interview, Mr. Pun, the Maoist leader, said the attacks his party organized this month were in protest against leaders like Mr. Dahal, who led the Maoist insurgency. Mr. Pun said Mr. Dahal, whose nom de guerre is Prachanda, or “the fierce one” in Nepali, has backed away from more revolutionary ideas in order to appeal to voters. “Right now, our strategy is to target political leaders,” Mr. Pun said, adding that the thousands of members of his party, the Nepal Communist Party, want to replace the country’s parliamentary government with a socialist one committed to “peace, prosperity, equity and sovereignty.” So far, the attacks have been confined to districts that border Kathmandu, home to a few million people. Mr. Deuba said he has taken extra security steps, and Nepal’s home ministry is deploying 300,000 security officers near voting sites. From his hospital bed, Bhes Kumar Tamang, 30, said he was traveling outside Kathmandu to an event organized by the Nepali Congress party when his vehicle was blown up. He said his injuries would prevent him from traveling to a polling site on Sunday, but he hoped that other Nepalis would vote. “We need to make this election a success,” he said. “This is the need of our time.” Sarita Rai, 28, who was on her way to a political rally in southern Nepal when she and her 7-year-old son, Jaibek, stepped on a land mine, wondered how she would go on. Sobbing, Ms. Rai described being blown into the air with her son, who suffered fractures to his hand, arm, forearm and leg, and underwent surgery to remove stones embedded in his skin. Ms. Rai lost her left leg in the explosion. “I do not know how I am going to survive this,” she said.",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Virginia Makes Every Voter Count,"Editorial Those who still doubt that their vote can make a difference should take a look at last week’s elections in Virginia. In House District 94, which includes Newport News, almost 24,000 people went to the polls; the Republican and Democratic candidates there are separated by just 10 votes. The race appears to be headed for a recount, as do those in two other districts where the margin of victory is in the dozens. With control of the Virginia House of Delegates in the balance, literally every vote counts. That’s particularly exciting in Virginia, where more than 40,000 previously disenfranchised citizens were registered to vote this year, many for the first time. Virginia was, until recently, one of four states — along with Kentucky, Iowa and Florida — that still impose a lifetime ban on voting by people with felony convictions. The only recourse is a personal reprieve from the governor, which happened last year when Gov. Terry McAuliffe restored the voting rights of more than 168,000 Virginians with criminal records. One quarter of those — about 42,000 people — registered to vote in time for this year’s election. Bringing so many people back into the electorate, or encouraging them to participate for the first time, is a good thing, period. It’s also yet another reminder of the pointless cruelty of felon disenfranchisement laws, which block more than six million Americans from voting — more than the population of 31 states. Since African-Americans are overrepresented in the criminal justice system, it’s no surprise that black citizens of voting age are shut out of the polls at four times the rate of nonblacks. Before Governor McAuliffe stepped in, more than one in five black Virginians were barred from voting. Today’s defenders of felon voting bans would call this a coincidence, but it’s impossible to separate the bans from their racist roots. In Southern states, white political leaders used to make the connection explicit. As one said during Virginia’s constitutional convention in 1902, the intent was to “eliminate the darkey as a political factor in this state in less than five years, so that in no single county in the commonwealth will there be the least concern felt for the complete supremacy of the white race in government affairs.” Especially in light of this history, it’s shameful that Republican lawmakers in Virginia fought to stop Mr. McAuliffe, suing him for overstepping his authority after he initially granted a blanket restoration to more than 200,000 Virginians with felony convictions. The Virginia Supreme Court agreed, albeit for dubious reasons, and required the governor to issue any restorations case by case, which he promptly and wisely did. So why the Republican resistance to what is clearly the right move by Mr. McAuliffe? It’s a mix of self-interested politics and race. People coming out of prison are disproportionately black, and blacks tend to vote overwhelmingly for Democrats. But there’s no clear evidence of a partisan skew in voting by people coming out of prison. And even if there were a demonstrable Democratic bias, that would be no reason to deny someone the right to vote. (It’s worth pointing out that felon disenfranchisement was an issue in the Virginia governor’s race this year, and the candidate who campaigned on the horrors of restoring the vote to “violent felons and sex offenders” lost by 9 points.) The bottom line is that this shouldn’t be a partisan issue. By an overwhelming majority, Americans of all political stripes support voting by those who have paid their debt to society. In recent years both liberal and conservative states have made it easier to restore the right to vote, on the understanding that disenfranchising people with criminal records serves no purpose other than to keep them at the edges of society. In Virginia, it was a Republican governor, Bob McDonnell, who took the important first steps toward restoring voting rights on a large scale. Maine and Vermont allow people to vote while they are still incarcerated, and no one is contending that this has led either state to collapse into a lawless hellscape. America has plenty of problems with its electoral system, but too many people voting is not one of them. Whoever wins the contested House races in Virginia, the fact that tens of thousands of new voters were able to participate is a win for everybody.",The New York Times
2017,"Opinion | Virginia Rejects Your Hateful Politics, Mr. Trump","Editorial Ralph Northam’s election as Virginia governor amid reportedly high turnout on Tuesday is a stinging and welcome rebuke to President Trump and white nationalism. Mr. Northam’s Republican rival, Ed Gillespie, an establishment operative, chose to dog-whistle himself breathless in pursuit of the state’s pro-Trump white voters, and the president attested to his make-America-great-again credentials. By late Tuesday, though, Mr. Trump was trying to sidle away from Mr. Gillespie, claiming that a candidate who sacrificed his own reputation to adopt the president’s style and positions in fact “did not embrace me or what I stand for.” Mr. Gillespie did, and he lost. Virginia and New Jersey, where Democrat Phil Murphy easily won the governor’s race, were the first statewide general elections since Donald Trump won the presidency a year ago, and Virginia, the only southern state Hillary Clinton won in 2016, was by far the more consequential of the two. Late Tuesday Democrats were also registering gains in the Virginia House of Delegates, suggesting strong disapproval of Mr. Trump at the grass roots. Having been nearly vanquished in the primary by Corey Stewart, an anti-immigrant conspiracy theorist who played on issues like preserving Confederate monuments, Mr. Gillespie, at the advice of Republican leaders, took up race-baiting. His ads, featuring menacing tattooed men, accused Mr. Northam of being “weak on MS-13,” the gang formed by Central American immigrants in Los Angeles that now threatens Virginia suburbs. They contained some of the darkest appeals in Tuesday’s off-year contests — and that’s saying something, given the Republican candidate ads that aired in places like Nassau County, N.Y., and New Jersey. Mr. Trump, who is traveling in Asia, waged one of his familiar Twitter smear campaigns against Mr. Northam on Tuesday, calling the pediatric neurologist and former Army doctor “weak on crime, weak on our GREAT VETS.” Democratic A-listers from President Barack Obama on down labored to put Mr. Northam over the bar. Mr. Northam was a lackluster campaigner in his own right. Despite mountains of post-2016 evidence that Democrats need to present voters with an inclusive and compelling economic message, he didn’t hone his own until late in the race. Then he lost support from the progressive wing of his party after he seemed to suggest he’d oppose sanctuary cities and, at the request of unions, omitted Justin Fairfax, his African-American running mate in the lieutenant governor’s race, from some campaign pamphlets. Mr. Gillespie’s choice to lay his principles on the altar of Trumpism made Mr. Northam’s win doubly important, as a triumph over the politics of racial division, and as a lesson for other Republicans tempted to adopt Mr. Trump’s vile tactics as their own.",The New York Times
2017,Virginia Restricts Protests at Lee Monument in Richmond After Clashes,"The State of Virginia imposed strict limitations on Monday on demonstrations at the Robert E. Lee statue in the state’s capitol, one of the oldest Confederate monuments in the country, after a string of clashes there. Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia announced the emergency regulations, which restrict crowd sizes at the Lee Monument to 500, down from 5,000, and ban guns at permitted events. The rules will also require permits for events there that draw at least 10 people. The regulations came out of a task force set up by the governor in August after a violent white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., where groups like the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis swarmed to protest that city’s decision to remove a statue of Robert E. Lee. After that rally, Confederate symbols on public lands across the country faced a new reckoning, attracting impassioned protesters calling for them to be removed and pushing cities to dismantle them, even in the dead of night. The Lee Monument in Richmond, erected in 1890 in the middle of a tree-lined roundabout on Monument Avenue in the capital, has been the site of clashes in recent months. Mr. McAuliffe said he enacted the limitations to protect public safety around the statue. The restrictions “will balance First Amendment rights and ensure that all Virginians remain safe,” the governor said in a statement. He added, “We believe these regulations can be a model for localities across Virginia as they consider how to approach these types of events in the future.” The emergency regulations will stay in place for 18 months while the state’s Department of General Services considers and finalizes a permanent resolution, and holds public hearings on the topic. The order applies only to the Lee Monument, which is on state property in the city. Five other monuments on the avenue are owned by the City of Richmond. Mr. McAuliffe’s opinion of the Confederate monuments in the state have changed in recent years. Two years ago, Mr. McAuliffe, a Democrat, insisted that the statues should stay in their places, saying they were “all parts of our heritage.” But he took a sharply different view after the clashes in Charlottesville, which resulted in the deaths of 32-year-old woman in a crowd hit by a car and two state troopers in a helicopter crash. He said then that Confederate monuments should be taken down and urged Virginia leaders to move them into museums. The Lee Monument, a popular attraction and focal point in Richmond, has been a landmark in the city for nearly 130 years. Former soldiers in the Confederate States Army began advocating to have a monument to Lee in Richmond in the early 1870s. After years of planning, the bronze statue of Lee, astride a horse atop a granite pedestal, was unveiled in 1890 in front of a crowd of up to 25,000 people. Descendants of Lee said in August that they were divided over whether his monuments should be taken down. “The war pitted brother against brother and cousin against cousin,” one family member said, “and we’re still at this today.”",The New York Times
2017,"Virginia Thoren, Artful Fashion Photographer, Dies at 97","Virginia Thoren, an advertising designer who had no formal training behind a camera but became a leading fashion photographer in New York and Paris in the mid-20th century, died on Oct. 27 in Manhattan. She was 97. Her death was confirmed by her friend and archivist Betty Guernsey. Embracing the preference of her mentor, Toni Frissell, for natural light and realistic settings, Ms. Thoren photographed Julie Andrews, Vivien Leigh, Lee Radziwill and other celebrities, as well as models like Carmen Dell’Orefice, Dorian Leigh, Barbara Mullen, Suzy Parker, Mary Jane Russell and Anne St. Marie in what she characterized as “relaxed portraiture” for magazine covers and advertisements. “She chased beauty through the eye of the camera,” Gaby Basora, the designer and owner of the Tucker clothing line, told the Council of Fashion Designers of America in an interview on its website this year. Beatrice Virginia Thoren was born on April 29, 1920, in South Orange, N.J., to Swedish immigrants. Her father, Julius Thoren, was a chauffeur. Her mother, the former Gerda Gustaffson, was a seamstress. She enrolled in a liberal arts curriculum at St. Lawrence University in upstate Canton, N.Y., but transferred to Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, where she earned a certificate in advertising design in 1942. Her work earned a certificate of excellence from the American Institute of Graphic Arts. Rejecting an offer from the Museum of Modern Art, she was hired by the art department of Vogue magazine, where she befriended Frank Crowninshield, the editor and art critic, became Ms. Frissell’s assistant and developed her affection for photography. While her artistic talent for watercolors and drawing was recognized when she was a child, she considered photography too technical. She later learned that shutter speeds and lens openings could be delegated to an assistant. “Virginia’s photographic style is unmistakable and easily recognized,” Patricia Cutright, of Central Washington University, wrote in a monograph on Ms. Thoren’s work in 2011. “She saw a good photograph as a marriage between photographer, assistant, model, light and location.” In 1944, Ms. Thoren joined the Manhattan advertising agency Albert Woodley & Company, which represented fashion and retail clients, including Christian Dior, Pierre Balmain and Emba furs. It was among the first agencies to regain a foothold in Paris after World War II. Armed with her Rolleiflex and Speed Graphic cameras, Ms. Thoren represented the agency in Paris as fashion coordinator and art director in 1946. She photographed Yves Saint Laurent’s first collection for Christian Dior. “You were a camera and eyewitness to a golden age — the rebirth of Paris after the war,” the New York Times photographer Bill Cunningham later wrote to Ms. Thoren. When a photographer missed an assignment to shoot the latest fall collections, she filled in and submitted her work to American and French magazines, which gladly published it. That lucky break helped start her career. She received a Certificate of Excellence from the American Institute of Graphic Arts in 1954. When Ms. Thoren returned to New York in the early 1950s, she opened her first studio, on East 25th Street in Manhattan. She later moved to a West Village brownstone, which became her studio and home. Her collection was curated by Ms. Guernsey and donated to the Pratt Institute Libraries in 2007. Her work is represented by June Bateman Fine Art in Manhattan. Ms. Thoren married Robert Rice, a former Navy fighter pilot, in 1960. Their marriage ended in divorce. (He died in 2006.) They had one son, Gordon, who died in 2010. No immediate family members survive.",The New York Times
2017,"Virginia, Texas, Roy Halladay: Your Tuesday Evening Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. It was Election Day, and the governor’s races in Virginia and New Jersey were being watched as the latest test of the Trump effect on voters. Democrats prevailed in both states. Lt. Gov. Ralph S. Northam won in Virginia, after urging voters to reject President Trump. And New Jersey elected Philip D. Murphy, a former Wall Street banker with no experience in office. We’re also watching elections in New York and Utah, among other places. We have live results here. Above, voting in Arlington. _____ 2. President Trump was in South Korea, where he assured anxious officials that the region’s nuclear standoff “will all work out.” Instead of threatening muscular pre-emptive action against the North, Mr. Trump said he prayed that using military force would not be necessary. Above, Mr. Trump with President Moon Jae-in. Next step on the tour: China. _____ 3. During his news conference in Seoul, Mr. Trump was asked whether he would support “extreme vetting” of gun buyers, comparable to extra scrutiny for immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries, which he has said is necessary to combat terrorism. He replied that stricter gun laws would not have prevented the Texas shooting, and could have driven the death toll into the hundreds, since the gunman was shot by an armed bystander before later killing himself, officials said. More details emerged about the suspect, who was reported to have escaped from a psychiatric facility in 2012. We looked at the data on why the U.S. has so many mass shootings. The answer, it turns out, is lying in plain sight. And today on our podcast “The Daily,” we look at why a domestic violence conviction did not stop the suspect from buying weapons. _____ 4. A congressional committee investigating Russian election meddling released a transcript of a seven-hour interview lawmakers conducted last week behind closed doors with Carter Page, above, a former foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign. Mr. Page’s testimony revealed new information about who in the campaign knew about a trip he took to Russia in the summer of 2016, what Mr. Page reported back to the campaign, and what other trips he took around that time. Here are the key excerpts and takeaways. _____ 5. Our latest article in the “Paradise Papers” series is an inside look at the hideaways used by billionaires, celebrities and political donors to conceal their cash. The papers, a trove of more than 13 million leaked documents from the law firm Appleby, were made public by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in partnership with nearly 100 media organizations around the world. We spent months poring over them and found that the records shed light on the trillions of dollars that move through offshore tax havens, depriving public coffers while enriching the ultrarich. Here’s a guide to our coverage. _____ 6. The House Ways and Means Committee heard debate on the Republican tax bill, which is expected to clear the committee on Thursday and go up for a vote next week. But opposition to the bill is building. An analysis by the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation found that the plan’s tax cuts for lower- and middle-income taxpayers would fade over the course of a decade, more so than they would for high earners. The Senate is expected to introduce its own version of the bill on Thursday. _____ 7. In Britain, about a dozen members of Parliament are under investigation for sexual misconduct after a torrent of accusations spurred by the Weinstein case. Complaints had accumulated for years, in part because young staffers had no independent agency to bring them to. Michael Fallon, above, stepped down as defense secretary last week, saying he had “behaved inappropriately in the past.” The movie mogul Harvey Weinstein hired private detectives, lawyers and undercover agents to try to scuttle articles about accusations of sexual harassment and assault against him, The New Yorker reported. _____ 8. Syria agreed to sign the Paris climate agreement, making the U.S. the only country that has rejected the pact. The announcement was made during U.N. climate talks in Bonn, Germany. Above, placards installed at a park in Bonn. And in India, where pollution is rampant, the toxic haze blanketing New Delhi, from burning crops and other pollutants, was so severe this week that an official said the city had “become a gas chamber.” _____ 9. Roy Halladay, one of baseball’s best pitchers in the last 20 years, died in a plane crash off the coast of Florida. He was 40. He had starred for the Toronto Blue Jays and the Philadelphia Phillies before he retired in 2013. His 16-year career included two Cy Young Awards. He had been alone aboard an Icon A5 registered in his name. He was known for his love of flying, and posted photos of the plane last month, writing that he had dreamed of owning one since retiring. _____ 10. “She dumped me.” That was the first line of our first Modern Love column, published on Oct. 31, 2004. In the 13 years since, the editors have received more than 80,000 submissions. In celebration of its anniversary, we’ve put together a collection of the column’s greatest hits. And we have updates about some of them, including the famously controversial 2005 essay by Ayelet Waldman, in which she declared that she loved her husband more than her children. We also offer a slew of new essays about love, in all its messy permutations, and a data analysis of the word choices used by male and female writers. There were some striking differences. _____ 11. Finally, the late-night TV hosts had some fun with President Trump’s travels in Asia. “Following the president’s trip, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will then kick off his own 13-day trip to apologize for everything Donald Trump says,” James Corden joked. Conan O’Brien continues his run of shows from the Apollo Theater. His guest on Tuesday is Keegan-Michael Key, best known for the sketch show “Key & Peele” with Jordan Peele. (11 p.m., TBS.)

2017,Opinion | Virginia’s Election and Trump’s Whupping,"David Leonhardt This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. President Trump’s critics and admirers have both often wondered whether most of the normal rules of politics apply to him. Trump, in his own graphic way, may have summarized the view best: “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn’t lose any voters, O.K.?” But it turns out that the normal rules of politics do indeed apply to Trump. With his approval rating at a paltry 38 percent, Trump’s Republican Party took a whupping. It’s not just that the Democrats easily won the highest-profile race — the Virginia governorship. Democrats enjoyed a stunningly good night across the country. Consider: • Defying virtually all expectations, Democrats flipped more than a dozen of the 100 seats in Virginia’s house of delegates and, pending final vote counts, may have won control of it. • They won full control — legislature and governorship — in both New Jersey and Washington State. • Maine’s Republican governor has repeatedly vetoed Medicaid expansion. Maine’s voters effectively overrode his veto, by referendum, in a landslide. • Democrats won two traditionally Republican legislature seats in special elections in Georgia. • Last night’s results continue a trend. Democrats have done startlingly well in special elections this year, often in conservative districts. As significant as all these wins are in their own right, they will also help shape the political future. Already, multiple House Republicans have announced their retirement, including two more yesterday. Idaho and Utah may now follow Maine and hold referendums on expanding Medicaid. Progressives will be energized to find candidates to run in traditionally Republican areas. (That last point was crucial last night. Too often, Democrats have conceded tough districts by not even fielding a candidate.) Donald Trump remains the most powerful person in the country, if not the world. But the election results show that he also remains the weakest first-year president in modern history. In The Times. Frank Bruni and the editorial board offered their takes. Elsewhere. “Enthusiasm matters,” writes The Atlantic’s Ronald Brownstein, noting that Ralph Northam, Virginia’s governor-elect, earned about 330,000 more votes than his predecessor had in 2013. It wasn’t just that Democrats won up and down the ticket but which Democrats won, notes Time’s Charlotte Alter. “A trans woman beat the guy who introduced the bathroom bill. A gun victim’s boyfriend beat a delegate with an ‘A’ grade from the NRA. A civil rights lawyer who sued the police department just became the top prosecutor in Philadelphia,” she tweeted. White, rural areas of Virginia largely backed Ed Gillespie, the Republican, but were swamped by suburban and urban turnout for Northam. “The data out of SW VA suggest maybe you can turn your campaign into a McTrump franchise,” noted the pollster Kristen Anderson, “but that’s of limited value in a state Trump lost.” “With all the evidence in front of us, Democrats are slight favorites to retake the U.S. House in 2018,” argues FiveThirtyEight’s Dave Wasserman. (Also: I’m grateful to Daniel Nichanian of the University of Chicago, for his smart election analysis on Twitter.) How Trumpworld reacted: Sean Hannity, whose Fox show airs at 9 p.m. EST, devoted just six seconds of coverage — six seconds! — to the Virginia and New Jersey results, dismissing them as “not states Donald Trump won.” Hannity carried President Trump’s 34-minute speech to South Korea’s National Assembly live and in full. “Pundits are calling Tuesday’s results a repudiation of Trump,” wrote Breitbart’s Joel Pollack. “It would be more accurate to point out that, once again, the Republican establishment came up short.” The website’s home-page headline echoed Trump’s late-night effort to distance himself from Gillespie’s loss, branding Gillespie a “Republican swamp thing.” Throughout the campaign, Breitbart praised Gillespie for incorporating Trumpist messages.

2017,Virtual Reality Companies Are Changing How Athletes See Practice,"Stanford kicker Jet Toner drags his right foot on the ground, then taps it twice. He looks down at the football in front of him and visualizes a line extending to the white poles 40 yards ahead. Defensive players shake out their quads and bend into squats in front of him, their hamstrings screaming from the second practice of the day. Sweat darkens their practice jerseys. The holder crouches, pats the grass with two fingers — the “go ahead.” Toner wiggles his right shoulder and turns his right wrist a few times, as he always does before field goal attempts. He tilts forward in anticipation, his eyes locked on the football. He exhales, springs lightly onto his left foot, and then takes two bounding hops before swinging a locked, pointed foot just below the holder’s fingers. He only narrowly avoids nailing his foot into the wall. This is Stanford’s virtual reality training room: a little glass box above the locker room where a virtual reality headset — a foamy black box flanked by three limp elastic headbands — dangles midair, suspended by a thick black cord. A desktop computer displays VR footage simulations used by almost every player position. Toner picks a simulation, clicks “Play” and slides goggles down his face. Instantly, high definition pixels surge out of the black vacuum. His flip-flops melt into cleats; his brain believes he is back at practice. He can pivot 180 degrees and watch Coach David Shaw making clipboard tallies, or look straight ahead and count a lineman’s eyelashes. This training VR is not animated — it’s real video. “I was pretty blown away by how immersive it was,” Toner says. “I was hesitant it would be helpful. After using it I was like, ‘Wow, this is a whole different angle that you just don’t get when you’re watching a typical film with your coach.’” Since 2015, sports virtual reality has expanded beyond college football to become the sparkly new training toy for professional programs in the N.F.L., N.H.L., N.B.A., M.L.B. and Japanese baseball leagues. The industry pioneers — EON Sports VR and STRIVR — both grew out of college football. Shaw was one of the first coaches to adopt STRIVR in 2015 and is now an investor. Toner kicks field goals on real-life fields while an unwieldy contraption — what appears to be six GoPros welded together into a 360 degree video camera — records by his shoulder. Then, Toner can relive kicks using a VR headset. He converted 15 of his first 17 field goal attempts and all 33 extra points through eight games in his first season starting at Stanford. As the N.C.A.A. and N.F.L. increasingly restrict the frequency of so-called hitting practices, virtual reality training is providing a contact-free way to keep players sharp. “It’s one of the reasons STRIVR was so successful to begin with, especially in college teams,” says Shawnee Baughman, the company’s product manager. “I think the N.C.A.A. coaches are really excited to be able to use a tool that allows their players more practice without breaking practice regulation rules, fatiguing them or injuring them.” For all the industry enthusiasm, VR’s record is rife with letdowns. Since the ’90s, almost every round of virtual reality hype has disappointed. Unresolved issues of motion sickness, fuzzy graphics and clunky equipment sabotaged almost any sense of “reality.” It simply wasn’t cool enough for its price. Today, VR once again demands the tech world’s attention, thanks to investments from Facebook, HTC, Valve and Samsung. Yet while VR costs are decreasing, it’s still not easy on budgets. Adopting STRIVR costs between $50,000 and $150,000; EON Sports’ products start at $5,000 and hit an undisclosed “much more than that” on the high end, according to chief executive Brendan Reilly. For pro sports programs, VR must prove more useful than a handful of interns or new weight room equipment. For quarterbacks, VR is a decision-making incubator — a playbook with moving X’s and O’s. Before quarterbacks press play, their teammates are frozen, as if they’re in a personalized wax figure museum. A button clicks, and they bubble to life, jogging to predetermined positions. Quarterbacks train to spot defensive gaps and open receivers. Linemen train to spot blitzes, and safeties look for offensive tells. In bird’s-eye game film, plays are simplified, and correct decisions appear obvious. In VR, each snap is a kaleidoscopic human puzzle, with every piece constantly shifting positions, glaring, deceiving. “You can only get so much out of a traditional sideline anymore,” says Chas Petrone, Vanderbilt’s director of football video services, who also manages Vanderbilt’s sports VR. “You go down, you put the headset on and you’re almost going up against the defense again. It’s decreasing your reaction time and making you that much better on the field.” The brain’s reflex center believes VR experience is real. “It’s visualization times a million,” says Conrad Ukropina, Toner’s predecessor at Stanford. “Kicking is like golf. It’s like bowling. You want everything to be unconscious and muscle memory. The magic is the extra edge you can get.” Ukropina cites his most famous play as an example of virtual reality’s subconscious effects. In 2015, against the prickly cold of Thanksgiving weekend in Palo Alto, Calif., Notre Dame scored with 30 seconds left, submerging Stanford, 36-35. Then the Cardinal drove to field goal range. A Rose Bowl appearance teetered in the balance. “If we make it we win. If I miss it we lose,” Ukropina recalls thinking. “It was as big as a kick can get.” The holder tapped the ground twice. The kick happened to mirror Ukropina’s most-practiced simulation kick: a 45-yard field goal, from the center of the field. “It felt comfortable and looked familiar,” Ukropina says. “I didn’t think about it in the moment, but afterward I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, it was literally identical.’ It started conscious and moved into unconscious because I’ve done it so many times.” Ukropina’s kick threaded the uprights, and Stanford won, 38-36. Teammates hoisted him above the crowd as Cardinal fans flooded the field in red. But the potential for VR performance training extends beyond athletics to more mundane activities. In one simulation, it’s 5 a.m. in a Walmart vegetable aisle. An older woman — an actress — peruses the green peppers. First-time users wander around the store aimlessly, their eyes darting from frail, translucent produce bags to plastic carts brimming with butternut squash. They don’t know what they’re supposed to be looking for. “The problem is in the bottom row,” Baughman, STRIVR’s product manager, explains, her voice floating into the vacuum like a movie narrator’s. The carrots and the celery are stacked too high, and no cold air can get to the bottom vegetables. Customers won’t want moldy carrots. If Walmart employees are to pass this test, they must catch the mistake. In 10 years, virtual reality training could be everywhere — from kindergarten classrooms to NASA training centers. For some, it’s underwhelming; the black-rimmed fantasy gear of childhood dreams has finally materialized, only to shave seconds off player reaction-times at a cost of thousands of dollars. Derek Belch, the chief executive of STRIVR, and Reilly recognize the need to find uses appealing to average people — the ones who could never hit a field goal in virtual reality, much less daily life. “Eight months ago, no one would have been asking whether this was a fad, because there was so much coolness about it,” Reilly says. “Then there was this ‘Oh wait, once the hype wears off, why are we doing this? How can we measure real value?’”",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Vladimir Putin vs. the Token Women,"Op-Ed Contributor MOSCOW — In the early 1960s, the Soviet Union decided that the time was ripe to spice up its space program. Sputnik capsules and Vostok spaceships had sent dogs, rabbits and the cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin into orbit already. The Americans were lagging behind; the Kremlin wanted to stay ahead. Russia had a proposition: It would send a woman into space. On June 16, 1963, Valentina Tereshkova was jettisoned out of the earth’s atmosphere. “If women can be railroad workers in Russia, why can’t they fly in space?” she famously said later. Her flight came at the culmination of Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev’s thaw, a series of reforms that relaxed repression, ushered in change and propelled women to new status. Thus, the Soviet Union gave birth to the token Soviet woman: a convenient, one-size-fits-all woman who ticked the boxes of enlightened gender equality and appeased the Communist ideologists, for whom the abolition of capitalism included ending women’s exploitation. “You think we’re not advanced?” Soviets could say to the West. “But look how liberated our women are.” Can there be such a thing as two token women? In Russia’s presidential election next year, President Vladimir Putin is widely expected to run and win, which would extend his 18-year grip over Russia by another six-year term. But contesting him — sort of — is the 36-year-old television personality Ksenia Sobchak, the daughter of Putin’s late mentor, and a member of the opposition. Another familiar face from TV, the 37-year-old journalist and lawyer Yekaterina Gordon declared her candidacy two weeks after Sobchak’s mid-October announcement. (A handful of other candidates, too, including the 73-year-old leader of the Communist Party and five-time presidential contender, Gennady Zyuganov, have also announced bids.) At first glance, Ms. Sobchak and Ms. Gordon appear almost interchangeable; both are persuasive and articulate with wide grins and shoulder-length blond hair. From the start of her campaign, Ms. Gordon has sought to distance herself from her rival, saying that, unlike Ms. Sobchak, she was not “born with a silver spoon in my mouth.” (Ms. Sobchak comes from a political dynasty; her father, Anatoly, was mayor of St. Petersburg and her mother, Lyudmila Narusova, is a former deputy in the Federation Council, or upper house. Ms. Gordon was born to well-educated parents, but had a comparatively humdrum upbringing.) This year marks the first time a woman has declared her intention to run for Russian president in 13 years. In 2004, the role was played by Irina Khakamada, at the time a liberal politician. (She later became a member of Mr. Putin’s advisory Human Rights Council.) Before Ms. Khakamada, there was Ella Pamfilova, who in 2000 became the first woman in Russia to run for president in a long-shot campaign that she hoped would encourage others to come forward. Ms. Sobchak and Ms. Gordon are both running on pro-women platforms. Ms. Sobchak graced the cover of Russian Glamour in November, punching the air with her fist and wearing a T-shirt scrawled in English with the words “Women Power.” Inside the magazine, she bemoaned the country’s 30 percent gender pay gap and the sidelining of women in the workplace. “When you’re missing out on freedoms like speech and elections, gender equality takes last place,” she said in a long interview, interspersed with photos from a fashion shoot. Ms. Gordon, taking a leaf out of her Bolshevik foresisters’ playbook, has been championing the rights of women and children. “We are a country of single mothers whom no one cares for,” she said in a campaign video. Almost no one in Russia takes seriously the idea that either Ms. Sobchak or Ms. Gordon is truly attempting to challenge Mr. Putin. To get a place on the actual ballot that Russians will see in March, a candidate needs to collect 300,000 signatures in order to register — an almost impossible goal without the aid of the Russian government. This ensures that Mr. Putin will face off only against opponents of his choice. (Ms. Sobchak, in particular, is viewed as a Putin puppet.) Candidates must also have a political party; Ms. Gordon has yet to join one. So the question, in this case, is not why two women have finally decided to run for president in Russia but rather: Why does Mr. Putin want to run not only against women, but against women talking about feminist issues? The Kremlin is often seen in the West as a slick political machinator, but this image belies the truth. It follows broader societal currents as often as it leads. Big ideas are felt out; messaging is gleaned. And so, perhaps, the subject of women, and their place in Russian society, is in the air. There have been other signs that the government has been thinking about this issue: Last March, Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev unveiled a national strategy for improving the lives of women by 2022. The timing of the two women’s political entrance comes as Russia embraces a wave of traditionalism, one in which women have not fared well. In a move that won the backing of a resurgent Russian Orthodox Church, domestic violence legislation was softened earlier this year from a criminal to an administrative offense. (The bill was pushed by the same female lawmaker who advocated for the country’s anti-gay laws several years ago.) Abortion, which has been legal and common in Russia for decades, is also increasingly under attack, with the full support of the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, who wants the practice banned. But if Ms. Sobchak and Ms. Gordon were sent out to talk female power on the notion that the Russian public could be developing an appetite for women’s issues, it appears that the Kremlin may have misinterpreted. The campaigns of Ms. Sobchak and Ms. Gordon are hardly gaining any traction. Ms. Sobchak may have a following among young urban women, thanks to her TV presence, but according to the independent pollster Levada, less than 1 percent of Russians would vote for her. That could be because of gender: Earlier this year, a survey showed that 53 percent of Russians said they opposed having a woman as their president within the next 10 to 15 years; a third said the country had no women at present fit for the job. Their campaigns might also be failing to take off because the man viewed as the real opposition leader in Russia, the anti-corruption activist Aleksei Navalny, has been barred from running, because of a revived criminal conviction. (In recent days, in an attempt to discredit him, the women or all three, a popular meme has been circulating on Russian social media showing Ms. Sobchak and Ms. Gordon, heavily pregnant and posing naked beside a potbellied, bare-chested Mr. Navalny in swimming trunks.) Or maybe the Kremlin didn’t miscalculate after all. Generating any excitement amid the monotony of Russian politics — where the same man, representing the same party, has been in power for nearly two decades — is proving difficult. Two months ago, it was reported that the Kremlin was searching for female sparring partners for Mr. Putin to satisfy the “tired people” of the Russian electorate, who needed the diversion. In Soviet times, polling stations lured in voters with promises of discounted food, hoping to maximize turnout in elections everyone knew didn’t matter. Today, it appears that the Kremlin has expanded its toolbox: Efforts to feign an active and lively political culture have now been expanded to include “women.” On International Women’s Day last March, dozens of women protested in St. Petersburg and Moscow in a rare feminist demonstration. They held posters with “radical slogans,” according to state-run media. Among the signs? “Men, out of the Kremlin!” and, “A woman for president!” Someday, maybe. But not next year.

2017,Voices Grow Louder for Merger of Women’s Pro Hockey Leagues,"BOSTON — Members of Canada’s national women’s hockey team believe the answer is clear. So do their rivals on the United States roster. A stable of Olympic gold medalists and the National Hockey League agree too: it is time to seriously explore a unification of the Canadian Women’s Hockey League and National Women’s Hockey League, which is based in the United States. “We always talk about it — the best in the world have to merge,” Laura Fortino of Canada said last week before playing the United States in an exhibition game here. “We hope the commissioners of both sides come to that reality, that in order for women’s hockey to get to the peak where we want it to be, we all have to be playing with the best.” The C.W.H.L. opened its 11th season on Oct. 14, with its players earning a salary from the league for the first time and with two expansion teams in China. The N.W.H.L began its third season Saturday with the Metropolitan Riveters hosting a game at the Prudential Center in Newark, home of the N.H.L.’s Devils, who recently became part-owners of the Riveters. The C.W.H.L. continues to grow its network of sponsors, and select N.W.H.L. games will be streamed on Twitter beginning this season. But for many of women’s hockey’s influential voices, that these milestones are being reached along separate paths delays the sport’s reaching its potential. Cassie Campbell, a three-time Olympic medalist for Canada, is a renowned ambassador for women’s hockey and a broadcaster for Sportsnet. After the Devils’ deal with the Riveters was announced in early October, she praised it, but also tweeted that two leagues were not “helping us get to where we want to go.” Her viewpoint was supported by Angela Ruggiero, a four-time Olympic medalist for the United States, and Hilary Knight, a current member of the national team. “The questions should be asked to the Commissioners, who both know that two leagues do not help us in our long term goal of eventually having a WNHL,” Campbell, who is also a member of the C.W.H.L.’s board of governors, wrote in an email. “It has been clearly communicated to them at various meetings and discussions. However, the legal issues and personality conflicts that exist make it difficult for a merger, but not impossible.” Dani Rylan, the commissioner of the N.W.H.L., said she had approached the C.W.H.L. about staging a game between the league’s champions. “We’ve had conversations with the C.W.H.L. about the potential of playing maybe one game as a start to see what working together could look like, and there wasn’t much interest on that,” Rylan said. “We’re going to keep asking. I think that would be an amazing event for women’s hockey, and I think getting that one in the books would definitely make it easier to have a bigger conversation.” Brenda Andress, the C.W.H.L. commissioner, was not made available to comment, but a league spokeswoman said: “The C.W.H.L. has always believed that one league is essential for a sustainable, strategic plan for a professional women’s hockey league. It is for this reason that the C.W.H.L. Board and office worked with Ms. Rylan closely three years ago; however, she chose to start her own league,” referring to Rylan’s interest in bringing a New York-area expansion franchise to the C.W.H.L. in 2014. AJ Mleczko Griswold, who was a member of the American team that won in the first Olympic women’s hockey tournament in 1998, said the onus was on the leaders of the rival leagues to come together for the betterment of the game. “If people can sort of look past their immediate agenda and look at the broader picture in women’s hockey, then that merger will happen,” she said. Mleczko Griswold added that support from the N.H.L. was critical to developing the sport because the league’s avenues of exposure could increase the audience for women’s hockey. In statements since the creation of the N.W.H.L., officials from the N.H.L. have repeatedly questioned the viability of having two North American women’s professional hockey leagues. Olympians from the United States and Canada will not play in either league this season until at least after the Pyeongchang Games in February, but a majority of those players, the game’s top stars, have said they would like to come back to one league. “What that one single league could be is amazing hockey,” said Jocelyne Larocque, who has played in the C.W.H.L. since 2012. “It’s hockey people would come and watch, people would pay to watch. It would be a true national women’s hockey league. Right now, neither of them are.” The leagues have had an icy relationship since Rylan formed the N.W.H.L. in 2015 and several players from the C.W.H.L.’s Boston franchise, including American Olympians, jumped to the new league, which was the first to offer salaries. The N.W.H.L. created its own team in Boston, and as a result, the C.W.H.L.’s Boston club has experienced a dramatic drop in attendance. The two leagues briefly joined forces two years ago to play an outdoor exhibition game as part of the N.H.L.’s Winter Classic festivities at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass., but that event was almost scrapped as the sides argued over arrangements. In an interview in March, Hayley Wickenheiser, who played in the C.W.H.L. and is one of the sport’s greatest players, said: “We can’t have two pro leagues trying to exist. That’s not a USA Hockey or Hockey Canada problem. That’s the two leagues’ issue. If they could sit down and come to a dialogue, we’d see professional women’s hockey come quickly. I see elite amateur hockey because the best in world don’t play in one league.” Any merger could not occur overnight, as a litany of business, financial and legal issues would have to be sorted out. The C.W.H.L. is centrally funded, while the N.W.H.L. has individual team owners. The N.W.H.L. has four teams in the northeast United States, while the C.W.H.L. now has seven franchises — four in Canada, one in Boston and two in China. Logistically, some teams might need to be contracted, while other markets, like Minnesota, could be attractive options for expansion. Players understand there are obstacles, but none seem insurmountable. The United States-Canada game here was played before a capacity crowd, and fans wearing merchandise from both leagues were almost as prevalent as those wearing national team colors. That the same professional environment does not exist for the world’s top women’s hockey players is bittersweet to many of them. Fortino and Larocque both predicted there would one day be a unified women’s professional league, but added a familiar caveat. “I don’t know if it will be in my lifetime,” each said, sighing.",The New York Times
2017,Volkswagen Sales in U.S. Rebound After Diesel Scandal,"LANSING, Mich. — There were times last year when Jeff Williams wondered how his Volkswagen dealership was going to bounce back from the diesel-emissions scandal that had rocked the German automaker and badly tarnished its image in the United States. After Volkswagen admitted that it had used illegal software to cheat on emissions tests, and the company was hit with a federal investigation and lawsuits from customers and dealers, many American consumers turned their backs on the brand. “We literally had weeks when no one came in looking to buy — nobody,” Mr. Williams recalled. “I had four salespeople. I had to cut down to two.” But now it seems Volkswagen has turned the corner in reconnecting with customers. October figures released Wednesday showed that sales of VW-brand vehicles leapt 12 percent from a year earlier, to 27,732 vehicles, even as overall new-car sales fell 1.3 percent to 1.354 million cars and light trucks. Volkswagen has now reported a year-over-year sales increase in 11 of the last 12 months. So far this year, its sales are up 9.4 percent — more than any other nonluxury auto brand, according to the research firm Autodata. VW sales have still not returned to the level achieved before the diesel scandal erupted two years ago, when American dealers were selling more than 30,000 cars a month. But the resurgence is striking in a year when car sales nationwide are declining. Mr. Williams’s dealership, in Lansing, sold 20 new VW cars last month, up from just nine in October 2016. “I’m back to three salespeople, and I’m about to add another,” he said. “We are on people’s shopping lists again.” Volkswagen’s Audi luxury brand also continues to grow. Its sales climbed 9.6 percent in October from a year earlier, to 19,425 vehicles, and were up 6 percent in the first 10 months the year. Although its United States sales are rising again, Volkswagen is still working through the impact of the diesel scandal. It has agreed to pay $22 billion in settlements and fines in connection with the matter, including $4.3 billion to settle a case that was brought by the Justice Department. It also agreed to compensate American customers and buy back or fix the diesel models equipped with the illegal software. All told, Volkswagen used the illegal software in some 11 million cars worldwide, including about 600,000 sold in the United States. Affected models included the diesel-powered versions of some of the VW brand’s most popular cars, such as the Golf, Jetta, Beetle and Passat. Certain vehicles sold by Volkswagen’s Audi and Porsche brands were also equipped with the illegal software. As of August, Volkswagen had repurchased or modified more than 308,000 vehicles in the United States equipped with 2.0-liter diesel engines, at a cost of $6.4 billion, according to an independent auditor monitoring the process. Roughly 200,000 claims for buybacks remain to be processed. The company had also repurchased about 35,000 vehicles with 3.0-liter engines, out of a total of 53,000 claims filed. While reporting a drop in earnings last week — a decline largely due to diesel settlements — Volkswagen acknowledged that the damage from the scandal was “nowhere near an end.” Diesel cars have been a bigger part of the company’s product mix in Europe than in United States, handicapping a worldwide recovery. In one good sign on Wednesday, Volkswagen shares climbed to 167.85 euros on the Frankfurt stock exchange, finally exceeding the price at which they were trading before the diesel scandal. Volkswagen isn’t the only automaker facing challenges. General Motors shares slumped this week after Goldman Sachs analysts downgraded the stock and gave it a “sell” rating over concerns about the company’s prospects in 2018. The investment bank said it now favored shares of Ford Motor stock over G.M.’s. Volkswagen’s revival in the United States is being driven by two new sport-utility vehicles that arrived in showrooms this year. Even before the diesel problems, VW’s United States sales had been declining since 2012 as consumers, spurred by low gasoline prices, flocked to S.U.V.s and turned away from sedans and compact cars. VW, like other automakers, was caught off guard and scrambled to beef up its S.U.V. offerings. One of the new S.U.V.s, the Atlas, is a full-size model that enables VW to compete with big sellers like the Ford Explorer and Honda Pilot. The 2018 Tiguan is redesign of an existing model. It comes with extra roominess to appeal to American car buyers. “We can now target the heart of the S.U.V. market,” Hinrich J. Woebcken, president and chief executive of Volkswagen Group of America, told reporters last month. “We are at a fundamental turning point for the brand and our strategy for our American customers.” Jessica Caldwell, an analyst at Edmunds.com, an auto information website, said VW “is not completely out of the woods,” but noted that American consumers had a history of forgiving automakers who had erred. G.M. faced heavy criticism and investigation after it was slow to recall faulty ignition switches that were eventually linked to fatal crashes. “Americans follow something for a certain amount of time, but won’t turn their backs on a brand like VW for life,” Ms. Caldwell said. “Eventually they forget or forgive.” For Volkswagen, keeping up the growth in the United States won’t be easy. The VW brand still lacks a compact S.U.V. for the American market, and the next two new models are sedans, the kind of cars fewer and fewer consumers are buying. One is a redesign of the Jetta compact, and the other a new full-size car called the Arteon. Both are due next year. The slowdown in overall car sales may also pose a headwind. The industry is likely to report a decline this year after seven years of growth and record sales of 15.5 million cars and light trucks in 2016. To help lure customers, VW has extended the warranty it offers on its 2018 model to six years or 72,000 miles, double what it previously offered. “This country always loves the comeback story, right?” Mr. Woebcken said. “That’s what American people love, and they love to give people a second chance.”",The New York Times
2017,Voodoo Too: The GOP Addiction to Financial Deregulation,"The big economic policy story for this week will be the attempt to ram through the Republican tax bill, which manages both to raise taxes on middle- and lower-income Americans even as it blows up the debt, all in the service of big tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy. To the extent that there’s any intellectual justification for this money grab, it lies in the conservative insistence that cutting taxes at the top will magically produce huge economic growth. That is, it’s still voodoo economics after all these years, and nothing — not the boom after Clinton raised taxes, not the failure of the Bush economy, not the debacle in Kansas — will change the party’s commitment to a false economic doctrine that serves its donors’ interests. But just behind the tax story is the effort to gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; and this too needs to be understood in the context of a broader GOP commitment to a demonstrably false but useful narrative. Think about it: what would it take to persuade the right that financial deregulation is a bad idea, and some kinds of regulation are very good for the economy? Modern financial regulation came about in the aftermath of the Great Depression, and — as you can see from the figure — the era of effective regulation was also an era of historically unprecedented financial stability. Did this stability come at the expense of economic growth? Hardly: the era of effective regulation was also the era of the great postwar boom in America, the thirty glorious years in Europe. Nonetheless, by the 1970s a combination of free-market ideology and big money (with the latter helping to feed the former) produced a widespread belief among policymakers that those old regulations were pointless and harmful. Regulations were lifted, and, maybe even more important, malign neglect allowed unregulated shadow banking to expand rapidly. (The Trump Treasury department wants global regulators to stop using the term “shadow banking”, which it says conveys the impression that there is something wrong with such institutions. Funny how causing the worst crisis since the 1930s can give you a bad reputation.) Anyway, at this point the results of the great rise of deregulatory ideology are all too clear: banking crises returned with a vengeance, culminating (so far) in the 2008 crisis. And it’s not as if 2008 came out of nowhere: we’d already had the S&L crisis of the 80s, the Long-Term Capital Management/Asian crisis of the 1990s, both of which were clear signals of the growing risks. Add in 2008, and you have a remarkable record of disaster. Why has financial deregulation been, literally, such a bust? There are multiple, interacting reasons, all of which are well studied at this point. Banking is inherently vulnerable to self-fulfilling panic; if you guard against panic with explicit or implicit guarantees, you create moral hazard which must be contained via regulation. Beyond that, finance is an area where the risks of fraud, of scammers exploiting the limits of consumer understanding and rationality, are especially high. Very few people are in a position to assess the fine print of financial contracts, and the most deceptive, risky deals are sold to those least able to make that assessment. Hence Dodd-Frank, which made a limited but serious attempt to rein in some of the new risks that had arisen from deregulation and shadow banking, and which created the CFPB to help protect consumers from financial scams perpetrated, in many cases, by big financial institutions. And these measures have been successful: leverage and financial risks are down, and the Bureau has surprised even those of us who supported it with just how effective it has been, just how much positive influence it has had on the honesty and transparency of financial dealings. So naturally the GOP wants to tear it all down. On the right, all of the disasters brought on by deregulation were actually the fault of liberals, who somehow forced banks to make subprime loans to Those People, or maybe the Fed, which somehow forced lots of bad lending by failing to raise interest rates in the face of low inflation. And Republicans insist that the prudential regulations introduced after the terrible crisis of 2008 are holding the economy back, despite zero evidence to that effect. But evidence isn’t the point. Like faith in the magical powers of tax cuts, faith in the wondrous things that happen if you let bankers do whatever they want has become a free-floating ideology on the right, untethered to any kind of reality check. And of course it’s a very convenient faith from the point of view of financial industry types. So really the attack on the CFPB and the tax cut are part of the same story. They’re both about voodoo economics in the service of plutocracy.",The New York Times
2017,"Voter Fraud Panel Is Sued Again, This Time by a Member","WASHINGTON — A Democratic member of the White House commission on election integrity filed a federal lawsuit against the panel on Thursday, saying that its claim of bipartisan cooperation “has been a facade” and that he had been denied information about its work. The commission member — Matthew Dunlap, the Maine secretary of state — stated in the lawsuit that he had been unable to get any information on the commission’s activities since its last meeting in September. His request in mid-October for copies of all correspondence among the commission’s members since its formation in May was referred to legal counsel, the lawsuit stated, and a second request on Nov. 1 has gone unanswered. The suit accused the commission of violating the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which requires such panels to operate transparently and to treat all members equally. Mr. Dunlap asked the court to force the commission to turn over the requested documents and provide any new ones in the future. The panel’s vice chairman and day-to-day overseer — Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state — said in a statement that Mr. Dunlap’s suit was “baseless and paranoid,” and that he had not received any correspondence from the commission lately either. Mr. Kobach said in the statement that the commission’s work had been slowed because it was defending itself in eight other lawsuits, and that “ironically, Dunlap’s lawsuit is only going to increase the workload.” Asked about that on Thursday, Mr. Dunlap replied, “Just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean they’re not out to get you.” In an interview, he said that a simple explanation of what the commission was doing — or if it was not doing anything, that its activities were delayed — might have satisfied him. But despite two letters and repeated emails, he said, “I never got that answer.” The October request for correspondence, Mr. Dunlap said, was prompted by a text message from a journalist seeking his reaction to the arrest of a commission staff member on child pornography charges. He said he had been unaware of the arrest. Almost a month later, he added: “I still don’t know what happened. Is he still employed? Is he on leave? Terminated? On bail? I have no idea. This is a little unusual.” The other suits against the panel, formally called the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity but commonly called the voter fraud commission, have largely been filed by critics who call the panel an arm of broader Republican efforts to make it harder for Democratic-leaning minorities, young people and the poor to register and vote. Mr. Kobach angered some other commission members, including Bill Gardner, the New Hampshire secretary of state, by writing a column for the far-right website Breitbart News in September suggesting that Maggie Hassan, a New Hampshire Democrat, had won election to the Senate in November 2016 because of fraudulent votes. State officials and election-fraud experts called the claim baseless. Since August, one panel member has died and a Republican member — Hans von Spakovsky of the Heritage Foundation — was found to have lobbied to keep Democrats, mainstream Republicans and academics from serving on the commission. The Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional agency, said in late October that it would investigate the commission’s activities in response to a request from three Democratic senators: Michael Bennet of Colorado, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey. Several of the Democrats on the 11-member commission have been increasingly critical of its direction, spurred in part by its focus on voter fraud, which academic studies and other inquiries have shown to be exceedingly rare. On Thursday, Mr. Dunlap said in a statement that he filed the suit to “allow me and all of my fellow commissioners to fulfill our roles as full, participating members, and provide a meaningful report to the president.” In an Oct. 17 letter to the commission’s executive director, Mr. Dunlap wrote that it had become “manifestly clear that there is information about this commission being created and shared among a number of parties, though apparently not universally. “I am in a position where I feel compelled to inquire after the work of the commission upon which I am sworn to serve,” he wrote, “and am yet completely uninformed as to its activities.” The lawsuit was prepared by a New York City law firm and American Oversight, a nonprofit watchdog group staffed largely by former Obama administration and Democratic officials.",The New York Times
2017,"W. Marvin Watson, Johnson’s Unofficial Chief of Staff, Dies at 93","W. Marvin Watson, a World War II combat veteran who ran Lyndon B. Johnson’s White House with the protective instincts of a loyalist, the privileged power of a confidant and the efficiency of a drill sergeant, died on Sunday at his home in The Woodlands, Tex., near Houston. He was 93. His death was confirmed by Tom Johnson, who served on the White House staff with Mr. Watson. President Johnson did not want to give any staff member the title of chief of staff, but he eventually made Mr. Watson his in all but name. When he arrived at the White House in early 1965, Mr. Watson — a fellow Texan and proud “Johnson man” by his own description — had been a political ally of the president’s since Johnson’s successful run for the United States Senate in 1948. In 1964, Mr. Watson had smoothed the way for Johnson’s nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, nine months after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. But for years he had turned down entreaties to work for Johnson, even after Johnson became president. Asked early on by Johnson to join his staff, Mr. Watson declined, saying he was happy living in a small Texas town as a steel company executive. Then, in mid-November 1964, shortly after he won the presidency, Johnson surprised Mr. Watson by showing up at a dinner being held in Mr. Watson’s honor. In his remarks, Johnson ladled out his famously effusive flattery. “Marvin is as wise as my father, as gentle as my mother, as loyal and dedicated and as close to my side as Lady Bird,” Johnson said, referring to the first lady. Weeks earlier, Johnson’s most trusted senior aide and longtime friend from Texas, Walter Jenkins, had resigned after being arrested on a morals charge, accused of engaging in homosexual behavior in a Washington Y.M.C.A. Courted by Johnson, Mr. Watson finally agreed to take the job Mr. Jenkins had vacated — with the nominal title of special assistant to the president — but only on certain conditions: that he would have unfettered access to Johnson, an adjacent office and the privilege of disagreeing with him frankly in meetings. As Johnson’s most trusted confidant, Mr. Watson would ultimately replace Bill Moyers in that role when Mr. Moyers, the president’s press secretary, left in 1967 to be publisher of the Long Island newspaper Newsday. Mr. Watson “now sits nearer the center of American political power than anyone except the president himself,” the reporter Roy Reed wrote in a profile of him in The New York Times in 1967, though he added, “He is practically unknown.” Mr. Watson proved to be a tough, exacting gatekeeper. He fired or forced the resignation of staff members who he believed were more loyal to Senator Robert F. Kennedy, Johnson’s archrival, than the president. The speechwriter Richard N. Goodwin, a longtime Kennedy family ally, was one of them. Mr. Watson coordinated White House relations with the Democratic National Committee and Congress, personally handing checks to Democratic representatives and senators running for re-election ($2,000 for those with opponents, $1,000 for others) from funds that Johnson had raised. He was also the administration’s liaison to the F.B.I. and the only person in the White House besides Johnson who read the agency’s reports on the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s private life. In his most controversial move, Mr. Watson ordered that White House telephone operators record the names, business affiliations and office phone numbers of all callers. He said the purpose was to gather information to make the phone system more efficient, but his critics said he was trying to find out if staff members were leaking information to reporters. The columnist Joseph Alsop denounced what he called a “curious espionage system to which members of the White House staff are subjected.” Mr. Watson’s attention to detail was so renowned that he was called the “master of the paper clip.” Even a new guardhouse had to pass his inspection, down to the smallest details. At one point he cut down the use of White House limousines from 83 trips a day to 70. William Marvin Watson, a fourth-generation Texan, was born in the small East Texas town of Oakhurst on June 6, 1924. He won a music scholarship to Baylor University but joined the Marines in April of his sophomore year and fought in the Pacific in World War II. After returning to Baylor, he earned a bachelor’s degree in economics and a master’s in business administration. He failed at his first job, selling hearing aids, but was hired to manage the Chamber of Commerce in the East Texas town of Daingerfield. That led to a job with Lone Star Steel, where he became assistant to the president. He also became involved in Texas Democratic politics, forming one of the nation’s first Johnson for President clubs. At the Atlantic City convention in 1964, he helped squelch a movement to nominate Senator Kennedy for president. Afterward he became chairman of the Texas State Democratic Party. His duties as a chief of staff ended in 1968, when Johnson named him postmaster general, then a cabinet-level position. He replaced Lawrence F. O’Brien, who went on to manage Senator Kennedy’s presidential campaign and later became chairman of the Democratic National Committee and commissioner of the National Basketball Association. Mr. Watson was succeeded by James R. Jones, who was later elected to Congress from Oklahoma. Mr. Watson helped pave the way for the Post Office, as it was then known, to become an independent agency. (It became the Postal Service in 1971.) He also strengthened regulations governing the mailing of guns. Though he was no longer directly at Johnson’s side, he remained a confidant to the president. In an article in The New York Times in 1988, Mr. Jones wrote that on the night of March 29, 1968, a Friday, Johnson, whose popularity was sinking as the Vietnam War dragged on and who was facing challenges for the nomination within his own party, summoned Mr. Watson to the Oval Office study, along with Mr. Jones and George Christian, the president’s press secretary. “I’m thinking about announcing Sunday that I’m not running” for re-election, Mr. Jones quoted Johnson as telling them. “What do you think?” Drinks were poured, and a two-hour discussion ensued. “The three of us argued vigorously while he poked holes in each argument,” Mr. Jones wrote. “By evening’s end, we split 2-1 (George was against his running, Marvin and I said it was too late for him to step away from the battle). We left the meeting not knowing what he would do.” Two days later Johnson announced he would not seek another term, stunning the nation. After Johnson left office, there was a small groundswell for Mr. Watson to run for the Senate from Texas. (Wooden nickels bearing the slogan “T.N.W.” — Texas Needs Watson — were circulated.) Instead, he went to work for Occidental Petroleum as executive vice president, the first of several high-level corporate positions he held. Mr. Watson, who was active in the Baptist Church and other religious groups, is survived by his wife, Marion; his daughter, Kim Rathmann; his sons, William III and Winston; four grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. In 2004 Mr. Watson published a memoir, “Chief of Staff: Lyndon Johnson and His Presidency,” written with Sherwin Markman, another former Johnson aide. As a presidential assistant, Mr. Watson began his day at 6 a.m. and often ended it after midnight. He sometimes briefed the president while Johnson was still in his pajamas. His responsibilities knew no boundaries. He once chased down one of the president’s beagles, which had escaped the White House grounds. One of his proudest accomplishments was persuading Johnson to ask Congress to make a Marine Corps general a full and equal member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He also succeeded in getting Congress to add a second four-star general to the Marines’ leadership. Other services already had many more officers of that rank. Mrs. Johnson asked Mr. Watson to deliver her husband’s eulogy at his funeral in 1973. It began, “He was ours, and we loved him beyond any telling of it.” It concluded, “The years will be lonely without him.”",The New York Times
2017,Waiting for Depression to Lift,"It’s late morning on a balmy September day. I try to summon the will to run from the bench where I’m sitting on Broadway and dive under the massive wheels of one of the trucks roaring past. Which section of my body, I wonder, should I hurl beneath the tires. Where would hurt the least, and soonest erase my suffering. I clutch my cellphone, hating its potential for rescue signals. After nine or 10 trucks pass me by, an unkempt man in his mid-50s sits on the bench beside me, plastic cup of lager in one hand, half-smoked self-rolled cigarette in the other. He looks me up and down and grins. Go away, jerk, I think to myself, shooting him an icy glance. Leave me be. “Are you waiting for a date?” he persists. “What are you doing?” I want to kill him, but my resolve switches. I stand abruptly and head for my apartment, where, I calculate, I have enough medications stored to off myself. I ponder what to say in my suicide note. My phone rings: my mother, responding to the please call me asap message I had texted her. “What’s going on?” she says. It is my mother who insists I call my therapist and my mother who, upon my therapist’s urging, drives me to the emergency room. “Can’t you think about how it’s a beautiful sunny day?” she says once I’ve checked in and changed into a hospital gown and scrubs pants. I tug at the neck of my cotton gown, which chokes no matter how much I loosen the ties. ‘“I just feel utterly hopeless,” I say. The depression is a silent, slow motion tsunami of dark breaking over me. I can’t swim away from it and don’t believe I can survive its natural withdrawal. That’s why I am here. This was over a year ago, and I’m still alive, thanks primarily to mental health care professionals and the passage of time. Over the course of the past decade, I have struggled with the exhilarating highs and excruciating lows of bipolar disorder, or manic-depression. I’ve spent a cumulative nine months living on psychiatric units. All these units were locked down, regulated, sterile. I ate food off hard plastic trays with soft plastic cutlery. When the medications I swallowed in front of policing nurses behind their grimy desks caused my skin to flake into dead orangish chunks and hang from my face, I stole mini-packs of butter from the patients’ fridge and used it as a moisturizer. I hid the foil-and-plastic wrappers in a drawer with my hospital-issue white gauze underwear, which bulged slightly at the crotch, an accommodation to those patients who were male. I have stared out windows for hours; a person trudging down the treeless street excited me as a major event. Between events, I named the landscape’s components in my head: single yellow line, grass, ugly rock, rakish slope toward road. The unit I am on this time is all grays and beige and stale air. The doctor prescribes lithium, supposedly the bipolar miracle drug. I take the button-size white pill dutifully with endless Dixie cups of brackish fountain water from the nurses’ station. Yet, my depression continues. The second bed in my room, which sits unfortunately close to the hallway’s clamoring communal telephone, is empty, and each morning I wake to a nurse asking, however gently, to take my blood pressure. The hospital’s red brick walls, visible through my window, remind me of my early childhood home in England, of churches and moderate antiquity. A week in, during dialectical behavior therapy group in the cafeteria, I see a tall woman about my age with long dark hair and warm but haunted brown eyes being gently seated in the plastic-upholstered two-seater across from me. She has blackish bruises around her mouth and nose. She sits as though her spine is a column of brittle ash. Earlier that day, she’d attempted suicide by lithium overdose. My new roommate. She wakes each morning an hour before me, making her bed with meticulous care, smoothing each wrinkle from the absurdly white hospital blankets. As she puts the finishing touches on her outfit and starts arranging the cushions brought by her husband from home on her bed’s pristinely smooth surface, I drag my sweaty self out from under the three, four, five blankets that fail to keep me feeling warm through the night. I make my way to the industrial-gray bathroom, splash cold water on my face and drag a hospital-issue black comb through my hair. By the time I emerge, my roommate is sitting on the edge of her bed, her hands clasped in her lap. I look guiltily over at the knot of wadded white blankets and sheets on my still-damp bed. “How are you?” she asks. “Fine,” I say. She looks away. The nurse arrives to dress the wound in her neck, the result of where she had intubation for emergency dialysis after her overdose. I can’t see the wound, but she has complained that it means she cannot wash her hair for three days, the hair she keeps swept into braids or up-dos, always impeccable. I flinch as the nurse swabs ointment onto her neck, then covers the area with a gauze pad before walking out. My roommate looks up at me, her eyes wide with concern. “If you ever want to talk,” she says, “I’m here to listen.” “Oh, thank you,” I say, thinking I could never possibly upset this girl with the impeccable hair. “You can talk to me, too, if you like.” We sit there not saying a thing for five minutes or so, fussing needlessly with our bedclothes, glancing occasionally at one another. There is a small, subversive pleasure in our enactment of the opposite of therapy, in which you’re directed to speak your troubles without any real option for silence.",The New York Times
2017,Wake Up and Smell the Traffic? London Tries Coffee to Power Buses,"LONDON — It was part of the imagery of much earlier times: a red double-decker bus nudging through London streets shrouded in smog created in part by its own exhaust fumes. Such was the vehicle’s lumbering notoriety that a musical duo popular in the 1950s and ’60s, Flanders and Swann, composed a tongue-in-cheek panegyric to the “London Transport diesel-engined 97-horsepower omnibus.” They called their song “A Transport of Delight.” On Monday, though, the city’s 9,500 buses — still mostly painted red — laid claim to a fresher narrative. While the worst smogs, or “pea soupers,” have long dispersed, London still chokes on heavy pollution. Seeking to curb toxic diesel fumes, transport officials and companies are hunting for new sources of energy for the buses. The latest idea? Coffee grounds. On Monday, in a much-hyped debut, a company called Bio-bean, in partnership with the oil giant Royal Dutch Shell, introduced relatively small amounts of oil produced from coffee grounds into the mix of diesel and biofuels mandated by the city authorities. The first batch of 6,000 liters, or about 1,580 gallons, would power one bus for a year, Bio-bean said in a news release. According to official figures in 2015, London’s buses used 240 million liters of diesel fuel a year. Given the tiny proportion of coffee-based oil in the bus fuel, there was no immediate, empirical indication that the noisome whiff of central London’s air would turn into the alluring aroma of, say, a Roman cafe, or even a Starbucks. Coffee-based oil does have a strong smell of coffee, Bio-bean said, “but once it is processed, distilled, blended and mixed with mineral diesel, that odor is removed.” Despite their traditional penchant for tea, Londoners drink an average of 2.3 cups of coffee a day, producing about 200,000 tons of used grounds, the news release said. Bio-bean collects that waste from coffee shops and factories and processes the sludge into oil. “It’s a great example of what can de done when we start to reimagine waste as an untapped source,” Arthur Kay, the company’s founder, said. At present, according to Transport for London, which operates London’s public transportation system, the city authorities want to ensure that increasing numbers of buses are fueled by a blend of diesel and biofuels made of products such as waste cooking oil and tallow from meat processing companies. Additionally, more than a sixth of the bus fleet is powered by hybrid engines, and that proportion is set to grow. The authorities also want to convert the 300 single-deck buses to run on electricity or hydrogen, which emit no exhaust fumes, Transport for London said. For years, the British authorities offered lower vehicle taxes to motorists using low-carbon diesel engines. But in recent years, London and many other European capitals have become alarmed by concentrations of harmful nitrogen oxides in the city’s air. And a backlash against diesel has grown with the scandal over secret efforts by several major carmakers, Volkswagen in particular, to circumvent emissions controls. “We’ve got a health crisis in London caused directly by the poor-quality air,” Mayor Sadiq Khan said in October. “Roughly speaking, more than 9,000 Londoners die prematurely because of the poor-quality air.” His remarks were made as the authorities introduced a charge for people driving into the city center in vehicles powered by engines that do not meet the latest European Union emissions standards, usually older diesel-powered models. The so-called T-charge, meaning Toxicity Charge, is 10 pounds, or roughly $13 a day, in addition to the so-called congestion charge levied on drivers since 2003, which now stands at £11.50 a day, Monday through Friday. That has brought the potential costs for a weekday drive into the city center to £21.50, approaching $30 — far more, in fact, than the cost of a latte or a double espresso. OpinionAndrew C.

2017,Walter Isaacson: By the Book,"By the Book The author of “Einstein,” “Steve Jobs,” and, most recently, “Leonardo da Vinci,” has a weakness for cyberpunk dating to the 1980s: William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Neal Stephenson. What books are on your nightstand? George Washington Cable’s “The Grandissimes,” a novel about a white Creole and his quadroon half-brother with the same name, because I’ve become fascinated by the complex shadings of race and class in 19th-century New Orleans. What is the last great book you read? I was blown away by “Madison Park,” a book just written by a colleague of mine, Eric Motley, about growing up in a tight-knit African-American enclave of Montgomery, Ala., that was built by a group of freed slaves led by his great-great grandfather. I ended up writing a foreword for it, because it taught me so much about the strength that comes from community and the grace that is bestowed by gratitude. What influences your decisions about which books to read? Word of mouth, reviews, a trusted friend? I’m a big reader of reviews. My friend Michael Lynton has the welcome habit of actually sending me books that he recommends, and he just sent me John Bloom’s “Eccentric Orbits” about communications satellites. I also like wandering into bookstores and getting suggestions. What’s the most interesting thing you learned from a book recently? I read a paper Eric Lander wrote about the gene-editing technology Crispr and then got Jennifer Doudna’s book on it, “A Crack in Creation.” I was astounded and unnerved about how easy it will soon become to modify genes to fight disease, make our kids taller, create bioweapons, etc. Her book is a rollicking scientific detective story that reminded me of the great scene in James Watson’s “The Double Helix” when Francis Crick “winged into” the Eagle Pub in Cambridge, England, to announce that they had found “the secret of life.” Which book was most helpful to you in working on your biography of Leonardo da Vinci? Leonardo’s own notebooks. More than 7,000 pages still, miraculously, survive. Paper turns out to be a superb information-storage technology, still readable after five hundred years, which our own tweets likely (and fortunately) won’t be. Leonardo crammed every page with drawings and looking-glass notes that seem random but provide intimations of his mental leaps. Scribbled alongside each other, with rhyme if not reason, are math calculations, sketches of his devilish young boyfriend, birds, flying machines, theater props, eddies of water, blood valves, grotesque heads, angels, sawed-apart skulls, tips for painters, and studies for paintings. I love his to-do lists, which have entries like “Describe the tongue of the woodpecker.” It was fun to go see them in places like Windsor Castle, Florence, Milan, and Paris. Bill Gates has one of the best notebooks, the “Codex Leicester,” filled with geology studies; Martin Kemp and Domenico Laurenza gave me access to a new translation they are doing that will be published next year. My assistant Pat Zindulka gave me a two-volume set that her late husband owned of J. P. Richter’s compilations in Italian and English, which is a delight. Which classic novel did you recently read for the first time? When I was a teenager my father bought a copy of James Baldwin’s “Tell Me How Long the Train’s Been Gone” and was deeply affected by it. When Dad died earlier this year, I found it on his shelf and read it. I wish I had read it when he first asked me to. Which books do you think best capture the current social and political moment in America? “All the King’s Men,” by Robert Penn Warren. As for nonfiction, I wish everyone would read Ta-Nehisi Coates’s “Between the World and Me” and J.D. Vance’s “Hillbilly Elegy” together. America’s unifying creed was that we were a land of opportunity, where our kids would be better off than we were, but for an unnecessarily large number of people that no longer feels true. Also, Kurt Andersen’s “Fantasyland.” Our current wave of crackpot conspiracies and tribal paranoias is nothing new, and Kurt traces their roots back four centuries. Which historians and biographers do you most admire? When I was in college, biographies had fallen out of favor in the academy, and that opened the way for some nonacademics to produce brilliant works that combined dogged research and delightful writing. Robert Caro’s descriptions of electrification coming to the Texas hill country and Margaret Frost trying to register to vote in Alabama still send chills up my spine. I also love David McCullough, who finds troves of golden nuggets when he pans through archives: he could even make the saga of pioneers settling Missouri into a riveting drama. And Doris Kearns Goodwin, whose tale of Teddy Roosevelt barnstorming America for “a square deal for every man, great or small, rich or poor” should be read by every politician. They paved the way for a lot of my friends from my journalism days whose biographies and narrative histories I savor: Evan Thomas, Jon Meacham, Nick Lemann, Strobe Talbott, Ken Auletta, Michael Beschloss, David Remnick, Bob Woodward, A. Scott Berg, Cokie Roberts, Jennet Conant, Sally Bedell Smith, Jon Alter, Chris Matthews, Joel Achenbach, Richard Reeves, and a slew of soon-to-be-annoyed-former friends I forgot to mention (hmmm… I guess this was a path down which I should not have gone). And which novelists do you especially enjoy reading? Walker Percy. With a grace worn lightly, he used his background as a doctor who didn’t practice and a Catholic who did in order to probe the human condition and how we fit into the cosmos. Which fiction and nonfiction writers inspired you most early your career? And which ones working today do you most admire? I was inspired early on by David Halberstam, whose “The Best and the Brightest” served as a model when Evan Thomas and I wrote “The Wise Men.” I liked his intense reporting, pithy descriptions, and tumbling sentences even after Nick Lemann did a memorable parody of him in The New Republic. Also, Anthony Lewis, whose “Gideon’s Trumpet” dazzles from the opening scene of Gideon’s petition arriving in a manila envelope at the Supreme Court to his answer of “Well I did” at the end when asked if he accomplished something. Nowadays, I am inspired by Michael Lewis, who gently hides moral tales of biblical proportion inside disarming narratives of ordinary people, and Brian Greene, who has taken the beautiful brushstrokes of physics and made them accessible to the general public, kids and now even theatergoers. Which genres do you avoid? How-to and secrets-of-success books. I could probably benefit from them, but I prefer narratives and biographies that allow me to extract my own lessons. How do you like to read? Paper or electronic? Morning or night? I actually find it easy to read books on the Kindle app on my iPhone, which is great when I travel. I read and write at night. Mornings are not my favorite daypart. What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves? I have a weakness for cyberpunk. I jacked into it during the 1980s when I subscribed to Omni and read William Gibson’s story “Johnny Mnemonic,” which led me to his novel “Neuromancer.” The hero is a console-cowboy hacker who gets data stored in his brain, which first ignited my interest in artificial intelligence, hacking and cybertechnology. I also love Neal Stephenson’s “Snow Crash,” which 25 years ago foresaw a virtual-reality metaverse that might supplant the internet and a blockchain-like successor to fiat currency. And Bruce Sterling, who in the early 1980s wrote of a future in which those who pursue genetic modification of humans will compete with those who push cybernetic augmentation and artificial intelligence. Wow. When I was an editor at Time, we ended up doing an offbeat cover on cyberpunk culture. It may have been our worst-selling issue of the year. What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most? I was not one of those voracious early readers, but I loved the Winnie the Pooh books. I still smile at the thought of Edward Bear coming bump, bump, bump down the stairs, wondering if there may be some other way, and I get wistful remembering that final scene where Christopher Robin puts out his hand, feels for Pooh’s paw and tries to say goodbye. I continue to believe that in that enchanted place on the top of the Forest, a little boy and his Bear will always be playing. If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be? “Moby-Dick.” You’re organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead or alive, do you invite? Well, rather unsurprisingly, I would have Benjamin Franklin, Albert Einstein and Leonardo da Vinci. They were all wonderful writers, and they would have a jolly time explaining things to one another. Disappointing, overrated, just not good: What book did you feel as if you were supposed to like, and didn’t? I’m on the dark side of “The Great Gatsby” debate. It always struck me as a brace of brilliant sentences glistening inside of an inert novel. I found its characters to be emotionally and morally unengaging. Of the books you’ve written, which is your favorite or the most personally meaningful? “Leonardo da Vinci” is for me the culmination of trying to write about the creativity that comes from appreciating the crosscurrents that connect the arts, sciences and humanities. He was the person in history who most playfully and fervently tried to learn everything there was to know about everything that could be known. Who would you want to write your life story? Those of us who write about people in the arena should not fall prey to the conceit that we are likewise in the arena and deserve to have our life stories written. What do you plan to read next? I’m going back home to New Orleans to teach at Tulane, and I want to know everything I can about my city. So, I’m planning to read or re-read Lawrence Powell’s “The Accidental City,” Richard Campanella’s “Bienville’s Dilemma,” Dan Baum’s “Nine Lives,” Ned Sublette’s “The World That Made New Orleans,” and Ernest J. Gaines’s “A Lesson Before Dying.” I’m particularly interested in Storyville, the early 20th century red-light district that offers fascinating lessons about sex, race, class and all that jazz. So I’ve just started Kim Marie Vaz’s “The ‘Baby Dolls,’” which traces back one of the earliest black women’s Mardi Gras organizations to its roots in Storyville. I also have Pamela Arceneaux’s “Guidebooks to Sin,” Al Rose’s “Storyville, New Orleans,” Emily Landau’s “Spectacular Wickedness,” and Gary Krist’s “Empire of Sin,” which I reviewed a while back for these pages.",The New York Times
2017,Walter Isaacson’s ‘Leonardo da Vinci’ Is the Portrait of a Real Renaissance Man,"Books of The Times Because Walter Isaacson has made a cottage industry of writing about Renaissance men, it’s no surprise, really, that he’s finally landed on a subject from the actual Renaissance. Like the other idols in Isaacson’s gallery of polymaths and visionaries — Albert Einstein, Benjamin Franklin, Steve Jobs — Leonardo da Vinci was born with extra bundles of receptors, attuned to frequencies his peers could not hear and capable of making connections no one else could see, especially between the sciences and the humanities. There is a significant difference, though, between “Leonardo da Vinci” and Isaacson’s previous biographies. His other geniuses left behind bountiful source material about the lives they led. Leonardo did not. There are, famously, 7,200 pages of his glorious notebooks to work from, and yes, they are rich in maps, doodles, anatomical drawings, schema for new machines, models for new weapons, proposals for city redesigns, geometric patterns, portraits, eddies, swirls, curls, pensées, scientific observations of uncanny prescience. (Among the most staggering: He intuited the first and third laws of motion, 200 years ahead of Newton.) But what Leonardo’s notebooks lack — which Isaacson readily concedes — are “intimate personal revelations.” Some biographers are perfectly comfortable composing a full-body portrait based solely on a few faint footprints. (Consider the legions who have tackled Shakespeare.) Isaacson does not seem to be that kind of writer. Absent the documentary material he’s accustomed to, he overcompensates with copious analyses of Leonardo’s works. I’m not sure the role of art critic suits him. Isaacson’s enthusiasm is admirable, but he hails many of Leonardo’s creations in the same breathless tone with which a teenager might greet a new Apple product. The words “brilliant,” “wondrous” and “ingenious” come up a lot. It is not atypical to find a sentence like this one, describing Leonardo’s notebooks: “They allow us to marvel at the beauty of a universal mind as it wanders exuberantly in free-range fashion over the arts and sciences and, by doing so, senses the connections in our cosmos.” As an art historian, Isaacson falls prey to the excesses of the profession, adopting the oracular tone of a museum docent — “the landscape of her soul and of nature’s soul are intertwined,” he writes of the Mona Lisa — and spending pages on questions of interest to a select few, like whether the original drawing of “Virgin and Child With Saint Anne” did or did not include the lamb. In these places, he’s not just missing the forest for the trees. He’s seeing only bark. Isaacson is stronger when he’s on familiar turf, showing us Leonardo the scientist and innovator, the engineer and secret doctor . Between 1508 and 1513, Leonardo skinned at least 20 cadavers, some as they were decomposing in his hands, in order to study and draw muscle groups, organs, skeins of veins. His analysis of the human body was so thorough that he determined how the aortic valve worked 450 years before the medical establishment did. (“Of all the amazements that Leonardo left for the ages,” the surgeon Sherwin Nuland said, “this one would seem to be the most extraordinary.”) I should mention here that Isaacson’s book includes dozens of color illustrations, all ravishing. Isaacson is at his finest when he analyzes what made Leonardo human. He was an inveterate deadline misser, more beguiled by starting projects than finishing them. He abandoned a 23-foot equestrian statue intended for a prince; he gave up on paintings and murals intended for wealthy patrons; he sketched “flying machines that never flew, tanks that never rolled, a river that was never diverted.” One of his most underrated achievements may have been his eloquent defense of procrastination. “Men of lofty genius sometimes accomplish the most when they work least,” he told one of his employers, “for their minds are occupied with their ideas and the perfection of their conceptions, to which they afterwards give form.” Leonardo was an implacable perfectionist. (“He saw faults even in the things that to others seemed miracles,” wrote an early biographer.) He worked on the Mona Lisa for 16 years, and it was in his bedroom when he died. Like many artists, Leonardo’s weaknesses were inseparable from his strengths. If he hadn’t been an easily distracted perfectionist, he would have left behind a larger official oeuvre but a less impressive one. Instead, he abandoned what he could not work out, which allowed him to “go down in history as an obsessed genius rather than merely a reliable master painter,” Isaacson writes. One often associates perfectionism with a toxic variety of neurosis. Yet Leonardo seemed quite well-adjusted, particularly for an artist. Unlike Michelangelo, who was dour and self-denying, Leonardo was generous and convivial, partial to robes of purple and pink. He wasn’t especially competitive. He didn’t spend his days spoiling for a fight. (He was no Caravaggio.) He was comfortably open about being gay (Michelangelo was not), merrily indulging his longtime companion with enough shoes and jeweled stockings to keep even Imelda Marcos in clover. And he was strikingly devoid of ego, “more interested in pursuing knowledge than in publishing it,” Isaacson writes. “He wanted to accumulate knowledge for its own sake, and for his own personal joy, rather than out of a desire to make a public name for himself as a scholar or to be part of the progress of history.” In recent years, there’s been a glut of books about the so-called science of creativity, which in truth are TED lectures in waiting, motivational business books that instruct us on how to unleash our own inner Leonardos. The pleasure of an Isaacson biography is that it doesn’t traffic in such cynical stuff; the author tells stories of people who, by definition, are inimitable. Yet in the conclusion of “Leonardo da Vinci,” Isaacson capitulates to the easy seductions of TED-ism, and boy is it disappointing. Under the subheading of “Learning From Leonardo,” he offers 20 italicized platitudes, including Retain a childlike sense of wonder and Let your reach exceed your grasp. Each gets its own elaboration. None is especially helpful. It’s all about as cloying as canned peaches. Though perhaps I’m just too old to Be open to mystery. What endures after reading “Leonardo da Vinci” is just how indifferent to glory the man was. He lived in a world of his private obsessions. He often despaired over his failure to get anything done. (“Tell me if ever I did a thing,” he wrote in his notebooks.) What a gift that he did; what a gift that we know him at all.",The New York Times
2017,"Opinion | Want Kids, a Degree or a Home? The Tax Bill Would Cost You","Editorial To pass their immense tax giveaway to the rich, Republicans need to ensure their plan would add no more than $1.5 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. To do so, they’re cutting billions of dollars in tax benefits to people trying to raise children, pay for college, buy a home or invest in renewable energy. That is why taxes would go up for about 45 percent of middle-class taxpayers by 2026 under the House bill, according to an analysis by The Times. By contrast, the people in the top 1 percent of income will get an average tax cut of $64,720 a year by 2027, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Even the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation concludes that the tax cuts are heavily tilted toward the rich. Yet, the Republicans may take the knife to even more middle class benefits, because the Congressional Budget Office said on Wednesday that the bill would overshoot the $1.5 trillion target by nearly $200 billion. If the bill exceeded the $1.5 trillion deficit threshold, it would have to be considered under rules requiring 60 votes in the Senate for passage, rather than a simple 51 vote majority. But whether the provisions in the bill are procedural necessities or just incredibly meanspirited, these are some ways they could hurt your family if you: Are planning to adopt a child: The bill eliminates the adoption tax credit, which is worth $13,570 per child to parents dealing with adoption procedures that can cost tens of thousand of dollars. This would offset $3.8 billion in tax cuts over 10 years — maybe not much in a federal budget of $4 trillion a year, but every dollar counts! Have or develop chronic illnesses: Republicans want to get rid of the medical expenses deduction, which is primarily used by families grappling with serious health problems. Nearly nine million taxpayers deducted $84 billion in such expenses from their taxes in just 2015; eliminating it would offset about $182 billion in tax cuts over 10 years. Have dependents you need to take care of: Under the proposal, dependent-care benefits that families receive from employers for things like day care or elder care, including flexible spending accounts, will become taxable. More than one-third of private sector workers and more than half of state and local government workers had such benefits in 2014, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Currently up to $5,000 a year in such benefits are exempt from taxes. This provision would offset $6.5 billion in tax cuts. Want to move for a better job: The bill would repeal the deduction for moving expenses when families take a new job that is at least 50 miles away. Not helping people move to areas with better economic opportunities would pay for $10.6 billion in tax cuts. Want to keep up with inflation: One of the biggest changes in this bill is a technical one involving how income thresholds, credits and other parts of the tax code are adjusted for inflation. This will end up pushing middle-class taxpayers into higher brackets and making credits and deductions less valuable over time, all in the service of paying for $128 billion worth of tax cuts. Want help buying a home: The Republicans want to end a program that lets state and local governments issue private-activity bonds to finance housing and let homeowners claim a tax credit on certain mortgages. This could reduce new affordable housing construction and renovations of existing properties, experts say. Chalk up $38.9 billion for tax cuts. Need help paying for college: The bill repeals numerous education deductions and credits. It also makes taxable the value of the tuition and other benefits universities give to their graduate teaching and research assistants. Ditto for education benefits offered by employers to their workers. Who cares about educating the next generation when you can bring in an extra $65 billion as offsets for an enormous corporate tax cut. Are an undocumented parent raising a child who is an American citizen: The House bill would require at least one parent to have a Social Security number to claim the refundable portion of child tax credit. Hurting young citizens in this way would add up to $21.7 billion. Are an undocumented student: House Republicans want to require students to provide a Social Security number to claim access to the American Opportunity Tax Credit for tuition and related expenses. This measure will chip in $800 million. Want to buy an electric car: The House bill would get rid of a $7,500 tax credit for electric car purchases starting with vehicles that hit the road next year; the measure would bring in a modest $200 million. Want to invest in wind projects: The production tax credit for renewable energywill become less valuable under the Republican proposal, raising $12.3 billion in revenue. It is not surprising that Republicans want to cut taxes on businesses and the wealthy. But they should stop pretending that this terrible proposal is a favor to average Americans, when many of them in fact will be left a good deal poorer.",The New York Times
2017,Want Your Gift to Impress? Buy Something Heavy,"The 17th-century French tragedian Pierre Corneille wrote: “The manner of giving is worth more than the gift.” He had a point, according to Charles Spence, head of the Crossmodal Research Laboratory at the University of Oxford. The professor’s work focuses on how our brains perceive the world around us. His research has demonstrated that high-frequency sounds and curved shapes seem to enhance the sweetness in food, and a wine tastes better if it is heralded by the popping sound of a cork and drunk from a heavy glass. He has partnered with chefs like Ferran Adrià and Heston Blumenthal to create multisensory food experiences, and worked with advertising agencies and marketers at many international brands. So, what’s his advice if you want to impress this holiday season? Bulk it up “We’ve just published research on eating a box of chocolate,” Mr. Spence said. “If you hide a 30-gram (1 ounce) weight in a box of chocolate, that weight translates to a significant increase in perceived quality of the chocolate.” There are exceptions, but the association between weight and the perception of luxury applies to numerous items including tableware, cutlery, perfume and wine, Mr. Spence said. “That’s why in a restaurant, a sommelier might subtly give you the bottle to weigh in your hand,” he added. Black is basic Black is the color most associated with luxury because, Mr. Spence said, “it seems to be the color that we perceive to be the heaviest.” Such luxury cues are learned, rather than innate, so they can change over time. “I’m doing a lot of work on transparency at the moment; premium packaged goods should have a transparent window because it conveys freshness or quality,” he said. But the trend is recent, the professor added, because “traditionally luxury goods used to have opaque packaging. I think it has to do with the current desire for authenticity.” Layer it on Unnecessary wrapping can be an ecological concern but, when it comes to luxury goods like wine in a presentation case, it does make an impression. “Tissue layers are really good,” Mr. Spence said, “because the crinkle adds an extra sense to the experience.” Consider a squirt of fragrance in the box or wrapping, and, if you want to cover all sensory bases, work out some way for classical music to be playing when the gift is opened because we associate it with quality. Engaging several senses at once is beneficial. “The brain combines the inputs from each sense, both to determine what something is, but also to determine a hedonic or reward value,” Mr. Spence said. Also, the more stimuli to the senses, the more activity is produced in the orbitofrontal cortex, a small part of brain situated just behind the eyes. And the more activity there, the more rewarding something is perceived to be. You can go too far “Engaging one sense is more effective, but you can potentially have an incongruence if that extra sense doesn’t match the others,” the professor said. He offered as an example the Portuguese denim brand Salsa, which embedded its jeans with microcapsules of perfume chosen to match the color of the item — a lemon scent to match yellow jeans — and to diffuse over time. “It totally backfired,” said Mr. Spence — who had no part in the project. “It proved too much for consumers.”",The New York Times
2017,Want a Car Pool in Your Neighborhood? Via Says Vote for It,"Subway and bus riders have no choice but to go where the stops are. Taxi and Uber passengers can name their own destinations, but pay a lot more for the privilege. Now a popular ride-hail app service aims to combine the savings of mass transit with the convenience of personalized rides. Via, which offers low-cost car pool rides through parts of Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens, recently used crowdsourcing to poll its best customers on where it should take its service next. About 20,000 riders spoke up. And in response to their wishes, Via will extend its routes to northern Manhattan and all of Brooklyn beginning this week. In addition, as the company looks to expand to all five boroughs, it is opening up voting to all New Yorkers at https://ridewithvia.com/nyc-vote/. “The No. 1 question we get asked is, ‘When are you coming to my part of town?’” said Daniel Ramot, the co-founder and chief executive officer of Via. “We are thrilled to get all of New York sharing affordable Via rides, and do our share to reduce congestion and emissions in our hometown.” Devin Shacket, 29, an actress who lives in Midtown Manhattan, said that it made sense to ask riders where they want to go. “I really like that idea,” she said. “From a business standpoint, it seems very smart to offer a service people want to use in locations where it will serve them best.” Via’s expansion in Brooklyn will mean that Chris Lee, 26, a researcher for a real estate company who lives in Cobble Hill, will have another option to get around. Mr. Lee, who has used Via, said he would stick with the subway for his regular commute because it is cheaper, but was likely to use Via when he needed a car. Via’s crowdsourcing is the latest development in New York City’s rapidly changing transportation landscape, as ride-hail apps have flooded the streets with thousands of black cars and upended the yellow cab industry. Though the new app services have hurt taxi owners and drivers, they have been embraced by many riders, especially in the boroughs outside Manhattan where subway and taxi service is limited. For the first time, in July, more people in the city chose Uber over yellow cabs. Via started in 2013 with five sport utility vehicles shuttling groups of commuters back and forth from the Upper East Side, where subways are crowded. It offered an unbeatable $5 flat fee around most of Manhattan, south of 125th Street. Soon its cars were also in four neighborhoods in Brooklyn — Downtown Brooklyn, Brooklyn Heights, Williamsburg, Greenpoint — in Long Island City, Queens, and at the airports. Via has even sought to get New Yorkers to share their yellow cab rides. In June, Via partnered with a competing taxi app, Curb, to give discounted fares to taxi riders around Manhattan in return for sharing the back seat with a stranger. Today, Via has grown to more than one million registered users in New York City, Chicago and Washington. Uber also has its own version of a car pool, called UberPool, while Lyft has Lyft Line. Ana Kukoleca, 26, an accountant, said she hoped that Via’s polling of customers would help establish new hubs of service and improve transportation in underserved neighborhoods. Ms. Kukoleca, who lives in Astoria, Queens, said that she had tapped her phone for an Uber or Lyft car, only to have to wait another six to 10 minutes for it to show up. “I feel it’s the best route to go,” she said. “New York is very much a word-of-mouth city.”",The New York Times
2017,Want to Help? Do Your Research Before You Donate,"Giving Do your homework. Find an organization with a clear mission and demonstrated results. Treat your donations like your investments and have a balanced portfolio. Above all, follow your passion, all the way to the next emergency. That’s the advice experts give on effective giving for disaster relief. And it’s exactly the way Dr. Craig Granowitz of Morristown, N.J., approached his decision to donate more than $10,000 to help victims of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. Dr. Granowitz was on a business trip when the hurricane struck. He watched on television the images of devastation. The day he returned home, he got a call from John O. McManus, a lawyer who advises Dr. Granowitz on philanthropic giving through his family foundation. “He said, ‘What are you doing about charity relief in Puerto Rico?’” said Dr. Granowitz, who is chief medical officer for a major pharmaceutical corporation. “I said, ‘Frankly, John, nothing yet.’ He said, ‘Well, get off the stick and do something!’” A supporter of many Orthodox Jewish causes, Dr. Granowitz said that he had not normally given to disaster relief efforts. But this time he was moved to action. He contacted a rabbi he knew in New York and was referred to Rabbi Mendel Zarchi at Chabad of Puerto Rico, the local chapter of the international Jewish advocacy and educational organization. Dr. Granowitz managed to phone Rabbi Zarchi, who at the moment he got the call was helping to distribute portable generators to residents. Rabbi Zarchi described to Dr. Granowitz the desperate conditions on the island and how he had not been home in weeks as he worked to coordinate relief efforts. He also explained that they were serving Jewish and non-Jewish people alike, and assured him that every dollar was going directly to those in need on the island, most of which was without power, and facing critical shortages. “I told him, we meet the people and we put it into their hands,” Rabbi Zarchi said, referring to the food, water and other essentials his organization had distributed. “We give them sympathy, and we look them in the eye. They want to know they’re not just statistics.” Dr. Granowitz liked what he heard from the rabbi. “I told him ‘I’m going to give you some money, see what you do with it, and then maybe give you some more,’” he said. That approach, said Stacy Palmer, editor of The Chronicle of Philanthropy, underscores one of the first rules of effective giving. “Do your research,” she said. “Our natural inclination is to say, ‘What can I do?’ and reach for our wallets. That’s the time to pause and do a few minutes of research and really make sure that the organization is doing the work you’re interested in.” Dr. Granowitz received proof of that early the next morning: In a text sent at 2 a.m., Rabbi Zarchi informed him that he had used some of the doctor’s money to buy a pallet of water and 451 cans of rice and beans (from a local Goya factory he had worked with), as well as much-needed cleaning supplies. He also sent and posted photos of that food being distributed to residents in a rural suburb of San Juan. “I was impressed,” Dr. Granowitz said. “Here’s a guy working tirelessly on behalf of the Puerto Rican people. And I know the money is being directly distributed to those who need it, not going to intermediaries. He is executing on all the things you’d like to see as a donor.” Communicating directly with donors, showing the effect their dollars have had, is more than just a way to verify that the recipients have used the money. “We’ve found that people want to meet someone with the organization, and they want to hear the stories, the so-called ‘mission moments’ which give examples of their work,” Mr. McManus said. That kind of personal touch can be difficult for the major national emergency-relief charities to achieve. Although a top executive from the Red Cross or the Salvation Army is not likely to send you a personal text in the wee hours to explain where your money went, that does not mean your gift is not going to make a difference. “A large national organization has been through this before,” said Shannon McCracken, chief development officer for Charity Navigator, a watchdog organization. “They know what to do. They have specially trained staff and infrastructure who show up quickly and get to work.” Indeed, some experts recommend allocating donations to different charities, based on reach, need and interests. That is not unlike the way one might approach investments, dividing money between solid blue chips and promising but smaller companies. In philanthropy, however, the distinction between big and national and small and local can become blurred. Case in point: Houston’s First Baptist Church, one of the city’s megachurches. The church, which has about 15,000 active members and a staff of 180, has raised more than $1.5 million after Hurricane Harvey. “Every one of those dollars was spent on relief,” said Steven W. Murray, a spokesman for the church. “I understand people get suspicious when a church starts raising money. And I can guarantee we’re not keeping a dime.” Moreover, the church has been actively and closely involved with on-the-ground efforts to feed, clothe and house those most directly affected by the hurricane. Mr. Murray said he recognized the kinds of choices donors faced and lauded the good work national charities had done in Houston and elsewhere. But he said: “If you want to have a direct impact, find local organizations in the impacted area. It’s a quicker channel.” Whatever your particular area of interest, he added, a charity serves that need. “There are groups in Houston helping dislocated pets,” Mr. Murray said. “There’s a group helping families with special needs, because a lot of these folks lost their wheelchairs or medical equipment they need, when they were evacuated.” Mr. McManus said the focus of his clients’ charitable giving includes organizations affiliated with the nursing profession and those that serve older people. Regardless of how one allocates donations for Puerto Rico, Houston, Mexico City, Northern California — or wherever the next natural disaster strikes — one beneficiary who shouldn’t be overlooked: the donor. “Giving should feel good,” Ms. McCracken said. Giving to disaster relief in Puerto Rico felt so good that Dr. Granowitz planned to make another five-figure gift to Rabbi Zarchi’s efforts. Dr. Granowitz said, “The speed of his action, the care on the use of the funds, the detail in our conversation and then the pictures, how could I not have a feeling of tremendous gratitude and satisfaction?”",The New York Times
2017,Want to See Some Curling? Ticket Sales Tepid for Pyeongchang Olympics,"When ticket sales were lagging in 2006 before the Winter Games in Turin, Italy, Italian officials explained that the matter was not so much apathy for the Olympics as it was a cultural mind-set. “It’s typical for Italians to do things at the last minute,” Giuseppe Gattino, a spokesman for the Turin organizing committee, said at the time. A few months before last summer’s Rio Olympics, when more than half of the 7.5 million tickets remained unsold, again the host country’s people were blamed for being last-minute shoppers. “Brazilians, they do not buy tickets at such an early stage, as the British or the Germans,” Thomas Bach, the president of the International Olympic Committee, said. Now, with 100 days to go before the next Olympics — the Pyeongchang Games, in South Korea — bleak ticket sales and the prospect of empty arenas have revived the excuse that has become almost as familiar as the lighting of the caldron. “Koreans are known to be last-minute buyers,” said Nancy Park, a spokeswoman for the group that is responsible for organizing the Pyeongchang Games, in response to questions about why only 341,327 of 1.07 million tickets had been sold so far. Of course, the Olympics are a TV spectacle above all else, so if the ratings are high most officials will be satisfied. The broadcasters who pay dearly for the rights to show the Games can deftly minimize the glare of empty seats. Still, if a host spends billions of dollars to stage the three-week sporting extravaganza and few people show up it is a bad look. “This is not the first time you get these concerns,” said Michael Payne, the former head of marketing for the International Olympic Committee, who noted that the Games tended to turn out just fine. “But I’m sure the I.O.C. is telling the Pyeongchang organizing committee, ‘Come on, guys, you better raise your game here with more active promotion.’ ” Though many host cities have struggled to sell tickets, Pyeongchang’s situation is particularly grim. As of Oct. 24, 57 percent of 320,000 tickets for the Pyeongchang Games reserved for international fans had been sold — but nearly 80 percent of the 750,000 tickets allocated to South Koreans were still available. The numbers for the Paralympics, which will take place in Pyeongchang from March 9 to 18, were even worse. According to the organizing committee, only 8,902 tickets had been sold as of Oct. 24, with the vast majority purchased as part of group packages. Only 499 individual tickets had been sold. The sales figures were met with gasps, and revived long-simmering questions about whether the organizing committee had been doing enough to promote the Games; whether recent political turmoil inside the country and the escalation of tensions with North Korea might be suppressing excitement about the event; and whether South Koreans even cared enough about winter sports to travel to an unassuming ski town 80 miles east of Seoul. “Filling the stadiums is the goal and challenge of every organizing committee,” said Park, the spokeswoman. “We are focused on building up the excitement and continuing to encourage the public to buy their tickets for the Olympic and the Paralympic Winter Games.” The committee noted that many promotional activities were only now beginning. On Tuesday in Athens, for example, the Pyeongchang organizers received the Olympic flame in a ceremony that initiated a 100-day countdown to the start of the Games in February. After leaving Greece, the torch was scheduled to travel 2018 kilometers across South Korea, visiting 17 cities and provinces, before the opening ceremony. “Once the flame lands in South Korea, I hope the Olympic fever will surge with the torch relay,” said Kim Yu-na, the former figure skater who was a member of the South Korean delegation on Tuesday in Athens, according to Yonhap News Agency. Organizers will hope that fever translates into ticket sales. On Wednesday, the offline sale period will begin in South Korea, making tickets, which until now were limited to the event website, available at designated offices around the country. The Pyeongchang Games will be held a few hours from Seoul, the country’s largest city. Snow sports, like skiing and biathlon, will be held in the mountains in Pyeongchang. Indoor ice sports, like figure skating and hockey, will be in Gangneung. News reports from South Korea indicated that regional government offices have been allocating more funds to buy blocks of tickets, with plans to distribute them to schools, disadvantaged families and other groups. “We always tend to be late buyers for all events,” said Park, pointing to the 2002 World Cup soccer tournament and the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon as examples. Park also tried to dispel the idea, pushed recently in some news media reports, that the specter of conflict with North Korea and the perception of political disquiet on the peninsula had held down ticket sales. She said comments of support from the International Olympic Committee and major national committees had hopefully put international fans at ease after reports that certain countries had expressed safety concerns. And specifically within South Korea, she suggested, people have been largely inured to the threatening rhetoric from their northern neighbors. “For Koreans, the tensions are nothing new,” she said. If the Pyeongchang organizers cannot fully overcome their ticket sales challenge over the next couple of months, United States officials might have a solution. The United States Army has a military base in Seoul. “That’s 20,000 or 30,000 people,” Scott Blackmun, chief executive of the United States Olympic Committee, said in an interview at The New York Times on Wednesday. “We’d love to try to get some of them into the seats.”",The New York Times
2017,Wanted: A ‘Corporate Kaepernick.’ Mellody Hobson on Workplace Diversity,"Mellody Hobson, the president of Ariel Investments, a Chicago investment firm, can’t help but notice how corporate America is still overwhelmingly white and male. “I’ve been asking myself one question over and over again,” she said at the DealBook conference on Thursday. “Where is the corporate Kaepernick?” [Get the latest from the DealBook conference, where the chief executive of Uber gave his first public interview since taking the job.] Colin Kaepernick, the former quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, began kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial inequality last year, attracting national attention. He is now a free agent. “I’ve never met Colin Kaepernick, but I will tell you he’s a hero of mine,” Ms. Hobson said. “I’m in awe of him because I believe he took it upon himself to publicly promote the American values of liberty and life that we all cherish.” She added: “Who else will be willing to use their high-profile position to call attention to inequality?” The ranks of black senior executives remain small. In 2001, when Kenneth I. Chenault was named to the top job at American Express, just one other black chief executive was running a Fortune 500 company, Franklin D. Raines of Fannie Mae. On this year’s list, Mr. Chenault, who is preparing to step down after a 16-year tenure, was one of four. As one of few black women in leadership positions in finance, Ms. Hobson said she understood why she was so often called upon to discuss diversity rather than, say, superannuation funds in Australia. But she added that she was “on one knee,” calling on other business leaders to step up their diversification efforts. “Trying is not the same thing as doing,” she said.",The New York Times
2017,Warning Signs About Another Giant Bitcoin Exchange,"SAN FRANCISCO — As the price of Bitcoin has soared, the virtual currency has edged toward the mainstream. Square, the fast-growing payments company run by the Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, has begun selling Bitcoins to ordinary consumers, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange will soon allow banks to trade on the value of Bitcoin. But if you want to see where the price of Bitcoin is actually determined in round-the-clock bidding, you have to go to a number of unregulated exchanges that often fly in the face of American and European laws. These days, no exchange is bigger than Bitfinex, an opaque operation that provides no information on its website about where it is or who operates the company. Bitfinex, which is officially incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, has been fined by regulators in the United States and cut off by American banks, and it has lost millions of dollars of customer money in two separate hackings, leading critics to question whether it even has the money it claims to hold. In the latest blow, on Tuesday, an alternative virtual currency that is owned and operated by the same people as Bitfinex, known as Tether, announced that it had been hacked and lost around $30 million worth of digital tokens. None of that has been enough to stop customers from pumping billions of dollars worth of virtual currency trades through Bitfinex in recent weeks — on some days, the exchange claimed to be doing more trades, by dollar value, than some stock exchanges in the United States. Even many people who believe in virtual currencies worry that the mixture of loose controls and booming trading at the world’s largest exchange is likely to cause trouble for all the investors piling into virtual currencies, even those who don’t go near Bitfinex. “I’m worried about the systemic risk that this centralized company poses, and I’m worried that if they go down, they will take down the space with them,” said Emin Gün Sirer, an associate professor of computer science at Cornell University, who has a track record of successfully predicting problems in the growing virtual currency industry. The chief executive of Bitfinex and Tether, Jan Ludovicus van der Velde, said in an email on Tuesday that “the financial position of the company has never been stronger.” Concerns over virtual currency exchanges are nothing new. The first and largest Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, collapsed in 2014 after losing $500 million of customer money to hackers. This year, law enforcement took down another large Bitcoin exchange, BTC-E, which was accused of being a way station for many of the Bitcoin flowing through online black markets and ransomware attacks. Regulators in the United States and a few other countries have tried to tame the business, and the largest exchanges in the United States and Japan are now under official oversight. Those regulated exchanges, though, are dwarfed by unregulated ones like Bitfinex and several that have popped up in South Korea, where regulators have been slow to act. The liquid nature of the Bitcoin markets, flowing around national borders and laws, is a product of the virtual currency’s unusual structure. Bitcoin is stored and moved through a decentralized network of computers that are not under the control of any single company or government. This structure means that the virtual currency continues to be an easy target for people who want to manipulate its price or use it to launder money. “Unregulated, unregistered exchanges are a very big concern for the industry and the community broadly,” said Kathryn Haun, a former federal prosecutor who is on the board of the American virtual currency company Coinbase. The most frequent face of Bitfinex is its chief strategy officer, Phil Potter. Mr. Potter worked for Morgan Stanley in New York in the 1990s but lost his job after bragging at length in The New York Times about his $3,500 Rolex, his opulent lifestyle and his aggressive tactics for making money. Mr. Potter, 45, runs Bitfinex alongside Mr. Van der Velde, a Dutch-speaking man living in Hong Kong, and Giancarlo Devasini, an Italian man who lives on the French Riviera, according to company filings in Hong Kong. The company lost 1,500 Bitcoin, worth around $400,000, to a hacker in 2015. But the most damaging incident happened in August 2016 when a thief got almost 120,000 Bitcoin, worth around $75 million at the time. The company spread out the losses to all customers — even those who were not holding Bitcoin at the time of the hacking — by forcing customers to take a 36 percent haircut or loss on any money at the exchange. The lack of detail that Bitfinex provided about the hacking drove away some large customers like Arthur Hayes, the founder of Bitmex, a Hong Kong-based virtual currency exchange. “There are so many questions about them,” Mr. Hayes said. “All of this could be easily rectified by just showing all the figures.” Mr. van der Velde said the company had “been as public and transparent as possible about the security incident in August 2016 given the ongoing criminal investigations.” Banks have also been put off by Bitfinex’s operations. Wells Fargo said this year that it would no longer move money from Bitfinex accounts. Shortly after, Bitfinex said its main banks in Taiwan were shutting it off. Since then, it has moved between a series of banks in other countries, without telling customers where the exchange’s money is stored. But nothing has drawn more criticism than the operation of Tether, a virtual currency that is supposed to be tied — or tethered — to the value of a dollar. Customers can buy Tether coins on Bitfinex and then transfer them to other virtual currency exchanges, providing a way to move dollars between countries without going through banks. Tether has also become a very popular way to buy Bitcoin. In recent weeks, a few hundred millions dollars’ worth of Tether has changed hands on a daily basis across several exchanges, according to data on CoinMarketCap.com. Tether and Bitfinex have insisted that the two operations are separate. But leaked documents known as the Paradise Papers, which were made public this month, show that Appleby, an offshore law firm, helped Mr. Potter and Mr. Devasini, the Bitfinex operators, set up Tether in the British Virgin Islands in late 2014. One persistent online critic, going by the screen name Bitfinex’ed, has written several very detailed essays on Medium arguing that Bitfinex appears to be creating Tether coins out of thin air and then using them to buy Bitcoin and push the price up. Tether and Bitfinex have countered this criticism in statements on the companies’ websites and promised that every Tether is backed up by a dollar sitting in a bank account. In September, the companies provided an accounting document intended to prove that Tether is financed with real money. Lewis Cohen, a lawyer at the law firm Hogan Lovells who advises many virtual currency projects, said the document, because of the careful way it was phrased, did not prove that the Tether coins are backed by dollars. Even if they are, he said, Tether and Bitfinex appear to be violating laws in the United States and Europe that govern investments like Tether, which has qualities very similar to a money market mutual fund. “There are a long list of reasons that you don’t want to deal with them,” Mr. Cohen said of Tether. On Tuesday, Tether announced that an “external attacker” had taken $30 million worth of Tether from the company’s online wallets. The company said it was working to recover the coins.",The New York Times
2017,"Warring Democrats in New York Pledge a Truce, for Now","ALBANY — There might kind of, sort of, be a possible deal to unite Democrats, and conceivably give them a majority, in the State Senate, pending just a few caveats: a pair of special elections, the party’s 2018 fortunes at the ballot box, and an ambivalent, politically polymorphous senator from Brooklyn and his obsession with school security. On Tuesday, Senator Jeffrey D. Klein, the leader of the renegade Independent Democratic Conference, signaled his intent to work together with the 23-member Senate Democratic Conference — seemingly pausing several years of strife that has helped the Republicans control the Senate. Yet, as always, there remained a swirl of questions and uncertainty. The combination of the two Democratic clans would still leave the party just short of a 32-seat majority, because of the long-running defection of Simcha Felder, a Brooklyn Democrat who nonetheless says he has no alliance to any party. As such, he has caucused with Republicans since his election in 2012, saying it favors his constituents. On Tuesday, Mr. Felder reiterated that position — “I’m lucky to represent a district that really doesn’t care about party affiliations,” he said — but added that he could be swayed to join Democrats, or stay with Republicans, if either side embraces a plan to put armed guards at every city school. “That’s very meaningful to me,” he said, in a phone interview. Whether such an idea would find a majority of votes in the Assembly — the measure passed in the Senate, with almost unanimous Republican support and some Democratic opposition — is unclear. But Mr. Felder seems well aware that he could be a very influential pivot vote in a divided Senate. “You don’t need to be a C.P.A. to count to 32,” he said, adding, “Numbers matter; I’d be the first to say I want to be in a position where the leverage I have, I get the most out of it.” The I.D.C. consists of eight Democrats who collaborate with Republicans in the Senate, a situation that has allowed Mr. Klein and his group to enjoy perks like increased pay from committee chairmanships, but has deeply vexed grass-roots progressive groups both in the state and nationally. It’s also caused a political problem for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a two-term Democrat and potential presidential candidate in 2020 who also leads the state party. On Monday, state Democratic leaders laid down an ultimatum in a letter to the warring factions, threatening primary challenges and leadership changes if the two sides didn’t reconcile. The deal, outlined by the state party chairman, Byron W. Brown, the mayor of Buffalo and an ally of Mr. Cuomo’s, was quickly agreed to by Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a Westchester County Democrat who leads the mainline Senate Democrats. Mr. Klein also initially praised the possible deal, which included a shared leadership with Senator Stewart-Cousins, but made demands that the Democrats prioritize a raft of bills, which, it should be noted, are also supported by Ms. Stewart-Cousins’s camp. On Tuesday, Mr. Brown expressly embraced those legislative items, as Mr. Klein said he had accepted the terms of the deal. “I look forward to implementing the terms that have been outlined in yesterday’s letter,” Mr. Klein said in a statement. Other knotty issues remain, including a provision that each side would be able to approve the other’s deputies. Ms. Stewart-Cousins’s No. 2 — Senator Michael N. Gianaris of Queens — has been a constant critic of Mr. Klein, who doesn’t seem to like him much, either. Each side would also refrain from challenging the other’s senators in primaries, and the two groups would work together on elections. There’s also a small parliamentary issue that could make for an awkward scene even if the mainstream Democrats, the I.D.C. and Mr. Felder unite: Under Senate rules, the leadership of the chamber, currently held by John J. Flanagan, a Long Island Republican, could be changed only by a vote of 38 senators, a half-dozen more than Democrats could hold in 2018. That raises the specter that a minority party could rule in the majority at least until the next Legislature is seated in 2019. Nor was it assured that some progressive activists, riled by the I.D.C.’s partnership with the Republicans in the age of President Trump, would like the compromise. One such group, True Blue NY, took to Twitter to voice its displeasure late Tuesday, calling the deal “a slap in the face to communities who have suffered greatly under I.D.C./G.O.P. rule.” The Working Families Party, a left-wing group that has criticized Mr. Cuomo in the past, also expressed reservations about the possible agreement, noting it wouldn’t take effect until after the March budget period. Then, too, is the matter of how Republicans, whose partnership with the I.D.C. and Mr. Felder have afforded them a powerful legislative foothold in an overwhelmingly blue state, would react to the idea of Democratic unity. Scott Reif, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans, said that his party expected to win seats in the fall 2018 elections, despite a sense in some quarters that the midterm elections will be rough for Republicans during Mr. Trump’s tenure. He also seemed dismissive of the Democrats’ ongoing attempts to shelve their dysfunctional ways. “There’s a time for politics and a time for governing,” he said. “And it’s unfortunate that some in Albany can’t ever separate the two.”",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Was Our Profile of a Nazi Sympathizer Too ... Sympathetic?,"Letters To the Editor: Re “In America’s Heartland, the Voice of Hate Next Door” (news article, Nov. 26): The subheadline of this article is “Seeking Acceptance in the Mainstream.” Well, mission accomplished! The New York Times just normalized Nazi sympathizers. Your charming, homey little profile of a guy who defends Hitler and believes that the races should be separate did what Breitbart only dreams of: Bringing white nationalism and organized hate into the homes and hearts of millions of Americans. Aw, they registered at Target. They have cats. How sweet. Perhaps the intent of the article was to shine a light on the face of hatred. But you used a soft-focus light that made him out to be just another guy — albeit with some “alt” political views. Nazi sympathizers are supposed to be reviled and ostracized, not humanized and normalized. BEATRICE SHAPIROSILVERTON, ORE. To the Editor: The outcry by some of your readers that your reporting about a Nazi sympathizer, Tony Hovater, living his seemingly ordinary American life, aside from his repellent beliefs, “normalizes” him makes me fear, as a liberal Democrat, that the right-wing name callers who brand us as snowflakes might be on to something. That a white supremacist might live in our neighborhood and mow his lawn on Saturdays as we do is, to my mind, particularly instructive about the frightening social and cultural forces emerging in our nation these days, after mostly hiding under rocks for many years. If he lived down my block, I would want to know everything about him so I could do all I could in every responsible way to oppose him and his vile thinking. Perhaps the aforementioned readers would do more for our country’s future by using their intellectual and emotional energies to pull their heads from the sand and join in. BILL CANUPWESTLAKE VILLAGE, CALIF. To the Editor: Why on earth would The Times describe a white nationalist and Nazi sympathizer as being “polite” and having “Midwestern manners” that “would please anyone’s mother”? A person who spouts anti-Semitic hate, denies the extent of the Holocaust and believes that people of different races should be separated is per se the opposite of polite, and certainly wouldn’t please any mom I know (or would want to know). When we lose sight of what evil means, what it actually entails, we risk legitimizing and normalizing it. STEPHEN A. SILVERSAN FRANCISCO To the Editor: Re “Readers Accuse Us of Normalizing a Nazi Sympathizer; We Respond” (Reader Center Bulletin Board, nytimes.com, Nov. 26): Like many readers, I was disturbed by the Times profile of Tony Hovater. As a psychologist researching the spread of misinformation, I was particularly concerned about statements such as that he declared the number of Jews who died in the Holocaust “overblown.” Research in cognitive science has warned about the dangers of repeating “sticky misinformation,” serving mostly to reinforce the myth rather than the facts. The editors defend the need to “shed more light, not less, on the most extreme corners of American life.” I disagree. The Times has given a platform to the extreme and fact-deprived opinions of a white nationalist, opinions that might inspire others to follow suit, attract more followers, get more coverage. They empower and embolden those who feel that their racist agendas are not being heard. There is enough hatred in the world. Anecdotal stories about Nazi sympathizers do not inform the educated reader about extremism trends in America. They do not inoculate against alternative facts; they do the opposite — they spread extremism. After all, if The New York Times writes about these extremists, they must have something interesting to say, right? SANDER VAN DER LINDENCAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",The New York Times
2017,"Was This a Virus, or Something More Dangerous for Her — and Her Fetus?","Diagnosis She could feel the child move inside her enlarged abdomen. Certainly he wasn’t tired — but she was exhausted and weak. A fever made her ache all over, and she hadn’t been able to keep any food down for days. She thought a hot bath might make her feel better, but instead she felt as if her already-meager energy had dissolved in the warm water. Holding the walls for support, she made her way to her bedroom. Now she lay on her bed covered by only the damp towel she used to dry off. Every muscle, every joint in her body throbbed as if she’d been beaten. It started a few days earlier. At first she thought it was just a bad cold — her nose was runny; her head and body ached. But it got worse every day. Her throat was raw, her head spun whenever she got up and a constant cough tore through her chest. She was taking acetaminophen — her obstetrician said that it was safe for her baby. It helped a little but not enough. Earlier that evening, she went to the “gender reveal” party her older sister organized for her and her boyfriend. All her best friends were there, and both families were thrilled to find out she was having a boy. All that excitement and joy kept her going until she got home and remembered how awful she felt. That’s when she took the bath. ↓ A Visit to the E.R. She heard her mother walk in and say her name, but she was too tired to answer. Her mother, seeing her 18-year-old daughter on the bed, not responding, was suddenly afraid. This wasn’t just a cold. She gave her daughter’s shoulder a little shake. She slowly opened her eyes. “You need to go back to the hospital,” she told her. She helped her daughter dress and get to the car. They had gone to Beaumont Hospital in Dearborn, Mich., the night before, but her mother was sure they needed to go back. The 15-minute drive seemed to take forever. In the E.R., the mother explained that her daughter had been sick for a few days and was steadily getting worse. The doctors they’d seen the day before said that she had some kind of virus. The illness wasn’t strep, and it wasn’t the flu — they tested her for those — so there was nothing they could do except give her acetaminophen and fluids. And that helped — but not for long. The fever and nausea returned. She hadn’t had anything to eat or drink for days now, at least nothing that stayed down. And she just seemed so out of it. The doctors, nurses and technicians fluttered about her half-awake daughter. The vomiting and diarrhea had left her dehydrated, and her blood chemistry was out of whack. They gave her fluids to replace the electrolytes she’d lost. The obstetrician came by and made sure the baby was O.K. He was. And then they sent them home again. Just a virus, they said. She was given a prescription for Zofran, a powerful anti-nausea drug, and a suggestion to take Pepto-Bismol for the diarrhea. She should start to feel better soon. ↓ Back Home Again But she didn’t. After two more days of feeling terrible, she asked her mother to take her back to the E.R. With this third visit in five days, and virtually the same story — the same fever, the same nausea and vomiting, the same aches — the doctors had to wonder if they had missed something. She had been tested for influenza using a fast test that takes less than 15 minutes, but that test can miss up to half of all flu cases. The doctors sent off a far more expensive and reliable test to look for evidence of influenza. They also retested her for strep. And they sent off more blood to look for the cause of the nausea and vomiting. This was lasting too long to be a run-of-the-mill gastrointestinal bug. The results showed that she didn’t have strep. But she did indeed have influenza; the first test had missed it. It might be too late for Tamiflu, but there was no harm in trying it. More surprising and concerning, the blood tests showed that the levels of liver enzymes that indicate injury were more than 10 times higher than normal. Liver injury can be seen in bad cases of influenza — though the enzyme level was not usually this high. The doctors admitted the patient to the intensive-care unit. ↓ Dangers of an Injured Liver Dr. Erik Sweet was the intern in the I.C.U. He, too, was concerned about the elevated liver enzymes. Maybe it was the flu, but could there be another reason for this injury? Had she taken any acetaminophen over the course of her illness? She had, she told him. Because she was pregnant, it was the only thing she was allowed to take. How much did she take, he asked. She took two extra-strength tablets (500 milligrams each) as often as every four hours, ingesting, perhaps, up to 6,000 milligrams each day. That was twice the maximum recommended dose. Sweet was alarmed. Acetaminophen is the most common cause of acute liver failure in the United States. Half of all patients with liver failure, and one-fifth of all patients who need a liver transplant, sustained their injury using this common over-the-counter medication. When acetaminophen passes through the liver, some of the drug is broken down into toxic chemicals. A healthy liver can dispose of these dangerous components. But the liver needs nutrients to do this, and because she was so sick, this woman wasn’t taking in much in the way of nutrients. In addition, because she was pregnant, she was sharing her nutrients with her fetus. All this put her at significant risk of being poisoned by the acetaminophen. What started off as simple influenza was now even more dangerous because of this possible slow overdose. ↓ Reversing the Damage Fortunately, there is an antidote to acetaminophen toxicity. N-acetylcysteine, called NAC, binds to the toxins that result from the breakdown of acetaminophen before they injure the liver. NAC can stop the damage and save the liver, if taken in time. Sweet ordered the NAC and sent off blood to confirm that her acetaminophen level was elevated. The result was surprising: The acetaminophen level was not elevated. There was no evidence of an acetaminophen overload. Perhaps the culprit was not the drug after all. Maybe influenza was causing the liver problem. Or maybe she had hepatitis. By now it was late at night. Sweet contacted the gastroenterologist on call, Dr. Aref Alrayes, to discuss what needed to be done. Even without seeing the patient, the doctor had two recommendations. First, the patient should be transferred to a nearby hospital with a ward dedicated to severe liver disease. Second, the patient should be given NAC. ↓ Slow-Motion Toxicity When patients take a single very large dose of acetaminophen, they have what is called acute acetaminophen poisoning — a huge blast of the medication overwhelms the body’s system of safe elimination. But there is also a slow form of poisoning. When ingested over days or weeks, intake of the medicine can still outpace elimination, and the accumulation can cause a chronic type of toxicity. Nearly one-third of these patients will have a normal acetaminophen level when measured. Even those patients should be given NAC, if they have a liver injury and have been taking acetaminophen, Alrayes told Sweet. The drug can be lifesaving, if acetaminophen is the culprit. If it is not, the dose of NAC would be safe for both mother and baby. The patient was started on intravenous NAC and transferred to the other hospital. It took a day or two, but slowly she began to feel better. Her nausea improved. Her appetite returned. And after four days, her liver showed signs of recovery. She was sent home. Her mother scoured the house and threw away every bottle of acetaminophen she could find. She was shocked that this medicine, which she’d always considered a friend, could be so dangerous. The rest of her daughter’s pregnancy went just fine. And her newest grandson will celebrate his 6-month birthday in the beginning of December.",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Was the Tet Offensive Really a Surprise?,"Vietnam '67 I learned the hard way during the Vietnam War that when intelligence is ignored, people get killed. I spent the better part of the war with the National Security Agency, often undercover. Time after time, I and my colleagues felt like Cassandra, the mythical Trojan princess blessed with foresight but doomed not to be believed. One example was the Battle of Dak To. By 1967, much of the fighting in South Vietnam was concentrated in the highlands, the mountainous region along the Laos-Cambodia border encompassing Kontum, Pleiku and Darlac Provinces. American military forces were drawn to the region for two reasons. First, it’s where the enemy was: The North Vietnamese used the area as a redoubt. The terrain was rough and barren with a sparse population of mostly non-Vietnamese Montagnard tribes, driven there centuries before by the Vietnamese who seized the lowlands for themselves. Second, it was the site of a critical section of the covert infiltration network used by the North Vietnamese to funnel thousands of troops into South Vietnam, known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail by Americans. That summer and fall I was in the highlands too, working undercover alongside American combat troops. I was a specialist in Vietnamese Communist communications, and I spoke Vietnamese, Chinese and French, the three languages of Vietnam. Unlike many other N.S.A. signals-intelligence specialists, I was willing to go into combat with the American units I was attached to. I was assigned to coach and assist the Army signals-intelligence team supporting the 4th Infantry Division and the 173rd Airborne Brigade, which was headquartered in the Pleiku area. Our intercept site was at a place called Engineer Hill, high enough so that we could detect enemy transmissions from far away; we also took in intercepts from other teams deployed with Special Forces units operating deep in the highlands. Throughout September and October 1967, my military counterparts and I kept close track of the communications of the B3 Front, the senior North Vietnamese headquarters for the highlands; its subordinate 1st Division; and two independent regiments, the 24th and the 33rd. Over those months we followed the B3 Front as it deployed a forward command post that established communications with Hanoi — always a sign of impending combat. Soon it was exchanging a large volume of messages with North Vietnam, mostly sent at night when Vietnamese Communist transmitters normally shut down. The command post and the 24th Regiment moved quickly to Kontum Province. The 33rd Regiment, two provinces to the south in Darlac, initiated combat communications. A new unit, not yet identified, showed up in Pleiku Province, close to our location. In other words, it looked like the enemy was preparing a highlands-wide offensive. One moonless night in late October, we located another new North Vietnamese unit, about 20 kilometers from where we were sitting. As if to underline the enemy’s proximity, while we were reporting the new unit’s appearance, we suddenly came under attack from mortars. The only casualty, it turned out, was a portable outhouse. Still, we were spooked. Before the end of October, the North Vietnamese 1st Division and its three subordinate regiments had all moved to the Dak To area of Kontum Province — a region of steep hills and deep jungle valleys. There was a Special Forces base at Dak To, a tempting target, but it was clear to us that it wasn’t the only objective. Low-level reconnaissance communications appeared, a sure sign that combat was imminent. Then the division headquarters dispatched a forward command post that took control of the regiments. They were ready. We informed the American 4th Infantry Division and the 173rd Brigade that an attack on the Dak To area would very likely begin between Oct. 30 and Nov. 4, dates we learned from the reconnaissance unit’s messages. But we also warned that units throughout the highlands were preparing for combat. This, we said, was going to be big. At this point we hit an unexpected obstacle: credibility. Several of us went to brief the commander of the 4th Infantry Division, Maj. Gen. William Peers. I warned him that a multi-division North Vietnamese attack on Dak To would take place at any moment, coincident with attacks throughout the highlands. He shook his head and pointed to our camp on Engineer Hill. “So I’m supposed to believe that some kind of magic allows a bunch of shaky girbs” — acronym for “G.I. rat bastards” — “distinguished more for their spit than their polish and abetted by a civilian, to use a tangle of antennas and funny talk to divine the combat plans of the enemy?” He waved us away. The briefing was over. But we were right. On Nov. 1, a bomb dropped from a B-57 struck somewhere near Dak To. It hit an enemy supply dump, setting off secondary explosions, proof positive that significant numbers of North Vietnamese troops were out there. General Peers sent a unit from the division’s 1st Brigade to investigate and make contact with the Special Forces camp at Dak To. Two days later, one of the brigade’s battalions landed by helicopter on Hill 978, near Dak To, expecting to meet little resistance. Instead they found thousands of North Vietnamese soldiers, well entrenched and ready. The battalion was decimated. That same day, another American battalion ran into similar trouble on nearby Hill 882. General Peers and the other generals soon recognized the gravity of what we’d been trying to tell them: that the North Vietnamese had moved into the area in force and were itching to fight. The weekslong series of engagements that followed, collectively known as the Battle of Dak To, was one of the biggest in the war, and one of the conflict’s few pitched battles. The North Vietnamese had established defensive positions on several hills, forcing the American and South Vietnamese forces to fight uphill, culminating in a horrifically bloody engagement at Hill 875, from Nov. 19 to Nov. 23. By the end of Dak To, nine American battalions from the 4th Infantry Division and the 173rd Airborne Brigade — some 16,000 men — had been committed. American bombers flew more than 2,000 sorties. The Americans eventually won, but at great cost to both sides: More than 2,100 North Vietnamese were killed, as were 376 Americans and 61 South Vietnamese soldiers. I left the highlands in December when the offensive was all but over. I moved south to work with another team near Bien Hoa, just north of Saigon. When I got there, I saw all the same sorts of communications indicators we were picking up in the highlands before Dak To. We weren’t alone; American signals-intelligence units in the northernmost part of South Vietnam were intercepting the same patterns. We realized that an offensive was going to occur throughout the country starting at the end of January. The N.S.A. pulled together all the evidence, and once again we presented it to the military leadership. And once again, the generals refused to believe us. At the time, Marines in the north were under siege at Khe Sanh, and the top brass in Saigon was convinced that any other North Vietnamese activity was only a diversion, an effort to pull away American forces from what they and Washington believed was Hanoi’s plan to reprise the victory over the French at the siege of Dien Bien Phu, 13 years earlier. Despite mounting evidence to the contrary, they did not prepare for an all-out assault, and at the end of January they were thrown back on their heels by the Tet offensive. Put differently, it’s not quite correct to say that Tet caught the Americans and South Vietnamese by surprise. The intelligence was there, and the recent experience leading up to Dak To should have persuaded General William Westmoreland to take it seriously. Instead, he chose not to believe it. The problem was bigger than Generals Peers and Westmoreland; eight years later, the same mistake was made with the fall of Saigon. By then I was the N.S.A. station chief in the city. I warned Graham Martin, the American ambassador, about overwhelming evidence showing that Saigon was about to be attacked. He refused to believe me and didn’t call for an evacuation of the thousands of American civilians still in the city, along with our South Vietnamese counterparts. When the North Vietnamese attacked a few days later, the city descended into panic. I escaped under fire. My South Vietnamese partners, the men I was working with, weren’t so lucky. Some 2,700 of them were killed or captured and sent to “re-education” camps. Was Cassandra blessed or cursed? Those of us who worked in intelligence during Vietnam know the answer.",The New York Times
2017,Washington Eyes a Cold War Strategy Against North Korea,"News Analysis WASHINGTON — When Defense Secretary Jim Mattis declared on Tuesday that North Korea now had the missile capability to “threaten everywhere in the world, basically,” he hinted at a long-running debate inside the United States government: Can the same strategy that worked against the Soviet Union — mutually assured destruction — also work against a far smaller adversary? The answer is yes, of course it can, if the problem is defined as keeping Pyongyang from unleashing a surprise attack on the continental United States. Or no, it probably can’t, if the problem of containing North Korea is more complex than simply protecting Los Angeles and Washington. And with North Korea, as the past 70 years of bitter experience have repeatedly shown, almost everything is more complex. There is no evidence that Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s current leader, or his father or grandfather, ever contemplated getting into a direct nuclear exchange with the United States. Depending on whose estimates one believes, North Korea has 20 to 60 nuclear weapons; the United States has more than 1,500 currently deployed, and thousands more in storage. It would be, as one senior American military strategist put it a few weeks ago, a case of assisted suicide. But that hardly means nuclear weapons are useless for a 33-year-old leader, who has made clear he has ambitious goals for how he would make use of the power conveyed by a global nuclear reach. If the previous leaders of North Korea were interested mostly in a survival strategy — and saw a small nuclear arsenal as the country’s best guarantee — Mr. Kim appears to have far greater ambitions. South Korea may have all the technology and the money, but the North has a purity of purpose, in Mr. Kim’s mind, that will ultimately give it control of the entire Korean Peninsula. And with it, Mr. Kim believes, will come the respect of far larger powers that have been waiting, for decades, for the North to be swept away by forces of history. That goal only works if an American president — President Trump or his successors — contemplates risking Chicago in order to save Seoul. Part of Mr. Kim’s vision, some of those who have watched him most closely speculate, is to sow doubt in Asia that the United States would really come to their allies’ aid — and splinter the alliance that has teamed up against North Korea for 70 years. “Kim is determined to be a ‘Great Leader’ in his own right,” said Han Sung-joo, a former South Korean foreign minister, who still walks around carrying shrapnel he was hit with as a young boy, when his family was escaping North Korean forces during the Korean War. “And to do that,” Mr. Han said this month, “he needs to accomplish something his grandfather and his father did not: building an intercontinental missile that can strike anyplace in the United States.” This summer, the Trump administration declared outright that if Mr. Kim succeeded in reaching that goal, conventional deterrence would not be enough. In a series of public statements, Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, said that the methods that worked so effectively in the Cold War would not apply in the case of North Korea. “The North Koreans have shown, through their words and actions, their intention to blackmail the United States into abandoning our South Korean ally, potentially clearing the path for a second Korean War,” General McMaster said, suggesting that the assumption that North Korea wanted a nuclear weapon only to assure survival may be wrong. He talked, on several occasions, about how a “preventive war” might be necessary if diplomacy failed. “The president’s been very clear about it,” he said at another point. “He said he’s not going to tolerate North Korea being able to threaten the United States.” It was not clear whether General McMaster’s comments were intended to signal a true willingness to go to war, or whether he was simply trying to shake the North Koreans — and the Chinese — into believing that Mr. Trump, unlike his predecessors, was perfectly willing to reach for a military solution to the problem. In recent months, General McMaster has not repeated those lines, perhaps hoping that a lull in North Korean missile testing might provide a diplomatic opening. That hope was dashed with the latest, and most impressive, North Korean test. The ballistic missile it set off went roughly 2,800 miles into space, before returning to the Sea of Japan; it was intended to demonstrate that the North was now able to reach any corner of the United States. It is not clear whether Pyongyang really can, or whether it could keep a nuclear warhead from burning up in the return to earth — the real rocket science of launching nuclear missiles. But one thing is clear: Whatever threats that Washington and Beijing issued in the past few months — sanctions, and the threat of oil cutoffs — have clearly not deterred Mr. Kim. Now he is betting that he can complete his project — solving the last technical details — before the United States, its allies and China can agree upon a unified response. So far, that bet has proved correct. South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, has declared that there must never be another war on the Korean Peninsula, and suggested he has a veto power over any American decision to use force. (The Trump administration says the South Koreans, while close allies, have no such veto.) Japan has talked a tougher line, but has been within reach of North Korean nuclear weapons for years — and so far has lived with it, convincing itself that America’s nuclear umbrella had it covered. Of course, no American official is prepared to admit that the United States is willing, however unhappily, to rely on conventional deterrence and live with a North Korean nuclear missile capability that can reach American shores as well. After all, a succession of American presidents, from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush to Barack Obama, have all said that would be intolerable. But clearly that appears to be where the United States is headed. While Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said in Beijing at the end of September that he had several lines of communication open to the North Korean leadership, he has left unclear what the goal of any talks with Pyongyang might be. Getting North Korea to completely disarm, his aides conceded, is not remotely possible — and the North has rejected any talks that involve giving up its arsenal. That leaves various proposals for a nuclear “freeze,” an agreement that North Korea would stop nuclear testing and missile shots like this week’s, in return for some American concession. (The two that are most discussed are an agreement to limit American military exercises around the Korean Peninsula or the opening of talks on a peace treaty formally ending the Korean War, which terminated with only an armistice in 1953.) The advantage of a freeze agreement is that it holds the prospect of preventing the crisis from growing worse. Without testing, the North cannot demonstrate to the world it has a weapon that can truly reach the United States. “We need a manageable, realistic interim goal,” Robert Einhorn, a nuclear specialist at the Brookings Institution who designed many of the Obama-era sanctions against North Korea, noted recently. Many inside the Trump administration privately agree. But Mr. Tillerson himself rejected the idea in March, on his first visit to Seoul as secretary of state, saying that a nuclear freeze would simply enshrine the North’s current capability. It would, in short, mean that the administration had decided for the foreseeable future, to rely on Cold War style nuclear deterrence, rather than do what President Trump promised: To “solve” the North Korea problem, once and for all.

2017,Washington Has Delivered a Tangled Message on AT&T’s Power,"Loosening rules on internet providers would let big companies charge more for their services. But a suit to block a merger signals a tougher stance against big business. CreditCreditCorey Olsen for The New York Times In a matter of hours this week, the Trump administration twice weighed in on one of the central issues shaping business and society today — just how much market power big companies should be allowed to amass. Yet in back-to-back developments, two federal agencies arrived at starkly different conclusions, and one company, AT&T, found itself on opposite sides of the debate. On Monday, the Department of Justice sued to block AT&T’s proposed $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner, a deal that would unite one of the country’s biggest internet providers with the company that owns CNN, HBO and the Warner Bros. film studio. It was a signal from antitrust enforcers that an era of breakneck consolidation might be coming to an end, and that mergers would be evaluated by a new set of standards. Then on Tuesday morning, the Federal Communications Commission announced plans to dismantle net neutrality rules. The move would let companies charge higher fees and block access to some websites, and was effectively a green light for big internet service providers — including AT&T — to freely wield their influence against rivals. In each development, there are signs that the Trump administration is trying to reckon with a media and telecommunications industry that has become intensely concentrated in recent years; most Americans now get their internet and phone services from one of a few providers, and most TV shows and movies are produced by a handful of big companies. But there is so far no clear view about how Washington will navigate this constantly shifting terrain in the future. “We have one government, but two separate agencies with opposing views,” said Spencer Kurn, an analyst at New Street Research. “You’ve got one agency saying that marrying content and distribution results in too much market power, and another agency saying there’s no problem with a distributor favoring their content over someone else’s.” At the intersection of both debates is AT&T. A global powerhouse offering access to the internet through mobile phones and landlines, and satellite television service through DirecTV, AT&T has a long history of battling regulators. In 1982, it agreed to break itself up and end a nearly century-old monopoly. In 2011, regulators scuttled its proposed deal to acquire T-Mobile. Randall L. Stephenson, the AT&T chief executive, has vowed to fight the Justice Department in court to save the Time Warner deal. AT&T stands to gain from the rollback of net neutrality rules. It could charge companies and consumers more for high-speed internet access, and use its market influence to hinder content providers it competes against. “It’s an ‘open the champagne bottles’ moment for AT&T,” said Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia University who coined the term net neutrality — the concept of providing equal access to the internet. “They can just tell people to pony up.” But AT&T’s long-term aspirations could be dealt a severe blow if the Justice Department succeeds in blocking its takeover of Time Warner. On Tuesday, President Trump signaled his approval of the lawsuit. “Personally, I’ve always felt that that was a deal that’s not good for the country,” he said in response to a question from reporters. If the merger was approved, he suggested, “I think your pricing is going to go up.” For all the good a rollback of net neutrality rules would do AT&T, the company is looking to diversify. Its core businesses of delivering phone, internet and satellite television services are maturing. A big move into the content business would expand the company’s sources of revenue, and give it new opportunities for cost savings. One of AT&T’s biggest competitors, Comcast, has already married content and distribution with the acquisition of NBCUniversal. If the government succeeds in preventing the Time Warner deal, it will raise sharp questions about the future of AT&T, and its competitors. “This could be a watershed event for future business combinations in media,” said Rich Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG. “Does this mean Comcast will be broken up?” There is no evidence that the decisions by the Justice Department and the F.C.C. were coordinated. “I do not think it is a well-thought-out, cohesive policy that is coming from the executive office,” said Christopher L. Sagers, an antitrust professor at Cleveland-Marshall College of Law. Instead, the diverging decisions reflect an effort by different agencies trying to come to grips with a radically transformed media and telecommunications landscape, one where Silicon Valley companies are suddenly powerhouses in content creation, and traditional media companies exert vast influence over how information flows across the internet. “We’re definitely getting mixed messages from the administration,” said Larry Downes, project director for the Center for Business and Public Policy at Georgetown University. The Justice Department’s decision to intervene in the AT&T deal was the more surprising of the two developments this week. Many antitrust experts believe that the government’s case against the deal is weak, because it is a so-called vertical merger, bringing together two businesses that do not compete directly with each other. But the lawsuit is a sign that the Justice Department is beginning to think about antitrust enforcement in fundamentally new ways. The decision by the F.C.C. to roll back net neutrality rules was less surprising, but has equally far-reaching implications. With less regulation, big internet providers will be able to charge more for their services, extract new fees from websites and block content. “The F.C.C. is saying that they’re going to give up any legal authority over regulating high-speed internet,” said Susan Crawford, a professor at Harvard Law School. “They’re handing the power to choose winners and losers online to about five companies.” Despite the seeming irreconcilability of the moves by the Justice Department and the F.C.C., some see a common narrative in the two decisions. “They’re both defense strategies against Silicon Valley,” Mr. Wu said. By rolling back net neutrality, the government is giving old-school media companies like AT&T and Comcast more leverage over companies like Netflix, Google and Facebook that are increasingly becoming their competitors. And by challenging the AT&T merger with Time Warner, the Justice Department could be laying the groundwork for a new approach to antitrust enforcement that could be used to go after big technology firms. Barry Diller, the media mogul and chairman of IAC, which owns a host of websites including Match.com and Vimeo, cited the power of tech companies in expressing exasperation at the Justice Department suit. “If you think AT&T has too much market power because of distribution, tell me what happens if you are Facebook and Google, which have unbelievable concentration in distribution,” Mr. Diller said. “How would you ever be able to get a content addition to Google?” And there is another school of thought suggesting that more vigorous antitrust enforcement might have obviated the need for net neutrality rules in the first place. If regulators had been stricter about ensuring robust competition among internet service providers over the years, the theory goes, big firms like AT&T would not be able to operate in ways that harm competition. “Net neutrality was a distant-second-best remedy,” Mr. Sagers said. “If we could have competition in internet service provision, that would have been way better than relying on the F.C.C.” Even if the Justice Department succeeds in blocking AT&T’s deal for Time Warner, the opportunity to use antitrust enforcement as a means to give consumers more choice among internet providers has likely passed. And now, by unwinding net neutrality rules, Mr. Sagers said, the Trump administration will make it easier for big companies like AT&T to maintain the already enormous power it has amassed through earlier consolidation. “If you want to have a monopoly,” he said, “the government can be your best friend.”",The New York Times
2017,Washington’s Tent: A Detective Story,"How the Museum of the American Revolution found the only known depiction of George Washington’s traveling headquarters during the Revolutionary War. Late one night last spring, Philip Mead, the chief historian at the new Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia, was browsing auction listings online when he spotted one for a panoramic watercolor of the Continental Army encamped in the Hudson Valley. The museum had opened a month earlier, complete with a lavish theater dedicated to its star relic: the canvas marquee tent that George Washington used as his headquarters for most of the war. And that evening Mr. Mead found himself pausing over a vaguely familiar speck in the watercolor. “There was a marquee tent up on a hillside,” he recalled. “I thought to myself, ‘Could it be…?’” Apparently, it was. And now, six months after that “Where’s Waldo?” moment, the museum is announcing that it has acquired what it believes is the only known wartime depiction of Washington’s tent by an eyewitness. That would be enough of a coup. But the eyewitness was Pierre Charles L’Enfant, the French-born military engineer and future planner of Washington, D.C., who had rendered the scene with meticulous accuracy. “We have no photographs of this army, and suddenly here is the equivalent of Google Street View,” Mr. Mead said. “Looking at it, you feel like you are walking right into the past.” We spoke with Mr. Mead, who is also the museum’s director of curatorial affairs, and R. Scott Stephenson, the museum’s vice president of collections, exhibitions and programming, about the detective work that went into identifying the watercolor, which will be the centerpiece of an exhibition opening on Jan. 13. The watercolor, which was listed by Heritage Auctions, measures about seven feet long and 14 inches high. It was painted on six sheets of paper, which had been pasted together and mounted into a book. No artist was listed. The curators knew that the Library of Congress owned a similar panorama by L’Enfant, showing the Continental Army encamped near West Point, in August 1782. But it was the provenance information that provided a “Rosetta stone,” Mr. Stephenson said. The auction listing identified the watercolor as coming from the papers of Thomas Digges, who was related to a prominent Maryland family that had housed L’Enfant at the end of his life. The watercolor at the Library of Congress had been acquired in 1920 from that same family. (Later, the museum’s researchers determined that a brief inscription on the back of the new watercolor matched L’Enfant’s handwriting.) The museum paid $13,750 for the watercolor, including the buyer’s premium. “We’re not supposed to discuss value, but hmmmm…,” Mr. Stephenson said. “Fortunately, no one else seemed to have figured out it was by L’Enfant.” The auction listing described the watercolor as dating from the Battle of Stony Point in July 1779. But the museum determined that it actually depicts the Continental Army’s encampment at Verplanck’s Point, just across the Hudson, in the fall of 1782. It was nearly a year after the battle of Yorktown, but the outcome of the war remained unsettled. There was a possibility of renewed attacks from the British, who were still in New York City, about 60 miles downriver. Washington had set up camp there to greet the French troops commanded by Rochambeau, which were passing through to set sail from Boston. “This encampment, with all its beauty, was a diplomatic act,” Mr. Stephenson said. “They knew they needed to impress the world.” The scene had been partially captured by the painter John Trumbull, who did a portrait of Washington and his horse at Verplanck’s that he later presented to Martha Washington. The oval-shaped tent itself is not visible in Trumbull’s painting. “But now, because of this new watercolor and the research we’ve done, we can tell it shows Washington standing right in front of the tent,” Mr. Stephenson said. The curators had a sense of the general appearance of the encampment from letters and diaries by contemporary eyewitnesses, like one British traveler who described it as having “the most beautiful and picturesque appearance.” The encampment’s layout and details, down to the number of tents, were also recorded in a map, now owned by Harvard University, which came from the papers of Washington’s headquarters. The details on that map precisely match those in the watercolor. “The map was like the key that unlocks the whole thing,” Mr. Stephenson said. “You can tell exactly where L’Enfant was sitting to get that particular perspective.” Written accounts of the encampment describe the bowers that each regiment erected in front of their tents to provide shade and protection, with symbols indicating the regiments’ origins. Most are hard to make out, but the curators identified a tiny anchor in one bower — the symbol of a regiment from Rhode Island known for its large number of African-American and Native American soldiers. (A similar anchor is visible on the hat of a black soldier in a famous sketch by a member of Rochambeau’s army.) “You’re looking at an encampment full of American symbols, through the eyes of the man who later designed Washington, D.C.,” Mr. Mead said. After the Revolution, Washington’s tent was erected at various ceremonial occasions, including at Fort McHenry during the Marquis de Lafayette’s triumphant return to the United States in 1824. It seems never to have been captured in its unfurled glory, though it did make one odd cameo in 19th-century art history. In 1853, Harper’s Magazine published an engraving of the rolled-up tent as part of a story about Revolutionary War relics stored at the Virginia home of Robert E. Lee, whose wife was the great-granddaughter of Martha Washington. The standing tent is visible in one historical photograph, from around 1909, when it was pitched in the snow at Valley Forge by Rev. W. Herbert Burk, the founder of the Valley Forge Historical Society, who had purchased it from Lee’s daughter. At the museum, which acquired the historical society’s collection in 2003, the elaborately restored tent is the big reveal at the end of a dramatic movie. But L’Enfant’s image shows something described in documents that has disappeared: the elaborate neoclassical wooden entrance erected in front of the tent at some encampments. “This is the equivalent of the Oval Office on a lonely windswept hill,” Mr. Stephenson said of the tent as seen in the watercolor. “It combines private and public Washington, all in one view.”",The New York Times
2017,Watch Brands Are Thinking Twice About Going to the Fair,"LONDON — The luxury watch show Salon QP is returning to the Saatchi Gallery here this week for a ninth edition — during an increasingly challenging time for regional watch fairs. Even as Swiss watch exports have been steadily recovering from the contraction that began in 2014, two events originally scheduled for this fall — Watches & Wonders in Hong Kong and ViennaTime in Austria — have been canceled. And Salon QP has had to curtail its ambitions. In previous years, the event attracted some of the biggest names in watchmaking, including Tag Heuer, Bulgari and Vacheron Constantin. But this year, exhibitor numbers have dropped to around 40 from more than 60, so the show will be staged on two rather than three floors of the gallery. While the salon continues to be the showpiece luxury watch event in London, the absence of former exhibitors such as Tudor, Montblanc and Jaeger-LeCoultre will be a concern to The Telegraph, the British newspaper that bought the event in 2013. “This is definitely the year of the independents,” said James Buttery, editor of QP Magazine and one of the show’s curators. “Bigger brands are looking for volume, there’s no escaping that. And backing D.J.s and models is higher on their list of priorities than boutique events with collectors.” The state of Swiss exports is not the only challenge: The event has suffered from the evolution of watch retail space in London. Retailers such as Watches of Switzerland, Mappin & Webb, Harrods and Bucherer (which acquired The Watch Gallery in March for an undisclosed amount) have invested heavily in creating reasons for customers to visit stores, transforming the British capital’s luxury watch landscape. Showrooms like Watches of Switzerland’s three-story Regent Street flagship, one of the largest watch stores in Europe, have become magnets for buyers. (The Regent Street location produced 50 million pounds, or $66 million, of the £565 million in sales that Watches of Switzerland’s parent company Aurum Holdings listed in its most recent annual report.) Many of these emporiums have shop-in-shop brand boutiques, which effectively are permanent exhibition spaces, an economical alternative to the cost of designing, building and staffing a watch fair booth that will be dismantled in a matter of days. Watch brands also are sinking millions into boutiques in London. This month, Tag Heuer and Panerai (another former Salon QP exhibitor) will become the latest brands to open stores in central London. Big-name brands without a London shop, such as Audemars Piguet, are now a minority. Brands report a focus on retail activities as a significant factor in withdrawing from Salon QP. The British managing director of a Swiss watch brand, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the topic, described a lot of visitors to the London event as “tire kickers,” adding that customers who are really interested in buying will go to a quality third-party retailer or a brand boutique. Industry experts say that large brands also are unhappy that they get little measurable return on the investment required to participate in a regional fair, and that their presence actually helps provide a platform for small independent watchmakers. The Swiss brand’s managing director said small brands do need such events to reach customers. “But we have so many other tools at our disposal,” he added. “It’s not high on our list of things to do.” Salon QP has transformed the fortunes of a number of independents. The British brand Garrick was introduced at the 2015 show. “We specifically wait for Salon QP to come along before launching any new pieces,” David Brailsford, the Garrick founder, said. “It’s the perfect place to meet potential clients. Last year, we generated £65,000 in sales, and £45,000 the previous year.” Salon QP is not the only watch fair seeing brands take their spending power elsewhere. According to industry experts, Baselworld, the world’s largest watch and jewelry fair, had 200 fewer exhibitors in 2017 than it had in 2016, with many of the withdrawals blamed on the market slump and the show’s costly participation fees. One of the no-shows was the British brand Bremont, which decided to have its own event in a London townhouse. Once a Salon QP regular, Bremont also will not be at the 2018 show. The Baselworld organizers have acknowledged the diminishing participation, and announced that the 2018 show would run just five days, March 22 to 27, rather than the seven days it had scheduled in the past. Some other shows also have been making changes. The Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie — a showcase for Richemont brands such as Cartier, IWC and Roger Dubuis — opened the 2017 show’s final day to the public. “We had 2,500 public visitors,” said Fabienne Lupo, president and managing director of the Fondation de la Haute Horlogerie, the Swiss watch organization that organizes the event in Geneva each January. “In the future, fairs will not be sufficient. They will have to evolve and find new ways of organizing themselves.” But not all regional fairs are struggling. Dubai Watch Week, which is supported by the foundation, has grown to more than 30 exhibiting brands from the 10 that participated in its inaugural event in 2014. This year the fair, scheduled for Nov. 16 to 20, expects to attract more than 4,000 visitors; it drew 500 three years ago. Its organizers say they are focusing on a young audience. “Consumer habits have evolved and we have noticed that purchasing power has become much younger and more sporadic,” said Melika Yazdjerdi, director of Dubai Watch Week. “The market over all has had to adapt to a diverse, younger demographic, and we have been catering to a more interactive and dynamic audience through our programs. “If we only target existing collectors or consumers, it would leave no room to showcase new and exciting projects or encourage a younger audience to attend the show,” she said. Ms. Lupo, however, struck a cautious note: “The answer is probably that there is not a place for fairs everywhere, as the sponsors are very often the same.”",The New York Times
2017,"Watch Out, Formula One. Lewis Hamilton Is Now Serene.","Abu Dhabi Grand Prix There is a sense of calm about Lewis Hamilton that had not been present earlier in his Formula One career. Hamilton appears to be at peace with himself, and with his Mercedes team. Such serenity this season has contributed to his winning his fourth drivers’ championship, with two grands prix to spare in the 20-race season after an intense battle with Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari. That serenity should provide a cornerstone to Hamilton’s further title runs and his challenging the records held by the retired driver Michael Schumacher. Hamilton has no intention of easing off, not when he describes himself as “the most complete driver I’ve ever been.” Despite the self-praise, he insists, with a sense of foreboding, that there remains room for improvement. With Formula One’s regulations being stable for the next three seasons, there is every possibility that Mercedes will continue its dominance, with Hamilton getting closer to Schumacher’s records of seven titles and 91 career victories. Hamilton has 62. “What drives me forward is that this year has definitely been inspiring, showing that I’ve still this ability, this drive to continue,” Hamilton said in an interview. It is why he is adamant that he will be fired up for the first day of preseason testing in February. “As the season is winding down, I’m already starting to think about my winter preparation, analyzing what I did this year, what I can do better for next season,” he added. “Coming out of the last race and going to the factory, you are focused on understanding the tools you are going to be given for next year, and then you go away for your break and you get back in the groove of being in the best shape you can be.” In a sport constantly changing, evolving, and therefore challenging, Hamilton knows he cannot rest if he is to remain at the vanguard of Formula One. “There are always areas to improve,” he said. “It will be about the usage of time, the understanding of data. “Qualifying has been strong, but there are areas for improvement in practice and the understanding of the car. My technical knowledge has continued to grow, as have my relationships with people in the team, but I have to continue to build on those. “You don’t just build them and then let it be what they are. You’ve got to continue to grow them. So there are lots of areas and lots of work. It never stops until you decide to retire.” There is little chance of his retiring like his previous teammate, Nico Rosberg, did after winning the drivers’ championship in 2016. “I never want to see anyone else driving my car,” Hamilton said. “I’ve worked so hard to help it be what it is, the beauty that it is.” He also gets along with his new teammate, Valtteri Bottas, unlike the difficult relationship he had with Rosberg. The acrimony between them resulted in an unhealthy tension throughout the team and in the garage during a grand prix weekend. When Rosberg left, Hamilton and Toto Wolff, the team principal, met in the kitchen of Wolff’s Oxford home to discuss their differences of opinion that had arisen during the season. The meeting resulted in a much better relationship between Hamilton and Wolff this season. “It was a very, very important meeting, which I think helped determine the future,” Hamilton said. “There were things through the year that had big question marks over them, so it was to clear the air, to say what was exactly on our minds.” Hamilton said, for example, that he told Wolff that he felt the team favored Rosberg last year. “We didn’t argue, or anything like that, but it was an opportunity to argue, to shout at each other, to shed a tear if needed, whatever, to squash any negativity, and that’s what we did,” Hamilton said. “I left feeling relieved, a weight off my shoulder, and I think it was the same for Toto, and so I went into the winter with the belief and focus of having the team right behind me, and driven to utilize and build upon the foundation we had rebuilt in that meeting.” Wolff agreed it was a pivotal exchange. “Our conversation was very important to our relationship, because being able to talk about all the frustrations that had built up over a while brought a release in the tensions,” he said. “I very much believe the dynamic is very important within a team. We have spent considerable time working on the intrateam relationships. That discussion in the kitchen helped.” Highlighting the difference it has made, Wolff added, “Lewis and I have not had one single difference of opinion this past year, and that is remarkable in a sport that is so intense.” Hamilton is clearly more at ease this season, with a more mature and well-rounded character. “As a personality, Lewis has developed and performs on a better level these days,” Wolff said. “His personal development is impressive. “We must not forget these racing drivers are thrown into the public eye when they are very young. He is 32 years old, and people have forgotten that he needs to make his own experiences, make his own way. “This year I have found him very grounded, very confident, and that has certainly helped his racing.” Hamilton’s contentment with life, and his position within the team, was underlined at the last race in Brazil. After crashing out in the early stages of qualifying, Hamilton cheered on Bottas, who claimed pole position ahead of Vettel. Apart from when he was a boy watching Formula One, Hamilton could not recall doing anything like that since he began driving in the series. Wolff feels Hamilton’s passion makes Schumacher’s records attainable. Hamilton surpassed the first of those, for most pole positions, which stood at 68, this season. Hamilton now has 72. “Michael’s records are impressive, that have made him the best-ever racing driver,” Wolff said. “Lewis has many years of Formula One in front of him, and looking at his statistics, those records are within reach. “As long as the team provides him with the right car, and he continues to develop in every area, then we must together leave no stone unturned and continue to develop as a group.” Wolff then highlighted a crucial weapon in Hamilton’s armory as to why he is a four-time champion, and why he could add more. “What I see within him is that losing is extremely painful, so whether it’s the fear of losing, or it’s the simple feeling of losing out, I don’t know, but for him, it’s a very difficult emotion to cope with,” Wolff said. With experience on his side, Hamilton has a different perspective, but just as compelling as to what continues to fuel his desire. “Challenges are there to make life interesting,” Hamilton said. “The journey of overcoming them, and hopefully succeeding, is what then makes life meaningful and worthwhile.”",The New York Times
2017,Watch Rentals. Or Are Subscriptions Luxury’s New Frontier?,"The watch rental site Eleven James is making a change. The company is betting that the “sharing economy” format that has grown brands like Airbnb and Uber will not only work for upmarket watches, but also change how the world acquires luxury goods. “We are focusing on what really matters, which is the experience of beautiful things,” said Olivier Reza, the company’s new chief executive. Mr. Reza is well versed in that world. In addition to being the artistic director of Alexandre Reza, the jewelry house in Paris founded by his father, and a board member of Sotheby’s, Mr. Reza was an early investor in Eleven James. “As a very high-end jeweler, I know how important it is for consumers to commit to beautiful items,” he said. But sometimes, he added, only a few people can afford to enjoy them: “The journey of experiences becomes so limited.” So the rental business, founded in 2014 by Randy Brandoff, a former chief marketing officer at NetJets, plans to turn on Monday to a subscription structure — something Mr. Reza described as luxury’s new frontier. It intends to expand into jewelry and contemporary art in coming months. And watch owners will be able to consign timepieces in exchange for payments or to defray the costs of their own subscriptions. (Consignments now account for only about 5 percent of the site’s stock; the rest is what the company describes as thousands of watches from more than 30 brands.) For an entry-level subscription of $150 per month, a customer could select a Rolex Datejust, Cartier Pasha or Tag Heuer Carrera Chronograph, then exchange it for different model three to six months later. The top rate, $1,350 a month, will allow access to some of the watch world’s most storied pieces, such as a Patek Philippe Nautilus 5726A or an Audemars Piguet Ceramic Royal Oak Offshore 44. If a romance endures, a purchase can be arranged. A longtime collector himself, Mr. Reza said he had consigned seven of his watches: five Patek Philippes and two Rolexes. “Some have more emotional value than others, but I know that these pieces will be maintained and insured,” he said, “so I’m delighted to earn maybe 10 grand a year on them.” (He won’t share two watches that he wears regularly, a limited-edition Piaget and an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Quantième Perpétuel.) To Mr. Reza, arranging access to rare items is a natural — and elegant — evolution for the luxury sector. “People have a ‘watch guy’, a ‘jewelry guy’, an art adviser,” he said. “We want to be everybody’s ‘guy.’”",The New York Times
2017,"Watching a Loss to the Cavs, but Seeing a Bright Future for the Knicks","On Pro Basketball The eyes that have seen it all sparkled with energy late Monday night. With enthusiasm. With hope. With the belief in a better future that he, Cal Ramsey, has held fast to across six decades of Knicks performances that were good, bad and abominable. “I see a team that’s growing,” he said. Ramsey, a quintessential fan with a special place in the franchise’s heart, had willed himself to Madison Square Garden after a nearly four-month hospital stay that ended just last Friday. Happy to be going home to his uptown apartment, he refused to go there deflated by LeBron James, who took a late-morning Manhattan subway ride with Cleveland Cavaliers teammates and later derailed the Knicks by leading a 43-point fourth quarter that produced a 104-101 victory at the Garden. From his longtime seat a firm bounce pass behind the Knicks’ bench, Ramsey watched their young foundational pieces build a 23-point lead in the third quarter. They surrendered it all when the self-proclaimed King James dissected their leaky perimeter defense with surgical passing and a pull-up 3-pointer over the 7-foot-3 Kristaps Porzingis with the game in the balance. James’s muscular containment of Porzingis in the fourth quarter also reminded us why it’s always a good idea to avoid early season overstatement about teams perceived to be on the rise (Knicks) or in decline (Cavaliers). James’s night, which ended one rebound shy of a triple-double, was predictably familiar to a man of Ramsey’s age, 80, which makes him one of the few who could scribble a scouting report on every N.B.A. great to ever dribble under the Garden’s famed dropped ceiling. “LeBron is right up there with Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant — you name it,” he said. “This is what players like LeBron love to do, and there’s almost nothing you can do when he does that.” Born in Selma, Ala., in 1937, but reared socially in New York, and athletically in Harlem’s Rucker Park, Ramsey has befriended his fair share of N.B.A. stars. He could tell you about attending Martin Luther King Jr.’s historic speech in Washington with Wilt Chamberlain in 1963. He palled around with Willis Reed during the Knicks’ glory days in the early 1970s and later became a team broadcaster and community relations mainstay. Long before that, in the fall of 1959, Ramsey played for the Knicks as a rugged 6-4 small forward out of New York University, averaging 11.4 points and 6.7 rebounds in 22.9 minutes a game off the bench over a seven-game stretch aborted by a culture of unofficial quotas. As the story was once told to me by Fuzzy Levane, who was the coach then, he got a call from the owner, Ned Irish, informing him that four African-American players on the roster amounted to one too many. Ray Felix, Johnny Green and Willie Naulls stayed. Ramsey wound up in Syracuse, where he injured his knee and drifted, like many a deserving black athlete of the time, into obscurity. Here he sat Monday night, watching a post-Carmelo Anthony era Knicks team ride a 29-13 second-quarter wave behind a Latvian giant (Porzingis), a rookie point guard from France (Frank Ntilikina) and a Turkish center (Enes Kanter). “It’s amazing what this league has become,” Ramsey said, agreeing that it would have been impossible in his day to imagine such social and economic borders crashed. And while the Knicks of the great melting pot of New York were among the last teams to go global, better very late than never. In the Anthony era, the Knicks could never stand up to James, because their leading man was — socially at least — more wingman than antagonist. So it was fascinating to watch the Monday subplot that grew out of James’s recent silly swipe at the Knicks for drafting Ntilikina over Dallas’s Dennis Smith Jr. It perhaps precipitated a late first-quarter elbow-and-shoving skirmish between two players separated chronologically by more than 13 years along with an ocean of professional experience. Ntilikina didn’t back down and proceeded to demonstrate what the Knicks saw in him, tormenting the Cavs with his long arms and fast hands. Four of his six steals came in a second quarter that had Ramsey, along with the rest of a capacity crowd, thinking James’s future should be as a team owner, not its director of player personnel. “What I really like about Frank is that he’s got long arms, great defensively, and he’s a good playmaker,” said Ramsey, who could, better than most, note the similarities in size and poker-faced style to Walt Frazier, the renowned Knicks broadcaster and playing legend. Comparing those two is as premature as recent forecasts of the 7-7 Cavaliers’ imminent demise. But don’t blame Ramsey, the last of a precious generation of Garden regulars, for embodying the die-hard. “I live for these nights in this place,” he said. His health issues began last summer when he fell out of bed, hit his head on a table and needed 25 stitches to close the wound. In the hospital, tests revealed trouble with his heart, a trace of cancer, a gall bladder problem. Surgery was scheduled, but Ramsey pleaded with doctors to let him out so he could attend an annual awards dinner he holds in conjunction with a teenage scholarship fund-raiser he has presided over for years. “Went back in after the dinner, had two surgeries the next day,” he said. “They went in and took everything out, gave me a clean bill of health.” The legs that carried Ramsey around Rucker Park and into the early N.B.A. don’t cooperate much anymore. The body is what it is. But the mind is sharp. The eyes are clear. They see a future growing around the so-called unicorn nicknamed K.P. “Kristaps is 7-3, shooting 25-foot jumpers, and the stronger he gets and the more he can post up, he’s going to be impossible to guard — you almost can’t guard him right now,” Ramsey said. A player for all positions, James did, even deflecting a couple of Porzingis’s fourth-quarter shots and effectively harassing him in his new midrange comfort zone. And in a building booing him at every turn, James had the last word, the triumphant smirk. Ramsey did not begrudge him. He relishes the iconic talents, but also knows that late next month, James will be 33. Term limits may not exist for a king. But age limits are a fact of athletic life. Speaking for a long-suffering fan base, Ramsey promised to tough it out with the Knicks, to accept the growing pains of a promising rebuild. “I’m still weak after the surgeries,” he said, adding that even getting to his seat wasn’t easy. “But you do what you got to do.”",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | Wavering Senators Buy Trump’s Assurances on Taxes. Really.,"Andrew Rosenthal Susan Collins and some other senators who had hinted they might oppose the Republican tax bill giveaway to the super rich are changing their tune. Apparently, President Trump assured them over lunch that he’s going to fix the bill. Are they actually that clueless? Or do they merely think the rest of us are? One of the few certainties in these uncertain times is that no one can rely on anything Trump says. But these senators believe him now? The only other option is that they know Trump’s pledges to “fix” the tax bill are insincere and they are conning their constituents and the rest of America. Neither possibility is appetizing, but that’s where we are after Trump met with Republican senators to talk about the tax bill. Participants told reporters that Trump was paying attention and seemed to understand the details. Think about that. It’s news when this president seems to grasp an even slightly complicated idea. After the meeting, Trump announced that the bill will “have lots of adjustments before it ends, but the end result will be a very, very massive — the largest in the history of our country — tax cut.” Another false assurance. It was never going be the biggest tax cut in history, and the only “very, very massive” reductions are going to corporations and extremely wealthy individuals, like Trump. A vast majority of Americans will get absurdly small cuts that will be temporary. As The Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, middle-class Americans stand to get a cut of about $1,000, or $19 a week. (Trump’s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, thinks that is enough to get a new car or redo your kitchen.) The tax bill will blow a gigantic hole in the deficit, as much as $1.5 trillion, and the so-called deficit hawks, like Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, know that. But Trump apparently allayed Johnson’s concerns with a deft and powerful argument. “Come on, Ron,” he is reported to have said during a lunch on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. Johnson came out of the meeting saying that “the good news is, everybody agrees it’s a problem, it has to be fixed.” He added: “I just keep getting assurances it’s going to be fixed. I just want to see how.” So Johnson may be keeping open the possibility of opposing the bill on the Senate floor after voting for it in the Budget Committee. I doubt it, just as I doubt that the promised “fixes” will materialize. And even if they do, they may take the form of “triggers” that will roll back tax cuts if the bill doesn’t magically reduce the budget deficit. (Triggers, by the way, are strongly opposed by right-wing tax groups that dictate policy to Republicans.) “I think we’ve come to a pretty acceptable place, from my standpoint,” said Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who had been denouncing the tax bill. That’s the same Corker who said on Oct. 24 that Trump has “great difficulty with the truth” and has “proven himself unable to rise to the occasion” of being president. What a difference a month and a lunch make. Collins is not committing herself to the bill but is more optimistic after the lunch. “I believe that a lot of my concerns, it appears, are going to be addressed and that I’m going to be getting the opportunity to offer amendments on the Senate floor,” she said. Right. Even if she miraculously gets those amendments through the Senate, the bill will then go to a conference with the House, whose tax measure is worse and is under the grip of the most right-wing Republican caucus the nation has ever endured. As for Trump’s assurances, he has not been telling the truth about the tax bill from the start. Trump also once assured us that the United States under his leadership would lead the world, but the nation’s allies are running from him, and its adversaries are delighted by how easy he is to manipulate with red carpets, fancy parties and military parades. Trump once told us not only that he had dropped his claim that President Barack Obama was not a citizen, but also that he took credit for proving that he was a citizen. Now we read in news reports that he started the whole “birther” nonsense again shortly after he was elected. During the campaign, he said the comments he made on the infamous “Access Hollywood” video about assaulting women and getting away with were just “locker room talk.” Now he’s claiming the tape was fabricated. After Trump visited the Times editorial board last year seeking our endorsement, I told my older brother, Dan, how moderate Trump had sounded. Dan said he was amazed at how gullible I was after four decades in journalism. “That’s just the Trump that he wants the Times editorial board to believe exists,” he said. I didn’t have to hear that lesson twice. Apparently some of our senators still haven’t got it.",The New York Times
2017,Waymo Enlists AutoNation to Maintain Driverless Test Fleet,"Waymo, one of the leading forces in self-driving technology, is enlisting the largest auto retailer in the United States, AutoNation, to maintain and repair the growing number of driverless vehicles Waymo is testing around the country. No financial terms were disclosed. But the partnership suggests Waymo — a unit of Google’s parent, Alphabet — is moving a step closer to putting driverless vehicles into ride-hailing fleets that would serve the general public, not just its own employees and others selected by the company to test them. “AutoNation will help assure that Waymo vehicles are always in top condition as we bring fully self-driving cars to the public,” John Krafcik, Waymo’s chief executive, said in a statement. Mr. Krafcik recently hinted that Waymo was further along in commercializing its self-driving technology than previously indicated. “We’re really close,” he told reporters at a demonstration of Waymo’s driverless vehicles at Castle, its test center on a former Air Force base in Northern California. Maintaining expensive and technology-packed self-driving vehicles is a main challenge for using them in moneymaking businesses, like ride-hailing fleets, said Michael J. Jackson, AutoNation’s chief executive. In most cases, driverless vehicles in such fleets will have to be on the road almost around the clock to offset the cost of the sensors, computer chips, software and other systems that allow them to drive safely and reach their destinations without human operators, he said. “These vehicles need to be in service for hundreds of thousands of miles, much more than personal-use vehicles, to make them economically viable,” he said. “To do that, you have to do much more proactive, preventative maintenance than what a normal person would do on a car.” Because the vehicles are intended to operate without drivers, breakdowns have to be avoided and parts replaced when signs of wear first appear, not when they fail or when a warning light comes on, Mr. Jackson added. “They need to work not 99 percent of the time, but 100 percent of the time.” Waymo also has a deal with Avis Budget Group, the rental-car company, to provide certain services for the self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans that Waymo is deploying in the Phoenix area. AutoNation said it had already started servicing Waymo vehicles in California and Arizona. With 361 new-car franchises in 16 states, AutoNation has the reach to continue providing service as Waymo builds up fleets in other markets, Mr. Jackson said.",The New York Times
2017,Waymo Seeks Delay in Court Fight With Uber Over Trade Secrets,"SAN FRANCISCO — A battle between two technology titans that could impact the future of self-driving automobiles may be delayed after new evidence surfaced in a court filing on Monday. Waymo, the autonomous vehicle unit spun out of Google, claims Anthony Levandowski, a former Google self-driving vehicle engineer, conspired with Uber to steal top trade secrets from his former employer before leaving and eventually joining Uber. But with the trial set to begin in only a few days, Waymo asked William Alsup, a judge in the United States District Court in San Francisco, on Monday for a delay, citing the introduction of new information. The evidence refers to what Waymo called the “Jacobs letter,” a reference to a letter sent by Richard Jacobs, a former Uber employee, to Angela Padilla, deputy general counsel at Uber, according to court documents. The filing, which is heavily redacted and missing crucial information about the contents of the letter, includes a request from Waymo to delay the start of the trial until after the company has had a chance to conduct more depositions of top witnesses. “This evidence was never disclosed by Uber despite discovery requests and court orders,” Johnny Luu, a spokesman for Waymo, said in a statement. “We are eager to start trial, but believe it should be a full airing of the evidence, so we have asked the court for additional time to fully investigate this new information.” The request is the latest salvo in the fight between the two companies, which have shared a tangled and occasionally friendly history over the last five years. GV, the venture capital arm of Waymo’s parent company, Alphabet, invested hundreds of millions in Uber during its fledgling days as a ride-hailing start-up. Uber also shared information and strategy with David Drummond, a top Alphabet executive, who sat on Uber’s board for years after the investment. But as it became clear that the two companies would become competitors, the relationship soured. Mr. Drummond left Uber’s board last year. And in February, Waymo filed suit against Uber. The suit added legal intrigue to a race to build autonomous vehicles, which automakers, technology companies and auto parts manufacturers believe will be a multibillion-dollar business. For months, Uber has maintained its innocence, and the two companies will argue before Judge Alsup on Tuesday. Jury selection was set to begin on Wednesday. “Uber has been waiting for its day in court for quite some time now,” Chelsea Kohler, an Uber spokeswoman, said in a statement. “We’re keen to have a jury finally hear this case on its merits.” An earlier version of this article misstated the circumstances surrounding the departure of David Drummond, a top Alphabet executive, from Uber’s board. He resigned but was not asked to leave.",The New York Times
2017,Waymo’s Autonomous Cars Cut Out Human Drivers in Road Tests,"SAN FRANCISCO — The self-driving car is edging closer to becoming driverless. Waymo, the autonomous car company from Google’s parent company Alphabet, has started testing a fleet of self-driving vehicles without any backup drivers on public roads, its chief executive said Tuesday. The tests, which will include passengers within the next few months, mark an important milestone that brings autonomous vehicle technology closer to operating without any human intervention. Dozens of companies are testing self-driving technology on public roads across the United States and some autonomous features are available in today’s cars. But Waymo is believed to be the first company to test vehicles on public roads without a driver ready to take over in an emergency. “Our ultimate goal is to bring our fully self-driving technology to more cities in the U.S. and around the world,” John Krafcik, Waymo’s chief, said in prepared remarks at a technology conference in Portugal on Tuesday. “Fully self-driving cars are here.” The tests are a show of engineering prowess by Waymo at a time when traditional automakers and other tech companies like Uber race to develop similar vehicles. Waymo is limiting the trials to a region around Phoenix, where it has been conducting a ride-testing program this year, and plans to expand the testing area over time. The company said it planned to use the driverless vehicles to launch a commercial ride-hailing service for the general public, but did not offer any detail on when, where or how. Waymo said its driverless cars hit the public roads last month. The company did not say whether it was testing the driverless cars in environments considered challenging for autonomous vehicles, like bridges or tunnels, or more difficult conditions, like driving at night or in rain and snow — usually not a big concern in the dry Phoenix climate. While the prospect of cars without emergency drivers may raise concerns among some passengers, Waymo said it had confidence in the safety of its self-driving technology. It has included backup systems like a secondary computer to take over if the main computer fails. And though the cars are driverless, they are not entirely without humans, at least for now. Waymo employees sit in the back seat of the cars, monitoring them, a company spokesman, Johnny Luu, said. Once passengers join the tests, they will be able to contact Waymo support staff with a button inside the car. If the cars are involved in a crash, they are programmed to respond appropriately, including pulling off the road on their own. Driverless cars are regulated by a patchwork of state laws. Arizona, like many states, has no restrictions against operating an autonomous vehicle without a person in the driver’s seat. On the other hand, California, where Waymo is headquartered, requires any self-driving car to have a safety driver sitting in the front. In December, Waymo published a report for California’s Department of Motor Vehicles about how frequently its car “disengaged” — deactivating its autonomous mode because of a system failure or safety risk and forcing a human driver to take over. In the report, Waymo said this happened once every 5,000 miles the cars drove in 2016, compared with once every 1,250 miles in 2015. Consumer Watchdog, a frequent critic of Alphabet, said that data demonstrated that the cars are not ready to drive without any human intervention and that Waymo was following the Silicon Valley model of “beta testing” a new technology on the public. “It’s the wrong approach when you’re dealing with self-driving cars,” said John M. Simpson, a director at Consumer Watchdog. “When things go wrong with a robot car, you kill people.” Researchers believe self-driving cars can be safer than cars operated by human drivers because they are programmed to adhere strictly to traffic laws, they don’t get distracted, and they usually refrain from taking unnecessary risks. Timothy Tait, a spokesman for the Arizona Department of Transportation, said the state was on pace to exceed 1,000 automobile-related fatalities this year and that its top priority is the public’s safety — particularly by advancing efforts to reduce crashes and deaths on its roads. “We are closely monitoring emerging technologies like self-driving cars that may ultimately support safer travel and open up opportunities for populations who today are unable to drive for themselves,” he said in a statement. Waymo, which started as a research and development project for Google in 2009, maintains what many in the industry consider a technological advantage over its competitors. Waymo said its autonomous vehicles had driven more than 3.4 million miles on actual roads — with safety drivers — as well as running 10 million miles every day in a virtual simulator. In his remarks, Mr. Krafcik said Waymo sees a ride-hailing taxi service as the first commercial application of the company’s driverless car technology, though there could be other uses in logistics and public transportation. Taking the human out of the equation will fundamentally change transportation and change how people buy cars, said Mr. Krafcik, who was an executive at Hyundai Motors before joining Google. “Because you’re accessing vehicles rather than owning, in the future, you could choose from an entire fleet of vehicle options that are tailored to each trip you want to make,” he said. “They can be designed for specific purposes or tasks.”",The New York Times
2017,"Wayne Cochran, Singer With High Energy and Big Hair, Dies at 78","Wayne Cochran, who wrote a classic love-and-loss pop song while still in his early 20s, then morphed into an energetic rhythm-and-blues singer with a devoted following and an outrageous pompadour before finding a new purpose in a Christian ministry near Miami, died on Nov. 21 in Miramar, Fla. He was 78. His son, Christopher Cochran, said the cause was cancer. Mr. Cochran was a relative unknown trying to make it as a singer in Georgia in 1961 when he wrote and recorded “Last Kiss,” a heart-wrencher about a fatal car wreck. “Well, where, oh where can my baby be?” it starts. “The Lord took her away from me.” Mr. Cochran’s initial recording did not make much of an impact, but a 1964 cover by J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers became a national hit. The song — which Christopher Cochran said was inspired by a real traffic fatality, though not one that his father was involved in — has proved durable. A Canadian group named Wednesday had a modest hit with it in the 1970s, and Pearl Jam did even better with a version recorded in 1998. Mr. Cochran, though, veered away from teenage pop and into soul and R&B, developing a high-energy stage act with a band he called the C. C. Riders (the initials stood for Cochran Circuit). With his hair in a pompadour of epic dimensions, he put on a propulsive show that earned him the nickname the White Knight of Soul. He drew comparisons to James Brown. “Cochran, though, made everything faster, louder; everything was bigger,” The Miami New Times wrote in a 1997 feature about him, “from the size of his carefully coifed ’do to the size of his band. And for white audiences reluctant to venture across the tracks to hear Brown and his black R&B contemporaries, Cochran offered a powerful and impassioned shot of blue-eyed soul.” Talvin Wayne Cochran was born on May 10, 1939, in Thomaston, Ga. His father, Talvin, worked in a cotton mill, and his mother, the former Mini Lee Starley, was a homemaker. He grew up listening to honky-tonk on the family radio and, with some other local boys, formed his first band, the Blue Cats. “We’d play around on the weekends on front porches and in people’s living rooms,” he recalled in the 1997 article. He dropped out of school in the ninth grade to pursue music — the story is that his school gave him the choice of either cutting his hair or leaving, and he left. In any case, by the late 1950s he was in Macon, Ga., where the musical opportunities were more plentiful than in Thomaston. Mr. Cochran formed a band and then relocated to Bossier City, La., to take an extended engagement at a club called Sak’s Boom Boom Room. The band grew, with Mr. Cochran adding horns and changing the name to the C. C. Riders, and the shows grew wilder. The group toured extensively, especially in the South and Midwest, playing roadhouses and nightclubs, including a place in Muncie, Ind., where a student at Ball State University heard about Mr. Cochran’s frenetic shows. Almost two decades later, in 1982, that student, David Letterman, had Mr. Cochran as a guest on “Late Night,” and Mr. Cochran told the story of how he had hit upon his distinctive look. “I had been messing with my hair, trying to get what I wanted,” he said. “I really couldn’t figure it out.” Then, at a neighboring club, he saw a group featuring the young Johnny and Edgar Winter, both albinos. “There was a great thing about their hair,” Mr. Cochran told Mr. Letterman. “Every time the lights over their heads changed colors, their hair changed colors. And I said, ‘Now there’s the color, if I could figure out how to get it.’” He hired a stylist with a bottle of bleach, but the initial experiment did not go well. “We must have bleached it for two or three days, and it come up strawberry red and then about fell out,” he said. “But we finally got it up platinum, and he teased it up like the old Trojan warriors.” Mr. Cochran relocated the band to Miami in 1964, and its following grew. He took to leaving the stage and marching right onto the dance floor to sing, his horn section following along. “We’d be out there in the audience, standing on tables,” he said. “We’d make the whole room part of the show.” Sometimes he would throw bottles and chairs. Among those who experienced the excitement was Jackie Gleason, who saw Mr. Cochran and the band at the Barn in Miami and had them on “The Jackie Gleason Show” in 1966. Mr. Gleason also wrote the liner notes for the 1967 album “Wayne Cochran!” “He doesn’t just sing — he explodes,” Mr. Gleason wrote. “He doesn’t perform — he happens. And when he happens, everything in the immediate vicinity vibrates and responds.” Mr. Cochran’s records were never chart toppers, but they made an impression. His signature song from the mid-’60s, “Goin’ Back to Miami,” was covered by the Blues Brothers, the band led by John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd, in 1980. But he followed the path of many other performers, one that included too many pills, too much alcohol, a dwindling money supply and, ultimately, a reckoning. “I remember dreading the thought of living another 30 or 40 years,” he said in the 1997 article, speaking of what he was going through in the mid-1970s and early ’80s. “I had this absolute fear of tomorrow. I had had everything. I had gone from nothing to everything and was heading back to nothing.” He turned to religion, receiving a call to the ministry in 1981 and founding the Voice for Jesus ministries northwest of Miami. His son said that at its peak, the church had about 600 members, though the figure is now down to about 130. Mr. Cochran may have left performing behind, but his church services were full of music, with him sometimes singing a few lines. In 2009 he even brought former bandmates into the church for a reunion performance. Mr. Cochran’s first marriage, to Inez Newton in the 1950s, ended in divorce. His second wife, the former Monica Powell, whom he married in the mid-1960s, died in February. In addition to his son, he is survived by a daughter, Cynthia Warford, and several grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Mr. Cochran said that one reason he was driven away from show business and toward religion was that his destructive habits had fractured his family. The change, he said, repaired the damage. “Standing up here, praise and worship, every Sunday morning, is my granddaughter and my great-granddaughter,” he told his congregation in an address on the theme of “Believe” last year. “In the sound booth is my son-in-law. My son is here. Isn’t that wonderful?” An earlier version of this obituary misstated part of the name of a nightclub in Bossier City, La., where Mr. Cochran once performed. It was Sak’s Boom Boom Room, not Sax’s.",The New York Times

2017,Ways to Stop Facebook From Eating Your Battery,"Tech Tip Q. I checked the battery usage setting on my phone and saw that Facebook was taking up a huge amount of energy. What is that app doing to suck up all that juice, and is there a way to limit it? A. Over the years, the Facebook app for Android and iOS has added more power-hungry features, like autoplay videos, location-based suggestions and real-time notifications. That means that more power is demanded from the battery. The separate Facebook Messenger app for text, audio and video calls has also been found to consume a noticeable amount of battery charge. Adjusting settings in the Facebook app can rein in some of the energy consumption, though be aware that doing so can limit the app’s functionality. For example, disabling the app’s ability to use the phone’s location-services function can save some power, but the map-based features may not work as well. In the settings for the phone or app, you can also turn off Facebook’s ability to download data in the background, which also helps if you have a cellular plan with data-use limits; the Android version of the app has a Data Saver setting that may help streamline bandwidth consumption, too. You can find specific instructions for maximizing mobile battery life in Android and iOS on the websites for Google and Apple. In the Facebook app’s settings, turning off the autoplay option for videos and mobile notifications can save energy. Forcibly closing the Android or iOS app when you do not expect to be using it for a while is another power play. Facebook’s mobile app is convenient and makes using the service easy, but it is not the only way to get to your Friends list if you decide to delete the software to save battery life. Instead, you can log into the mobile version of the site at m.facebook.com with your phone’s web browser, which should take up less battery power. Many Android users also have the option to use the Facebook Lite app, which was designed for less-powerful phones using slower connections. It performs basic Facebook functions like sharing photos and posting status updates.",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | We Can’t Trust Facebook to Regulate Itself,"Op-Ed Contributor I led Facebook’s efforts to fix privacy problems on its developer platform in advance of its 2012 initial public offering. What I saw from the inside was a company that prioritized data collection from its users over protecting them from abuse. As the world contemplates what to do about Facebook in the wake of its role in Russia’s election meddling, it must consider this history. Lawmakers shouldn’t allow Facebook to regulate itself. Because it won’t. Facebook knows what you look like, your location, who your friends are, your interests, if you’re in a relationship or not, and what other pages you look at on the web. This data allows advertisers to target the more than one billion Facebook visitors a day. It’s no wonder the company has ballooned in size to a $500 billion behemoth in the five years since its I.P.O. The more data it has on offer, the more value it creates for advertisers. That means it has no incentive to police the collection or use of that data — except when negative press or regulators are involved. Facebook is free to do almost whatever it wants with your personal information, and has no reason to put safeguards in place. For a few years, Facebook’s developer platform hosted a thriving ecosystem of popular social games. Remember the age of Farmville and Candy Crush? The premise was simple: Users agreed to give game developers access to their data in exchange for free use of addictive games. Unfortunately for the users of these games, there were no protections around the data they were passed through Facebook to outside developers. Once data went to the developer of a game, there was not much Facebook could do about misuse except to call the developer in question and threaten to cut off the developer’s access. As the I.P.O. approached, and the media reported on allegations of misuse of data, I, as manager of the team responsible for protecting users on the developer platform from abuse of their data, was given the task of solving the problem. In one instance, a developer appeared to be using Facebook data to automatically generate profiles of children, without their consent. When I called the company responsible for the app, it claimed that Facebook’s policies on data use were not being violated, but we had no way to confirm whether that was true. Once data passed from the platform to a developer, Facebook had no view of the data or control over it. In other cases, developers asked for permission to get user data that their apps obviously didn’t need — such as a social game asking for all of your photos and messages. People rarely read permissions request forms carefully, so they often authorize access to sensitive information without realizing it. At a company that was deeply concerned about protecting its users, this situation would have been met with a robust effort to cut off developers who were making questionable use of data. But when I was at Facebook, the typical reaction I recall looked like this: try to put any negative press coverage to bed as quickly as possible, with no sincere efforts to put safeguards in place or to identify and stop abusive developers. When I proposed a deeper audit of developers’ use of Facebook’s data, one executive asked me, “Do you really want to see what you’ll find?” The message was clear: The company just wanted negative stories to stop. It didn’t really care how the data was used. When Russians decided to target Americans during the 2016 election, they didn’t buy TV or newspaper ads, or hire a skywriter. They turned to Facebook, where their content reached at least 126 million Americans. The fact that Facebook prioritized data collection over user protection and regulatory compliance is precisely what made it so attractive. Now the company is arguing that it should be allowed to regulate itself to prevent this from happening again. My experience shows that it should not. Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, mentioned in an October interview with Axios that one of the ways the company uncovered Russian propaganda ads was by identifying that they had been purchased in rubles. Given how easy this was, it seems clear the discovery could have come much sooner than it did — a year after the election. But apparently Facebook took the same approach to this investigation as the one I observed during my tenure: react only when the press or regulators make something an issue, and avoid any changes that would hurt the business of collecting and selling data. This makes for a dangerous mix: a company that reaches most of the country every day and has the most detailed set of personal data ever assembled, but has no incentive to prevent abuse. Facebook needs to be regulated more tightly, or broken up so that no single entity controls all of its data. The company won’t protect us by itself, and nothing less than our democracy is at stake.",The New York Times
2017,We Lost Our Newborn Baby. Can This Marriage Survive?,"The Sweet Spot The “Dear Sugars” podcast is an advice program hosted by Steve Almond and Cheryl Strayed. The audio contains more letters; submissions are welcome at dearsugars@nytimes.com. If you’re reading this on desktop, click the play button below to listen. Mobile readers can find “Dear Sugars” on the Podcasts app (iPhone and iPad) or Radio Public (Android and tablet). Dear Sugars, I recently married a wonderful man. We’ve been together two years, and we’re more in love than ever. Our first child — a baby boy — was born three months before we got married and he died. He had a heart defect, and there was nothing to be done. We’ve dealt (and are dealing) with our grief beautifully and differently, but together. Still, I can see why so many couples break up after the death of a child. It’s so hard not to let the immeasurable sadness overshadow the joy of love. I’m wondering how we can overcome that pattern and whether our relationship will ever be the same as it was. Will we be as excited over the birth of our next child? I need reassurance that our love and excitement can exist after this. Right now, I’m working in the U.S. while we wait for his visa. It’s hard for us to have good communication and for me to feel supported while so far apart. I’m so lonely dreaming about my beautiful baby at night and missing my wonderful, sexy husband. When we were living together, “the shoulder to cry on” was always there. Now we’re relying on FaceTime, and it’s not exactly conducive to a good cry or heart-to-heart talks about fear and grief. Grieving Honeymooner Steve Almond: I’m so very sorry about your baby boy. More than any words of condolence, I wish I could give you a hug. You’re asking two essential questions: whether your marriage will survive this, and whether your relationship will ever be the same. In fact, the only way your marriage will survive is for both of you to accept that it will never be the same again. How could it be? Your union was consecrated by this tragic event. It’s not a loss you’re going to “get over.” It’s one you’re going to have to integrate into your lives. One thing that’s vital to realize is that it’s not the sorrow of a child’s death that tears certain couples apart. It’s a sense of isolation within that sorrow. You and your husband should consider it your central goal to share your feelings with one another, even and especially the difficult feelings: ones of helplessness, confusion, guilt, depression and even rage. You don’t have to feel the same things, or mourn in the same way, just commit to being open and honest. Recognize, too, that you need support as a couple: the love of family and friends, the wisdom of other survivors, the guidance offered by therapists — whatever it takes. No two people, even love-struck honeymooners, can get through such rough seas without all hands on deck. Cheryl Strayed: My deep condolences to you, Grieving Honeymooner. I understand how you and your husband might struggle with not letting your sorrow overshadow your joy, but I want to challenge your assumption that your son’s death will have a negative impact on your marriage. While it’s true that some research shows that bereaved parents have higher divorce rates than couples that haven’t experienced a loss, other studies contradict those findings. The evidence is inconclusive, and it doesn’t much matter anyway. I encourage you to forget about overcoming a statistic that may or may not apply to your life and focus instead on what you know: You and your husband are more in love than ever. The best reassurance I can give you that your love and excitement will exist after the death of your son is to point out to you that it already does. You and your husband have come through a terrible loss together and you’ve been supportive companions in your mutual grief, even while enduring the challenges of a long-distance relationship. For every couple ripped apart by hardship, another is more strongly bonded, and it sounds like you and your husband fall into the latter category. Take strength from that. SA: One thing that might complicate your situation is that this loss came at such a volatile moment in your relationship. The physical distance between you, and even more so the anxiety of waiting for your husband’s visa, must be excruciating. I applaud you for being so kind to each other in the midst of this uncertainty, and so forthright in confronting the emotional risks of your situation. You’ve had to mourn this loss, and weather this separation, at a moment when most couples are blissfully cataloging wedding gifts and building a future. The very name you’ve chosen (Grieving Honeymooner) speaks to this dissonance, as does the fact that you have to rely on a smartphone app to gaze into the eyes of your beloved. It sounds like FaceTime is inhibiting your emotional connection; I’d suggest writing letters or talking on the phone. CS: I like Steve’s suggestion of using methods other than FaceTime to communicate, and I also encourage you to be creative about what you do during those exchanges. Instead of relying exclusively on the “how was your day” conversations, perhaps you’d feel more connected to your husband if you consciously expanded the things you share across the distance. How about reading a book out loud to each other or interviewing each other about an era in your lives or listening to a podcast together and then discussing it? Part of what gets lost when we’re far away from those we love is the sense of connection we feel when we interact with people in a wide variety of ways, rather than exchanging a simple report of the day. I think, too, that talking about the future together is of vital importance — even while you process the painful past. Looking ahead to the time when you’ll live together again and have another child will inevitably bring excitement and joy to your conversations. SA: You ask whether you’ll be as excited over the birth of your next child. Your fear, I think, is that you’ll never be able to recapture the sense of boundless hope you once had. That may be true. But I suspect you’ll be just as excited, only in different ways. The shadow of your first son’s death can’t be erased. But it might yet cast a light onto the precious opportunity you and your husband have to bring another life into this world.",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | We Need the Diversity Visa Lottery,"Op-Ed Contributor When I tell people that I was born in Uzbekistan, they usually say I am the first Uzbek-American they have ever met. Just as often, they admit they can’t even name a single Uzbek. I worry that the horrific terrorist attack in Lower Manhattan on Tuesday by Sayfullo Saipov, an Uzbek native, has changed that for the worse. President Trump placed blame for the attack on the State Department’s “diversity lottery” visa program, through which Mr. Saipov entered this country, and he called for its end. The lottery has few preconditions, but applicants must come from countries with little immigration to America. It would be a shame to eliminate it. The program has allowed my family and countless other immigrants to thrive. Moreover, such a craven move would mean America loses a chance to fight extremism across the world by defining its values on its own terms rather than letting its enemies do so. I was only 2 years old when my family started a new life in an Atlanta suburb. Our household was quintessentially American, reflecting a hodgepodge of cultures. Like many other boys, I loved nothing more than playing in Saturday afternoon baseball games at our local park and waking up early on Sundays for extra batting practice with my dad. But kids also belittled and taunted me, particularly after the Sept. 11 attacks, because of my Muslim-sounding name. I kept this to myself, which nearly two-thirds of children who are bullied also do. I had always wanted to be a college baseball player and was thrilled when recruiters from Oberlin College in Ohio came knocking. I was a student-athlete there and achieved the most coveted prize among immigrants: an American college education. Through hard work and more than a little bit of luck, I was awarded the Rhodes Scholarship and I’m in my last year of graduate study at the University of Oxford. My parents laid the foundation for my success. They have dedicated their lives to public service, spending a vast majority of their careers, absent a few years when they were learning English, working at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2015, they even traveled to Sierra Leone, the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak, to help slow the spread of the virus. My family’s story wouldn’t be possible without the “diversity lottery” program. President Trump’s call to end it does nothing to strengthen our national security. Uzbekistan’s government has willingly helped us fight terrorism. Furthermore, people who enter the United States through the diversity visa program submit to thorough background checks. Although we now know that Mr. Saipov passed his with no red flags, he was reportedly radicalized while in America, not before, a phenomenon no test could screen for. The diversity visa program should also be preserved because, for many people across the globe, a relative or a neighbor who has managed to immigrate to the United States is their only authentic connection with the country. This was certainly true for my family. At a time when groups ranging from state-sponsored media to terrorist organizations denounce the United States as “the Great Satan,” America can’t afford to turn its back on an opportunity to portray itself as an open, tolerant and diverse nation. Most important, America is obligated to live up to its promise as a shining city on a hill for aspiring immigrants across the world. The country has always served as a place where people were limited only by the bounds of their imaginations or the scope of their dreams. No person has a greater claim to the American dream than any other, and it would be uniquely un-American to systematically exclude the residents of some nations in an immigration system that disproportionately favors those who are related to those already in the United States. We face a number of complex challenges in both immigration and national security. As we confront them, however, we have to remember that in America, you’re defined less by where you came from and more by where you are going.",The New York Times

2017,We Were in Our 20s and We Didn’t Have a Clue,"Modern Love Always hard to believe the ways details vanish. Even what John Cheever once called the marvelous skulduggery of illicit love, time chips away and scatters, and what you’d thought would be seared for life? Reach for it, it’s gone. We were still in our 20s though she was already married, a weird novelty. My first conflict with that specter: husband. Society’s great, dull bulwark. We met at another wedding. She was a friend of the bride’s. I was an old roommate of the groom’s. The husband hadn’t joined her. I’d come alone also. We were both in the wedding party and had been assigned to walk down the aisle, arm in arm. She wore a lemon dress. It was my first time in a tuxedo. We got drunk and happy and a lot drunker and a lot happier. We ended up, as you do in Chicago in July: in Lake Michigan. I think of the dark water, that glorious floating, her dress like a little parachute blooming. Stumbled back to someone’s room, hers or mine, I wasn’t sure. Woke up to the open blinds, afternoon light. On the floor, the sandy wreckage of our respective uniforms. We’d missed breakfast. We’d missed brunch. We’d missed the bride-family versus groom-family softball game. Another bridesmaid was pounding on the door. Must have been her room. Bridesmaids are indentured servants, serfs. Groomsmen get drunk. Easy to say now that we were in our 20s and didn’t have a clue. Fact is we were already making plans. “Remain here,” she said. “I’m rooted to these sheets,” I said. “Where are the sheets?” I slept. She came back a couple of hours later and fell asleep next to me in her clothes. At some point I woke up and gave an impassioned speech about fate and destiny to the hotel-room ceiling. I toasted Mr. Marriott for bringing us together. She slept through it. She was small and blond and wore big glasses. When she was awake, she laughed a lot. She already had a master’s degree. She spoke Basque to her grandmother. She subscribed to the Utne Reader. What more did I need to know? She lived in St. Louis. I lived in Boston. She worked for an accounting firm and traveled a lot. Three months later she came to Massachusetts for work. I remember this. Walking very slowly, as slowly as possible, down the corridor toward her hotel room. I got down on my hands and knees and crawled. She must have felt my presence because she opened the door and saw me and laughed and got down on her hands and knees and crawled my way. Had it not been for a startled maid and her big cart of sundries, we’d have torn each other to nothing out there in the corridor. Things get hazier. The single bed in my dog meat apartment in Allston. Her putting lotion on her feet. A walk in Boston Common. Milkshakes at J.P. Licks? A rented car and a drive down the Cape to a bed-and-breakfast. How easily she laughed. A kindness in her always wet eyes. Tears waiting all the time, though I never saw them drop. Her braininess. The fact that she paid with her corporate credit card because she knew I had no money. I was working at the Cambridge Y.M.C.A. on Mass Ave, in the after-school program. I played Ping-Pong and yelled at little kids. And I was writing short stories. She read a couple of them and laughed though I can’t imagine I was trying to be funny. My aim was extreme solemnity. I wanted everything, even then, to be a dirge. But everything delighted her. The clam shack by the Bourne Bridge. Boiled clams were hilarious. Drinkable embryos! At one point, I remember, in the Common, I showed her the statue Robert Lowell wrote about in “For the Union Dead.” I said, Come and live with me. I watched myself. I was gallant. I pulled her close with my poor, artistic hands. In the Cheever story, the guy’s a jewel thief who meets a woman on a cruise. So I worked in day care. Did this mean I couldn’t be a hero? “In Boston?” she said. “Technically I live in Allston, which is an independent entity, but it’s also part of Boston.” “So it’s a neighborhood?” “Yeah, but sort of more. It’s hard to explain. It’s a little like Kosovo.” “Or Vatican City.” “Exactly. Allston’s like Vatican City.” We walked on, hand-in-hand, swinging arms. I wasn’t going to press the issue, what was obvious was obvious. It had everything to do with time. How you didn’t notice it. How you didn’t even need it. Could be 3 in the afternoon, could be midnight. I remember the silence of the drive back from the Cape. I remember the milkshakes. I remember walking backward, again, very slowly, doing a little backward shimmy, down the same hotel corridor as she stood at her door like an actress, wagging at me with her index finger. A beckoning and goodbye at the same time. Two weeks later she called. Her husband, she said, was on the line as well. They both had something to say. She wanted to make clear that there wasn’t going to be any more to this. That we’d had our time together. She had no regrets. Did I understand? No more phone calls at work, no more letters sent to work. The husband spoke up: “You all right with this?” His voice was pleasant and considerate. “Look, it’s cool. I know she’s awesome.” She laughed a quick laugh, but stopped. She asked if I wanted to say anything. I said I didn’t think I did. Part of me wants this to be a sad recounting, not a pathetic one, but I see I’m failing. I’m trying to stay close to the facts as best as I can remember them, but as I say, facts disintegrate. For days, weeks, I mourned around the city. I rode the T and read. I went to work. I shouted at kids to line up for snack. “If you guys don’t line up, there will be no snack, period.” At night, in Allston, I considered the nature of self-pity, how it’s not unlike masturbation in the sense of how satisfying it can be in the short term. And the long term is just a linked chain of short term after short term. Then I’d die. A few years ago I found myself teaching, briefly, in St Louis. This was at Washington University. (It’s neither here nor there, but my mother had long thought that my life would have turned out better if only I’d been accepted to Wash U for college. She was quite proud that at last I’d made it as a visiting professor.) I thought about calling her or sending her a message. All I had to do was reach out to my friends, the ones whose wedding we met at and who were still together, and ask how to get ahold of her. But it felt more like an obligation to a defunct emotion than something I actually wanted to do. Still, maybe I’d run into her buying groceries at Schnucks or we’d both be pumping gas on the same island. I’d sit across from her at a cafe and listen to her talk. I’m always interested in the way people edit the details of their lives, the way they compress all the years into sentences.",The New York Times
2017,"WeWork Buys Meetup, the Service for Bringing Hobbyists Together","WeWork has made its name — and collected billions of dollars from investors — by providing places for people to work. Now, it is buying a social network meant to bring people together in their off time. WeWork announced on Tuesday that it had bought Meetup, whose 35 million members use the service to find fellow aficionados of some common interest: drone racing, say, or learning Dutch. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The transaction is the latest effort by WeWork to move beyond its origins as a provider of working spaces for freelancers and consultants to become a phenomenon that, its founders say, can reshape modern life. It is a vision that has attracted a slew of investors, most notably SoftBank, which led a $4.4 billion investment that valued the company at about $17 billion. And it is a pitch whose success has helped the company buy Lord & Taylor’s flagship building as its new global headquarters. Whether WeWork can fulfill its bold promises remains to be seen, and skeptics say that the company at its core is a richly valued real estate concern. But this month, WeWork has taken steps to move its focus beyond work. The company announced plans to start a private kindergarten focused on entrepreneurship. And now it has bought Meetup, a company dedicated to bringing together hobbyists and enthusiasts of all stripes. “It’s like a magical puzzle that fits together,” said Scott Heiferman, the chief executive and a co-founder of Meetup. Meetup members organize on average about 15,000 gatherings a day, according to the company. The event-organizing service has at least broken even over the last few years and has not taken in outside money in years, Mr. Heiferman said. But the company believed that to grow — and especially to do so abroad — it needed to bring in investors again. The process of raising money eventually led to conversations about selling Meetup altogether. The company’s general counsel, David Pashman, had a relationship with a senior WeWork executive and suggested the two businesses talk. In August, Mr. Heiferman met with WeWork’s chief executive, Adam Neumann, and the two quickly came to believe that uniting the two companies made sense. WeWork’s roughly 10 million square feet of leased office space, spread out over more than 170 locations in 16 countries, is used primarily during the day. By contrast, meetups happen primarily outside of working hours. WeWork could especially help in promoting Meetup abroad, given its growing overseas presence. Already, roughly 100,000 people have attended a Meetup gathering at a WeWork location, according to the companies. “You need a proper community space for that,” Mr. Heiferman said. “You can’t have a musty church basement or whatever space people used in the old days.” But Shiva Rajaraman, WeWork’s chief product officer, said that the deal had been done for a bigger reason: to help instill a sense of broader community in the company’s spaces. “It’s less about utilization and much more about that fundamental mission of connecting people to their purpose,” Mr. Rajaraman said. “This is a great tool to introduce people to their passions.” Meetup will continue to operate as it has, Mr. Heiferman said. He added that the ideal operating model would be something like how Instagram functions within Facebook, or Zappos within Amazon. (Zappos’s chief executive, Tony Hsieh, is on Meetup’s board.) “We’re going to be a core part of WeWork,” Mr. Heiferman said. “There’s a really great culture that we’re proud to be a part of.”",The New York Times
2017,Weinstein Documentarian Wants Another Shot at His Subject,"LOS ANGELES — A Canadian filmmaker, Barry Avrich, whose effort to make a documentary about Harvey Weinstein ended in 2011 with an online-only movie that he says was watered down, has decided to try again. Mr. Avrich said on Wednesday that he will rework his documentary, “Unauthorized: The Harvey Weinstein Project,” in the wake of sexual harassment and rape allegations against Mr. Weinstein. “I have a moral obligation to edit and expand my film, and not just by tacking on an 11-minute ending about him as a sexual predator,” Mr. Avrich said by phone from Ottawa. But Mr. Avrich must first contend with IFC Films, a division of the publicly traded AMC Networks. IFC bought distribution rights to “Unauthorized: The Harvey Weinstein Project” for an undisclosed amount in September 2010. Mr. Avrich has long asserted that IFC subsequently asked for sanitizing trims and decided against a theatrical release as a favor to Mr. Weinstein, who was then one of Hollywood’s most powerful men. IFC has repeatedly denied Mr. Avrich’s claims. In a statement on Wednesday, the company wrote: “The film was at various times on Netflix, iTunes and our own streaming service. We believe we provided appropriate distribution for it, as we do for the six to eight documentaries we distribute each year. We asked the filmmaker to eliminate 30 seconds of the film, which we did not believe was central to the story.” Mr. Avrich, 53, chronicled his quest to document Mr. Weinstein — and Mr. Weinstein’s aggressive attempts to thwart him — in a 2016 memoir, “Moguls, Monsters and Madmen: An Uncensored Life in Show Business.” It was in that book that Mr. Avrich also claimed that IFC had watered down the film and failed to give it a robust release. (Mr. Weinstein ended up hosting a release party for the book.) “There was nothing subtle about it,” Mr. Avrich reasserted on Wednesday. “IFC worked to soften content in the film that was negative to Harvey.” According to Mr. Avrich, IFC asked for trims to a section that described Mr. Weinstein as giving specific instructions for a sex scene in the film “Factory Girl.” Mr. Avrich said IFC had also wanted to cut discussion about attempts by Mr. Weinstein to help his wife’s fashion label by using his clout with celebrities. Even so, Mr. Avrich said he had contacted IFC in recent days to ask if it would collaborate with him on a new version of the film or at least let him buy back distribution rights. If IFC declines, Mr. Avrich said, he will go forward with a new film. IFC did not comment on that. The effort could lead to criticism that Mr. Avrich is trying to capitalize on Mr. Weinstein’s behavior. “Anybody who says that doesn’t know me or my work,” Mr. Avrich said. Mr. Weinstein was fired by the studio he co-founded in early October after The New York Times revealed decades of sexual harassment allegations against him. Since then, more than 50 women have come forward with claims against him, including rape, sexual assault and groping. The police in London, New York and Los Angeles have opened investigations. Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Weinstein has repeatedly denied “any allegations of nonconsensual sex.” Mr. Avrich, who is working on a film about the Nuremberg prosecutor Benjamin Ferencz, rights for which were previously controlled by the Weinstein Company, is best known in Hollywood as the writer and director of “The Last Mogul,” a 2005 documentary about the entertainment kingpin Lew R. Wasserman. Mr. Avrich intended to take a similar approach with Mr. Weinstein, tracing his rise from the concert promotion business in Buffalo to independent film chieftain. “I set out to make a film that looked at Harvey as a businessman and cultural force, someone who was a creative genius but also an incredible bully,” Mr. Avrich said on Wednesday. “I briefly looked into his reputation with women, but nobody would touch it.” He added: “I was never told about him as a sexual predator. Would I have gone there if I had known? Absolutely. I obviously wish I had pushed harder. It would have made for a far better film.” Mr. Avrich said he had tried to get Gwyneth Paltrow, Quentin Tarantino and others associated with Mr. Weinstein to participate in the film but had been rebuffed. Ms. Paltrow told The Times last month that Mr. Weinstein had sexually harassed her when she was in her 20s. Mr. Tarantino told The Times that he had known about sexual misconduct claims against Mr. Weinstein dating to the 1990s, and apologized for never speaking out. An earlier version of this article misstated the Weinstein Company’s connection to a film that Barry Avrich is making about the Nuremberg prosecutor Benjamin Ferencz. It previously controlled the rights to the film. It does not control them now.",The New York Times
2017,Weinstein Work Pulls Lawyer Back Into an Ethical Debate,"David Boies may be best known for taking on nationally prominent political cases before the Supreme Court, including Bush v. Gore and the fight to legalize gay marriage. But it’s his role as a hard-nosed litigator representing corporations and executives that has earned him lavish payouts but created potential ethical issues — so much so, it has forced his firm to step away from several cases. In 2006, the cable company Adelphia asked his firm to resign from a bankruptcy case after it was disclosed that the firm had advised Adelphia to hire a document-management company partly owned by his children. Last year, Mr. Boies’s firm parted ways with Theranos, the blood-testing company it represented in a series of government investigations, in part because of disagreements over legal strategy with the Theranos board, on which he served. Now Mr. Boies, 76, is again drawing fire for the perception of conflict of interest, after a report in The New Yorker on Monday outlined legal work he did for Harvey Weinstein, the movie mogul facing a wave of allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault. The article reported that Mr. Boies had helped execute a contract with a private investigation firm that Mr. Weinstein hired to help block a negative article about him in The New York Times. Mr. Boies’s firm, Boies Schiller Flexner, has provided outside legal counsel for The Times three times in the last 10 years, including one libel case. The article said the investigative firm had been instructed to dig up information on Rose McGowan, an actress who had accused Mr. Weinstein of rape, and to find out what various reporters knew about the allegations against Mr. Weinstein. On Tuesday, Mr. Boies issued a statement saying he believed the investigators had been hired solely to determine the facts related to the allegations against Mr. Weinstein, which he believed would be to The Times’s benefit. He denied there was any conflict of interest with his work for the paper. But late in the day, the paper said it was ending its relationship with his firm. “We never contemplated that the law firm would contract with an intelligence firm to conduct a secret spying operation aimed at our reporting and our reporters,” The Times said in a statement. “Such an operation is reprehensible.” Mr. Boies said neither he nor his firm had any role in initially hiring the private investigative firm, Black Cube. But he said he had made a mistake in helping out Mr. Weinstein, whom Mr. Boies described as a longtime client and who has denied any allegations of nonconsensual sex, in forging a new contract with the firm. “It was not thought through, and that was my mistake,” he said in the statement. He pointed out that he had never been disciplined for his work. In an interview, he sought to minimize his involvement with Mr. Weinstein, contending that he was brought in to deal with a “billing dispute” with Black Cube. But in effect, Mr. Boies helped draft a new contract to retain the services of Black Cube for Mr. Weinstein. The contract, a copy of which was posted on The New Yorker’s website, said one objective was to provide Mr. Weinstein with “intelligence” to “stop publication of a new negative article in a leading NY newspaper.” “In retrospect, we should not have gotten involved in the billing dispute,” Mr. Boies said. “In the case of Harvey Weinstein, there is a lot of information that I didn’t have.” The episode may deepen the perception that Mr. Boies pushes the boundaries on potential conflicts, while raising questions about why he didn’t seek to learn more about Mr. Weinstein’s team of hired-gun investigators. “From Boies’s perspective, this is no good deed goes unpunished,” said Laurie L. Levenson, the David W. Burcham chair in ethical advocacy at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. “From what I heard, he should have had more information as to what it was about. He is leaving a thumbprint on it, and whether he wants it or not, this now belongs to him.” The rules of professional conduct in New York, where Mr. Boies practices, prohibit lawyers who have not gotten consent to a conflict from representing clients “if a reasonable lawyer would conclude” that “the representation will involve the lawyer in representing differing interests.” Stephen Gillers, who teaches legal ethics at New York University School of Law, said there were several ways to view Mr. Boies’s decision to execute the contract. “If all he did, as he seems to claim, was help Weinstein unearth facts about his accusers that affected their credibility and might have persuaded the paper not to run the story, that would not be seen as adversely affecting his ‘loyalty’ to The Times,” Mr. Gillers said. “The paper has an interest in the credibility of its sources.” “On the other hand, if Boies assisted Weinstein in targeting the integrity of Times journalists as a way to prevent the story from running or, failing that, to discredit the reporting if it did run, that would certainly be disloyal to his client,” he said. Lawyers usually deal with potential conflicts by giving clients the option of switching to another law firm, legal experts said. In many instances, if the matters are not related, the clients will give the lawyer permission to keep representing them. Sometimes broad waivers are included in the initial retention agreement. The agreement between Mr. Boies’s firm and The Times acknowledged that the firm would from time to time do work for clients whose interest may be adverse to the newspaper’s — a fact that Mr. Boies cited Tuesday. But The Times’s statement on Tuesday made clear that it believed Mr. Boies’s firm had gone too far by handling a contract for a company that sought to undermine a major reporting effort. Actual conflict or not, legal experts said Mr. Boies would most likely pay little penalty for his dual work for Mr. Weinstein and The Times. They said disciplinary action was unlikely because it usually required a formal complaint. Moreover, they said, some clients may find Mr. Boies’s aggressiveness appealing. “I don’t think this will hurt from a business perspective,” said Rebecca Roiphe, a professor at New York Law School and a former prosecutor who specializes in legal ethics. “It is not going to harm his reputation with most clients. When you hire Boies, you are hiring an aggressive lawyer.” That assertive, sometimes belligerent, style has made Mr. Boies a favorite in the business world. Steven A. Cohen, the billionaire investor, hired him to do battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission when it was deciding how long to bar him from the securities industry for failing to adequately monitor employees charged with insider trading. Maurice R. Greenberg, the former head of American International Group, tapped Mr. Boies and his team to deal with a long-running civil fraud case filed against him. And Mr. Boies is no stranger to controversy. His decision in 1997 to leave Cravath, Swaine & Moore, a longtime legal powerhouse, came about because he wanted to represent George Steinbrenner, who owned the New York Yankees, in a suit against Major League Baseball. Lawyers at Cravath objected because the firm also represented Time Warner, which owned the Atlanta Braves. So Mr. Boies started his own firm, which grew quickly. Some critics said his affinity for high-profile cases led him to take on more work than he could handle. “My wife says I have a hard time saying no,” Mr. Boies said in a 2002 interview. Occasionally, he worked for little or no money. He charged a reduced fee, for instance, to represent the federal government in its failed attempt to break up Microsoft on antitrust grounds. His videotaped deposition of Bill Gates, one of the company’s founders, is remembered as a classic example of the art of cross-examination. And a casual follower of his career might take Mr. Boies for a champion of progressive causes. He represented Al Gore in the 2000 recount litigation that culminated in the Supreme Court decision that handed the presidency to George W. Bush. And he may be best known to the general public for joining with Theodore B. Olson, his adversary in Bush v. Gore, to challenge California’s ban on same-sex marriage. The Supreme Court heard the case in 2013 but ducked it. The court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage two years later. While all that was going on, Mr. Boies’s moneymaking side of the business was generating some unflattering headlines. In 2016, the law firm stopped representing Theranos after the disagreements over legal strategy with the board. There were also allegations that lawyers at Boies Schiller were trying to learn the identity of sources The Wall Street Journal used for a series of stories on the company. Mr. Boies said Tuesday that the incidents at Theranos and Adelphia had been misconstrued by his critics. He said that his firm had not been disciplined with regard to Theranos, and that there had been no attempt to impede the Wall Street Journal reporting. He conceded that aggressive litigation was going to leave some people unhappy.",The New York Times
2017,Welcome to the Campiest Place on Earth,"Scene Stealers GREAT FALLS, Mont. — When a study recently found Great Falls the least gay-friendly city in Montana, one man wrote on a local news website, “Let’s keep it that way.” Mermaids are totally tolerable, though. Great Falls, home to 59,000 mostly conservative citizens, can be a soul-deadening place. Big-box stores and chain restaurants line the weary main drag. The primary employer is Malmstrom Air Force Base, which services nuclear missile silos. The wind chill has been known to hit 40 below. But you can’t hold life back. It always breaks through — sometimes in unintentionally hilarious ways — even in the most unlikely places. I don’t know how else to account for the Sip ‘n Dip, a kitsch-tastic tiki bar hidden inside the O’Haire Motor Inn here. To find this treasure, you walk past the stack of Western Ag Reporter newspapers in the lobby and climb a narrow set of carpeted stairs. There, swimming behind glass six nights a week on a rotating schedule, you will find 12 women dressed very convincingly as mermaids. Truth be told, there are only nine at the moment. Three are out on maternity leave. “I’m hiring,” said Sandra Johnson-Thares, the Sip ‘n Dip’s mer-manager. “Do you know anybody? I’m desperate. But they’ve got to be comfortable in a bikini top and a tail.” The cavelike Sip ‘n Dip has two large windows that look directly into the O’Haire pool. In the daytime, you can spy on swimming motel guests. The pool closes around happy hour, and women in mermaid outfits, goggles and flowing wigs begin performing in pairs. They do flips, swivel their hips and blow bubbles, rising to the surface (which is out of view) every 20 seconds or so to take a breath. Claudia, one of the mermaids, said the hardest part of the job is staying in character. “Toward the end of a four-hour shift, your mind can start to wander,” she said. “Stuff like, ‘Did I remember to turn the coffeepot off when I left the house?’” (Claudia would not tell me her last name, explaining that she has a conservative day job. “I don’t know how corporate would react if they knew I was moonlighting as a mermaid,” she said.) Ms. Johnson-Thares, whose family owns the O’Haire, recently drew statewide media attention by pushing against the accepted view of masculinity in Montana: She advertised online for a merman — Tuesday night at the Sip ‘n Dip is ladies’ night — and the posting went viral, prompting responses from senior Montana politicians. “Dang, I’m overbooked,” Gov. Steve Bullock wrote on Twitter. Senator Jon Tester tweeted, “Shucks, I’m busy.” Tim Fox, the state’s attorney general, weighed in with, “Speedo is @ the dry cleaners.” Ryan Zinke, a former congressman who is now the interior secretary, replied, “I got you covered brother. You can borrow mine.” As it happens, the mermaids alone do not make the Sip ‘n Dip the campiest cocktail lounge in the history of campy cocktail lounges. (Honorable mentions to the Red Fox Room in San Diego and the velvet-wallpapered Bryant’s in Milwaukee.) Adding to the atmosphere is an 85-year-old singer: “Piano Pat.” Pat Spoonheim has been an institution at the Sip ‘n Dip since 1963. (The bar opened in 1962 and has the original Naugahyde to prove it.) She still arrives three nights a week with a towering hairdo. She applies a little lipstick, adjusts the Ace bandage on her wrist and sits down at an electric keyboard encircled by Christmas lights. Ms. Spoonheim can be a little cranky — she’s sick and tired of “Sweet Caroline,” she’ll have you know. But she will accommodate the occasional request. She describes her style as “jazzy.” “We’re rockin’ and rollin’,” she was shout-singing when I dropped in over the summer. “It’s Great Falls! On good-Ole Friday night!” Two macho-looking dudes in cowboy hats lifted their drinks (blue concoctions topped with umbrellas) and roared in unison: “We love you Piano Pat.” A guy wearing a T-shirt reading “Beer, Bacon, Guns & Freedom” turned away from the mermaids long enough to clap. A husky lady with the remnants of a home perm fervently tapped her fork on a platter of meatloaf. Oh, didn’t I mention the menu? Despite its landlocked location, the Sip ‘n Dip has tiki décor. Blowfish and glass buoys hang from a thatched ceiling. There are velvet paintings, fake ferns and seashell lights. Behind the Formica bar, pink light glows upward through stacks of cocktail glasses. But the food is pure home on the range. There is a full menu. For $15.95, you can enjoy the Hog Heaven (pulled pork, macaroni and cheese, bacon bits). That meatloaf will also set you back $15.95. It comes with potatoes and gravy. “You couldn’t make this place up if you tried,” said Gayle Nafziger, a teacher from Carlinville, Ill., whom I encountered during my visit. She was on a summer road trip with some friends and the Sip ‘n Dip was one of their planned stops. “It’s like a bucket-list place,” Ms. Nafziger said. She paused to fish an orange wedge out of her cocktail. Then Ms. Nafziger burst into wild applause as Piano Pat, having finished a rousing version of “Ring of Fire,” made a turn into “Piece of My Heart.” Ms. Spoonheim, who recently retired from playing the organ at her church, appeared to be having trouble seeing the sheet music through her bifocals. But the crowd sang along with relish anyway: “Take it!” For reasons that should by now be clear, the Sip ‘n Dip has become a must-visit for fans of Americana run amok — the wacky places where the human spirit gushes to the surface in an unexpected geyser. “These weird, little spots usually have a lot of heart, and I think that’s why people seek them out,” said Kenneth Smith, a founder of Roadside America, a state-by-state compilation of offbeat tourist attractions. Along with the Sip ‘n Dip, Roadside America lists Montana charms like the Testy Festy, where bikers annually gather to eat fried bull testicles and men participate in a drunken who-has-the-biggest-undercarriage contest. (But there is nothing at all gay about this state. Got it?) The mermaids were Ms. Johnson-Thares’s idea. By the mid-1990s, the Sip ‘n Dip was in steep decline. Locals still dropped in to hear Piano Pat. But newer motels had opened near the highway, and the O’Haire pool often sat empty, dispiritingly for Sip ‘n Dip patrons. One night in 1996, Ms. Johnson-Thares was sitting in one of the circular booths with her mother, and they started to brainstorm. “I joked that we should hire some mermaids,” Ms. Johnson-Thares said. “The more drinks we had, the funnier it got.” The first mermaids made their debut shortly afterward, with tails made from green tablecloths held in place by duct tape. The gimmick was an instant hit, prompting Ms. Johnson-Thares to start sewing more elaborate tails by hand, sometimes incorporating lace. “It makes them foofier,” she said. To make the pool look more like a lagoon, she added blue lights and faux seaweed, aquarium-style adornments inspired by a family vacation to Disneyland in California. (In fact, when she got home, Ms. Johnson-Thares wrote a letter to Disney asking for decorations from a submarine ride that had just been closed for refurbishment. “To my shock, the Disney people mailed me a box of their special seaweed,” she said.) Ms. Johnson-Thares had been telling me all of this as we sat at the bar. As she finished, Piano Pat, perhaps reacting to the light scent of country-fried steak in the air, started warbling her version of “I Love This Bar,” a country song by Toby Keith. “We got winners, and we got losers,” she sang. “Chain smokers and boozers. It ain’t too far. Come as you are. Mmm-hmm. I love this bar.” And how. An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the surname of a singer known as Piano Pat, who started playing and singing at the Sip ‘n Dip Tiki Lounge in 1978. She is Pat Spoonheim, not Sponheim.",The New York Times
2017,"Welcoming Worshipers With Open Arms and Concealed Ones, Too","Before the church massacre in Sutherland Springs, Tex., there was the church massacre in Charleston, S.C. It was enough to make the Rev. John Darsey think that his young Georgia church needed a security plan — one that involved defenders with firearms. So his church, Redeemer Church of Madison, hired three uniformed sheriff’s deputies for each Sunday service, one directing traffic, one in the parking lot, and one right by the door. This is the visible deterrent — the first line of defense. The second, more subtle layer is an in-house security team of church members with military or law enforcement backgrounds, all carrying concealed weapons. Inside the spare, spacious modern sanctuary — where some 500 people come every Sunday morning — the team members split the room into quadrants, with one always keeping a bird’s-eye view from the back of the room, on the riser with the sound and lighting equipment. The third layer of protection is one that Mr. Darsey knows is there, though he has trouble quantifying it. He estimated that about 20 to 25 of his flock were concealing a weapon on any given Sunday. “Now that’s just the ones I know about,” he said. And there were other weapons around. “Including here,” he said, opening a drawer of his big wooden desk. Around the country, a string of threats and attacks in recent years have led many houses of worship to take steps to secure their sanctuaries. And after 26 people were killed at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Tex., last Sunday, one of the worst mass shootings in American history and the deadliest ever at a church, many more have begun looking hard at whether God’s protection might need some armed backup. In Plano, Tex., the Prestonwood Baptist Church, a megachurch with more than 43,000 members and a model of modern-day vigilance — with off-duty police, private security, and cameras monitored 24 hours a day — offered to hold a seminar on church security after the shooting last Sunday. Within 48 hours, more than 250 ministers and lay leaders from more than 100 churches in four states had signed up. “This has caused every church in the country to think about the security of their people, and how that has to be of utmost importance,” said the Rev. Mike Buster, Prestonwood’s executive pastor. But securing a house of worship poses very different challenges from securing other public places like airports, schools or theaters. For one thing, most American congregations are relatively small, and lack the staff or the budget for extensive security. Two-thirds of the churches in the United States have fewer than 100 regular attendees, adults and children combined, according to data from the National Congregations Study, and in many cases, only part-time or volunteer ministers. Just as important, many clergy members say that the very mission of houses of worship leaves them conflicted over imposing security measures. A church, temple or mosque should be a welcoming place, they say, with doors kept wide open to strangers and those who are hurting. Many say they have ministered to people in all kinds of crises — homelessness, drug addiction, domestic abuse, or trouble with the law — without being sure whether they are intent on harm. “The safe thing to do is to isolate yourself from these people, but that’s the wrong thing to do for a church,” said the Rev. Bart Barber, pastor of the First Baptist Church of Farmersville, Tex., who wrote an essay for Christianity Today about the security dilemma for small rural churches. “We’re not going to cordon off the block, and make people show their I.D. and do a fingerprint background check to get into the worship service,” Mr. Barber said. “Because the very people we’re afraid of are also the people we are here to help.” But increasingly, clergy members have felt it necessary to have extra eyes, and sometimes weapons, watching their open doors. In the last five years alone, shootings have occurred at churches, mosques, a Sikh temple and a Jewish community center, forcing religious leaders nationwide to confront the issue of safety. Consultants have started businesses focused on church security, and the federal government has offered limited grants for houses of worship to install cameras and hire guards. It was a security camera image from Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston that helped the authorities quickly identify Dylann S. Roof as the gunman. Church Executive magazine recently suggested that church leaders invite local police officers to stop by and use the restrooms or meeting rooms, in order to acquaint them with the church’s layout and leadership before an emergency arises. In areas of the country where many people own and carry guns, church security is complicated by the question of whether to allow or even encourage guns in church. Texas law allows houses of worship to bar firearms, and many do, posting signs saying that carrying guns onto the property is prohibited. The United Methodist Church adopted a resolution suggesting that churches post such signs in 2016, part of a larger statement on ending gun violence. Mormon Church policy says that carrying firearms is “inappropriate except as required by officers of the law.” All week, since the massacre in the pews in Sutherland Springs, the Rev. Brady Martin said that members of his church, Temple Baptist Church, in Gainesville, Tex., have been coming to his office to discuss how to protect the church while still being welcoming. One asked whether the sign posted out front announcing that the church doesn’t allow the open carrying of firearms — showing a gun with a slash through it — could actually be sending the message that the church is vulnerable. “That was something I hadn’t actually thought through,” he said, though he added that the church was not reconsidering its open-carry policy. (It does allow concealed firearms.) “We are not thinking that everybody should open carry. That would be a security nightmare.” He said that his church would send 12 people to the security seminar at Prestonwood. In the meantime, his volunteer security team is considering stationing members in the parking lot before Sunday services, not just inside. The Rev. Robert Jeffress, pastor of a Dallas megachurch, First Baptist Dallas, said in an interview on Fox News this week that he felt safer knowing that one-quarter to half of his congregation carries concealed weapons to services on Sunday. “If somebody tries that in our church,” he said of the attack in Sutherland Springs, “they might get one shot off, or two shots off, and that’s the last thing they’ll ever do in this life.” Mr. Darsey, the pastor at Redeemer in Georgia, acknowledged that some might find it odd that so many deadly weapons were being brought into a building dedicated to worshiping the man the book of Isaiah calls the Prince of Peace. But he cited Romans 13, which allows earthly authorities to serve as “agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.” There was always a chance, he said, that someone who meant to fire a weapon to protect innocents could end up harming the innocents themselves, which would be a “nightmare scenario” for his church. “I’m not so Southern and fundamentalist in my thinking that I don’t see the other side of that issue,” he said. “But it is what it is.” Jason Singleton, 36, is among the members who brings a handgun to Redeemer, in his case, strapped to his torso with a belly band. He said he would never pull the gun if there was merely a fight. There had to be an armed attacker, shooting innocents. “It would be a last resort,” he said. “If I took someone’s life it would be because mine was about to be took or someone else’s, and I think I’d be O.K. with answering for that, in the by and by.”",The New York Times
2017,Were You a Victim of Russian Propaganda? Facebook Will Help You Find Out,"SAN FRANCISCO — Have you ever wondered whether you have fallen prey to a Russian misinformation campaign? Soon, you will be able to find out. Facebook said on Wednesday that it planned to roll out a new tool later this year to help figure out if that new page you followed on Facebook or account you added on Instagram was secretly being run by Russia’s troll army. The tool, which you will find through a newly created portal on your Facebook or Instagram page, is part of an effort to “protect our platforms and the people who use them from bad actors who try to undermine our democracy,” Facebook said in a blog post. The social network is trying to assuage critics who said Facebook did not do enough to stop Russian propaganda from spreading on its platform ahead of the 2016 presidential election. The social media giant, along with Twitter and Google, were grilled by lawmakers on Capitol Hill several weeks ago about their role in the election and the unintended consequences of their technology. Facebook has said that 29 million Americans saw content created by Russian agents directly in their news feed, while 126 million shared posts that were shared or linked to by their friends, with that number rising to roughly 150 million when including Instagram. On Election Day itself, about 10 million people saw ads purchased by the Kremlin on Facebook, the company has said. Andy Stone, a spokesman for Facebook, said the company hoped the tool would help Americans who liked a page or followed an account created by a Russian agent, though he acknowledged that it stopped short of being able to help the much wider circle of people who viewed Russian propaganda shared by their friends. Facebook executives previously said they doubted whether they had the ability to reach out to every single American who was exposed to Russian government-backed propaganda. “It’s a much more challenging issue to identify and notify reliably people who may have been exposed to this content on an individual basis,” Colin Stretch, the company’s general counsel, said during the appearance before Congress. For now, the tool may only be able to help you if you chose to follow one of the accounts or pages set up by Russian agents on Instagram or Facebook. According to experts who have studied disinformation campaigns, that accounts for only a tiny sliver of the people Facebook estimate were affected by content Russian posted online. “People are much more affected by content shared by their friends, they are more likely to click on it and spend time reading it and considering its merits when a trusted friend shares it on their Facebook page,” said Jonathon Morgan, chief executive of New Knowledge, which tracks the spread of misinformation online. “People don’t know the extent to which they are influenced by what their trusted social circles post online.” The lesson? Choose your friends carefully.",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | We’re All Part of Trump’s Show,"Bret Stephens If you want to understand the ways in which Donald Trump’s presidency is systematically corrupting the American mind, I have a book recommendation for you. It’s about Vladimir Putin’s Russia. The book is Peter Pomerantsev’s “Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible.” It was published in 2014, and it brilliantly tells the story of the (Soviet-born) British author’s sojourn as a producer for Russian TV. As the title suggests, at its heart it’s the tale of the substitution of reality with “reality,” of factual truth with interpretive possibility. That’s also the central task of Donald Trump’s presidency. We were reminded of this again this week, on news that Trump is backing away from his public admission last year that he said what he said on the infamous Access Hollywood tape. Then there was his appalling insinuation Wednesday that MSNBC host Joe Scarborough might have killed an office intern in 2001. And his hallucinatory tweet last week in which he claimed to turn down an approach from Time magazine to make him Person of the Year for the second time in a row. Before that it was his multiple attacks against his attorney general. Or his tweeting of a video pastiche in which he physically assaults CNN. Or his voter fraud claims. Or the ones about the size of his inaugural crowds. All this has given rise to the suggestion that Trump is mentally unwell. That’s the charitable interpretation. But the president also gives signs that he is perfectly well, can communicate relatively coherently when he wants to do so, and knows exactly what he is tweeting (and subtweeting), and to what effect. This is where Pomerantsev is so instructive. In one of his book’s early scenes, he relates a professional homily from a man he identifies as prominent Russian TV presenter. “We all know there will be no real politics” in Putin’s Russia, the man says at a staff conference. “But we still have to give our viewers the sense something is happening. They need to be kept entertained. So what should we play with? Shall we attack the oligarchs? Who’s the enemy this week? Politics has got to feel like … like a movie!” This is why there’s a Colosseum in Rome, and why public spectacle, theater, cinema, TV and now the internet have always been handmaids of dictators. In Russia, it’s all about casting the president as a bare-chested action hero, pumping out anti-Western conspiracy theories and serving up remakes of Western sitcoms and reality shows. “The new Kremlin,” Pomerantsev notes, “won’t make the same mistake the old Soviet Union did: It will never let TV become dull.” Authoritarian dominion requires effective methods of mass distraction. Trump isn’t a dictator, and his influence over media that isn’t Fox or Breitbart is negligible. But Trump does control his Twitter feed, with its 43.6 million followers. And he exerts a deeper level of control simply through his ability to bait hostile media at will with his every seemingly nutty utterance. The benefits, for Trump, are threefold: a political opposition that is exhausting itself — and much of the public — with its perpetual state of moral apoplexy; a political base that thrills to his readiness to scandalize the bien pensant; and an effective means of distraction from his electoral, legislative and foreign policy failures. In other words, the president is conducting a kind of meta-politics, the purpose of which is to erase ordinary standards of political judgment. The question is not “How am I doin’?” as the late New York City mayor Ed Koch used to ask. It is, gladiator-like, “Are you not entertained?” Even those of us most aghast at this administration must confess we are. The Trump news is scarier, funnier, more salacious and more relevant than anything else on TV. It’s why the apolitical Jimmy Fallon has floundered in the age of Trump while the hyperpolitical Stephen Colbert has thrived. For a president who cares more about ratings than he does about polls, this is the ultimate vindication. He minds less if you hate him so long as he knows that you’re thinking about him. The truth about Trump is not that he’s crazy. He’s a narcissist and a neurotic with a feral talent for attracting the attention he craves. In Russia, Putin can compel attention thanks to his complete control over most media and many other aspects of ordinary life. In the United States, citizens can deprive Trump of his political oxygen simply by turning off and tuning out. But that isn’t enough. “For if one part of the system is all about wild performance,” writes Pomerantsev of Putin’s media calculations, “another is about slow, patient co-optation.” Like it or not, we all inhabit the Trump-verse and we all are subject to its consequences. How do we pay attention without paying him a kind of homage? Can we respond to his outrages without drowning in our own?",The New York Times
2017,"We’re Not Done Yet, Hague Court Tells Burundi’s Leaders","When Burundi became the first country to withdraw from the International Criminal Court less than two weeks ago, its leaders thought they had successfully avoided an inquiry into egregious crimes including murder, torture and rape. They apparently miscalculated. The court announced Thursday that a pretrial panel of judges had authorized the prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, to open an investigation concerning crimes committed while Burundi was a member. The judges also said that Ms. Bensouda had the authority to investigate any related crimes committed since Burundi’s withdrawal, “if certain legal requirements are met.” Burundi’s legal obligation to cooperate, the judges said, “remains in effect for as long as the investigation lasts and encompasses any proceedings resulting from the investigation.” Their announcement said the judges had given approval for the inquiry on Oct. 25 — two days before Burundi’s withdrawal from the court took effect — but that the decision had remained under court seal until Thursday to protect victims and potential witnesses. The decision stunned and infuriated the government of Burundi, the tiny southern African nation that is the first — and so far, only — country to withdraw as a party to the Rome Statute, the treaty that created the court in 2002. Willy Nyamitwe, the senior adviser and spokesman for President Pierre Nkurunziza of Burundi, said in a Twitter posting that the court’s decision reflected what he called its “outrageous lies to implement Westerners’ hidden agenda to destabilize #Africa.” Burundi’s withdrawal has come to symbolize resentment by African leaders toward the Hague-based court, which has largely focused on crimes committed in Africa. Still, other African nations have not followed Burundi’s lead, despite initial predictions they might. The Burundi investigation is likely to focus on evidence of extrajudicial killings, disappearances, arbitrary arrests and detentions, torture and sexual violence in the two-and-a-half years since Mr. Nkurunziza forced and intimidated his way into a third term in office. In September, a United Nations human rights panel found that Burundi’s top leaders and security agencies were implicated in such crimes, and it urged the International Criminal Court to open an inquiry. Rights advocates welcomed the announcement by the court on Thursday. “The decision of the I.C.C. is a relief for the victims and a real beginning of the end of impunity in Burundi,” said Lambert Nigarura, president of the Burundi Coalition for the I.C.C. “From now on the authors, co-authors and accomplices of the crimes must understand that the games are over.” Param-Preet Singh, associate international justice director at Human Rights Watch, said Mr. Nkurunziza’s loyalists in the country’s security forces and the police had a “devastating track record of unchecked abuses” that had invited scrutiny by the court. “I.C.C. involvement means victims in Burundi and their families may one day see those responsible brought to justice,” she said. Some lawyers and human rights activists have said that the court’s prosecutors were obliged to make good on their planned investigation of Burundi, and needed to send a signal that leaving the court was not a guarantee of immunity. But court officials concede that experience has shown that leaders in power can effectively block investigations. Whether the investigators can do their work if the government thwarts them remains an open question. According to the Rome Statute, if a state withdraws from the court, it is still obliged to cooperate with a criminal investigation or proceeding if it was underway before the date of its withdrawal. In Kenya, where President Uhuru Kenyatta and Vice President William Ruto were elected despite facing charges before the court, proceedings against them collapsed because of what prosecutors and judges called witness interference, including bribes and threats. Court investigators also say they were blocked from talking to police and other government employees, and denied access to banking and telephone records. In Sudan, the prosecutions of President Omar al-Bashir and some of his close aides were suspended after investigators failed to gain access to witnesses and victims within the country, and after the court failed to secure the arrests of the accused even when they traveled. It was Mr. Bashir who began a campaign in the African Union to undermine the court, which was joined several years later by other presidents: Mr. Kenyatta of Kenya, Jacob Zuma of South Africa, Yahya Jammeh of Gambia. Their efforts to organize a mass walkout from the I.C.C. have so far failed. Kenya has so far not acted on its plans to leave. Gambia reversed course after Mr. Jammeh was voted out of office. South Africa remains a member because its high court ruled that the nation’s Parliament, not Mr. Zuma, had the last word. Human rights groups and lawyers have pushed back with their own campaigns to sway African opinion, arguing that those who oppose the court are only trying to protect themselves.",The New York Times
2017,"Opinion | We’re Sick of Racism, Literally","Opinion Estifanos Zerai-Misgun, a black Brookline, Mass., police officer, pulled up in an unmarked car and greeted his superior, a white lieutenant. He wasn’t prepared for the response by the lieutenant, who said, as he gestured at the vehicle, “Who would put a black man behind one of these?” “I was shocked,” the officer later told a Boston news station about the experience. It was one of several derogatory racial comments he would hear on the job. It got so bad that he and a black colleague walked away from the force in 2015. The statements they’d heard were offensive and at times threatening in the moment, but they also made the men fear for their safety at work in a broader sense: The black officers weren’t sure that the white colleagues who were so willing to antagonize them would back them up if they were attacked on patrol. Even if Mr. Zerai-Misgun and his colleague were never directly physically harmed, the experience probably took a toll on their bodies. Perceptions of discrimination like those the officers experienced, as well as those that are less direct, may make us sick. And in the current political environment, with its high-profile expressions of racism, sexism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, homophobia and xenophobia, along with widely covered acts of hate and bigotry, countless Americans are at risk of this type of harm. Take Mr. Zerai-Misgun as an example. Chances are, in reaction to each instance of perceived discrimination, he had a stress response. His blood pressure increased, his heart rate went up, and his brain sent a signal to release cortisol. We know this because in 2008, researchers studied the effects of discrimination on blood pressure. Black and Latino study participants recorded their interactions with perceived racism and were outfitted with blood pressure monitors. The results were striking. While blood pressure normally dips at night, those who said they’d experienced racism were more likely to have blood pressure that did not — and this has been strongly linked to increased mortality. Over time, this high blood pressure hardens our arteries, increasing the risk of a clot forming in our hearts or brains. In 2015, researchers examined the effect of discrimination on cortisol, a natural hormone that helps the body deal with stressful situations. They followed black and white children in Maryland, measuring their perceived racial discrimination starting in seventh grade and for 20 years thereafter. When study participants were in their early 30s, researchers calculated their cortisol levels. Perceptions of discrimination consistently predicted slower declines in cortisol level throughout the day, which is associated with obesity, depression, decreased immune function, cancer and death. More than 700 studies on the link between discrimination and health have been published since 2000. This body of work establishes a connection between discrimination and physical and mental well-being. With all of these effects, it is no wonder that more than 100,000 black people die prematurely each year. These days, it’s nearly impossible to avoid headlines about things like the white nationalists and neo-Nazis who marched in Charlottesville, Va., and the recent spike in expressions of identity-based hate and harassment. Our commander in chief has said he wants to ban transgender people from our military and Muslim people from our nation, and he pardoned the former sheriff Joe Arpaio, in a sign of approval of Mr. Arpaio’s notorious racial profiling of Latinos in Arizona. In this climate, it makes sense that so many people report having personally experienced discrimination. In recent polls, about half of black respondents and a third of Hispanic respondents reported that they’d experienced unfair treatment because of their race in the past month. About half of Muslims reported discrimination in the past year. Even if one denies that these self-reported instances constituted actual discrimination, it is this perception of discrimination, in and of itself, that is linked to poor health. Worse, we know that racism doesn’t have to be experienced in person to affect our health — taking it in the form of news coverage is likely to have similar effects. After all, studies have shown that when television viewers observe scenes depicting racism, their blood pressure remains elevated long after the scenes are over. That means it’s reasonable to believe that every time we see a TV news segment or even get a notification on our phones about an event, statement or policy that we believe represents discrimination, our bodies pay the price. We shouldn’t need the specter of disease to denounce hatred in all its forms. Racism, bigotry, sexism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, homophobia, xenophobia, should have no place in our society. But the illness associated with discrimination adds injury to insult and magnifies the suffering of these times.",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | We’re With Stupid,"Timothy Egan It would be much easier to sleep at night if you could believe that we’re in such a mess of misinformation simply because Russian agents disseminated inflammatory posts that reached 126 million people on Facebook. The Russians also uploaded a thousand videos to YouTube and published more than 130,000 messages on Twitter about last year’s election. As recent congressional hearings showed, the arteries of our democracy were clogged with toxins from a hostile foreign power. But the problem is not the Russians — it’s us. We’re getting played because too many Americans are ill equipped to perform the basic functions of citizenship. If the point of the Russian campaign, aided domestically by right-wing media, was to get people to think there is no such thing as knowable truth, the bad guys have won. As we crossed the 300-day mark of Donald Trump’s presidency on Thursday, fact-checkers noted that he has made more than 1,600 false or misleading claims. Good God. At least five times a day, on average, this president says something that isn’t true. We have a White House of lies because a huge percentage of the population can’t tell fact from fiction. But a huge percentage is also clueless about the basic laws of the land. In a democracy, we the people are supposed to understand our role in this power-sharing thing. Nearly one in three Americans cannot name a single branch of government. When NPR tweeted out sections of the Declaration of Independence last year, many people were outraged. They mistook Thomas Jefferson’s fighting words for anti-Trump propaganda. Fake news is a real thing produced by active disseminators of falsehoods. Trump uses the term to describe anything he doesn’t like, a habit now picked up by political liars everywhere. But Trump is a symptom; the breakdown in this democracy goes beyond the liar in chief. For that you have to blame all of us: we have allowed the educational system to become negligent in teaching the owner’s manual of citizenship. Lost in the news grind over Roy Moore, the lawbreaking Senate candidate from Alabama, is how often he has tried to violate the Constitution. As a judge, he was removed from the bench — twice — for lawless acts that follow his theocratic view of governance. Shariah law has been justifiably criticized as a dangerous injection of religion into the public space. Now imagine if a judge insisted on keeping a monument to the Quran in a state judicial building. Or that he said “homosexual conduct” should be illegal because his sacred book tells him so. That is exactly what Moore has done, though he substitutes the Bible for the Quran. I don’t blame Moore. I blame his followers, and the press, which doesn’t seem to know that the First Amendment specifically aims to keep government from siding with one religion — the so-called establishment clause. My colleagues at the opinion shop on Sunday used a full page to print the Bill of Rights, and urge President Trump to “Please Read the Constitution.” Yes, it’s come to this. On press freedom, due process, exercise of religion and other areas, Trump has repeatedly gone into Roy Moore territory — dismissing the principles he has sworn to uphold. Suppose we treated citizenship like getting a driver’s license. People would have to pass a simple test on American values, history and geography before they were allowed to have a say in the system. We do that for immigrants, and 97 percent of them pass, according to one study. Yet one in three Americans fail the immigrant citizenship test. This is not an elitist barrier. The test includes questions like, “What major event happened on 9/11?” and “What ocean is on the West Coast of the United States?” One reason that public schools were established across the land was to produce an informed citizenry. And up until the 1960s, it was common for students to take three separate courses in civics and government before they got out of high school. Now only a handful of states require proficiency in civics as a condition of high school graduation. Students are hungry, in this turbulent era, for discussion of politics and government. But the educators are failing them. Civics has fallen to the side, in part because of the standardized test mania. A related concern is historical ignorance. By a 48 percent to 38 percent margin Americans think states’ rights, rather than slavery, caused the Civil War. So Trump’s chief of staff, John F. Kelly, can say something demonstrably false about the war, because most people are just as clueless as he is. There’s hope — and there are many ways — to shed light on the cave of American democracy. More than a dozen states now require high school students to pass the immigrant citizenship test. We should also teach kids how to tell fake news from real, as some schools in Europe are doing. But those initiatives will mean little if people still insist on believing what they want to believe, living in digital safe spaces closed off from anything that intrudes on their worldview.",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | What America Celebrates on Thanksgiving,"Editorial In these days of anxiety and alienation, Thanksgiving offers the warm embrace of inclusiveness. Particularly for many people with families and faiths rooted in other lands, no other holiday, not even the Fourth of July, has so great a capacity to make them feel American. A child of Orthodox Jewish immigrants could feel his apartness on other festivals celebrated by the larger society. Christmas, Easter, Halloween — all are distinctly Christian observances, no matter how temporal and commercialized they have become. They are inevitable reminders for some Americans that they are different. Thanksgiving’s origins are also Christian. But it has evolved into something both secular and spiritual, a day devoted to family and amity. Perhaps that explains its unwavering appeal for believers and nonbelievers alike (even if many Native Americans understandably choose not to partake). Thanksgiving is at heart more than parades, or football or even country; there’s no flag-waving or chest-thumping. It is about shared bounty and shared humanity. That’s why the writer Saadia Faruqi, a Pakistan-born Muslim, welcomes the day. “For a Pakistani-American, Thanksgiving is as wholesome and normal a holiday as one can get,” she said in a 2015 essay. “It is a time to be grateful, to spend time with family, and to have a little bit of fun.” Though she never developed a taste for turkey, Ms. Faruqi wrote, the Thanksgiving table would most definitely be set — with tandoori chicken, daal and naan. No turkey, either, for Saumya Arya Haas, a writer who is Hindu. But there would be the familiar trimmings, she wrote a few years ago for Huffington Post. And, for sure, chai. “My family experience of being Hindu is deeply rooted in inclusiveness, social equity and community service. Chai-party values, if you like,” Ms. Haas said. She continued: “There’s pumpkin pie on the table and chai on the stove. This is America, after all. We create our own truth, if there even is a truth at all. We are all poor in something. We share with those who have less. Everyone brings something. We are imperfect, real, enriched.” Writing last month on the website of the International Buddhist Society, David Westdorp said he had adopted Buddhist ways of living in recent years. And so, appropriately, he offered suggestions for a meatless Thanksgiving meal. Mr. Westdorp noted correctly that it is not a day traditionally known for exchanging gifts. “The ‘presents/presence’ you can give to people,” he said, “is extending loving kindness” — preferably, he added, “in the Buddhist Metta tradition without any clinging or expectation of reciprocation.” Lincoln may well have anticipated all those convictions — Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim, Jewish and Christian — when in 1863 he proclaimed the last Thursday in November to be “a day of Thanksgiving and praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens.” It was formally changed in 1941 to the fourth Thursday in November. Lincoln knew his Bible, and was surely familiar with a passage from Exodus all too often ignored in our present era of hard feelings: “Do not mistreat or oppress a foreigner, for you were foreigners in Egypt.” Lincoln mentioned God but no particular faith in his proclamation. We may presume that all were thus declared welcome to sit at the American table.",The New York Times
2017,What Became of the Manson Family?,"Over two nights in August 1969, Charles Manson’s followers savagely murdered seven people through a frenzied combination of shooting, stabbing, beating and hanging. Their most famous victim was the actress Sharon Tate, the wife of the film director Roman Polanski. She was killed at her house along with four guests. The following night, the gang murdered a wealthy grocer named Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary. At their trial, members of the so-called Manson family shamelessly admitted their crimes and flaunted their allegiance to a leader whom they said they loved and who was portrayed as controlling their minds. Most of his followers were young women who had fled middle-class and upper-class homes to live with Mr. Manson at the Spahn Movie Ranch, a mock Old West town near Los Angeles that was once a film set but had fallen into ruin. One sang in her church choir. Another recalled being enchanted by Mr. Manson through what she hoped was a budding romance. Mr. Manson, who died on Sunday, and four members of his gang were sentenced to death. In 1972, their sentences were reduced to life in prison when capital punishment was outlawed in California. (It was reinstated in 1978.) Here is a look at what happened to some of his most ardent followers. Ms. Atkins was a quiet middle-class girl who was born in San Gabriel, Calif. She has said that her parents were alcoholics and that she was sexually abused by a male relative. She sang in her school’s glee club and her church choir, but she quit high school and left home when she was 18. She met Mr. Manson soon after, and he gave her a new name, Sadie Mae Glutz. In 1968, she gave birth to a son. Mr. Manson — who by all accounts was not the father — had her name the child Zezozose Zadfrack Glutz. The child was eventually removed from Ms. Atkins’s care and later adopted. Ms. Atkins was arrested in October 1969 in the murder of Gary Hinman, a friend of Mr. Manson’s, and convicted. At that point, the police did not know who was responsible for the Tate-LaBianca murders. But Ms. Atkins implicated herself in jail, when she is said to have admitted to cellmates that she stabbed Ms. Tate, tasted her blood and used it to write “Pig” on the front door of the house. Ms. Atkins became a born-again Christian in 1974 while in prison, she wrote in her memoir, “Child of Satan, Child of God” (with Bob Slosser). She denounced Mr. Manson, formed a prison ministry and did charitable work of all kinds. She was routinely denied parole and died at a women’s prison in Chowchilla, Calif., in 2009, at 61, a year after she was found to have brain cancer. Ms. Krenwinkel was a 19-year-old secretary from Los Angeles when she met Mr. Manson at a party. Three days later, she said, she left everything behind to pursue a romantic relationship with him. She said during her trial that at Ms. Tate’s home, she chased down Abigail Anne Folger, the heiress of the coffee fortune. “We fought on the grass,” she testified. “I remember stabbing her, stabbing and stabbing.” She said she also assisted in the killings of the LaBiancas the following night. Ms. Krenwinkel, now 69, has been in a women’s prison in Corona, Calif., for about 47 years, longer than any other woman in the state. She has been denied parole at least 13 times. “The saddest part is my definition of love was totally skewed,” she said in a 2014 documentary, “Life After Manson.” Ms. Van Houten said she recalled stabbing Mrs. LaBianca in the abdomen 14 to 16 times. She showed little remorse in court as she described wiping away fingerprints and burning her clothing. She said she remembered taking chocolate milk and cheese from the refrigerator before leaving. Many years later, Ms. Van Houten, calm and articulate, was regarded as a model prisoner at a women’s prison in Corona, Calif. She said that she regretted taking part in the murders and that at the time she had been mentally ill, a condition aggravated by LSD use. “I believed that he was Jesus Christ,” Ms. Van Houten said of Mr. Manson. “I bought into it lock, stock and barrel.” Ms. Van Houten, 68, was granted parole in September after she was denied at least 20 times. Ms. Kasabian, who was 20 at the time of the murders, became the prosecution’s star witness and was given immunity. She said that she kept watch on both nights and that she had not participated in the killings. She was raised in New Hampshire and moved to Los Angeles to live with the man she married. She said she joined Mr. Manson’s family in July 1969 after feeling rejected by her husband. In her testimony, she said Mr. Manson was the Devil and that she did not report him to the police because she feared for the safety of her daughter. After the trial, she returned to New Hampshire. She is 68. Known as Tex, Mr. Watson, a lanky former honor student and high school athlete from Dallas, was said to have led the killing spree as Mr. Manson’s assistant after living at the Spahn Ranch for parts of 1968 and 1969. After the murders, he fled to his native Texas, where he was arrested, and fought extradition for so long that the other members of Mr. Manson’s family were tried without him. When he was finally extradited, he pleaded guilty by reason of insanity from overuse of hallucinogenic drugs, but was deemed fit for trial and convicted of murder. In recent decades, Mr. Watson, now 71, is said to have fathered four children from conjugal visits in prison, and he has founded a prison-cell ministry. He was denied parole for the 17th time in 2016 and remains at Mule Creek State Prison in Ione, Calif. An earlier version of this article misidentified the state where Susan Atkins, a member of the Manson family, spent most of her childhood. It was California, not North Carolina. An earlier version of this article misspelled the middle name of one of the Manson family’s victims. She was Abigail Anne Folger, not Ann. video",The New York Times
2017,What Can Fashion Tell Us About Art?,"Nonfiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. CLOTHING ART The Visual Culture of Fashion, 1600-1914 By Aileen Ribeiro Illustrated. 572 pp. Yale University Press. $60. One of the perennial yet unresolved debates in fashion concerns the question of whether fashion is art — or, to be fair, whether some fashion can be described as art. Does its ephemeral nature, its roots in consumerism, frivolity and (sometimes) vulgarity, preclude it from achieving such transcendence? Or are the most conceptual, time-intensive, elaborate, original and expensive garments deserving of that designation? Since I’m a critic, people generally assume that I come down on the “art” side, though I’ve always hewed more to the museum interpretation of the issue, which tends to view fashion as a decorative art rather than a fine art. It turns out, however, that we may have been framing (pun intended) this question improperly from the get-go. We shouldn’t be asking whether fashion is art, but how fashion relates to art, and vice versa — or so Aileen Ribeiro, a professor emeritus at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London, suggests. And she’s not talking about the relatively superficial approach of designers who pay “homage” to paintings by literally putting them on their clothes (see Saint Laurent’s Mondrian dress and Jeff Koons’s Masters Collection bags for Louis Vuitton). Instead, she’s suggesting a deeper, more synergistic connection between the way artists use clothes for their own painterly purposes, and what such use can tell us about the role of clothes in a particular society. To that end, her book is divided into five sections, covering everything from the use of clothes in portraiture, including artists’ self-portraiture, to depictions of national identity and the drives for modernization and liberalization. Effectively an academic treatise masquerading as a coffee-table tome, “Clothing Art” is an exhaustive, sometimes exhausting, tour through just over three centuries of masterworks and the looks within them, for both men and women. Though Ribeiro is the author of numerous other books, including “Dress and Morality” and “Fashion in the French Revolution,” this is one of her broadest and most ambitious works, filled with sumptuous reproductions and lots of small type. Populist, however, it is not. Ribeiro isn’t using fashion to make Rembrandt, Hogarth and Delacroix accessible; she’s trying to get you to think about how artists use fashion. How, for example, van Dyck “conjured up clothing that was firmly based on the fashions” of his day “but that was also, so to speak, smoothed out,” and how Klimt “reinvents” fashion and “dramatizes it on the canvas.” Ribeiro may be a historian of dress, but she’s also a cultural omnivore, and she pulls from the letters of figures like Dante Gabriel Rossetti to support her points, as well as from the writings of Roland Barthes, John Berger, D. H. Lawrence, Le Corbusier, Marcel Proust and Thorstein Veblen (among many others). Reading her book start to finish can be a little overwhelming, not to mention hard on the arms; it’s heavy, in every sense of the word. Those who are fooled by the glossy presentation into thinking they’re getting a picture book are in for a surprise. It’s easy to get lost among the references, not to mention the gorgeous imagery, and it’s possible — and tempting — to dip in and out. That’s O.K. But Ribeiro’s argument, sustained over many pages and built on an accumulation of detail and evidence, is worth taking the time to consider. After all, it engages not just the eye and the mind, but the closet.",The New York Times
2017,What Can Republicans Do About Roy Moore? Here Are Their Options.,"A growing number of Republican senators have called on Roy Moore to withdraw from the Alabama Senate race after accusations of sexual misconduct from multiple women, several of whom said he harassed or assaulted them when they were under the age of consent. But with the Dec. 12 special election less than a month away, there may not be much the Republican Party can do. Here are the options. No. Whatever happens, Mr. Moore’s name will be on the ballot. Names cannot be added to or removed from a ballot for any reason within 76 days of the election, said John Merrill, the Alabama secretary of state. “Even if he withdrew formally or if the state party formally withdrew their support for him or if he passed away, he would still be on the ballot,” said Mr. Merrill, a Republican who has endorsed no one in the race. “If that happened today or if it happened the day before the election, he will still be on the ballot.” The ballots have been printed and were distributed on Oct. 18, when absentee voting began in Alabama, Mr. Merrill said. That means it is likely that some votes for Mr. Moore have already been cast. “The election has long since started,” he said. In short, yes. Lisa Murkowski, the Republican senator from Alaska, was re-elected in 2010 after a write-in campaign, and met recently to discuss strategy with Luther Strange, the Republican who currently holds the Senate seat but lost a primary election to Mr. Moore. Mr. Merrill said he believed no one had ever won a statewide write-in campaign in Alabama. A write-in candidate has the built-in disadvantage of not being listed on the ballot. And there are prosaic concerns, as well, like spelling and penmanship. Voters would have to legibly write and correctly spell the candidate’s name in the appropriate blank space on a ballot. “If somebody was trying to write in Joe Brown and they wrote in Joe Brownlee, that’s not ‘Joe Brown,’” Mr. Merrill said. “If they wrote in ‘Joe Browne’ and it was ‘Joe brown,’ I don’t know how the law would be interpreted in that case.” Poll workers at the local level, where votes are counted, would have to know ahead of time which potential spellings of a candidate’s name were permissible. A lack of clarity could invite problems, Mr. Merrill said, drawing a comparison to the disputed 2000 presidential election in Florida. “As long as you can tell what they’re trying to spell, phonetically, it should be counted,” he said. “You’re almost on the edge of getting in a hanging-chad situation.” The bylaws of the Alabama Republican Party do appear to be clear on one thing, though: If Mr. Strange were to run as a write-in candidate and lose, he would then be barred from seeking office as a Republican for six years. This “sore loser” rule was adopted by the party in 1994. Gov. Kay Ivey has the power to set and change special election dates, but it would be extraordinary for her to take such a step so close to the date, especially after absentee voting has begun. “I’m not aware of any time in the history of the state when the governor changed the date of an election when the election was already in mid-stride,” Mr. Merrill said. “We had a primary and a runoff, and now we have a general election in 29 days."" Governor Ivey has already rescheduled the Senate election once after she became governor following the resignation of her predecessor, Robert Bentley, amid a sex and corruption scandal. Before she would do so again, she wants support from President Trump, according to Republicans in touch with her camp. If Mr. Moore is elected, Senate Republicans could express their unhappiness by moving to expel him from the chamber. That process requires a two-thirds majority vote, or 66 votes, said Josh Chafetz, a professor of law at Cornell Law School. “The slight wrinkle with that is there is a longstanding norm with regards to conduct that was known to someone’s constituents prior to an election,” Mr. Chafetz said. “The idea is if your constituents knew about it and approved of it, then who is the chamber to expel you for it?” The Constitution gives senators the power to refuse to seat someone only if they deem the election results invalid or the candidate to be unqualified under the terms of the Constitution, Mr. Chafetz said. The last time a senator was expelled was in 1862 when several of them pledged allegiance to the Confederacy. The last time a member of the House was expelled was 2002, when James A. Traficant Jr. was convicted of bribery. If Mr. Moore does win and the Senate expels him, Mr. Chafetz said, Governor Ivey could then appoint a temporary replacement. “In some ways it gives the Republicans a way to look pretty good,” he said. “They can get rid of someone they didn’t like anyway, they get to look like they’re doing nonpartisan ethics enforcement, and Ivey could replace him with an establishment Republican.”",The New York Times
2017,What Children — and Parents — Can Learn From Baking Together,"On Dessert There’s a picture that I keep in the left-hand corner of my computer screen, of me and my son, Joshua, who is now grown, baking together years ago. It shows me bent over the kitchen counter gingerly disengaging a bell-shaped cookie from a large piece of dough. It looks as if it might have been gingerbread. Joshua — age uncertain, less than 3, I’d say — is standing on the stool we bought for just this job. He’s holding a cookie cutter, and there are more scattered about. We both have flour on our fingers; Joshua has some in his hair and on his sleeve, too. We’re both concentrating intently. We baked together regularly but rarely took pictures. I wish we’d taken more. If we had, I think I would have seen us growing older, but not different. In the gingerbread picture, I recognize the curve I still make over the counter and the way Joshua holds his head when he’s focused, the way he keeps his arms close to his body when the task is intricate. Our silhouettes would be the same today, and we would probably be doing the same things. Playing with the dough a little longer than any recipe would recommend. Molding miniature figures from the scraps. Licking bowls, spoons and fingers. Piling dishes in the sink and leaving them for later. Sitting on the floor in front of the oven window, watching our work rise, turn golden and set. Snatching hot cookies from the rack. Smiling, happy to be together in the warm room with the fragrance of butter and sugar and spice around us. As Joshua grew older, what we baked didn’t change much. We made the cookies and plain cakes we had always loved and the ones we probably could have made without reading the recipes. What changed was how we worked together. I no longer needed to teach Joshua about baking. He no longer felt he had to show me what he could do. Our time in the kitchen was simply time to be together doing something we liked. Sometimes we would work silently, and sometimes the work became the backdrop for conversations on subjects we might never have broached outside the kitchen, without the comfort of dough in our hands and a familiar job ahead of us. These moments are written indelibly into our shared memory. Something else was being written as we worked, too, something I didn’t really think about until last year. I had just finished a talk at a bookstore outside Los Angeles when a boy named Austin, age 2 1/2, walked over to have his copy of my cookbook “Baking From My Home to Yours” signed. The book weighed five pounds, and his mother helped him heft it onto the desk. It was smudged and dog-eared and lumpy in odd places. Austin started leafing through the book, and I saw why it was so misshapen: Every few pages there was a photograph of him with his mother and what they had baked. Under the image was the date. “‘I think of this book as his baby journal,” his mother told me. When Austin would come to a photo, he would point to it and say, “I made this!” Each time he said it, he lifted his head from the book, looked directly at me and smiled. When I was pregnant, I dreamed of having a child with an eclectic appetite and a proclivity toward all things French. Michael, my husband, a skilled woodworker, imagined a child who could make things with his hands. Michael believed that when you craft something, you know when it’s right. You can measure its good qualities on your own — you don’t need someone else’s praise or approval to understand that you’ve done a job well. Our time in the kitchen — all those cookies and cakes and brownies and cupcakes — gave Joshua that quiet sense of competence. Maybe especially the cupcakes. I remember one afternoon when Joshua must have been in middle school. Until that day, every baking project was a work for 20 fingers; that day, he told me that I could sit on the windowsill, that he would make the cupcakes himself. I watched him line the muffin tins with pleated papers and mix the batter. We chatted, and he worked, checking that there was the same amount of batter in each cup, poking the tops of the cakes to see if they were baked through and finally frosting them. When the cupcakes were ready, he admired his work. I did, too. Recipe: Black-and-White Cupcakes cooking",The New York Times
2017,What Christian Artifacts of the Middle East Can Show Us About Tolerance,"Critic’s Notebook PARIS — Behind the famous dilating windows Jean Nouvel designed for its Seine-side home, the Institut du Monde Arabe has presented a string of recent shows that have deepened and diversified France’s understanding of Islam. From “The Thousand and One Nights” (2012) to “Hajj: The Pilgrimage to Mecca” (2014) and the epic “Ocean Explorers” (2016), exhibitions here have disclosed the breadth of Islamic culture and history, and their intimate, centuries-long links with the West. But Islam is not the only religion in the Arab world, and this autumn the institute, which celebrates its 30th birthday this month, has turned its attention to another faith. “Eastern Christians: 2,000 Years of History,” a vital, thorough, and sometimes astonishingly gorgeous exhibition, explores the birth and transmission of Christianity from Jesus’ death to the present day. “Eastern Christians” has been billed as the largest exhibition anywhere devoted to the religion in the Middle East, and among its paintings, manuscripts, tapestries, mosaics, ivories and liturgical vestments are several critical loans from Lebanon, Jordan, Israel and Iraqi Kurdistan. It has opened at a grave time for Christians in the Middle East, who have faced appalling violence and even enslavement at the hands of the Islamic State. And it steps into a roiling debate in France, where right-wing politicians, especially, have deplored the plight of Christians in the Middle East — though not always with humanitarian motives. “Eastern Christians” was inaugurated by President Emmanuel Macron, who attended the show alongside his Lebanese counterpart, Michel Aoun, who is a Maronite Christian. It’s received acres of media coverage, not just from Christian publications like the newspaper La Croix, but on numerous mainstream radio and television programs. On one news channel Jack Lang, the former culture minister who is the director-general of the Institut du Monde Arabe, called Christianity an “essential component of the Arab world,” and warned of an “emergency” for eastern Christians, who constituted 20 percent of the region a century ago, but make up no more than 4 percent now, according to the Pew Research Center. Their continuing migration, and persecution, threatens the diversity and the vibrancy of the Arab world itself. The exhibition opens with a fragment of red silk, dating to around A.D. 800 and lent from the Vatican, whose floral rosettes enclose the enthroned Mary, sitting stiffly as the archangel Gabriel delivers some big news. The weaving comes from Syria, and, like the Jordanian mosaic and Lebanese bas-relief it hangs alongside, it deploys Hellenistic motifs in the service of a new religion, born in Jerusalem and quickly evangelized. Faded frescoes and fragile handwritten Bibles evoke the lives of early Christians, who faced consistent oppression and prayed largely in private. But in the early fourth century the Roman emperor Constantine converted to Christianity, and his Edict of Milan established freedom of religion across the realm. Under his imperium, churches sprouted across the Middle East, and ornate censers, candelabras, mosaics and goblets with gold crosses testify to the new prestige and security Christians enjoyed. The fourth and fifth centuries saw Christians quarrel over theological matters and divide into numerous sects. And as its title implies (“Eastern Christians,” not “Eastern Christianity”), this is an exhibition about multiple cultures, speaking numerous languages, practicing a variety of faiths sometimes at odds with one another. Manuscripts in Greek, Arabic, Coptic or Syriac are presented in a magnificent circular gallery equipped with speakers that play hymns from across the region. An Arabic canticle to the Virgin Mary gives way to a woman singing a plangent hymn in Armenian; an ululating chant of repentance comes from the Syriac Orthodox Church. In the seventh century, the banner of Islam charged across the east of the former Roman Empire, and a religion of images gave way to a religion averse to icons. The show treats the Crusades rather briefly, and principally through its cultural aftereffects; we see an Old Testament in Arabic as intricate as the finest Qurans, and a 13th-century Syrian vase whose scenes of Christian monks nestle inside Islamic decoration. More attention is paid to the early modern era, which saw a Christian bourgeoisie arise in Baghdad, Damascus and other Arab metropolises between the 16th and 18th centuries. “Eastern Christians” thus confirms that, contrary to the clash-of-civilization palaver spouted by both the Islamic State and the European far right, Christians lived peacefully as a minority in the Middle East for nearly 1,000 years. The accelerated violence of the 20th century has political roots, above all in the collapse of the Ottoman Empire after World War I and the nationalist movements that arose in its wake. This exhibition relies on contemporary artists to illustrate these modern problems. Dor Guez, an Israeli artist of Jewish and Christian heritage, presents an archive of images of his grandmother’s expulsion from Jaffa in 1948. The photographer Katharine Cooper depicts the ruined churches of Aleppo, Syria, in stark black-and-white prints, sapped of hope. The fate of Christians in the Middle East has become a heated political topic in France — which, despite the country’s official secularism, has lately wrestled with the place of both Christianity and Islam in public life. In 2014, amid horrible violence in Syria and Iraq, a number of right-wing politicians began adding the Arabic letter “nun” to their Twitter account handles, in solidarity with Christians under threat from the Islamic State. They were not the only ones; the symbol appeared on the accounts of hard-right activists, like the leader of Génération Identitaire, an extremist movement calling for a “reconquest” of Europe from a supposed Muslim takeover. This year’s presidential election also saw the defeated candidates of the French right and far right invoke eastern Christians, often in the same breath as they disparaged Muslims at home. François Fillon, the former prime minister and Republican candidate, attended a Coptic Easter service and expressed his “affection” for eastern Christians — just hours after deploring that in a secular country “we no longer say the words identity, France, nation, homeland, roots, culture.” The far-right leader Marine Le Pen, during last year’s election, went further, raising the prospect of French intervention. She insisted on “France’s absolutely essential role in protecting eastern Christians,” which she went on to call a “historic role.” Mr. Macron’s address at the Institut du Monde Arabe implicitly rebuked the political use Ms. Le Pen has made of the plight of Christians in the Middle East. “Anywhere where minorities are defending their faith, the French stand by their side,” the president said, “because we believe in pluralism.” That pluralism has marked the Arab world since before the birth of Islam, as this essential exhibition reaffirms. Taking that pluralism seriously means contesting the new crusades of these eastern Christians’ false friends in the West — and rejecting sectarian caricatures in favor of universal equality and human freedom. I don’t believe “Eastern Christians” can impart much to the Le Pens of the world, who are as dishonest and as deaf to reason as the jihadists they claim to oppose. It does, though, have a message for the rest of us: Take the past as seriously as the present, and never let extremists set the terms of debate.

2017,What Colleges Want in an Applicant (Everything),"The admissions process is out of whack. Just ask the heartbroken applicant, rejected by her dream school. Ask high school counselors, who complain that colleges don’t reward promising students for their creativity, determination or service to others. Even the gatekeepers at some famous institutions acknowledge, quietly, that the selection system is broken. Ask five people how to fix it, though, and they’ll give five different answers. Sure, you might think colleges put too much stock in the SAT, but your neighbor’s kid with the near-perfect score thinks it should matter a lot. More than half of Americans say colleges shouldn’t give children of alumni a leg up, according to a recent Gallup poll; yet nearly half say parental connections should be at least a “minor factor.” The debate about who gets into the nation’s competitive colleges, and why, keeps boiling over. The Justice Department has confirmed that it’s looking into a complaint, filed in 2015 by a coalition of 64 Asian-American associations, charging discrimination against high-achieving Asian-American college applicants. Also, students for Fair Admissions, which opposes affirmative action policies, has filed discrimination lawsuits against Harvard, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Texas at Austin. Although the Supreme Court affirmed last year that admissions officers may consider an applicant’s race among other factors, polls show that a majority of Americans disagree with that decision. Critics of affirmative action see plenty of room for future legal challenges. Whatever happens, age-old questions about fairness in admissions will surely endure. For one thing, the nation can’t come to terms with a tricky five-letter word: merit. Michael Young, a British sociologist, coined the pejorative term “meritocracy” over a half-century ago to describe a future in which standardized intelligence tests would crown a new elite. Yet as Rebecca Zwick explains in her new book “Who Gets In?” the meaning has shifted. The word “merit,” she writes, has come to mean “academic excellence, narrowly defined” as grades and test scores. But that’s just one way to think of an applicant’s worthiness. Dr. Zwick, professor emeritus at the University of California at Santa Barbara, has long been a researcher at the Educational Testing Service, which develops and administers the SAT. She disputes the notion that testing prowess — or any other attribute, for that matter — entitles a student to a spot at his chosen college. “There is, in fact, no absolute definition of merit,” she writes. That brings us to you, the anxious applicant, the frazzled parent, the confused citizen, all wondering what colleges want. It’s worth taking a deep breath and noting that only 13 percent of four-year colleges accept fewer than half of their applicants. That said, colleges where seats are scarce stir up the nation’s emotions. Each year, the world-famous institutions reject thousands and thousands of students who could thrive there. Yes, rejection stings. But say these words aloud: The admissions process isn’t fair. Like it or not, colleges aren’t looking to reel in the greatest number of straight-A students who’ve taken seven or more Advanced Placement courses. A rejection isn’t really about you; it’s about a maddening mishmash of competing objectives. Just as parents give teenagers a set of chores, colleges hand their admissions leaders a list of things to accomplish. When they fail, they often get fired. “We don’t live in a cloud — the reality is, there’s a bottom line,” said Angel B. Pérez, vice president for enrollment and student success at Trinity College, in Hartford. “We’re an institution, but we’re also a business.” On many campuses, financial concerns affect decisions about whom to admit. A recent report by the National Association for College Admission Counseling found that about half of institutions said an applicant’s “ability to pay” was of at least “some importance” in admissions decisions. Among other targets is geographic diversity, which is now seen as an indicator of institutional strength and popularity. (Some presidents have been known to gripe if the freshman class doesn’t represent all 50 states.) A campus might also need a particular number of engineering majors or goalies. Indeed, a college could accept 33 percent of all applicants, but that doesn’t mean each applicant has a one-in-three chance. Success depends on what a student brings to the table. Generally, nothing carries more weight in admissions than grades (plus strength of the high school curriculum) and ACT/SAT scores. With limited time and resources, those metrics offer a relatively quick way to predict who will succeed. But the measures have drawbacks. Grade inflation has complicated the task of evaluating achievements, and so has the variance in high school grading policies. Standardized test scores correlate with family income; white and Asian-American students fare better than black and Hispanic students do. Also, when colleges talk about predicting “success,” they usually mean first-year grades — a limited definition. And so, many colleges rely on “holistic” evaluations, allowing colleges to contextualize applicants’ academic records and to identify disadvantaged students who might lack the sparkling credentials of their affluent peers. Did they attend low-performing high schools or well-resourced ones? Did they participate in extracurricular activities? Do they have leadership experience? What colleges look for sends a powerful message about what matters, not just to admissions officers but in life, and students often respond accordingly. Dr. Pérez, a first-generation college student who grew up in a low-income family, recently revamped Trinity’s process to better identify promising students, particularly the disadvantaged. While reading applications, its admissions officers now look for evidence of 13 characteristics — including curiosity, empathy, openness to change and ability to overcome adversity — that researchers associate with successful students. These are also qualities that the liberal-arts college values, inside and outside the classroom. Trinity’s officers can check as many qualities as apply using a drop-down box labeled “Predictors of Success.” They must note where they saw evidence of each quality in the application. “It can’t be just a hint,” Dr. Pérez said. He recalls a teacher recommendation describing how an applicant had taken a stand on a controversial social issue in class, even though other students vocally disagreed with him. Impressed, Dr. Pérez checked the box for “Comfort in Minority of 1,” a sign, perhaps, that the student would contribute to campus dialogues. Also on the drop-down: “Delayed Gratification” and “Risk Taking.” While Trinity still values conventional measures, the new model has expanded the staff’s understanding of merit. “We’re trying to give students more credit for these characteristics, especially those who’ve had some challenges,” Dr. Pérez said. The new approach, along with the college’s recent decision to stop requiring ACT/SAT scores, has helped it diversify its classes. Low-income and first-generation students represent 15 percent of this fall’s freshman class, up from 8 percent three years ago. “I’m trying to increase the tools we have, and get beyond a system that is absolutely antiquated,” Dr. Pérez said. “As the country becomes more diverse, as we learn more about the correlation between standardized test scores and wealth, we have to be a lot more creative in predicting for success in college.” • What most colleges ask for from applicants doesn’t reveal much about the many skills and talents a student might possess. But what if colleges asked for more? The admissions process at Olin College of Engineering includes a live audition. After completing a traditional application, selected students visit the campus, in Needham, Mass., for an intense two-day tryout. In addition to sitting for interviews, they work in small groups to complete a tabletop design challenge, such as building a tower that can hold a specific weight. On the second day, they are given another task, like designing a campus building. This time, evaluators observe each student, noting how well they communicate with others and adapt on the fly. The experience is meant to help prospective students understand Olin’s collaborative culture, while giving the college a better glimpse of each applicant before finalizing acceptance. “It’s hard to nail down a student’s mind-set from the traditional elements of the application,” said Emily Roper-Doten, the dean of admission and financial aid. “This allows us to see them in motion, in an educational moment.” A desire to see what students can do with their hands inspired a recent change at one of the world’s most renowned campuses. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (motto: “Mens et manus,” Latin for “Mind and hand”) now gives applicants the option of submitting a Maker Portfolio to show their “technical creativity.” Applicants can send images, a short video and a PDF that shed light on a project they’ve undertaken — clothing they’ve made, apps they’ve designed, cakes they’ve baked, furniture they’ve built, chain mail they’ve woven. M.I.T. also asks students to explain what the project meant to them, as well as how much help they got. A panel of faculty members and alumni reviews the portfolios. Last year, about 5 percent of applicants submitted a Makers Portfolio. “It gives us a fuller picture of the student,” said Stuart Schmill, dean of admissions and student financial services. “Without this, some applicants might not be able to fully get across how good a fit they are for us.” M.I.T.’s experiment has sparked discussions among admissions deans, some of whom say they plan to offer similar opportunities for applicants to send evidence of project-based learning. They describe the Makers Portfolio as an intriguing glimpse of how a college might better align its process with its culture and values. The catch: Reviewing all those portfolios takes time, something admissions offices lack. Even a small college like Olin, which welcomed fewer than 100 new students this fall, must scramble to pull off its elaborate evaluations. Larger campuses couldn’t even consider such an approach. Thorough review has become more challenging over the last decade, with waves of applicants overwhelming big-name colleges, victims of their own popularity. The University of California at Los Angeles received more than 100,000 applications for about 6,000 spots this fall. Stanford got 44,000 for just over 1,700 spots, and M.I.T. juggled more than 20,000 for 1,450 seats. Most colleges are considering more incremental ways to enhance evaluations. The Coalition for Access, Affordability and Success, with more than 130 prominent campuses as members, recently established an application platform with a feature called a virtual college locker, a private space where students can upload materials, such as videos and written work, that they could later add to their applications. Among its stated goals: to make admissions more personal. So far, most of its members aren’t asking applicants to send anything different than before. But that could change. A handful of colleges are planning experiments using alternative ways to measure student potential. One hopes to enable applicants to demonstrate their “emotional intelligence,” or E.Q., to showcase their ability to work with others, according to Annie Reznik, the coalition’s executive director. Another seeks a way for prospective students to display their “fire” for learning. “We want better inputs,” said Jeremiah Quinlan, dean of undergraduate admissions and financial aid at Yale. “The inputs we have predict success academically. Now, we have the ability to get to know a student better, from a different type of submission.” Like many deans, Mr. Quinlan has grown wary of polished personal essays in which applicants describe their achievements. “They feel like they have to show off, because we’re so selective,” he said, “and it’s completely understandable.” Technology, he believes, can help colleges get to know the student beneath the surface of a résumé, to gain a better sense of their passions, the kind of community member the applicant might be. Last year, Yale allowed students using the coalition’s application to submit a document, image, audio file or video in response to a prompt (they also had to reflect, in 250 words or less, on their submission). When Justin Aubin heard about that option last fall, he thought, “Cool!” Mr. Aubin, from Oak Lawn, Ill., was then a high school senior hoping to attend Yale. The following prompt caught his eye: “A community to which you belong and the footprint you have left.” He submitted a short video documenting his Eagle Scout project, for which he oversaw the construction of a monument honoring veterans. Even a well-written essay, he figured, couldn’t capture his experience as well as four minutes of footage, shot by his older brother. The content of the video impressed Yale’s admissions committee. “People sat up in their chairs,” Mr. Quinlan said. “You could see how he handled his leadership role, and we felt like we got a good sense of him in a way that we didn’t get from recommendations.” Mr. Aubin is now a freshman at Yale. Did the video tip the scales? “That was a difference-maker,” Mr. Quinlan said. • Even as colleges consider innovation, it’s worth asking which fixtures of the admissions process, if any, they are willing to discard. Some prevalent practices seem to stand in the way of meaningful change. Giving an advantage to the sons and daughters of alumni is one such practice. Some colleges admit legacies (and the children of potential donors) at a much greater rate than non-legacies. Legacies make up nearly a third of Harvard’s current freshman class, The Harvard Crimson has reported. Princeton’s class of 2021 is 13 percent legacy, according to the university’s website. While a handful of prominent institutions, including the University of Georgia and Texas A&M University, stopped considering legacy status more than a decade ago, most colleges seem unlikely to remove that variable from the admissions equation anytime soon. “I don’t think an applicant’s legacy status is a crazy thing to look at, especially in the financial climate some colleges are in,” said Rick Clark, director of undergraduate admission at Georgia Tech, where nearly a fifth of freshmen are legacies. “Colleges have to think about their longevity.” The benefits of legacies go beyond maintaining good will with alumni who might open their wallets, Mr. Clark said. In his experience, they tend to be enthusiastic students who help foster community on campus, the kind of relationships that help other students feel at home and succeed. “Multigenerational ties to a place add value, creating this passionate, magnetic source of energy,” he said. The key, Mr. Clark believes, is not to lower standards, or to enroll so many legacies that other priorities, such as increasing racial and socioeconomic diversity, suffer as a result. “Those two goals aren’t mutually exclusive,” he said. Other measurements used by selective colleges have nothing to do with a student’s accomplishments or attributes — and everything to do with a college’s agenda. About one in five institutions allot “considerable importance” to “demonstrated interest,” the degree to which applicants convey their desire to enroll if accepted, according to a survey by the National Association for College Admission Counseling. The strongest expression of demonstrated interest is applying for binding early decision, a policy that favors affluent students who don’t need to compare financial aid offers and one that some colleges use to fill half their seats. Beyond that, technology has made it easier to track the number of times an applicant engages with a college (by visiting the campus, contacting an admissions officer, responding to an email). This valuable information helps officers gauge who’s most likely to enroll, which can influence who gets admitted in the first place. A higher “yield,” the percentage of accepted students who actually enroll, is widely seen as a measure of status. The problem is that savvy students who know colleges are watching them can tilt the odds in their favor, said Nancy Leopold, executive director of CollegeTracks, a Maryland nonprofit group that helps low-income and first-generation students get into college: “Demonstrated interest is biased against kids who don’t know the game exists, or who don’t have the time or money to play it.” What do colleges really cherish? The answer is influenced greatly by the entities they seek to impress. U.S. News & World Report and other college guides, not to mention bond-rating agencies, rely heavily on conventional admissions metrics like ACT/SAT scores and acceptance rates to evaluate institutions. A college president might wish to attract more creative thinkers, but accomplishing that goal won’t help his college’s ranking. Generally, colleges are risk-averse. Rocking the boat with a newfangled admissions process could hurt their reputations. “The challenge for many admissions offices is to make a change, but not so much change or innovation that you’re risking the position you’re in,” said Ms. Roper-Doten of Olin. Asking students to do more could scare off would-be applicants. “Colleges seek validation,” said Lloyd Thacker, executive director of the Education Conservancy, a nonprofit group that has sought to reform college admissions. “Without a real external incentive for colleges to care about broadening their understanding of what makes an applicant promising, they don’t seem likely to change the definition on their own.” A recent campaign called “Turning the Tide,” a project of Harvard’s Graduate School of Education, is urging admissions deans to rethink the qualities they consider in applicants. In a report signed by representatives of about 200 campuses, colleges are asked to promote ethical character and service to others through the admissions process. Although some deans say they have no business assessing the character of still-maturing teenagers, the push has prompted a handful of institutions to tweak their applications. The University of North Carolina now emphasizes contributions to others when asking about extracurricular activities. M.I.T. added an essay question asking students to describe how they’ve helped people. Richard Weissbourd, a senior lecturer at Harvard, who leads the initiative, recommends that colleges define service in ways that might resonate with disadvantaged students. “Many students don’t have opportunities to do community service,” he said. “They’re taking care of their siblings, or they’re working part-time jobs to help their families. Colleges need to say, ‘That matters to us.’ ” • In the end, increasing racial and socioeconomic diversity in higher education is a matter of will. A college can prioritize it or not, said Shaun R. Harper, a professor at the University of Southern California’s Rossier School of Education who studies race and student success. In September, Dr. Harper gave a keynote speech at the annual conference of the National Association for College Admission Counseling, in Boston. He urged his audience to think hard about racial inequality and “things you perhaps inadvertently and unknowingly do to support it.” He cited as examples high school counselors who discourage promising minority students from applying to highly selective colleges; college leaders who say they “just can’t find enough” qualified black applicants even as their athletics coaches comb the nation for black students who excel at sports; admissions officers who recruit at the same high schools year after year, overlooking those full of underrepresented minorities. As Dr. Harper spoke, many listeners applauded; a few scowled. He concluded his remarks by criticizing the lack of racial diversity among admissions deans themselves. He received a standing ovation. In a subsequent interview, Dr. Harper elaborated on his concerns. “When the demographics of the profession have not changed, particularly at the senior level,” he said, “I don’t know that we can expect a major change, especially in terms of diversifying the class.” Although Dr. Harper believes colleges rely too heavily on ACT/SAT scores, he says that the major barriers arise well before the application process even begins. Colleges, he said, must do more in terms of outreach to encourage underrepresented students to apply. Dr. Pérez, at Trinity, has similar concerns. Although he is convinced that the selection process can be successfully revamped, he doesn’t think that will solve the No. 1 problem he sees in admissions. “The problem is money,” he said. “If I had more funding, my class would be more diverse. The conversation we’re not having in this country is: How do we fund colleges and universities?” However the admissions process might evolve, it surely will continue to serve the interests of colleges first and foremost. Even if someone invents a better, more equitable way to gauge applicants’ potential, a college’s many wants and needs wouldn’t change. Deans would still seek to balance their classes by enrolling a diverse mix of majors from many states and countries. Colleges would still need enough oboe players and theater-arts majors. “What compels institutions to change is deep discontent,” said Marie Bigham, director of college counseling at Isidore Newman School, in New Orleans. “If they’re only making changes on the margins, it indicates that they’re mostly content with the way things are.” That leads to a big question in an age of widening social inequality. How unhappy are the wealthiest colleges, really, with the status quo? Some of the nation’s most selective institutions enroll more students from the top 1 percent of the income ladder than from the bottom 60 percent. Is that simply because of lack of preparation in the K-12 system? Flaws within the selection process? Or is it evidence, as Dr. Harper suggests, of a systemic lack of will to change those numbers? Jon Boeckenstedt, associate vice president for enrollment management and marketing at DePaul University, says that it is the high-profile colleges that have the power to redefine the admissions process. “Unless and until something changes at the top, nothing else is going to change,” he said. “That’s because, at a lot of colleges, people will go to their graves trying to imitate the Ivy League.”",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | What Congressmen Are Hiding,"Editorial As charges of sexual harassment and assault swept from Hollywood to Washington, Congress has faced questions about how it addresses such claims. The answer: terribly. For two decades, taxpayers have been underwriting secret payments to people who accuse lawmakers of sexual misconduct under a 1995 law called, paradoxically, the Congressional Accountability Act. The legislation applied to Congress many laws on workplace safety, employment and civil rights from which it had been exempt. In the process, it established an account to pay settlements, which prevented lawmakers from being personally liable, and created an Office of Compliance that kept charges and payments secret. After public pressure, the Office of Compliance released a tally of the settlements this month: Between 1997 and the present, the office has paid more than $17 million on more than 260 claims. In keeping with Congress’s maddening lack of transparency, the tally lumps harassment with discrimination and other claims, so the number of harassment claims isn’t clear. It also doesn’t name any of those accused. On Sunday, Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan stepped away from his post as the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee as the House Ethics Committee investigates reports that Mr. Conyers, the longest-serving House member, in 2015 settled a wrongful dismissal complaint with a woman who said she was fired because she would not “succumb to [his] sexual advances.” (Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, faces a likely Senate Ethics Committee investigation after a woman said he forcibly kissed and groped her in 2006, before he was in politics.) Congressional sexual misconduct is likely far more prevalent than the settlement figures suggest, because Congress lacks safeguards common in large institutions. Lawmakers get no mandatory training in appropriate behavior toward their staff. Employees, many young and female, say they get little to no guidance on where to report predatory behavior. Victims who do find their way to the Compliance Office are required to undergo counseling, mediation and a 30-day “cooling off period” before filing a formal complaint. Early this month the Senate adopted a bipartisan resolution requiring its members and staff to participate in anti-harassment and anti-discrimination training; in coming days the House is expected to follow suit. But the heavier lift is overhauling how harassment complaints are handled. In the House, Representative Jackie Speier, a California Democrat, and Representative Barbara Comstock, a Virginia Republican, are leading a bipartisan push for legislation that prohibits nondisclosure agreements as a condition of initiating a complaint, makes mediation and counseling optional before a victim can file a complaint and requires lawmakers who settle discrimination cases to repay the Treasury. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, is championing similar legislation in the Senate. But lawmakers are divided on the question of whether to unmask lawmakers and settlements from before this year. Some legislators, including the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, have said that revealing details from those cases could jeopardize the anonymity of victims. If Congress is serious about change, it should pass legislation that grants victims, not legislators, the choice. It’s sobering to recall that the 1995 law was passed three years after another congressional scandal, in which House members of both parties were censured and prosecuted for abusing accounts with the House bank, in some cases writing checks for tens of thousands of dollars they didn’t have. The same environment of entitlement, secrecy and lax rules led to the current situation. Both parties have controlled the House and Senate in the years since the Congressional Accountability Act was passed, and neither has pushed to better protect the thousands of staffers who do the bulk of the work on Capitol Hill. Righting this wrong would seem obvious for Democrats, who led the condemnation of President Trump for his videotaped boasts of sexual assault. So it was not encouraging to hear Ms. Pelosi on Sunday, delivering a weak, he-said she-said defense of Mr. Conyers. Decades of hushed-up complaints show sexual misconduct is as terrible an open secret in Congress as in Hollywood. Legislators have a chance to correct their poor handling of a national problem. They should seize it.",The New York Times
2017,What Did Bernie Sanders Learn in His Weekend in Canada?,"TORONTO — As he tells it, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont fell in love with the Canadian health system 20 years ago when he brought a busload of his constituents across the border to buy cheaper prescription drugs. Now he wants to make Americans fall in love with his proposal to make the United States system a lot more like Canada’s. That’s one reason he took the equivalent of a busload of staffers, American health care providers and journalists to Toronto last weekend, in a two-day trip that was part immersion, part publicity tour. Canadian government officials and hospital executives showed him high-tech care, compassionate providers and satisfied patients, all as videographers recorded. He ended the trip with a speech at the University of Toronto titled, “What the U.S. Can Learn From Canadian Health Care.” But our question is this: What did Bernie Sanders learn from his weekend in Canada? Mr. Sanders — after wedging himself into Row 21 and taking extensive notes on a legal pad during the flight — had barely gotten off the plane in Toronto when an airport security guard chased him down the hallway, telling him, “You’re like a hero to me.” A team of cardiac nurses at Toronto General Hospital asked to take pictures after he toured their unit. At a full 1,600-seat university auditorium on Sunday, he received repeated and sustained standing ovations. College students waited for hours to get into the auditorium and see him speak. Mr. Sanders, who drew huge crowds as a presidential candidate in the United States last year, learned firsthand that he is also a household name in Toronto. His policy vision, decidedly from the left in the United States, matches mainstream Canadian views. “You received the welcome here that is normally reserved for celebrity rock stars,” said Greg Marchildon, the director of the North American Observatory on Health Systems and Policies at the University of Toronto. Ed Broadbent, the chairman of the progressive Broadbent Institute, called Mr. Sanders the most important social democrat in North America — even though Mr. Sanders is not a Canadian social democrat, and is not even a particularly powerful member of the Senate. Many developed countries have achieved universal health coverage, but Canada is relatively distinct in its insistence that individuals should not have to pay any money at the point of care. When Canadians go to the doctor or hospital, they just show their Canadian “Medicare” card. At Women’s College Hospital, executives showed Mr. Sanders an empty billing window. The hospital, they told him, has one employee who manages bills. “For the entire hospital?” Mr. Sanders said, in mock disbelief. Several patients told him about the comfort that comes from not having to pay for their care directly. And doctors, too, said they felt more comfortable recommending their patients get an operation or see a specialist than they might if those treatments weren’t free. “I didn’t have to fill out any forms; I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to pay for the simple job of staying alive,” said Lilac Chow, a kidney transplant patient at Toronto General Hospital, who had been brought in to share her experience with the senator. Whenever Mr. Sanders was asked what he learned about the Canadian system, the value of free care came up. “What I think stuck out to me was from both the patients and the physicians, the importance of not having to worry about money in terms of the doctor-patient relationship,” he said in an interview after his trip on Tuesday. His Medicare-for-All bill includes free care as a central feature. If the legislation became law, no American would pay directly for a doctor, dentist or hospital visit, and co-payments for prescription drugs would be limited. (Taxpayers would, of course, finance the system.) At a round-table discussion at Women’s College Hospital, the chief of surgery noted that Canadian patients can’t always get all the care they want right away. “Wait times, you could argue are a problem for certain procedures,” said Dr. David Urbach, before discussing the ways the province and hospital were working to shorten the lines. Mr. Sanders quickly turned to the glass-half-full interpretation. “What you are arguing — correct me if I’m wrong — is that waiting times are not a problem, and it’s an issue you are dealing with,” he said. In Canada, where government finances health insurance and the private sector delivers a lot of the care, patients with life-threatening emergencies are treated right away. But patients with cataracts or arthritis often have to wait for operations the Canadian system considers elective. A governmental review of the Ontario system recently found that wait times were getting worse in some cases, like knee replacements. The Canadian system puts hospitals on a budget and limits the number of specialists it trains, both factors that can lead to lines for complex care that’s not life-threatening. The system also limits access to services, like M.R.I. scans, that are much more abundant south of the border. On his weekend tour, Mr. Sanders didn’t see the places where patients might wait. Hospital executives instead showed him a refugee primary care clinic, a neonatal intensive care unit and a cardiac surgery unit. But he points out that many Americans who are uninsured — or who have limited savings and insurance with high deductibles — may wait even longer than Canadians for elective, or even urgent, care. “If you’re very, very rich, you’ll get the highest-quality care immediately in the United States,” Mr. Sanders said, in the interview. “If you’re working class, if you’re middle class, it is a very, very different story.” Assessing the systems in eight countries can inform the debate in the U.S. over universal coverage. The Commonwealth Fund, a health research group, ranked the United States health system at the bottom of its most recent 11-country rankings, published in July. But Canada did only a little better, at No. 9. Of all the measures in the study, Canada ranked the worst on the “timeliness” of care. (A team of Upshot experts eliminated Canada in the first round in an eight-country virtual bracket tournament of international health system performance.) Any single-payer system will need to grapple with how much it should spend over all, and where it will save money. Mr. Sanders’s Medicare-for-All bill currently includes few details about how the government would set budgets and allocate resources once all Americans were brought into the government system. Mr. Sanders wants to bring big, sweeping change to the American health care system. Unlike the Affordable Care Act, which filled in holes in an existing system, his Medicare-for-All plan would take away the health coverage that most Americans hold now, replacing it with a single, very generous government system. It would do away with the premiums, deductibles and co-payments that individuals and businesses pay for health care, and instead impose large tax increases. That is not the kind of change that would be politically trivial. In his speech, he noted that the creation of a single-payer system in Canada and Britain followed grass-roots movements, and political landslides by the parties that favored the change. “Real change always happens from the bottom up,” he said, to big applause. “You’ve got to struggle for it. You’ve got to fight for it. You’ve got to take it. And that is the history of all real change in this world.” Yet even in Canada, he learned, changes to the health care system have been difficult. The Canadian system, with insurance run at the province level, covers doctors and hospitals. But decades after the 1984 Canada Health Act, many Canadians pay for supplemental private insurance through their jobs for prescription drugs, dentistry and optometry — despite a growing recognition that medications are essential to care. “Any one of us around the table is just a job loss away from having access to prescription medications, and that’s a problem,” said Danielle Martin, a vice president at Women’s College Hospital and policy researcher, who helped organize the trip, at a round-table discussion. “I’m on my own going to the dentist,” said Naomi Duguid, a patient, sitting across the table. “It’s the only time I get to experience what it must be like to be an uninsured American.” Ontario has recently started a program that will provide coverage for medications to residents under 25. And there is a patchwork of drug coverage programs for older people, the poor and those who get insurance from work. But even in Canada, it’s tough to find the resources to expand coverage. “We have to find the money to fund the program up front,” said Kathleen Wynne, the premier of Ontario, who helped establish the youth drug coverage program. Equity. Fairness. Throughout the weekend, Mr. Sanders kept asking Canadians what they thought about the higher taxes they’d paid to finance their system. Every one among the patients and doctors selected to meet him said the trade-off was worth it because it made the system fair. “I think it’s a really fair way to do it,” said Frederick Brownridge, 67, of Etobicoke, Ontario, as he sat by the window in his Toronto General Hospital room, with IV lines in his arms. Mr. Brownridge had had two heart valves repaired and a double bypass three days earlier. “It also means if you’re in a lower economic status or higher economic status, you’ll get the treatment you need.” On Tuesday, Mr. Sanders said the uniformity of this message really stuck out to him: “There really is, I think, a deep-seated belief in Canada that health care is a right, and whether you’re rich or whether you’re poor or whether you’re middle class, you are entitled to health care.” In the United States, though, Republicans control the presidency and the Congress, and many candidates last year ran on a promise to roll back government support for health care coverage. Several recent public opinion surveys show majority support for a government guarantee of health coverage, but support declines substantially when pollsters mention that government coverage would mean higher taxes. Mr. Sanders said he knows his bill isn’t going to become law anytime soon, but he thinks discussing the idea will help make its underlying values more broadly acceptable. “When you talk about health care, you’re not just talking about health care,” he said in his Toronto speech. “You’re talking about values, because how a society deals with health care is more than medicine. It’s more than technology. It is about the values that those societies hold dear.”",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | What Do You Like to Read?,"David Leonhardt This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. First, a request: What digital media subscriptions would you recommend to others? I’m not interested in the most obvious answers, like The New York Times, The Washington Post, The New Yorker or The Atlantic. Tell me about publications that cover a specific subject, local publications with national relevance or anything else. I would also welcome recommendations of a couple of free publications you particularly like. Email me at leonhardt@nytimes.com. I’ll share the results later this week. The middle-class tax hike. Each time Congress makes major changes to its tax bill, the independent tax experts who analyze bills need to do another analysis. Yesterday, the Tax Policy Center came out with a new overview of the Senate bill, and it was brutal. You can see a summary in the chart below. In brief, 98 percent of households making at least $5 million (roughly the top 1/1,000th of the income distribution) receive a tax cut by the time the bill is fully implemented. Only about 26 percent of those making less than $150,000 a year (roughly the bottom 4/5ths of the distribution) get a tax cut. The tax bill has a few decent ideas scattered in it. But it is, at root, an enormous tax cut for the very rich, financed by a combination of middle-class tax increases and deficit increases. As Chye-Ching Huang notes, it would be very easy to write a tax bill with an entirely different emphasis. Elsewhere. Tyler Cowen, on his blog, offers a limited defense of the Trump presidency. I don’t agree with large parts of his analysis, but it’s worth reading. On foreign policy, Cowen argues that Trump has begun a real “pivot toward Asia” — cultivating better relations with Japan and India while pressuring China to help contain North Korean nuclear aggression — and has taken risks in the Middle East that could pay off. On the domestic front, Cowen credits the president for cutting federal regulations. And he tentatively suggests that Trump’s attacks on American “political and social norms” could nonetheless leave them stronger than before. German turmoil. Why did Chancellor Angela Merkel’s attempts to put together a governing coalition collapse? Because there was not enough of a vision for what Germany would try to accomplish under the new government, writes Philipp Wittrock in Der Spiegel. Absent that vision, the parties fell into bickering over smaller issues. “None of the parties really made a positive case,” he explains. “And that is troubling. After all, the German economy is thriving, meaning that the new government will be in the enviable position of having the financial means to develop projects and undertake reforms like never before.” Germany may be facing a new election, only two months after its last one. Sexual harassment, by industry. In yesterday’s newsletter, I mentioned the scourge of sexual harassment in some low-wage industries. Jocelyn Frye of the Center for American Progress has broken down federal harassment claims by the sector from which they come, in a new analysis. The problem cuts across all sectors. The one with the most claims is “accommodation and food services.” Retail is second on Frye’s list, and manufacturing is third. Health care, including social assistance, is fourth. Perhaps most alarmingly, Frye writes: “Nearly three-quarters of sexual harassment charges include an allegation of retaliation either upon being filed or later on in an investigation, suggesting that many victims face retribution when they come forward.”",The New York Times
2017,What Do You Think of President Trump’s Use of Twitter?,"Student Opinion Please note: Student Opinion is a forum for teenagers. Please refrain from commenting if you are an adult. In an April 28, 2017, article, The New York Times cataloged every tweet by President Trump in his first 100 days in office. Look at the 10 themes Times reporters used to categorize the tweets and read some of the tweets in each category. What do you notice about the way Mr. Trump has used Twitter as president? What is your reaction to his use of this social media platform? This week, President Trump shared inflammatory anti-Muslim videos on Twitter. As Peter Baker and Eileen Sullivan write: President Trump touched off another racially charged furor on Wednesday by sharing videos from a fringe British ultranationalist party purportedly showing Muslims committing acts of violence, a move that was swiftly condemned by Britain’s prime minister as well as politicians across the spectrum. Mr. Trump retweeted the video posts from an ultranationalist British party leader, Jayda Fransen, who has been charged in the United Kingdom with “religious aggravated harassment.” The videos were titled: “Muslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!” “Muslim Destroys a Statue of Virgin Mary!” and “Islamist mob pushes teenage boy off roof and beats him to death!” At least one of the videos, however, did not show a “Muslim migrant,” as it claimed, but a teenage boy who was born in the Netherlands, according to Dutch authorities. The other two showed incidents in Syria and Egypt in 2013 without any explanation of the context of the political unrest then taking place in those countries. No modern American president has promoted inflammatory content of this sort from an extremist organization. Mr. Trump’s two most recent predecessors, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, both made a point of avoiding public messages that were likely to be seen as anti-Muslim and could exacerbate racial and religious animosities, arguing that the war against terrorism was not a war against Islam. But Mr. Trump has shown little such restraint, targeting Muslims with a broad brush, such as when he claimed on the campaign trail last year that “Islam hates us” and when he called for a “total and complete shutdown” of Muslims coming to the United States. Since taking office, he has sought to block visitors from select Muslim-majority nations and engaged in a long-distance feud with the Muslim mayor of London, whom he accused of being weak on terrorism. Students: Read the entire article, then tell us: — What is your reaction to Mr. Trump’s sharing these videos on Twitter? Do you think he is trying to draw attention to the need for national security, as the White House spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, claims? Or, like the British politicians who condemned his actions, do you think he is perpetuating racist narratives, inciting fear and normalizing hatred? — One paragraph in this piece reads, “Such unbridled talk has thrilled some of his supporters who see him as a truthteller breaking out of the shackles of political correctness, but it has alarmed mainstream political leaders both in the United States and Britain, who see it as reckless and counterproductive.” With which side do you feel most aligned? Why? Do you know people who feel the opposite way? What arguments do they make? Since the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump’s use of Twitter has been the subject of political analysis and provoked debates about its legal, ethical and political implications: — In general, what do you think of Mr. Trump’s use of Twitter? Do you find it informative? Entertaining? Inflammatory? Reckless? How do you think a president should use social media? What effects do you think Mr. Trump’s tweets have? Why? The Times has reported that since Mr. Trump declared candidacy until Nov. 17, 2017, he has insulted 394 people, places and things on Twitter and is on track to insult 650 by the end of his first term. He has retweeted doctored GIFs of himself enacting violence against Hillary Clinton and news reporters. In “Trump as Cyberbully in Chief? Twitter Attack on Union Boss Draws Fire,” Michael D. Shear writes about the dangers of this Twitter behavior: “When you attack a man for living an ordinary life in an ordinary job, it is bullying,” said Nicolle Wallace, who was communications director for President George W. Bush and a top strategist to other Republicans. “It is cyberbullying. This is a strategy to bully somebody who dissents. That’s what is dark and disturbing.” Robert Dallek, a presidential historian, called the verbal attack unprecedented and added: “It’s beneath the dignity of the office. He doesn’t seem to understand that.” Frank Sesno, a former CNN Washington bureau chief and now the director of the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University, said Mr. Trump’s willingness to weaponize his Twitter feed, especially against people who are not political rivals, could produce a chilling effect on people willing to publicly criticize the president. “Anybody who goes on air or goes public and calls out the president has to then live in fear that he is going to seek retribution in the public sphere,” Mr. Sesno said. “That could discourage people from speaking out.” — What do you think of Mr. Trump’s use of this platform to insult political rivals, the media and even ordinary citizens? In your opinion, is he a “cyberbully” or is he expressing his First Amendment right? Do you think his tweets normalize or condone bullying and violence? If you do find this behavior inappropriate, what consequences, if any, should he face? — The president’s use of Twitter also brings up questions about traditional democratic norms like accountability, transparency and public participation. In “Trump, Twitter and the Art of His Deal,” Amanda Hess writes: Twitter provides the veneer of populist connection without the hassle of accountability. Sean Spicer, Mr. Trump’s incoming press secretary, has suggested that Twitter town halls and Reddit forums may replace some typical presidential press interactions, where he can easily make himself available to anonymous fans instead of the scrutiny of the press. The social media platforms that were once heralded as democratic tools could also be used to undermine democratic norms. — Do you think the president should be able to block people on Twitter? Is it a form of government censorship or should he be free to choose with whom he communicates? Why do you think so? Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

2017,"What Does Bill de Blasio Do All Day, Anyway?","Like a pyramid, a city is built from many blocks. Since it’s almost Election Day, here’s a look back at the little and endless daily labors of the first four years of Mayor Bill de Blasio. JULY 2014: New York City announced its 2,000th beneficiary of the Business Acceleration program, a diner in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, called Emeline’s. DECEMBER 2014: The city agreed to no longer “punitively segregate” people under 21 in city jails. (That means keeping people alone in a room for 23 hours a day.) JANUARY 2015: The city announced it had received a record number of 311 calls in the previous year: more than 28 million. That’s more than 76,000 a day on average. APRIL 2015: City Hall got solar panels, which were expected to power 30 percent of that building’s needs. JULY 2015: Packing peanuts and single-service Styrofoam containers — Expanded Polystyrene Foam — became illegal in New York City. SEPTEMBER 2015: A handball court at a park in Queens got a spiffy paint job! NOVEMBER 2015: This was the second year in a row that the city resurfaced more than a thousand lane miles. (A “lane mile” is the length of the road multiplied by the number of lanes.) JUNE 2016: Mayor Bill de Blasio cited Lawrence Ferlinghetti while cutting the ribbon at the opening of Coney Island Amphitheater. OCTOBER 2016: A new 72-inch tunnel, 100 feet under the bottom of the harbor, is opened between Brooklyn and Staten Island to carry drinking water. JANUARY 2017: The city set aside a billion dollars to fix the roofs on 700 New York City Housing Authority buildings. MARCH 2017: The mayor gave a speech to announce that the “Fearless Girl” statue, which currently opposes the “Charging Bull” in the financial district, would remain in place until March 2018. MAY 2017: The city announced borough-specific campaigns to promote animal awareness and safety — coyotes in the Bronx and Queens, deer in Staten Island, raccoons in Brooklyn. JULY 2017: The City announced that its ferry services had served a million riders in the last three months. OCTOBER 2017: The mayor made a speech announcing that Prospect Park in Brooklyn would now be car-free.",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | What Donald Trump Thinks It Takes to Be a Man,"Jill Filipovic Donald Trump is a new kind of old-school American man. In some ways, he’s a throwback to days when authority and power were exclusively white and male by definition, when displays of masculine entitlement were overt and unapologetic. But he’s also a thoroughly modern man-child, the kind of overgrown adolescent you expect to find on internet forums dedicated to video games or anti-feminism: a tweeter of juvenile threats, a crass name-caller, an id unrestrained. Trump-style masculinity, in other words, is less John Wayne and more Tucker Max — and a revealing insight into American male anxiety. American manhood is reshaping itself in two opposing directions, and both archetypes are ones we’ve never seen before. If Barack Obama embodied the new ideal of the progressive man — a hands-on dad and a self-identified feminist married to a high-achieving woman who was once his boss, who is also well mannered and protective of his family — then Mr. Trump is his antithesis, an old-school chauvinist embracing a new code of adolescent anarchy. He is a paradigm of feckless male entitlement, embracing male power while abnegating the traditional masculine requirements of chivalry, courtesy and responsibility. Almost a year ago, he won the presidential election by presenting this version of aggrieved manhood in opposition to Hillary Clinton’s hand-raising Hermione Granger feminism. White American men loved it. This happened while, in homes across America, the Obama model of manhood had increasingly taken root. Yes, powerful men do abuse their positions to extract sexual services from women or to remind us that no matter how mighty and successful we are, we can be reduced to simple objects of predatory male sexuality. The past few weeks have been a stark reminder that these abuses don’t fall along partisan lines, with the Harvey Weinstein revelations and stories across industries and continents still unfolding in their wake. Most men also continue to fall short when it comes to household responsibilities, and men still tend to out-earn women. But, in much of America, men’s and women’s lives look more similar than they ever have: Women do more work for pay, and men do more care work than they previously have done. Feminists have insisted that women and men alike can and should embody the characteristics we positively associate with both masculinity (power, respect, dependability, providing) and femininity (caregiving, devotion, compassion), and many of our lives have crept closer to this ideal. To Mr. Trump and many of his increasingly nihilistic supporters, this is a threat to their fantasy of masculinity. We could have guessed that men who believe in gender equality would do more housework than men with conservative views, and it is not news that white conservative men overwhelmingly vote Republican. What is different from generations before is that many of the men making up Mr. Trump’s base are less attached to the institutions that offered respect and required responsibility — unions, church, marriage, school, even independent living. In the face of women’s success, many of them have fallen behind on adult obligations and fallen back on misogyny. Many of these men now seek community online. Mr. Trump knows how to speak to them, and he adopted the modern man-child’s medium. When he tweets insults about the stature of those who challenge him — “Liddle Bob Corker” and “Little Marco” Rubio — he’s not just emasculating his tormentors by suggesting that manly authority is tied to height (although he’s doing that, too); he’s adopting the ad hominem rhetorical tactics that are a staple of angry men on Twitter and Reddit. Today, young women are more likely to attend college than young men, while young men are more likely to live with their parents, and it’s not only student loan debt that’s driving them home. Economic shifts that have decreased employment in blue-collar jobs but increased opportunity in female-dominated sectors have had a psychic as well as financial impact. Care jobs are not jobs men are generally willing to take, in part because of the depressed pay, but also because of social constraints: Nursing, elder care and child care are women’s work. A desire to reclaim this psychic masculinity is why Mr. Trump fetishizes a specific (and specifically white) kind of rough-hewed American maleness while embodying an envy-inducing lack of obligation. The white working men of Trump speeches have the kind of dirty-fingernail jobs so revered in the American imagination: coal miners, firefighters, autoworkers. In real life, more Trump voters work in cubicles than in coal mines. But the point was never Mr. Trump’s understanding of reality. It was his grasp of white male aspiration and identity. Mr. Trump’s own life and actions paint an appealing picture of masculine entitlement for those who want power without the shackles of responsibility. He may not be the smartest or most qualified guy in just about any room, but his money allowed him to marry and reproduce with a succession of models, star in a reality television show, live in vulgar gold-plated glory, say whatever offensive thing danced through his brain and still make a successful run for president. It was a plus that in the three Trump marriages, there have been no “power couple” partnerships of equals, just Mr. Trump on “The Howard Stern Show” talking about his wife’s breasts and bragging that he never changed a diaper. Most American men are unable to actually achieve this level of authority minus accountability; as a result, admiration for men like Mr. Trump gets paired with an “if I can’t have it, no one can” nihilism. White male power remains a dominant force in America, but it is no longer the only force that matters. For many men, this is not a leveling of the playing field, but a plundering of what was rightly theirs. Resentful of the changing order of things, some men have simply leaned in to chaos: If the system no longer serves them, it will at least be fun to blow it all up. Which is exactly why the old rules of political engagement don’t work with Mr. Trump or his base. The president is a perfect figurehead for this bizarre moment: a man who carries all of the negative characteristics of stereotypical masculinity while adopting almost none of the virtues, occupying the most powerful and exclusively male seat of power in the nation (and perhaps in the world), who ascended in large part because a yawning fear of female power kept one of the best-qualified candidates in history out of office. He is ego unchecked, narcissism in place of dignity. In a 1961 essay for Vogue, Joan Didion wrote that people with “self-respect have the courage of their mistakes. They know the price of things.” The piece went on to say, “In brief, people with self-respect exhibit a certain toughness, a kind of moral nerve; they display what was once called character.” Character, she wrote, is “the willingness to accept responsibility for one’s own life.” Our current president, who can’t even accept responsibility for his own social media use or admit that all-caps tweeting might suggest he’s angry about continuing criminal investigations and low poll numbers, may indeed be a new low. Mr. Trump has ushered in a fresh era of noxious manhood wherein bullying is conflated with toughness and self-interest is more important than self-respect. But all is not lost. Every generation believes it is uniquely observing diminishing standards of behavior, even while by most measures, life improves. Plenty of American men are doing exactly the opposite of Mr. Trump and embracing the more productive characteristics of masculinity while rejecting the malicious ones. And the virtues of self-respect — toughness, moral nerve, character — have never been, unlike the presidency, male-only business.",The New York Times
2017,What Doomsday Cults Can Teach Us About ISIS Today,"Retro Report A disturbing 1981 film from Canada could serve as an enduring learner’s manual for any family worried about a son or daughter succumbing to the lure of a religious cult. The movie, “Ticket to Heaven,” describes how a young man, adrift and vulnerable, falls prey to a sect closely resembling the Unification Church of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon. Deprogramming — rescuing him from the zombielike state into which he has fallen — proves a challenge for his friends and relatives. More than three decades later, a ticket to heaven is what Abdirizak Warsame thought he had bought when he and other young Minneapolis men of Somali origin came under the spell of recruitment videos posted online by the Islamic State. The power of that propaganda to inspire acts of terror was evident again last week in New York, where the authorities said such videos impelled Sayfullo Saipov, an Uzbek immigrant, to drive a truck along a bicycle path at high speed, killing eight people and injuring 11 others. In Minneapolis, the aspiring jihadists were like the fellow in the 1981 film: nowhere men. They felt distant from both family traditions and the conventions of their adopted country. In 2015, they set out to join Islamic State fighters in Syria, only to be arrested by federal agents who had them under surveillance. “My son was brainwashed because he was watching this propaganda video,” Mr. Warsame’s mother, Deqa Hussen, said to Retro Report. “He thought that if he go to Syria, he’s going to go to heaven and all my family is going to go to heaven.” Retro Report, a series of documentary videos that mine past news events for their continuing relevance, explores the behavioral threads that run through the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, and apocalyptic cults from years ago. “When you’re in a vulnerable situation,” Leslie Wagner-Wilson said, “by gaining your trust, slowly, you become indoctrinated into the ideology of the organization.” That description fit Ms. Wagner-Wilson and her family 40 years ago. They were mesmerized by Jim Jones, a charismatic figure who declared himself God incarnate. He founded the Peoples Temple, a cult that promised a future utopia where poverty, racism, injustice and war were banished. Based first in Indiana and then Northern California, Mr. Jones drew thousands to his side. But he became ever more paranoid, and his behavior ever more erratic and menacing. In the mid-1970s he moved his flock to a jungle base in Guyana called Jonestown. On Nov. 18, 1978, feeling threatened by deepening scrutiny from American officials and the news media, Mr. Jones organized one of history’s most devastating acts of mass suicide and murder. He compelled his followers to drink a fruit punch laced with cyanide. Ms. Wagner-Wilson managed to escape in time with her young son. Others in her family were not so fortunate. They died, along with more than 900 others, including at least 270 children, their bodies strewn across the jungle floor. The horror shocked the world (and gave rise to a lasting expression for blind adherence to a perilous idea: drinking the Kool-Aid). Jonestown was not the last cult twisted by visions of apocalypse. Aum Shinrikyo in Japan, the Branch Davidians in Texas, Heaven’s Gate in California, the nonreligious Manson Family — all had faithful disciples. All embraced death. Now, groups like the brutal Islamic State and the Shabab in East Africa are magnets for several thousand readily duped Westerners, including scores of Americans. Many of them feel isolated from family and community, and long for something to believe in. They’re typically young men like the Minneapolis Somalis. “ISIS tries to instill that there is something greater that you can be doing,” Mr. Warsame said in an interview last year with the CBS show “60 Minutes,” after his arrest and before a federal judge sentenced him to 30 months in prison. “It kind of takes control of you,” he said. Social media and online videos are powerful recruiting tools that the Islamic State has exploited skillfully and aimed at young people like him and his friends. “If they’re living in a context where they feel alienated, they feel like they’re not getting a fair deal, they can be open to indoctrination,” Charles B. Strozier told Retro Report. Mr. Strozier, a psychoanalyst who is the founding director of the Center on Terrorism at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, added, “They’re susceptible to thinking of these larger messages which come flooding at them through the internet.” They are not necessarily beyond salvation, though. Almost as if “Ticket to Heaven” were a training film, the federal court in Minneapolis has turned to a version of deprogramming as a possible solution. Only the word used in connection with jihadists is deradicalization. The court invited in Daniel Koehler, founder of the German Institute on Radicalization and Deradicalization Studies in Berlin. Mr. Koehler has concluded that extremists of all stripes share a sense that what is wrong with the world and what is wrong in their own lives are intertwined. Many high school or college students feel woebegone: Parents are annoying or teachers are oppressive. Most young people figure out that there are various ways to cope. But for someone who has been radicalized — say, a teenager led to believe that his religion is being persecuted — the perspective can narrow and obvious solutions fade (except maybe violence). Mr. Koehler calls it “depluralization.” What he attempts, he told Retro Report, is to “repluralize the worldview, make it broader again, make them understand that there are no easy answers for single problems.” That means, in part, reintegrating them back into the larger society and inculcating skills other than how to fire an AK-47 or strap on a suicide vest. He thinks that progress has been made with some of the young Somali men, but not all. The judge in Mr. Warsame’s case, Michael J. Davis, said he remained unpersuaded that the defendant had abandoned jihadist aspirations. While the Islamic State in recent months has lost much of its territory in Syria and Iraq to United States-backed coalition forces, experts say it is not defeated. Thousands of militants remain in those two countries and presumably are still able to tempt gullible Western recruits, who are within reach via laptops and smartphones. And there’s always a chance that new death-hugging cults will arise. If the past is a guide, some young people are bound to be seduced into picking up a gun, convinced it’s their ticket to heaven. video",The New York Times
2017,What Explains U.S. Mass Shootings? International Comparisons Suggest an Answer,"The Interpreter When the world looks at the United States, it sees a land of exceptions: a time-tested if noisy democracy, a crusader in foreign policy, an exporter of beloved music and film. But there is one quirk that consistently puzzles America’s fans and critics alike. Why, they ask, does it experience so many mass shootings? Perhaps, some speculate, it is because American society is unusually violent. Or its racial divisions have frayed the bonds of society. Or its citizens lack proper mental care under a health care system that draws frequent derision abroad. These explanations share one thing in common: Though seemingly sensible, all have been debunked by research on shootings elsewhere in the world. Instead, an ever-growing body of research consistently reaches the same conclusion. The only variable that can explain the high rate of mass shootings in America is its astronomical number of guns. The top-line numbers suggest a correlation that, on further investigation, grows only clearer. Americans make up about 4.4 percent of the global population but own 42 percent of the world’s guns. From 1966 to 2012, 31 percent of the gunmen in mass shootings worldwide were American, according to a 2015 study by Adam Lankford, a professor at the University of Alabama. Adjusted for population, only Yemen has a higher rate of mass shootings among countries with more than 10 million people — a distinction Mr. Lankford urged to avoid outliers. Yemen has the world’s second-highest rate of gun ownership after the United States. Worldwide, Mr. Lankford found, a country’s rate of gun ownership correlated with the odds it would experience a mass shooting. This relationship held even when he excluded the United States, indicating that it could not be explained by some other factor particular to his home country. And it held when he controlled for homicide rates, suggesting that mass shootings were better explained by a society’s access to guns than by its baseline level of violence. If mental health made the difference, then data would show that Americans have more mental health problems than do people in other countries with fewer mass shootings. But the mental health care spending rate in the United States, the number of mental health professionals per capita and the rate of severe mental disorders are all in line with those of other wealthy countries. A 2015 study estimated that only 4 percent of American gun deaths could be attributed to mental health issues. And Mr. Lankford, in an email, said countries with high suicide rates tended to have low rates of mass shootings — the opposite of what you would expect if mental health problems correlated with mass shootings. Whether a population plays more or fewer video games also appears to have no impact. Americans are no more likely to play video games than people in any other developed country. Racial diversity or other factors associated with social cohesion also show little correlation with gun deaths. Among European countries, there is little association between immigration or other diversity metrics and the rates of gun murders or mass shootings. America’s gun homicide rate was 33 per million people in 2009, far exceeding the average among developed countries. In Canada and Britain, it was 5 per million and 0.7 per million, respectively, which also corresponds with differences in gun ownership. Americans sometimes see this as an expression of deeper problems with crime, a notion ingrained, in part, by a series of films portraying urban gang violence in the early 1990s. But the United States is not actually more prone to crime than other developed countries, according to a landmark 1999 study by Franklin E. Zimring and Gordon Hawkins of the University of California, Berkeley. Rather, they found, in data that has since been repeatedly confirmed, that American crime is simply more lethal. A New Yorker is just as likely to be robbed as a Londoner, for instance, but the New Yorker is 54 times more likely to be killed in the process. They concluded that the discrepancy, like so many other anomalies of American violence, came down to guns. More gun ownership corresponds with more gun murders across virtually every axis: among developed countries, among American states, among American towns and cities and when controlling for crime rates. And gun control legislation tends to reduce gun murders, according to a recent analysis of 130 studies from 10 countries. This suggests that the guns themselves cause the violence. Skeptics of gun control sometimes point to a 2016 study. From 2000 and 2014, it found, the United States death rate by mass shooting was 1.5 per one million people. The rate was 1.7 in Switzerland and 3.4 in Finland, suggesting American mass shootings were not actually so common. But the same study found that the United States had 133 mass shootings. Finland had only two, which killed 18 people, and Switzerland had one, which killed 14. In short, isolated incidents. So while mass shootings can happen anywhere, they are only a matter of routine in the United States. As with any crime, the underlying risk is impossible to fully erase. Any individual can snap or become entranced by a violent ideology. What is different is the likelihood that this will lead to mass murder. In China, about a dozen seemingly random attacks on schoolchildren killed 25 people between 2010 and 2012. Most used knives; none used a gun. By contrast, in this same window, the United States experienced five of its deadliest mass shootings, which killed 78 people. Scaled by population, the American attacks were 12 times as deadly. In 2013, American gun-related deaths included 21,175 suicides, 11,208 homicides and 505 deaths caused by an accidental discharge. That same year in Japan, a country with one-third America’s population, guns were involved in only 13 deaths. This means an American is about 300 times more likely to die by gun homicide or accident than a Japanese person. America’s gun ownership rate is 150 times as high as Japan’s. That gap between 150 and 300 shows that gun ownership statistics alone do not explain what makes America different. The United States also has some of the weakest controls over who may buy a gun and what sorts of guns may be owned. Switzerland has the second-highest gun ownership rate of any developed country, about half that of the United States. Its gun homicide rate in 2004 was 7.7 per million people — unusually high, in keeping with the relationship between gun ownership and murders, but still a fraction of the rate in the United States. Swiss gun laws are more stringent, setting a higher bar for securing and keeping a license, for selling guns and for the types of guns that can be owned. Such laws reflect more than just tighter restrictions. They imply a different way of thinking about guns, as something that citizens must affirmatively earn the right to own. The United States is one of only three countries, along with Mexico and Guatemala, that begin with the opposite assumption: that people have an inherent right to own guns. The main reason American regulation of gun ownership is so weak may be the fact that the trade-offs are simply given a different weight in the United States than they are anywhere else. After Britain had a mass shooting in 1987, the country instituted strict gun control laws. So did Australia after a 1996 shooting. But the United States has repeatedly faced the same calculus and determined that relatively unregulated gun ownership is worth the cost to society. That choice, more than any statistic or regulation, is what most sets the United States apart. “In retrospect Sandy Hook marked the end of the US gun control debate,” Dan Hodges, a British journalist, wrote in a post on Twitter two years ago, referring to the 2012 attack that killed 20 young students at an elementary school in Connecticut. “Once America decided killing children was bearable, it was over.”",The New York Times
2017,What Famous Figure From the Past Fascinates You Most?,"Student Opinion Charles Manson died Monday, and The Times ran not only the video above, but also an obituary, an Arts piece about his role as a figure in pop culture, an Op-Ed essay, and an article exploring what became of the Manson family. Were you as fascinated by Manson and his crimes as many others were? Who else in this special section of Notable Deaths in 2017 — whether Mary Tyler Moore, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lewis, David Rockefeller, Trisha Brown, Glen Campbell, Dick Gregory, Edith Windsor, Sam Shepard, Tom Petty or anyone else — seems especially interesting to you? What other famous figures from the recent or long-ago past interest you? Why? In “Charles Manson Dies at 83; Wild-Eyed Leader of a Murderous Crew,” Margalit Fox writes: Charles Manson, one of the most notorious murderers of the 20th century, who was very likely the most culturally persistent and perhaps also the most inscrutable, died on Sunday in Kern County, Calif. He was 83 and had been behind bars for most of his life. He died of natural causes in a hospital, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said in a news release. Mr. Manson was a semiliterate habitual criminal and failed musician before he came to irrevocable attention in the late 1960s as the wild-eyed leader of the Manson family, a murderous band of young drifters in California. Convicted of nine murders in all, Mr. Manson was known in particular for the seven brutal killings collectively called the Tate-LaBianca murders, committed by his followers on two consecutive August nights in 1969. The most famous of the victims was Sharon Tate, an actress who was married to the film director Roman Polanski. Eight and a half months pregnant, she was killed with four other people at her home in the Benedict Canyon area of Los Angeles, near Beverly Hills. The Tate-LaBianca killings and the seven-month trial that followed were the subjects of fevered news coverage. To a frightened, mesmerized public, the murders, with their undercurrents of sex, drugs, rock ’n’ roll and Satanism, seemed the depraved logical extension of the anti-establishment, do-your-own-thing ethos that helped define the ’60s.

2017,What Good Can Come from Disagreements?,"Student Opinion Read The New York Times headline that appears below. Did you initially misread “start” as “stop”? What do you think the Op-Ed will be about? Why would someone tell kids to start fighting? In the op-ed “Kids, Would You Please Start Fighting?,” Adam Grant writes: Wilber and Orville Wright came from a wobbly family. Their father, a preacher, never met a moral fight he wasn’t willing to pick. They watched him clash with school authorities who weren’t fond of his decision to let his kids miss a half-day of school from time to time to learn on their own. Their father believed so much in embracing arguments that despite being a bishop in the local church, he had multiple books by atheists in his library — and encouraged his children to read them. If we rarely see a spat, we learn to shy away from the threat of conflict. Witnessing arguments — and participating in them — helps us grow a thicker skin. We develop the will to fight uphill battles and the skill to win those battles, and the resilience to lose a battle today without losing our resolve tomorrow. For the Wright brothers, argument was the family trade and a fierce one was something to be savored. Conflict was something to embrace and resolve. “I like scrapping with Orv,” Wilbur said. The Wright brothers weren’t alone. The Beatles fought over instruments and lyrics and melodies. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony clashed over the right way to win the right to vote. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak argued incessantly while designing the first Apple computer. None of these people succeeded in spite of the drama — they flourished because of it. Brainstorming groups generate 16 percent more ideas when the members are encouraged to criticize one another. The most creative ideas in Chinese technology companies and the best decisions in American hospitals come from teams that have real disagreements early on. Breakthrough labs in microbiology aren’t full of enthusiastic collaborators cheering one another on but of skeptical scientists challenging one another’s interpretations. If no one ever argues, you’re not likely to give up on old ways of doing things, let alone try new ones. Disagreement is the antidote to groupthink. We’re at our most imaginative when we’re out of sync. There’s no better time than childhood to learn how to dish it out — and to take it. Students: Read the entire op-ed, then tell us: — What are some good things not mentioned by the Op-Ed that can come from argument or disagreement? And some bad things? — How does your experience with your family compare with how Mr. Grant describes as many parents’ desire to keep any kind of conflict out of their homes? — What is your response to Mr. Grant’s assertion that “we’re at our most imaginative when we’re out of sync.” Have you had an experience that supports this idea? What about an experience that contradicts it? — How do you think people can best benefit from their disagreements? Can you think of any examples that compare to the Wright Brothers’ experiences?

2017,What Happened (and Didn’t) at the Bonn Climate Talks,"Want the latest climate news in your inbox? You can sign up here to receive Climate Fwd:, our new email newsletter. BONN, Germany — After wrangling through the night, the 23rd conference of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change wrapped up early Saturday with modest accomplishments, paving the way to complete by next year the rules that will set the Paris agreement in motion. Delegates wrapping up before dawn congratulated themselves on another year of saving the process, if not the planet, and called on countries to be more ambitious in tackling emissions. “Climate change is a global challenge. The Paris agreement has sped up the historic global momentum for dealing with climate change, and that momentum is not reversible,” said China’s lead negotiator, Xie Zhenhua. The conference resolved a handful of issues dear to vulnerable nations, but the most thorny decisions were kicked to 2018. Here’s a look at what got resolved in Bonn, and what to look for in the year ahead. No major decisions were expected from this 23rd Conference of the Parties, known as COP23. The goal for this meeting had always been that countries would begin drafting rules and processes for translating the ambitious goals of the Paris agreement into action. Under the 2015 Paris agreement, nearly 200 nations submitted individual pledges to curb their greenhouse-gas emissions and wealthy countries promised to deliver aid — amounting to at least $100 billion per year by 2020 — to help poor countries develop clean energy and build resilience to disasters. Negotiators said they had made some progress expanding the fine print of that agreement, particularly in refining rules that will help verify whether countries are actually reducing emissions as promised. But countries still have to finalize a rule book that will govern a much larger climate discussion in 2018, when countries will formally gauge how much progress they have made in reducing emissions to date. That rule book will have to be completed by next year’s climate conference in Katowice, Poland. After President Trump announced in June that America would withdraw from the Paris agreement by 2020, many feared his administration would play a spoiler role in this year’s climate talks. That didn’t happen. White House officials in Bonn did draw the ire of climate advocates when they staged a forum promoting fossil fuels and nuclear power. But, behind the scenes, a team of career State Department negotiators showed up to work with other countries on the details of international policy. Those negotiators pushed hard for China, India and other developing countries to be as transparent as possible in verifying their emissions reductions. But they also beat back proposals from poor countries that insisted that rich nations should offer a fuller accounting of the climate aid they are providing. That move angered a number of developing countries, particularly since Mr. Trump has said the United States will no longer contribute to the Green Climate Fund for global warming assistance. Fiji was the official host of this year’s talks and organizers did their best to transform the conference hall in this German city into something resembling a tropical Pacific island. But the leaders of islands and other vulnerable countries said they were disappointed that wealthy nations had opposed sweeping steps to compensate countries already threatened by climate change. Negotiators did create a technical expert group to discuss the issue, known as “loss and damage,” which island leaders said they welcomed. Other island leaders said they were pleased that more programs to promote insurance coverage on islands were cropping up. But those on the front lines of disasters said they were getting tired of delays on what they need most: money. “This means life or death for us,” said Tommy Remengesau, the president of Palau, an archipelago in the Pacific. Helping islands and others hit by weather extremes, he said, “is a moral question, and it requires a moral answer.” The world is still wrestling with its reliance on the dirtiest of all fossil fuels. On Monday, midway through the talks, scientists reported that global carbon dioxide emissions would most likely rise in 2017 after a three-year plateau, in part because of a rebound in Chinese coal consumption. We know. Global warming is daunting. So here’s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers. And not just in China: An hour’s drive from the conference, Germany is expanding mining operations for lignite coal. Still, there are signs that the global coal boom is coming to an end. The International Energy Agency issued a report declaring that coal’s “boom years” are over, as more and more countries start shifting to cleaner sources of electricity, including natural gas, wind, and solar. On Thursday, 19 countries vowed to phase out their coal use by 2030, though it was largely a symbolic gesture because those countries were already getting rid of coal. Under the Paris agreement, nations vowed to limit the rise in global temperatures since the industrial revolution to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). Everyone at the Bonn talks conceded that nations were still way off course from that goal. Current pledges for constraining greenhouse gases put the world on pace for 3 degrees Celsius of warming or more, a drastic change that would reshape coastlines, put many populated islands underwater and usher in a new era of deadly heat waves, floods and droughts. Two years after countries signed a landmark climate agreement in Paris, the world remains far off course from preventing drastic global warming in the decades ahead. Despite this, very few countries announced new initiatives to speed up emissions cuts. Some had hoped that China would announce a major cap-and-trade program for its emissions, but that was delayed. Environmentalists pressed Chancellor Angela Merkel to set a timetable for phasing out Germany’s coal use, but she simply announced that she was holding “tough discussions” as she sought to form a new government. Instead, most countries will wait until the next few years before discussing how to ratchet up their efforts. The wheels of diplomacy turn slowly.",The New York Times
2017,What Has Been Your Most Memorable Thanksgiving?,"Student Opinion Do you celebrate Thanksgiving? How do you celebrate and with whom? Do you like this holiday? In “A Thanksgiving Snapshot: Readers Share Their Holiday Stories,” Julia Simon writes: So many of us come together to celebrate Thanksgiving, but the holiday means something different to everyone. We asked for a snapshot of your Thanksgiving — a story or a tradition or a dish that helps define your holiday, and hundreds of you responded. You shared funny stories, about the turkeys that were too big for your ovens. You shared tragic memories, about experiencing unbelievable heartache on a day that is supposed to bring people together. And you shared tales about overcoming hardship to create a memorable meal. Here are your stories; together, they help tell the story of the holiday itself. These responses have been edited for length and clarity. ‘My mother couldn’t stand the idea of anyone eating pizza for Thanksgiving’ About 45 years ago, my mother made a last-minute run to the grocery store. There was a pizza parlor next to the store, and she watched as three Marines entered. My mother couldn’t stand the idea of anyone eating pizza for Thanksgiving dinner, so she dragged them home. She cooked enough for a small army every night anyway, so three more hearty appetites wouldn’t make a dent. These three young men spent the day with our family, played board games, watched football and shared our Thanksgiving dinner. They even helped with the dishes. I think they were the most polite people my parents ever had over. — Sandy Stinson, Santa Barbara, Calif. ‘The shelter didn’t have an oven’ I was homeless and living on New York City streets, in foster homes and homeless shelters. One Thanksgiving, I received a donated turkey — a thoughtful, generous gift, for which I was grateful. My shelter, however, didn’t have an oven where I could roast my dinner. Ultimately, I cut meat off the turkey bones, boiling it in a small pot on a hot plate — my only cooking appliance. The generosity of the donated turkey was tempered by the indignity I felt as a hungry person, scrambling to find any possible way to prepare my Thanksgiving meal. — Debra Vizzi, Hillside, N.J. ‘A possum. In the pie.’ When I arrived at my parents’ home a few hours before dinner, the pie I baked was still very warm. The refrigerator was already packed and bursting with food. It was a particularly chilly Thanksgiving that year, cold enough that I thought I’d just set the pie out on the back porch to chill until dessert time. The curtains had been drawn all evening, and when I parted them to open the sliding door and retrieve the pie I saw — to my horror — a small possum with its face buried in my perfectly cooked, beautifully seasoned pumpkin pie. I SCREAMED. It froze. My brother came rushing over (probably suspecting I’d actually dropped the pie) and witnessed the same scene. A possum. In the pie. — Sonja Groset, Lake Forest Park, Wash.

2017,What If Our Current State of Affairs Is Actually ‘Normal’?,"First Words Americans, we often say, cannot agree on anything. Though we enjoy astonishing access to information about the world and about one another, we’ve elected to retreat into separate, contradictory universes. At the extremes, these beliefs approach a kind of comic-book absurdity — that the victims of mass shootings are actually paid actors, or that every political development of the past four years is part of a devious foreign plot. But there is at least one thing on which almost everyone, across the entire spectrum of realities we have chosen to inhabit, can apparently agree: None of this is “normal.” It’s among the ranks of Trump-averse realists that this observation has become especially common. Every alarming, precedent-shattering move emanating from the White House is met by the same warning Michelle Obama issued in a speech last October: “This is not normal.” (Often, periods or emoji handclaps are inserted for emphasis: “This. Is. Not. Normal.”) The mantra functions as a snappy diagnosis of a grave illness: Things are happening to our system of governance that fall outside the bounds of health and order, things that represent dire breaches of longstanding principle. President Trump’s supporters tend not to find American politics particularly normal either; that’s why they elected him. The sustained focus on Trump’s peculiarities, though, puts them in the curious position of defending him as a highly normal person — not at all a wealthy eccentric whose foibles have fascinated people for decades now. It’s a signature claim of Trump’s political life, after all, that whatever you notice his team doing is merely what any normal person would have done under the circumstances. “Most people would have taken that meeting,” he said of his son’s sit-down with a Russian lawyer to collect damaging information on Hillary Clinton. “This was locker-room banter,” he said of his recorded claim to paw at the bodies of women he has just met. “My hands are normal hands,” he said of his hands. He tends to speak by implication, with a kind of conspiratorial barroom confidence that says: You and I, normal people, we know what’s going on. I don’t even have to say it; everyone is talking about it. Maybe it’s the onslaught of appalled handclapping; maybe it’s the continuing insistence that Trump and his cabinet of the hyperwealthy are just workaday Americans. Whatever the cause, there is something about the mere concept of “normal” that has become faintly hilarious. In some quarters, the word’s use is more likely than not to be sarcastic. Take a recent tweet from Max Marin, a reporter at Philadelphia Weekly, accompanied by a screenshot of an email promoting New Jersey as the seventh-safest state for Black Friday shopping: “A totally normal press release in a totally normal country.” At some point — by the time of the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, at the latest — most everything about the public sphere began to seem like a hack television writer’s parody of it. What could be funnier, more strange and outlandish, than something that managed to qualify as normal? The golden age of “normal” might date back to 1945, the year Trump was conceived. According to Peter Cryle and Elizabeth Stephens, Australian academics from the University of Queensland whose book “Normality: A Critical Genealogy” was published this month, it wasn’t until then that “normal” truly became an everyday word. Harvard researchers had just published the initial results from the Grant Study on Normal Young Men, an examination of students designed to better understand the typical, healthy American male. (One book on the study was titled “Young Man, You Are Normal.”) An obstetrician named Robert Latou Dickinson worked with a sculptor to make two statues, “Normman” and “Norma,” based on the average proportions in data sets of American men and women. In the era of post-World War II conformity, such representations of what was statistically ordinary turned rapidly into prescriptions for what was ideal. Dickinson described Norma as “the perfect woman, the average American.” The culture wars that followed in the next decades are often seen as conservative defenses of the supposedly normal versus liberal defenses of the supposedly deviant. Over time, though, both sides have wound up with the same resistance to normalcy: Each feels oppressed by the social standards of the other. One works to dismantle beliefs that things like homosexuality or disability are abnormal; the other screams about political correctness and pledges never to accept changing social mores. (Online, the young men of the alt-right now dismiss their mainstream millennial peers as “normies.”) What they share, on some level, is a culture-wide, ’60s-born focus on liberating the individual from the tyranny of the normal. And yet now, after decades of sustained attack — during which an astonishing range of Americans came to see themselves as somehow culturally dissident — normalcy is being treated as a positive state. What’s more, the word’s focus shifted: Instead of focusing on how individuals ought to behave in a society, we’ve turned back to looking at the health of society as a whole. We have detected within it an aberration, an irritant, that may threaten its overall health. This unease is partly emotional. A core experience of becoming an adult is the gradual realization that there is no stable force in charge of things and no natural progression by which the unimpressive young people who have always surrounded you, eating paste and binge drinking and struggling at math, will be magically transmuted into credible authority figures. The responsibility for maintaining the world falls to you and your peers. This is why your elders pressured you to learn things; they were aware that they would die and that someone would need to be able to design power plants and do heart surgery. As with international law, we might enjoy the thought that there is some coherent structure holding everything together, but in the end the structure is only as stable as we’re prepared to step forward and make it. This might explain the sense of comic plaintiveness that has accumulated around the word “normal.” Every indignant handclap on Twitter seems to be calling out for the adult in the room. But the only adult available here is the American public, which has turned out to be a lot more comfortable with abnormality than previously imagined. It doesn’t help that Americans of all political persuasions tend to get excited by promises of sweeping, revolutionary change — or that the first chorus of voices warning against the corrosion of the system will always come from its “establishment” caretakers, easily accused of trying to preserve the status quo only because they’re personally invested in it. This is the unrelenting attack on old-school conservatives by the far right. It’s also prevalent on the left, which suspects that centrist Democrats might be less attached to principle than to a meaningless sense of decorum. Hence the moment when George W. Bush obliquely criticized Trump in a speech he gave in October and many Democrats looked back at him with sudden nostalgia: At least he gave the appearance of respecting the system. In 2005, the Russian anthropologist Alexei Yurchak coined a term for a phenomenon he noticed during the final years of the Soviet Union: “hypernormalization.” And last year, the British filmmaker Adam Curtis released a documentary named for Yurchak’s coinage. “Russia,” he explains in the voice-over, “became a society where everyone knew that what their leaders said was not real, because they could see with their own eyes that the economy was falling apart. But everybody had to play along and pretend that it was real, because no one could imagine any alternative.” Curtis’s provocative argument is that the political and economic absurdities of the postindustrial West have been hypernormalized, too. Shortly after our most recent period of real political chaos — the violence and disorder that marked the 1970s — both governments and citizens essentially ceased trying to shape the world and settled for being able to maintain it; we placed our hopes in vast and unknowable systems of interconnected data and markets and technologies, and we simply worked to keep the gears turning. Depending on how convincing you find that notion, there’s a strange implication you might draw out of it about the normal. What if people have things backward? What if, when we fret that something has gone awry with America, we are merely getting a glimpse of a dysfunction that is actually normal, and has always been normal, and has merely been papered over, for a few decades, with careful management? We’d have to believe that the nation’s history includes wild partisan divisions, irrational conspiracy fantasies, bursts of political violence, absurd manipulations of truth, willful subversion of constitutional principles and loads of bumbling ineptitude. Exactly how funny would that be?",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | What If the Russian Revolution Had Never Happened?,"Red Century The October Revolution, organized by Vladimir Lenin exactly a century ago, is still relevant today in ways that would have seemed unimaginable when Soviet Communism collapsed. Marxist-Leninism (albeit in the unique capitalist-Maoist form) still propels China, the world’s surging hyperpower, even as that same ideology ruins Cuba and Venezuela. Meanwhile, North Korea, a dystopian Leninist monarchy with nuclear weapons, terrifies the world. Even more surprisingly, Communism is experiencing a resurrection in democratic Britain: Jeremy Corbyn, that quasi-Leninist comfortingly disguised as cuddly grey-beard, is the most extreme politician ever to lead one of Britain’s two main parties, and he is inching toward power. But Lenin’s tactics, too, are resurgent. He was a sophisticated genius of merciless zero-sum gain, expressed by his phrase “Kto kovo?” — literally, “Who, whom?” asking the question who controls whom and, more important, who kills whom. President Trump is some ways the personification of a new Bolshevism of the right where the ends justify the means and acceptable tactics include lies and smears, and the exploitation of what Lenin called useful idiots. It’s no coincidence that President Trump’s chief campaign strategist, Steve Bannon, once boasted “I am a Leninist.” One hundred years later, as its events continue to reverberate and inspire, October 1917 looms epic, mythic, mesmerizing. Its effects were so enormous that it seems impossible that it might not have happened the way it did. And yet it nearly didn’t. There was nothing inevitable about the Bolshevik revolution. By 1917, the Romanov monarchy was decaying quickly, but its emperors may have saved themselves had they not missed repeated chances to reform. The other absolute monarchies of Europe — the Ottomans, the Habsburgs — fell because they were defeated in World War I. Would the Romanovs have fallen, too, if they had survived just one more year to share in the victory of November 1918? By 1913, the czar’s secret police had dispersed and vanquished the opposition. Just before the fall of the czar, Lenin reflected to his wife that revolution “won’t happen in our lifetime.” Ultimately, it was a spontaneous, disorganized popular uprising and a crisis of military loyalty that forced Nicholas’s abdication. When that moment arrived, Lenin was in Zurich, Trotsky in New York and Stalin in Siberia. Lenin initially thought it was “a hoax.” He was lucky that Germany inserted him like a bacillus (via the so-called sealed train) to take Russia out of the war. Back in Petrograd, Lenin, aided by fellow-radicals Trotsky and Stalin, had to overpower erring Bolshevik comrades, who proposed cooperation with the provisional government, and force them to agree to his plan for a coup. The government should have found and killed him but it failed to do so. He succeeded. Even the “storming” of the Winter Palace — restaged in a 1920 propaganda spectacular as a people’s triumph — was no storming at all. Lenin rages as it took days to seize the main buildings of the government, while the palace itself was taken by climbing through unlocked windows, undefended except for adolescent cadets — followed by a bacchanalia, with drunk Bolsheviks slurping the czar’s Château d’Yquem 1847 out of the gutters. October might have heralded a short-lived interim, like so many other failed revolutions of that era. Any coordinated attack by White armies, the other side in the Russian civil war, or any intervention by Western forces would have swept the Bolsheviks away. It all depended on Lenin. He was very nearly overthrown in a coup by rebellious coalition partners but he made his own luck, though, by a combination of ideological passion, ruthless pragmatism, unchecked bloodletting and the will to establish a dictatorship. And sometimes, he just got plain lucky: On Aug. 30, 1918, he was shot while addressing a crowd of workers at a factory in Moscow. He survived by inches. Had any of these events foiled Lenin, our own times would be radically different. Without Lenin there would have been no Hitler. Hitler owed much of his rise to the support of conservative elites who feared a Bolshevik revolution on German soil and who believed that he alone could defeat Marxism. And the rest of his radical program was likewise justified by the threat of Leninist revolution. His anti-Semitism, his anti-Slavic plan for Lebensraum and above all the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 were supported by the elites and the people because of the fear of what the Nazis called “Judeo-Bolshevism.” Without the Russian Revolution of 1917, Hitler would likely have ended up painting postcards in one of the same flophouses where he started. No Lenin, no Hitler — and the 20th century becomes unimaginable. Indeed, the very geography of our imagination becomes unimaginable. The East would look as different as the West. Mao, who received huge amounts of Soviet aid in the 1940s, would not have conquered China, which might still be ruled by the family of Chiang Kai-shek. The inspirations that illuminated the mountains of Cuba and the jungles of Vietnam would never have been. Kim Jong-un, pantomimic pastiche of Stalin, would not exist. There would have been no Cold War. The tournaments of power would likely have been just as vicious — just differently vicious. The Russian Revolution mobilized a popular passion across the world based on Marxism-Leninism, fueled by messianic zeal. It was, perhaps, after the three Abrahamic religions, the greatest millenarian rapture of human history. That virtuous idealism justified any monstrosity. The Bolsheviks admired the cleansing purges of Robespierre’s Reign of Terror: “A revolution without firing squads is meaningless,” Lenin said. The Bolsheviks created the first professional revolutionaries, the first total police state, the first modern mass-mobilization on behalf of class war against counterrevolution. Bolshevism was a mind-set, an idiosyncratic culture with an intolerant paranoid wordview obsessed with abstruse Marxist ideology. Their zeal justified the mass killings of all enemies, real and potential, not just by Lenin or Stalin but also Mao, Pol Pot in Cambodia, Mengistu Haile Mariam in Ethiopia. It also gave birth to slave labor camps, economic catastrophe and untold psychological damage. (These events are now so long ago that the horrors have been blurred and history forgotten; a glamorous glow of power and idealism lingers to intoxicate young voters disenchanted with the bland dithering of liberal capitalism.) And then there is Russia, the successor to the Soviet Union. President Vladimir Putin’s power is enforced by his fellow former K.G.B. officers, the heirs of Lenin and Stalin’s secret police. Mr. Putin and his regime have adopted the Leninist tactics of “konspiratsia” and “dezinformatsiya,” which have turned out to be ideally suited to today’s technologies. Americans may have invented the internet, but they saw it (decadently) as a means of making money or (naïvely) as a magical click to freedom. The Russians, bred on Leninist cynicism, harnessed it to undermine American democracy. Mr. Putin mourned the fall of Soviet Union as “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe” of the 20th century, yet he regards Lenin as an agent of chaos between two epochs of national grandeur — the Romanovs before Nicholas II (Peter the Great and Alexander III are favorites) and Soviet Union’s superpower glory under Stalin. Mr. Putin presents himself as a czar — and like any czar, he fears revolution above all else. That is why it is victory against Germany in 1945, not the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 that is the founding myth of Putinist Russia. Hence the irony that while the West has been discussing the revolution at length, Russia is largely pretending it never happened. Lenin’s marble mausoleum in Red Square must echo with his laughter because that’s just the sort of serpentine political calculation he would have appreciated.",The New York Times
2017,What Is Happening on Manus Island? The Detainee Crisis Explained,"The United Nations warned on Thursday of an “unfolding humanitarian emergency” in Papua New Guinea, as hundreds of asylum seekers barricaded themselves inside an abandoned detention center on Manus Island, choosing to remain inside a camp devoid of food and clean water rather than relocate to alternative facilities in a city nearby. The camp officially closed on Tuesday, but the detainees have refused to relocate to temporary accommodations, claiming fears of violent reprisals by the island’s residents. By law, Australia will not resettle any migrants who approach the country by boat, a policy intended to discourage dangerous ocean crossings and human smuggling. Since 2013, Australia has paid Papua New Guinea, its closest neighbor, to house hundreds of migrants caught at sea while trying to reach the continent. About 600 migrants, all men, and mostly from the Middle East and Southeast Asia, remain at the center. Most of them have sought status as refugees or asylum seekers. Many of the men have already had their asylum claims vetted and approved by the United States and are awaiting placement there, according to American officials. But nearly 200 have been rejected, leaving them in legal limbo. Tensions over the migrants have grown since the governments of Australia and Papua New Guinea agreed in April to close the site by Oct. 31. On Tuesday, water and electricity to the camp were shut off, and detainees were supposed to move to temporary housing in Lorengau, a city close by on the island. Many of the men refused, citing previous attacks by residents in Lorengau. Instead the migrants barricaded themselves inside, using solar power for their phones and digging wells for water as police cars circled. “It’s very surprising to see it come to this level,” said Jonathan Pryke, Pacific Islands program director for the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank. “It just seems like a complete mess.” By Thursday, conditions in the camp appeared to have declined. One detainee, Behrouz Boochani, a Kurdish journalist from Iran, said the men were experiencing dehydration, hunger, anxiety and the fear of attack and disease. “Heat, humidity, hunger and incessant mosquitoes are taking their toll,” Mr. Boochani wrote on Facebook. “This is not a hunger strike. It is a situation that the Australian government has created, forcing people into starvation and these harsh conditions by refusing to offer a safe place for resettlement.” By Friday, detainees said conditions were leading to illness. One asylum seeker, Imran Mohammad, said in a text message that three diabetic men had fallen ill because they were unable to get insulin, and the camp was strewn with garbage. The governments of Australia and Papua New Guinea each claim the other is responsible for relocating the men until a permanent solution can be found. Australia has pledged 250 million Australian dollars, or $193 million, for the men’s food and security at the facilities in Lorengau for the next year. Julie Bishop, Australia’s foreign minister, said on Thursday that it made “no sense” for the detainees to remain at the camp. But Nat Jit Lam, the regional representative of the United Nations’ refugee agency, said the temporary housing was incomplete and unsafe. “I will not be bringing any refugee there to stay — not in that state,” Mr. Lam told ABC Radio of Australia. In a statement issued Thursday, the agency said: “Australia remains responsible for the well-being of all those moved to Papua New Guinea until adequate, long-term solutions outside the country are found.” Australia has consistently said it will not accept the men for resettlement. They have all been given the option of permanent residency in Papua New Guinea, or applying to resettle in Cambodia or Nauru, the location of a second offshore facility run by the Australian government. None of the men still on Manus have accepted the offer, according to reports. American officials said dozens if not hundreds of refugees from Manus and Nauru would be accepted in the coming weeks and months. About 50 men already moved to the United States in September under a deal brokered by former President Barack Obama. Jacinda Ardern, the new prime minister of New Zealand, also said this week she would an honor a predecessor’s pledge to accept 150 refugees. The Australian government has been reluctant to allow New Zealand to accept the men, fearing it would open a legal backdoor to Australia. If those options do not work out, there is another possibility: Russell Crowe, the Australian actor, offered on Twitter Wednesday to provide housing and jobs for six of the men. Calling Australia’s refugee policy the “nation’s shame,” he added, “I’m sure there’d be other Australians who would do the same.”",The New York Times
2017,What Is Parkinsonism?,"Ask Well Q. What is Parkinsonism? A. Parkinsonism refers to a group of movement abnormalities — such as stiffness, slowness, shuffling of the feet and often tremor — that are classic features of Parkinson’s disease but that can also be caused by medications and other disorders with overlapping symptoms, said Dr. Michael S. Okun, a neurologist and the national medical director of the Parkinson’s Foundation. He said that he makes no assumptions about the cause of parkinsonism “until I see the patient and pinpoint the diagnosis.” Determining the cause of parkinsonism involves asking a series of questions, starting with, “Do we think this is regular Parkinson’s disease?” said Dr. Okun, who is also co-director of the Center for Movement Disorders and Neurorestoration at the University of Florida College of Medicine in Gainesville. Though a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease strikes fear in patients, Dr. Okun said that the illness, a neurodegenerative brain disorder caused by the loss of dopamine-containing neurons and other cells, progresses slowly in many people and generally responds well to drugs that replenish dopamine in the brain. Some patients whose parkinsonism is not caused by Parkinson’s disease also respond to these drugs, but the medications are most effective for people with Parkinson’s disease, Dr. Okun said. It’s important to rule out other potential causes of parkinsonism, he said. The condition can be triggered by antipsychotic medications that affect dopamine levels in the brain, as well as by other drugs, including stimulants like amphetamines and cocaine. Discontinuing the drugs may stop the symptoms over time, though not always. Parkinsonism may also be caused by repeated injuries to the head, exposure to various toxins or brain lesions. Once doctors rule out Parkinson’s disease, they must consider several other serious neurological disorders. The three most common ones are multiple system atrophy, a degenerative disorder also referred to as Shy-Drager syndrome, which may or may not respond well to Parkinson’s medications; progressive supranuclear palsy, or PSP, which also may respond to high doses of drugs that replace dopamine in the brain; and corticobasal degeneration (CBD). Patients with a form of dementia called Lewy body dementia may also exhibit symptoms of parkinsonism, which may or may not respond to dopamine. Various other movement disorders, called ataxias or dystonias, also may display features of parkinsonism. Do you have a health question? Ask Well",The New York Times
2017,What Is Wealth?,"Giving Interviews have been edited and condensed. Wealth is about community, good health and service to others for Rachel Talton. Ms. Talton, 52, is founder of the Flourish Conference for Women in Leadership, and chief executive of Synergy Marketing Strategy & Research in Akron, Ohio. “I know we are blessed financially because we have the freedom to do the things that we want not only today but tomorrow,” said Ms. Talton, who lives with her husband in the suburb of Richfield. As a little girl, Ms. Talton knew she wanted to help people, and yearned to be a psychiatrist. In college, she realized she “might not become the scientist I wanted to be” but had a way with words, and switched to marketing. She ultimately earned a doctorate at the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. Financial success doesn’t guarantee happiness, she said, but it provides a kind of freedom. “Wealth means loving what you do and the contributions that you make,” Ms. Talton said. “It means being able to be financially free to do the things you love, to live the way you want to live. But it also means being healthy, and to know that your family and the ones you care about are healthy and spiritually whole, and that they’re contributing. “If every day I feel I’ve given back, and I have the freedom to do the things that I love and serve other people, then I’m happy to be happy. It makes me so fulfilled.” — Carlo Wolff For Kyle Webb, 32, wealth is about opportunity and access. His financial and business success came from two places: One was luck and the other was being born to entrepreneurially minded parents. Mr. Webb is the chief financial officer of his family’s business, Webb Family Enterprises, which operates 16 McDonald’s franchises in Southern California. He said that his parents set him up with his first McDonald’s franchise and that, along with a good education — a bachelor’s degree in business administration from Morehouse College and an M.B.A. from the University of Southern California — set him on his track. Webb says he is not quite what he would call wealthy yet, but he has a clear view of what that will be. “Having the financial freedom to contribute to the things that you want to contribute,” Mr. Webb said. “That’s measured by earning twice the income that is required to sustain your cost of living via passive income.” He said that wealth “provides access to more,” and that it should extend for “future generations to be able to have, again, more access and more opportunities and to be able to extend it to other people whether they are in your familial line or if there are opportunities for other people in your community that you feel warrant opportunity.” Citing the McDonald’s tagline “America’s best first job,” Mr. Webb takes pride in the way his family’s business extends both access and opportunity to its employees. — Jarrett Hill Wealth has enabled Daniel Buss, 69, an orthopedic surgeon in Minneapolis, to adopt five children, which cost more than $250,000 in total, and address their special needs, including a string of out-of-state cleft lip and palate operations and specialized tutoring for dyslexia. It allows him to take off work for extended family vacations and for most of the children’s school breaks. “Taking more time off puts us in a position where we can get them up to speed on life,” Dr. Buss said. “Having excess income allows me to be more involved with my family and more involved in my community,” he added. With that comes a sense of perspective. “I probably make 10 times a year what my dad made as a small farmer in southern Minnesota,” Dr. Buss said. “Every time I look around, it sort of hits you: Boy, am I fortunate to have had the education I got and then the opportunities after that.” Meanwhile, wealth mutes the late-night worries that nag many parents, he said. “It gives me some peace of mind that I’m going to have resources — next week, next month, next year.” Still, Dr. Buss said he did not consider affluence to be paramount. Rather, it sweetens a life that is already rich. “It allows us to put the whipped cream on top of the icing, which is over the cake. The money makes it easier.” — Christina Capecchi When Nedim Ramic thinks of wealth, the first thing that comes to mind is health. “If you’re a healthy person, you are already wealthy,” said Mr. Ramic, 35, at his home in St. Louis’ southern suburbs. “The reason I say this is, as you can see with a lot of these refugees, a lot of them were really, really wealthy. They had a lot of money and had a lot of material things, and it just all gets wiped away. And all of them had to start from scratch somewhere else.” It’s a story that resonates with Mr. Ramic, a Bosnian Muslim whose family fled genocide in his native Bosnia and Herzegovina when he was 10. His hometown, home to 12,000 people when war broke out, sits on the border with Serbia. The family escaped to Germany in 1992 and resettled in St. Louis in 1999 — starting over from nothing. “If you have your health, if you have your life, you can accomplish pretty much anything if you get the right mind-set,” he said. Mr. Ramic went on to finish law school at St. Louis University and became an American citizen. In 2008, he passed the Missouri Bar Exam and the United States citizenship test the same week. He is now a personal injury attorney and maintains several investment properties. “Material aspect of wealth is very important, because everything else is much easier to plan around if you are financially stable,” he said. Mr. Ramic and his wife had their firstborn — a son — just last year. “What I want him to get out of me, I guess, is if anything — you can become anything you want, and this country gives you the foundation for that,” Mr. Ramic said. “And that’s why I think this country is the greatest one in the world. Yeah, we’ve got our problems. Yeah, we’re not perfect, but at the end of the day, if you have ambition and you’re healthy, you can achieve pretty much anything.” — Ryan Schuessler Wealth is many different things, said Darrin Williams, 49, chief executive of Southern Bancorp Inc. “For me it is an accumulation of assets, and when I use the term assets they don’t necessarily have to be financial,” he said. “I think people can be wealthy in a number of ways. I am wealthy in that I have a loving family and that makes me happy, more happy than money.” “When I think of wealth I really go back to my family,” said Mr. Williams, a lawyer and former state legislator. “I think of what my wife and I will be able to leave our children and our grandchildren, and that’s much further beyond just income and money and possessions, but that’s also wisdom, that’s also advice and a strong faith foundation. I think all of those things make you wealthy. You can be very wealthy and not have a lot of money.” Mr. Williams said Southern Bancorp, a Community Development Financial Institution, worked in some of the most impoverished regions of the country to help people break the cycle of generational poverty through employment, homeownership and savings. “We believe that wealth building isn’t just for the wealthy,” he said. He said he and his wife, Nicole, stressed the importance of sound financial decision-making to their children by requiring them to set aside 10 percent of all the money they receive for church contributions and 20 percent for savings. Only then are they allowed to enjoy the remainder. — Rob Moritz After an impoverished childhood, Hattie Hill, a consultant, author and women’s professional group leader, had to learn the lessons of wealth. “We were in survival mode,” Ms. Hill said. “The transition from scarce resources to financial security was and continues to be a challenge. It’s always about choices.” Ms. Hill is president and chief executive of the Women’s Foodservice Forum, which promotes women’s advancement in the food industry. She also writes books and maintains a global speaking and consulting schedule. “Wealth covers the necessities of life,” she said. “It covers the wholeness of families. It’s also about making a difference in the community, whether it’s supporting faith-based organizations or women and girls.” She is drawn to initiatives with values. “That’s important as a woman trying to make a difference in the world — to promote women and girls, sustaining and developing your community,” she said. Ms. Hill described an evolving sense of what is important — distinguishing between wants and needs. — Randy Lee Loftis Jen Kimmich was waiting tables and managing at a Burlington, Vt., pub when she fell in love with its young, blue-eyed brewmaster. She and John Kimmich married and started saving for their own brewpub. Those were lean times. The experience of struggling on service wages stuck with them even as their Alchemist Pub and Brewery in Waterbury, Vt., started to make money. “John and I lived with our son in an 1,100-square-foot condominium until 2013,” said Ms. Kimmich, who is now 45. “We always had used cars, always bought clothing from the sale rack. We still live well within our means. We like to go out to eat and take nice trips. We know what’s important to us and what we value.” Tropical Storm Irene destroyed the pub in 2011, just as the Kimmiches started a small production plant nearby. “The reality is, while money doesn’t make you happy, it does give you freedom to not worry about those financial stresses,” Ms. Kimmich said. Last year, they opened an $11 million second brewing plant and tasting room in Stowe, and they now employ a total of 45 people at both breweries. They installed a wastewater capturing system to minimize pollution and set up a charitable arm that supports educational and work-force development programs. “The good we can do with our money is really exciting to us,” Ms. Kimmich said. “If you make it all about you and fancy handbags and trips on private jets, that’s all silly stuff that doesn’t matter. I don’t think that stuff has any impact on your day-to-day living or your happiness, but being able to give back and contribute really does.” — Carolyn Shapiro The week before Zach Strief was born, his father was fired from his job as an electrical engineer. His father immediately started his own company, Control Works Inc., which he built and eventually employed 49 people. Mr. Strief, 34 — an offensive tackle for the New Orleans Saints and a partner in Port Orleans Brewery in the Irish Channel neighborhood of New Orleans — said he was raised upper class in Milford, Ohio, a suburb of Cincinnati, and “had no wants as a kid.” “My dad worked 16 hours a day building his company,” he said. “I watched him a lot and learned the value of hard work.” He said he had learned over time “that wealth is an advantage that gives you an opportunity to provide for your family. It does not eliminate problems. It does not create eternal peace of mind. It creates other stresses. But if you don’t have money — it’s an immediate stress.” He was a union representative for four years, and one of the things he saw a lot was that people can’t understand how a player can make so much money and lose it all. “It’s easy,” he said. “Spending and taking care of money is a skill — not everybody has that skill,” he said. He added that when you hand $500,000 to a 22-year-old who has grown up in a family without much money, there is no comprehension of how to deal with it. “If financial literacy has to be taught to grown men,” he said, “it has to be taught to a 10-year-old. This is the power of money; this is how to take care of it.” — Allen Johnson Sabina Teshler was born in Russia and lived in Israel, Italy, New Zealand and Brooklyn before moving to Portland, Ore., and starting her own company there. She now lives just across the Columbia River in Vancouver, Wash. “Growing up, we didn’t have a lot of money,” Ms. Teshler said. “My father taught us hard working ethics and to always put family first. I never went to college; I started my career working for my brother in advertising and learned everything through my different clients, working at different agencies and self-teaching. Coming from that background, wealth is something you share with people.” She said wealth had done two things for her. “On the business side, it created an opportunity,” she said, “allowing me to bring in great talent to my company and help the economy in Portland. When you start a company, it’s because you’re passionate about it and you see an opportunity- the wealth comes after.” On the personal side, she said, it is about having more security and giving more to those you love. “I go back to my father,” she said. Everything he worked for was to help me and my brother. It’s important to me to give back to my community through Portland Design Week, children’s charities and to my own family.”— Michelle Udem Anuj Peddada and his family immigrated to the United States from India when he was 6, and he remembers the sparseness of those early years. “We really had nothing,” he said. “We were in poverty.” Mr. Peddada, 53, works as a radiation oncologist at the Penrose Cancer Center in Colorado Springs. With more than 22 years of practice under his belt, he is at the top of his field. “It’s the freedom to have some choices,” he said, explaining what wealth has meant to him. “It means you have the luxury of being able to provide for your family and determine how much work you want to do.” Mr. Peddada works a lot. On his days off, he pores over medical journals for hours, breaking in the afternoon for a mountain-biking venture with his son – a hobby Mr. Peddada says his wife and daughter are too smart to pursue. But, added Mr. Peddada, who treats cancers and brain tumors, the reading doesn’t feel like work. “My job is a calling. I love what I do.” Wealth, he said, “is experiences and time to do the things you want to do.” — Avalon A. Manly",The New York Times
2017,What Is Your Reaction to the #MeToo Movement?,"Student Opinion Watch the video above with women sharing their stories about sexual abuse and harassment. Have you been aware of the #MeToo social media messages? Have you participated? Do you ever discuss issues around sexual assault and harassment with friends, family, classmates or others? Why or why not? In “#MeToo Floods Social Media With Stories of Harassment and Assault,” Anna Codrea-Rado writes: Women are posting messages on social media to show how commonplace sexual assault and harassment are, using the hashtag #MeToo to express that they, too, have been victims of such misconduct. The messages bearing witness began appearing frequently on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram on Sunday, when the actress Alyssa Milano posted a screenshot outlining the idea and writing “If you’ve been sexually harassed or assaulted write ‘me too’ as a reply to this tweet.” Tens of thousands of people replied to the message. Some just wrote “me too,” while many others described their personal experiences of harassment or assault. The author and poet Najwa Zebian wrote: “I was blamed for it. I was told not to talk about it. I was told that it wasn’t that bad. I was told to get over it.” Other celebrities who took part include Anna Paquin, Debra Messing, Laura Dreyfuss, Lady Gaga and Evan Rachel Wood. Men also expressed their support. The comedian and activist Nick Jack Pappas wrote: “Men, Don’t say you have a mother, a sister, a daughter … Say you have a father, a brother, a son who can do better. We all can.” Students: Read the entire article, then tell us: — What is your reaction to the #MeToo movement? Have you participated in this hashtag campaign?

2017,What Is the Uranium One Deal and Why Does the Trump Administration Care So Much?,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s Justice Department is weighing whether to appoint a special counsel to investigate Hillary Clinton and an Obama administration decision in 2010 to allow a Russian nuclear agency to buy a company that had access to the United States uranium supply. Uranium One, with headquarters in Canada, is one of the world’s largest producers of uranium with holdings in the United States. It is a subsidiary of the Russian nuclear agency, Rosatom. At the time of the Obama administration decision to allow Rosatom to buy Uranium One, Mrs. Clinton — Mr. Trump’s opponent in the 2016 presidential race — was secretary of state. People associated with Uranium One had donated millions of dollars to the Clinton family’s charitable organization, the Clinton Foundation. Because the State Department was one of nine United States government agencies that signed off on the deal, questions have been raised about whether there were any connections between deal’s approval and the donations to the Clinton Foundation. Some ties between Uranium One and the Clinton Foundation were disclosed in a book by Peter Schweizer, a former fellow at the right-leaning Hoover Institution and frequent collaborator on films and books with Stephen K. Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart News and the former White House chief strategist. Mr. Schweizer provided some of his information from his book, “Clinton Cash,” to The New York Times, which conducted its own reporting. Mr. Trump is frustrated with the continuing investigations into Russia’s election meddling and possible ties to his campaign. Last month the special counsel announced the first charges against Trump campaign aides. The president has said the Justice Department should instead be investigating Mrs. Clinton’s involvement in the Uranium One deal and donations to her family’s charitable foundation. “Uranium deal to Russia, with Clinton help and Obama Administration knowledge, is the biggest story that Fake Media doesn’t want to follow!” Mr. Trump wrote in a Twitter post on Oct. 19. His request has triggered a political backlash and breaks with longstanding norms established after Watergate. On Monday, the Justice Department told Congress that it was looking into whether to appoint a special counsel to investigate Mrs. Clinton and the Uranium One deal. Earlier this year, the department appointed a special counsel, the former F.B.I. director Robert S. Mueller III, to take over the government’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and the possible involvement of Trump campaign aides. Some Republicans have also called for investigations into the Uranium One deal, including Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Representative Bob Goodlatte of Virginia — both chairmen of congressional committees that oversee the Justice Department. The Justice Department’s letter on Monday was in response to Mr. Goodlatte’s requests. Mr. Goodlatte’s committee and the House oversight committee are already conducting their own investigations into the Uranium One decision. On Oct. 24, Mr. Grassley wrote in a Twitter post, “Whoever in DOJ is capable w authority to appoint a special counsel shld do so to investigate Uranium One ‘whoever’ means if u aren’t recused.” In October, an article in The Hill reported that the F.B.I. had been looking into evidence around the time of the Uranium One deal that Russians were offering bribes to expand their energy interests in the United States. Mr. Mueller was the F.B.I. director at the time. “I think the uranium sale to Russia and the way it was done — so underhanded, with tremendous amounts of money being passed — I actually think that’s Watergate, modern age,” Mr. Trump told reporters on Oct. 25. There has been no evidence that donations to the Clinton Foundation influenced the Uranium One deal. Mrs. Clinton’s campaign spokesman, Brian Fallon, has said suggestions they did were “baseless.” In 2015 the F.B.I., at several of its field offices, opened preliminary investigations into the Clinton Foundation. Agents wanted to pursue a wider investigation and conduct interviews and obtain subpoenas. The F.B.I. eventually consolidated the cases at its headquarters. Former officials said that career public corruption prosecutors in Washington concluded there was not enough evidence to move forward with a case.",The New York Times
2017,What Love Looks Like,"Modern Love We set out to find couples in New York who would be willing to have their photo taken and to answer some personal questions. Here are 10 couples who agreed. On an unseasonably warm day in October, a photographer and a reporter on a quest for couples to feature in The New York Times traversed almost the entire length of Manhattan, crossing through Central Park, stopping at Comic Con and wandering the High Line. A few mishaps were inevitable. Upon spotting one couple who were power walking around the Central Park reservoir, they stopped to ask: “Are you a couple?” “I’m his mother!” the woman said. “I’m 80.” (Well, she hardly looked it.) A few successes followed. Faith in journalistic powers of observation reaffirmed. And then, another stumble. A pair of women lounged on a picnic blanket, bodies and hair casually intertwined. A few feet away, a man reclined in the grass, his gaze on them. A triad? The photographer and reporter approached: “Are you by any chance in love?” Sisters, it turned out. “That’s my boyfriend,” said one of the two, pointing at the man. Awkward. Brushing off the sting of embarrassment, the photographer and reporter marched on, and by sundown they had rounded up 10 romantically involved duos. Meet them below. Dr. Foster, 32, is a pediatric intensive care doctor, and Mr. Gates, 34, is a firefighter. They met online. Their first date was over brunch, between his night shift and her afternoon shift. Is this your first big trip? Dr. Foster: This is our second big trip. We went to Europe last year. Was it smooth sailing? Mr. Gates: I don’t know about that. Dr. Foster: Definitely a few arguments. About directions and stuff. Is that why you carry your own map? Dr. Foster: Pretty much. He has his map on his phone, so I have to check. I confirm. Ms. Shahzad, 20, and Mr. Javier, 22, met at Sweetgreen, where they both work. Ms. Shahzad: He was upset because no one was level scooping the chicken. So I showed him that I was level scooping, and he saw me for the first time. We started hanging out, and a couple of weeks later he asked me to be his girlfriend. We’ve been in a relationship for two months now. Mr. Jo, 43, works in construction, and Ms. Yi, 31, is in fashion merchandising. They were on the High Line on their first day of vacation in New York. Mr. Jo: Our friends introduced us. That was a year ago. I felt I was falling in love with her from the first time. It took me six months to propose. Ms. Yi: No, three months! Mr. Jo: No, six months. Did you know he was going to propose? Ms. Yi: The mood was different. I expected it instantly. Ms. Ledain, 37, a stylist, and Mr. Ledain, 47, a UPS driver, met at the nightclub Webster Hall. They have four children and dated for eight years before Mr. Ledain asked Ms. Ledain to marry him. (They were attending Comic Con.) Mr. Ledain: For two weeks, every time we went out, I would carry the ring with me. There was a horse and carriage, a white one. I asked the lady to take us to a nice spot, and she took us to Central Park. Liza stood up to look at the city. And then I was on my knees. She turned around, looked down and I proposed. Mr. Rivera, 34, a manager at Oak, and Mr. Stirtzinger, 27, a server, were friends before they began dating. Mr. Stirtzinger recently moved to New York and now lives with Mr. Rivera. Mr. Rivera: We met in Los Angeles when I worked at Kitson. He came in one day and came in every day after. He would just spend eight hours wandering all around. Everybody knew I was being stalked. I was actually in another relationship at the time. But it was cute. Mr. Wright, 26, a construction worker, stopped Ms. Williams, 20, in the street the first time he saw her. Their relationship took off from there. What did you say? Mr. Wright: “Marry me, marry me, marry me.” Or something like that. No. I saw her, looking amazing as usual. I was like, “I don’t mean to interrupt you, ma’am, but you’re very pretty.” And she was like, “Thank you.” We started talking. She was going to catch the bus but instead we walked. I walked her to the last stop on the bus route. We’re coming up on our one year. Mr. Diallo, 40, who works in sales, and Ms. Dair, 47, who works in customer service, met six years ago. They have been inseparable since. Ms. Dair: We met at a bodega. On 27th street. I was doing paperwork. Mr. Diallo: And I walked in to buy something. Ms. Dair: He approached me. Mr. Diallo: She was sitting down. I stared at her, and we had eye contact. Ms. Dair: And then you came up and said, “Do you want to mingle?” My first thought was no, but it was so charming that I said yes. Mr. Poole, 40, a doorman and mechanic, and Ms. Gonzalez, 31, met in Puerto Rico 16 years ago when she came into an auto body shop where he fixed cars. They dated for a year before he joined the beauty supply company where she worked. Mr. Poole: We were going out on the island constantly because we were working together. For six years or so, we had to be constantly in contact. We have 16 years together. I’ve proposed twice, and she said yes. But there are so many complications. Mr. Phillips, 89, and Ms. Phillips, 79, both retired, first met about 40 years ago on a yacht, when they were both married to other people. Ms. Phillips: When his wife died, my husband, who was very ill, and I started looking after Malcolm. But then I started looking after him I think far too well. Mr. Phillips: We got married when I was 84. Ms. Phillips: I was 74. How did the romance begin? Ms. Phillips: I walked past his beach house. I said, “Hello, how are you?” Mr. Phillips: You had your dogs. Ms. Phillips: And I said, “Would you like to come for a walk?” And he said, “Yes.” The next day, miraculously, there he was again. And then you said, “Do you think Graham would mind if we had a cup of coffee?” And I said, “I think he could care less.” Mr. Vendruscolo, 38, a hedge-fund manager, and Ms. Amadio, 40, an assistant at a courthouse, met while taking Italian language classes. Both of their grandparents are from Italy. Who asked whom out for the first time? Mr. Vendruscolo: I invited her to watch a movie at home. That was 12 years ago. Had you been eyeing him from afar? Ms. Amadio: No. Mr. Vendruscolo: It was not love at first sight. It happened slowly. It was the day-by-day routine, studying together. What do you fight about? Mr. Vendruscolo: We don’t fight. Sometimes I like to do stuff, walk around and stuff, and she’s more lay down. Sometimes we fight about that, but besides that, we don’t really fight. We’ve never had a real fight.

2017,What New York Attack Suspect’s Words May Say About ISIS Ties,"More than two days after the driver of a pickup truck crushed pedestrians in a bike lane in Lower Manhattan, at least four clues have emerged showing the radicalization of the suspect, Sayfullo Saipov. While it remains unknown if the suspect was speaking to the terrorist group or being guided by it, pieces of paper and two cellphones at the scene provide a window into his familiarity with the terminology of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. (On Thursday night, the group took credit for the attack in its weekly newsletter.) Feet from where the truck came to a stop on Tuesday afternoon, police recovered sheets of paper bearing a message written in Arabic and English, “It will endure,” they said, referring to the Islamic State, according to the criminal complaint against Mr. Saipov. The phrase is familiar to followers of the group. Throughout the territory it once held in Iraq and Syria, the Islamic State left one Arabic word: baqiya. It was printed on billboards and spray-painted on the buildings it confiscated. Enter a home formerly occupied by one of the terrorist group’s emirs, and you find it scrawled in marker on the walls. You can even find it etched into the desks they used, like teenagers carving their initials on a picnic table. It means “remaining” or “enduring,” and it is the terrorist group’s slogan, dating to when it was still an affiliate of Al Qaeda. A senior law enforcement official, who had been briefed on the investigation into the New York attack, said that the phrase appeared more than once in the note. “There’s some stuff in the beginning and then there’s the repeated, ‘The Islamic State will endure forever,’ or ‘will last forever,’ you know, three times, in Arabic,” he said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing. The Islamic State’s magazine, Rumiyah, provided detailed guidance on truck attacks in an issue published in November 2016. The group encouraged supporters to keep driving the car for as long as possible. “To ensure the most carnage over upon the enemies of Allah, it is imperative that one does not exit his vehicle during the attack. Rather, he should remain inside, driving over the already harvested kuffar” — infidels — “and continue crushing their remains until it becomes physically impossible to continue by vehicle.” In the New York attack, the suspect drove over people in the bike lane until he crashed into a school bus. According to the magazine, the attacker is expected to jump out and use a secondary weapon, like a gun or a knife. The New York attacker did just that: He jumped out with a pellet gun, though he did not appear to have hurt anyone with it. His aim, though, may have also been to use a knife. The complaint states that a black bag containing three knives was found near Mr. Saipov after he was shot. Among the more obscure instructions, however, is the manner in which the assailant is supposed to tell the public of his allegiance to the Islamic State. The article states that an assailant should write a note on several sheets of paper, throwing them out the window of the vehicle as the attack is being carried out. The magazine suggests including the phrase, “The Islamic State will remain,” a rendering of the group’s baqiya slogan. The New York attacker’s papers were found about 10 feet from the driver’s side of the car, the criminal complaint said. On the attacker’s cellphone, recovered at the scene, investigators found several pictures of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the self-styled caliph of the Islamic State. Recruits learn that before an attack, a pledge of allegiance needs to be recorded. It can be written or recorded as audio or video, but the pledge is supposed to be to addressed to an individual, in this case the caliph of the Islamic State, and not to the organization overall. This ritual is meant to recreate the way in which early Muslims pledged fealty to the Prophet Muhammad, and later to the caliphs that succeeded him, said Amarnath Amarasingam, a senior research fellow at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. Islamic State recruits refer to Mr. Baghdadi as Emir al-Mumineem, an honorific meaning the commander of the believers, and they will often use a long version of his name — “Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi al-Husseini al-Qurayshi.” The last term — al-Qurayshi — is a reference to tribe of the Prophet Muhammad. One of the rules for choosing a caliph is that he must be descended from the lineage of the prophet. Recruits who use this terminology are nodding to this history. These terms can be heard in the first few sentences of Anis Amri’s pledge of allegiance, released after the Tunisian immigrant used a tractor-trailer to run over shoppers in a Christmas market in Berlin last December, killing 12. Although Mr. Saipov had pictures of Mr. Baghdadi on his phone and told investigators that he began plotting his attack after hearing one of the leader’s audio recordings, the authorities said, he does not appear to have pledged allegiance in this formal manner. This could reflect someone who was self-radicalized, not coached online, at least not extensively, by Islamic State recruiters. At the same time, what the complaint said was found on the attacker’s phone suggests he may have had access to the Islamic State’s secret chat rooms on the app Telegram. It is in these chat rooms, known as “channels,” that Islamic State followers congregate and post claims for attacks as well as share videos, including executions. With numerous lawsuits filed against social media companies by the families of victims of recent Islamic State attacks, the group’s videos are often suspended within hours of being uploaded to YouTube, Twitter or Facebook. The group has increasingly turned to closed channels to share information. Among the videos that investigators said they found on Mr. Saipov’s phone was one of the group’s most disturbing clips, showing the grotesque executions of prisoners forced to wear orange jumpsuits in an echo of the United States prison at Guantánamo Bay. That the suspect was said to have these videos, as well as thousands of images of Islamic State propaganda suggests he may have had access to the group’s Telegram channels. These channels include online tutorials on how to carry out attacks. For example, the Lone Lions channel routinely posts step-by-step demonstrations showing how to make triacetone triperoxide, or TATP, the explosive compound used in nearly all Islamic State attacks in the West. More important, these channels serve as digital watering holes, where ISIS scouts identify potential new attackers. Numerous attacks in the last three years were carried out by recruits who made contact with Islamic State handlers on the Telegram app, and later migrated to encrypted, one-on-one chats. Like any other app, Telegram can be deleted from a phone. The complaint does not state if investigators found the app on the two cellphones the suspect left at the scene, or if he erased the digital bread crumbs leading back to ISIS.",The New York Times
2017,What Parents Can Do to Help Keep Their Children Safe From Assault,"They are public officials, celebrities, coaches, doctors, teachers: adults in positions of authority who are accused of sexually assaulting minors. In many of the cases, the perpetrators were men the kids knew well and the children frequently felt unable to report it. Parents may have a sense of panic that the problem is getting worse. But in fact, some of the cases now making news aren’t new at all: Some of the accusations against Roy Moore, the Republican running for Senate in Alabama, stem from the 1970s. Over the past 25 years, the overall rate of reported cases of sexual abuse of children in the United States has actually declined by 65 percent, according to research conducted by David Finkelhor, director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center and professor of sociology at the University of New Hampshire. Dr. Finkelhor attributes the decline to several factors, not the least of which are a growing awareness of the problem and an increase in education and training surrounding the identification and prevention of sexual assault. “It’s not like we are having a new epidemic, but it looks like this new awareness is resulting in some improvement of the situation,” Dr. Finkelhor said. An estimated 90 percent of the perpetrators of child sexual abuse are people the child knows, with 30 percent being family members. Just 10 percent are strangers. What can parents do to help keep their kids as safe as possible? Teach Body Awareness Early As your child is learning to talk, use the real names of body parts and genitals during diaper changes or bath time — and let them know that no one should touch their private parts other than a parent, caregiver or doctor. Further, in those instances, explain that the touch should be brief, and in the case of a doctor visit, a parent or other adult should be present. “It’s never too early to teach children that their body belongs to them,” said Debby Herbenick, a professor of public health at Indiana University and a fellow at the Kinsey Institute. For instance, when you tickle your kids and they tell you to stop, you stop. The same applies to physical affection. “Sometimes parents think they have to make their kids hug or kiss relatives, but they don’t. You can suggest it but if the child says ‘no,’ just leave it at that, which teaches kids that how they give affection is their choice to make and not something they have to do to make somebody else feel good or happy — or do out of obligation,” Dr. Herbenick said. Once your child requests privacy in the bathroom or while changing, grant it, said Wendy Mogel, a psychologist and author. “This communicates the concept of dignity, enables children to discern what’s appropriate and what’s not, and it teaches them independence and agency over their own bodies,” she said. Help Kids Listen to Their Intuition and Act on It “We tend to emphasize manners to kids, but when they are in a situation where they’re starting to feel uncomfortable, they often don’t feel they have the power to be rude and leave,” Dr. Mogel said. So she suggests role-playing with your kids — pretend to be a neighbor with a litter of kittens to show them. “I’d remind them that they didn’t have to be polite or even answer if a situation felt wrong to them. They could simply run and report to a safe adult.” Role-playing helps give children a script for awkward conversations, Dr. Finkelhor said. “Kids can find it hard to articulate, ‘I need to go home’ or ‘You can’t touch me that way,’ and having practiced saying those strong messages makes them more likely to be able to do it when needed.” Dr. Finkelhor added that it’s necessary to talk with young people not only about the possibility of becoming victims but also about becoming offenders because population surveys have found that about half of sexual abuse offenders are juveniles. Another thing parents can do: Assure your kids that their feelings are valid. “We live in a culture in which girls and boys tend to put down each other’s feelings,” said Rachel Simmons, co-founder of Girls Leadership. “It’s up to us to say, ‘I believe your feelings and you should too,’ because self advocacy can only happen when you authorize your own feelings.” Make Clear You’re There for Support It’s crucial to tell your child that if somebody makes her uncomfortable or touches her inappropriately, she can tell you and she won’t be in trouble. Often children have been told by the perpetrator that nobody will believe them if they tell, they will lose their social status, they will be blamed or that they will give up what may seem like a special relationship with the offender, said Dr. Tara Harris, medical director of the Pediatric Center of Hope at Riley Hospital for Children at Indiana University Health. Explain to your children that they can talk to you and you will not judge or blame them and will do all you can to protect them. And get a medical exam, both to help take care of the child and to record any evidence. Reporting abuse can be particularly difficult for a child when the perpetrator is an admired member of the community (like a teacher or a coach) who may appear to have power over a child’s future. “This is an opportunity for parents to say that I’m going to stand with you — and that no success and no opportunity is worth the violations that you’re experiencing,” Ms. Simmons said. Be Aware of Your Child’s Behavior “The nature of the newsfeed has made the probabilities of danger seem wildly skewed in parents’ minds and they imagine that if they let their child out of their sight for one second without implanting a GPS tracker in their head, they’re going to be assaulted, molested or abducted that day — and that is highly unlikely,” Dr. Mogel said. Still, within reason, keep tabs on your child’s life. “I encourage parents to have the rule that phones and electronic devices stay in the parents’ room at night,” Dr. Harris said. “Kids should be sleeping, not playing on their phone at night; and that’s usually when people text kids in inappropriate ways.” Monitoring late-night communications can be a way to prevent questionable relationships from developing. Also, find out what policies your child’s school or camp has regarding sexual assault. And urge kids to follow a buddy system. “There shouldn’t be one adult taking a child to a bathroom alone and there’s no reason your child can’t grab a friend to come along,” Dr. Harris said. “Let your school or camp know that your family follows this buddy system, which puts the organization on notice that you talk about body safety and your child knows about these things — and that’s an extra barrier that may slow someone down who might have targeted that child.” If you do notice signs of distress in your child, take it seriously. “If your child suddenly becomes more withdrawn or is spending more time alone in their room, talk with them about it,” Dr. Herbenick said. “Let them know, ‘I’m noticing this about you and I want to make sure you’re O.K.’” If your child discloses an assault, don’t dismiss it. “One of the biggest factors in how a child recovers from what happened is the reaction they get when they tell an adult,” Dr. Harris said.",The New York Times
2017,What Reality TV Teaches Us About Russia’s Influence Campaign,"State of the Art In May 2016, a Facebook page called Heart of Texas urged its nearly 254,000 followers to rise up against what it considered to be an urgent cultural menace. A mosque in Houston had opened up a new library, and Heart of Texas planned to protest. “Stop Islamization of Texas,” it warned. Word of the protest spread quickly, but supporters of the mosque were also ready to mobilize. “Bigots are planning to intimidate through weaponized fear this Saturday at noon,” one of them wrote on Reddit. The post linked to a Facebook page for United Muslims of America, a group that said it was planning a counterprotest for the same time and place. By now you might be able to guess the punch line here. Heart of Texas wasn’t a real group, as Business Insider later reported. United Muslims of America is a real organization, but the Facebook page promoting the counterprotest was not run by the actual group, as The Daily Beast found. Instead, according to documents made public last week by the Senate Intelligence Committee, both the pro- and anti-mosque protests had been planned and promoted by Russian trolls. We may never know for certain if Russia’s campaign to influence American society through social networks changed the course of history in big ways — if it altered the election results, say. But it is already clear that Russia’s efforts did change the world in countless small ways. A few dozen real Americans did protest that Saturday in Houston. Videos of the protest show real emotion — people on opposite sides of the street screaming, swearing and truly angry to have to share the country with the bozos on the other side. As I watched these videos recently, I had an epiphany about the Russia influence campaign. The Houston protest videos depicted a bunch of Americans duped into fighting each other in public, all at the whim of an unseen force that, through expert and surreptitious cajoling, had gotten them to lose control of themselves on camera. I’d seen this show many times before, and you probably have, too. It’s called “The Bachelor.” And not just the “The Bachelor,” but every show like it. The Russians are running a reality show through Facebook and Twitter, and their contestants are all of us. Over the past few days, I reached out to several reality show producers, asking them to compare the Russian digital influence campaign and the world of unscripted TV. The more they told me about reality shows, the more the metaphor seemed to explain Russia’s trolling campaign — how it worked, what it aimed to do and why campaigns like it will be so difficult to fight. One of the more surprising findings about the Russian influence campaign is its political incoherence. The documents released so far suggest that, as in the Houston protest, the trolls didn’t seem to care very much about pushing one political side over another. They were happy to push all sides — to get people to argue for and against the Islamic library — which suggests their ultimate goal was to sow drama. Why? Reality TV offers a guide: Because drama is easy to produce, and because drama sells. On a show where the action stems from the interplay of people living in close quarters — like “The Bachelor” — there are often producers on set who subtly, and sometimes less than subtly, prod the contestants into acting in certain ways. How often this happens, and to what degree, varies greatly from show to show and is matter of great secrecy and controversy within the industry. But pretty much everyone in the world of reality TV acknowledges that it happens to some degree on most shows, and that there are certain basic ways to manufacture drama. Sarah Gertrude Shapiro, a former producer on “The Bachelor” who later created “Unreal,” a scripted show about the reality industry, said the key to manipulating contestants into acting a certain way was to “tap into their fears, passions and ego.” On reality TV, producers can do that because they keep detailed dossiers on everyone on set. But guess what? Russian trolls had detailed dossiers, too — and they could consult them at scale. Using Facebook’s exquisitely detailed ad-targeting and viral propagation systems, trolls could create content that perfectly matched your fears, passions and ego. “Facebook pages are veritable instruction manuals for someone who wants to exploit you,” Ms. Shapiro said. Given these tools, the Russian plan was simple: “You just poke the bears, put them in a cage and let them fight.” Case in point: In response to Heart of Texas’ “Stop Islamization” post, a Facebook user upset with the Houston mosque posted a comment suggesting that it be blown up. That prompted a local civil rights group to contact the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which in turn led to a story in The Houston Chronicle about the threat and the law enforcement response. Bear poked. But it doesn’t end there. In the same way that cage-fighting bears sells on reality TV, such conflict also sells on Facebook’s News Feed, which rewards posts that get a lot of engagement, as well as on Twitter and the larger ecosystem of amped-up cable news that feeds off viral content. The Russian trolls clearly understood this. They based their campaigns on well-known divisions — racial, political, religious — and the conflicts they generated spread far across social media, and were then widely covered by the news media. “If Simon Cowell once tapped into a main artery of negativity in American life, Facebook and Twitter and 24-hour news really picked that up,” said Mike Duffy, a co-founder of Ugly Brother Studios, which produces many unscripted shows, referring to the acerbic judge of “American Idol” and “America’s Got Talent.” “They’re pushing the same types of bombastic characters, and they’re seeing a ratings increase.” There’s a surprising amount of disagreement among experts about how real reality TV is. One camp suggests it’s not real at all. Jennifer L. Pozner, a media critic and author of “Reality Bites Back: The Troubling Truth About Guilty Pleasure TV,” said that reality producers go to fantastic lengths to manipulate contestants, denying them food and communication, plying them with alcohol and ultimately chopping up footage to make it look as if they have said and done things that they haven’t. “The contestants have zero ability to contribute narratives about themselves,” she said. There’s another camp that suggests that while the circumstances on most shows are contrived, the contestants’ emotional responses are deeply real. “The way we generate drama on reality TV is to put someone in the most extreme environment possible and then watch for their genuine reaction,” said Troy DeVolld, a longtime producer and the author of “Reality TV: An Insider’s Guide to TV’s Hottest Market.” In fact, he said, reality TV would be boring if that weren’t the case — the whole reason we watch is “we can tell how seriously everyone is taking what’s going on, even in the most absurd of circumstances.” I’m not here to adjudicate this debate. But I will point out that it matches the question at the heart of the Russian-influence saga: Did Russia’s trolls persuade Americans to act in ways that they wouldn’t have otherwise — or were they merely providing us a framework for expressing our deeply held political and social ideas? The answer is not obvious. On the one hand, it’s clear that there are cases — like the Houston protest — where the Russian campaign prompted real people to take real action in the real world. What’s less clear is whether we should discount those protesters’ actions and emotions simply because they were influenced by a Russian Facebook campaign. After all, both sides were genuinely angry about the mosque; whoever inspired the campaign, their feelings weren’t fake news. This happens on reality TV, too. Though everyone understands “The Bachelor” is contrived, there are “Bachelor” winners who have been married for more than a decade. At some point, reality TV becomes reality. This gets to what’s really pernicious about the Russian campaign. It so deftly blended artifice and reality — for so many people, across so many issues, in so many places — that it is impossible, now, for any of us to tell where reality and fakery begin and end. Is it the trolls’ world, or is it ours?",The New York Times
2017,What Red States Are Passing Up as Blue States Get Billions,"For years, red states have effectively been subsidizing part of health insurance for blue states. By declining to expand their Medicaid programs as part of the Affordable Care Act, many of those states have passed up tens of billions of federal dollars they could have used to offer health coverage to more poor residents. That means that taxpayers in Texas are helping to fund treatment for patients with opioid addiction in Vermont, while Texans with opioid problems may have no such option. Now new estimates prepared by the consulting firm Avalere Health for The Upshot give a sense of just how much states are giving up. Texas could collect around $42 billion in Medicaid over a decade if it opted in, according to the Avalere analysis. Tennessee could pull in around 5 percent of its state budget next year. Altogether, Avalere estimates that the 18 states that have still not expanded Medicaid could give up more than $180 billion over the next 10 years. Blue states generally subsidize red states, so this a notable counterexample to the overall trend. “They are leaving a lot of money on the table that would cover a lot of people, full stop,” said Chris Sloan, a senior manager at Avalere who helped build the model. Every state is required to provide Medicaid coverage to certain groups: poor children and pregnant women, people with disabilities, and poor older people requiring long-term care. But the Obamacare expansion provides coverage for many poor parents and childless adults who were less often covered in the program. The health law provides federal funding for states to include all residents who earn below or just above the federal poverty line — the limit is about $16,000 for a single person. In the first three years of the expansion, the federal government paid 100 percent of the tab. But now states need to chip in a small share to cover the expansion population’s medical bills. That share, 5 percent this year, is set to rise to 10 percent in 2020. Some state governments and local think tanks have prepared estimates of the costs and benefits of Medicaid expansion in their region. But the Avalere analysis is the first to apply a consistent methodology across all of the states that have declined to expand. Some of the numbers are big. Florida would get an estimated $26 billion over the next decade, according to Avalere; North Carolina $13 billion. The Medicaid expansion has been the subject of substantial scholarly attention. Strong evidence suggests states’ expansion has helped improve the financial health of their low-income residents, as well as the financial performance of local hospitals. Studies also show that Medicaid coverage has helped low-income Americans get access to health care, though there is not yet strong evidence about whether it has improved their physical health. Research has found that the Medicaid expansion does not appear to discourage low-income people from working. More speculative articles have suggested that the influx of federal dollars may help strengthen state economies, though there is little hard evidence of such effects. Governors in expansion states have argued that the money has been particularly helpful in helping residents battle addictions to opioids. A recent study found that, in the early years of the expansion, there were no hidden costs to state budgets — and that states spent no more on their programs than states that declined to expand. In some states, it appears that expansion has improved state finances, by reducing the need for programs that pay doctors and hospitals directly for uncompensated care, among other ancillary effects. There is evidence that Medicaid expansion has lowered insurance premiums for middle-class residents who buy their own insurance. Some states are likelier to come out ahead than others. Benjamin Sommers, an associate professor at the Harvard School of Public Health who studies Medicaid, said Wisconsin, for example, might actually save money over all if it accepted federal expansion dollars. But legislators and governors in the holdout states have consistently opposed the expansion, citing a range of political, ideological and fiscal concerns. One big issue, experts say, is the expansion’s link to Obamacare, a law that Republicans have vowed to repeal from the beginning. “It’s made it very hard for them to turn around and embrace one of the only optional parts of it,” said Matt Salo, the executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, who has closely watched the debate. “There is ample evidence from the states that have done it that there is substantial benefit.” Some state officials also object to a program that provides benefits to poor residents who don’t work. Studies have shown that the large majority of expansion beneficiaries are working, in school or caring for a sick family member. But the Trump administration has signaled that it will allow states to condition coverage on “community engagement activities,” a policy change that could interest some reluctant politicians. For some states, finding 10 percent of the dollars may be a challenge. David Dzielak, the Medicaid director in Mississippi, a state that has not expanded, said raising even a small fraction of the funding would be hard, especially after recent corporate tax cuts. The Avalere numbers suggest that the 6 percent of Medicaid expansion costs that Mississippi would need to pay if it expanded next year would represent less than 1 percent of its 2016 general fund spending. “It’s all about the money, really, and our state is so poor that we can’t even afford the 10 percent for the expansion,” he said. “That’s really the bottom line.” But not every state that has expanded its program has been wealthy, and some of those have been red states. Louisiana, for example, expanded Medicaid last year, providing health coverage to around 430,000 people, despite limited fiscal capacity and state budget challenges. Some of the largest coverage gains have come in poorer states, including West Virginia, Arkansas and Kentucky. Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health policy at George Washington University, said states generally fight to maximize federal funding for their programs. She described Medicaid expansion as a striking counterexample, where political preferences have sometimes outweighed the desire for resources. “It’s so much revenue,” she said. “That’s when you know we’re not dealing with dollars and cents.” Medicaid expansion states could keep growing. Voters in Maine last week approved a ballot measure to expand Medicaid. And recent legislative gains by Democrats in Virginia could change the politics of the issue there. Activists in other states, including Kansas, Utah and Idaho, are mobilizing for a renewed expansion push in the coming year. *** The Avalere estimates are rough, but they show what would happen if each state’s expansion resulted in a decrease in the uninsured rate among low-income residents that is similar to the average decrease in states that have already expanded their programs. The model then made adjustments for the size of the poor, uninsured population, and the different costs of providing Medicaid care in different states. In the states that have expanded already, there has been a wide range of effects. The uninsured rate among the eligible population declined by only half a percentage point in Massachusetts, which already had very broad insurance coverage. But it declined by more than six percentage points in Louisiana, where there were many more poor residents who lacked coverage. The average reduction was 2.5 percentage points. Most of the states that haven’t expanded are likely to reap more federal dollars than these estimates if they expand, said Mr. Sloan, but analysts felt the average number was a useful, conservative estimate. (That means that our figures may also understate the amount of money that states would need to spend, too.) Our budget numbers are for the fiscal year 2016, and come from a recent survey from the National Association of State Budget Officers. In evaluating the budget impact of the federal share of Medicaid expansion, we compared estimated federal spending with total state budgets, including current federal dollars. In evaluating the state share of the expansion funding, we compared the numbers to state general funds, to give a sense of how the program would compare with functions that the state raises its own funds to cover. State budgets typically grow by around 3 or 4 percent a year, said John Hicks, the association’s executive director, so our percentages may slightly overstate Medicaid expansion funding as a share of state budgets.",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | What Russian Revolution?,"Editorial Observer Most countries have an unpredictable future; Russia has an unpredictable past. That old chestnut has cropped up often this year as the Kremlin has struggled to find an appropriate official way to mark the 100th anniversary of the 1917 Russian Revolution. Manipulating history for political ends is not unusual — see the Trump administration and the Civil War. But in Russia, invoking history has long been a way of proclaiming political or ideological affiliation. The “Great October Socialist Revolution” was the founding myth of the Soviet Union; Nov. 7 (Oct. 25 on the old Russian calendar), the date of the uprising that brought the Bolsheviks to power, was the national holiday, on which tanks, missiles and high-stepping soldiers swept through Red Square. The history of the revolution — and of the czarist past, and for that matter of the entire world — was written to fit the myth of Soviet Russia as the vanguard of civilization, and woe to those who tampered with the official version. Unless they were the guardians of the official version, to whom it fell now and again to rewrite and update that history — like when Stalin went abruptly from demigod to footnote. The end of the Soviet Union in 1991 set history adrift. The collapse of a totalitarian dictatorship that had overthrown an absolute monarchy forced Russians to confront a painful task of choosing what to glorify, what to condemn, and what to gloss over. Impassioned debates over what role of “liberalism,” “democracy” or “elections” might have had a century ago are really about today. Those who pine for a powerful state, President Vladimir Putin among them, have come to blame Lenin for the territorial costs he incurred for quitting the war with Germany and to credit Stalin with putting it together again (until it was dismantled anew by Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin). The last czar, Nicholas II, is alternately seen as a weak master who either foolishly allowed the autocracy to founder or who failed to ride with a democratizing tide. The Russian Orthodox Church has canonized him as martyr of an idealized, God-fearing past. The fall of Communism is the onset of freedom for some, the collapse of empire for others, and simply irrelevant to many Russians under 35, who, according to public opinion polls, simply don’t know much about 1917. The revolution doesn’t fit comfortably into any of the competing narratives. The very concept of “revolution,” sanctified in Soviet mythology, changed radically after the chaos and impoverishment of the 1990s, until today the overwhelming majority of the Russian population, across all categories, declare that “whatever happens, a revolution in the country cannot be allowed.” That, too, is a sentiment Mr. Putin fully shares, though his reason may be less a fear of chaos than of losing power the way his Ukrainian neighbors did in their “color revolutions.” The history Mr. Putin has sought to write is one in which his Russia is a continuation of a great and powerful Russian state that has existed over the centuries, under the czars and the Bolsheviks. In this vision, revolution is a foreign-instigated setback. The chairman of the official Russian Historical Society, Sergei Naryshkin, who is also head of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, said as much when he spoke to the organizing committee charged with the 100th anniversary of the revolution about “those centers, primarily beyond the ocean, where the decisions to fund coups d’état are made.” The Kremlin could not simply gloss over the Russian Revolution, so Mr. Putin has played it down. The official government order for commemorations referred only to “the revolution of 1917 in Russia” — not Great, or Russian, or Socialist, or October, or any other adjective that would imply glorification or disparagement. And the lesson Mr. Putin stressed was the need for reconciliation — “the strengthening of the social, political and civic consensus that we have managed to achieve today.” No major national events were scheduled. The official silence doesn’t mean there’s been no excitement in this jubilee year. A movie called “Matilda,” about a relationship between Nicholas II when he was still heir to the throne and a dancer named Matilda Kshesinskaya, set off a nationwide furor long before it was released. One legislator demanded that it be banned for demeaning the image of a sainted czar, Orthodox Christian extremists tried to set fire to a theater showing it in Yekaterinburg, where the czar’s family was killed, and the premiere last month required heavy security. There’s no controlling the past.",The New York Times
2017,What States Can Learn From One Another on Health Care,"Some have made large improvements in certain areas. What have they done to get better? We know that where you live matters: There are huge disparities in health and costs across the country. The uninsured rate in Texas is six times higher than in Massachusetts. You’re four times more likely to be readmitted to the hospital in Maryland or New Jersey than in Hawaii. One-third of low-income adults in Texas forgo medical care because of cost, but only 9 percent in Vermont do. Alaska spends twice as much on health care per person as Utah does. If all states were to improve to the level of top performers, we’d see gains across the country: 20 million more people insured and 14 million fewer skipping care because of cost; 12 million more adults screened for cancer and 500,000 more children vaccinated; 124,000 fewer hospital readmissions and 90,000 fewer premature deaths. How can we get there? Although it’s important to learn from states at the top, it’s perhaps more instructive to see what states with large improvements are doing, or have done, to get better. Health care is perhaps the area most consistently recognized as ripe for state-based policy innovation, in keeping with the ideal of states as laboratories of democracy. Nearly all recent health reform proposals, especially from Republicans, focus on granting states greater flexibility to design and manage their health systems. Seema Verma, the director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has promised to give states an “unprecedented level of flexibility” to devise their Medicaid programs, including the option to impose work requirements. Senators Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray have put forth a plan to make it easier for states to get federal waivers to reshape their health systems. There are good reasons to pursue such a strategy. States have markedly different populations with varying needs, resources and cultures — and systems that work well in one state may not work well in another. But what do we know about how states use health policy freedom? One fundamental challenge in the Obamacare insurance marketplaces is that a few very sick patients can increase premiums for everyone, especially in states with small individual markets. To address this problem, Alaska applied for a Section 1332 waiver to expand its reinsurance program, which brings in federal funds to cover costs for people with particularly expensive conditions. Alaska thus “reinsures” its insurers for high-cost patients, and prevents those costs from being passed on to healthier people. Because premiums don’t rise as steeply, the federal government pays out less in premium subsidies — keeping the program deficit-neutral. The waiver is expected to lower premiums by 20 percent in 2018, and insure nearly 1,500 additional Alaskans. Minnesota recently received a similar waiver, and several other states are exploring their own reinsurance programs. Prices for health care services vary widely across the United States with little relation to quality. The price of an M.R.I., for example, is 12 times higher in the most expensive markets than in the least expensive ones, and can vary by a factor of nine even within the same area. In 2011, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (Calpers) changed how it paid for common procedures, a move that drastically reduced prices and saved the state millions. Before the initiative, prices for knee and hip replacements ranged from $15,000 to $100,000 with no difference in quality. That’s when Calpers introduced reference pricing — meaning it set an upper limit on how much it would pay for a given procedure, and patients would pay the rest. For example, Calpers would pay up to $30,000 for knee or hip surgery at 41 acceptable-quality hospitals, defined by measures like infection and readmission rates. Patients could still go wherever they wanted, but would have to cover the additional cost of a high-priced hospital. The results were impressive. Referrals to lower-priced hospitals increased by nearly 20 percent. The average price of the procedures dropped to about $26,000 from $35,000 — driven primarily by hospitals not initially included, and hoping to compete. There was no change in how well patients did or how much they paid out of pocket. California saved $5.5 million on knee and hip operations in the first two years. It also saved $7 million on colonoscopies, $1.3 million on cataract operations, and $2.3 million on arthroscopies. Prices fell by about 20 percent for each procedure. The United States has one of the highest infant mortality rates among wealthy nations — and does worse than even many poorer countries like Cuba and Belarus. Mississippi’s infant mortality rate puts it on par with Botswana and Bahrain. The infant mortality rate in the U.S. is nearly three times higher than in Finland or Japan. Georgia, which recently had one of the highest infant mortality rates in the country, has had perhaps the largest improvement in the past decade. The state has taken a three-pronged approach to the problem. First, it began a Safe to Sleep campaign to educate parents and health care providers about putting babies on their backs to sleep, in a separate bed, free of loose bedding or soft objects. The Department of Public Health developed “hot-spot” maps to focus the campaign on six areas with the highest infant mortality. Second, based on research suggesting that short intervals between births lead to poorer outcomes, Georgia introduced a program to expand access to long-acting reversible contraception (LARC). The state received a Medicaid waiver so it could be reimbursed for LARC insertion immediately after births in the hospital, overcoming a major barrier to broader LARC use among low-income women. Finally, Georgia aimed to reduce early elective deliveries, which increase the risk of feeding, breathing and developmental problems, by changing its reimbursement policy so that non-medically necessary inductions and cesarean sections before 39 weeks of gestation would no longer be covered. There’s much to learn from state-level innovations, but there are also general principles that apply across states. High-performing states have competitive and accessible insurance markets; strategies for data-sharing and health information technology expansion; more value-based purchasing; greater emphasis on primary care; and strong partnerships with community organizations. They also expand Medicaid. It’s also important to note that many state-level policy changes do not require federal approval, and that states don’t always use their flexibility to improve population health. Proposals that allow states to weaken protections for those with pre-existing conditions, for example, could harm patients and their ability to access care. Greater flexibility for states is an opportunity, not a solution. The enormous variation in quality, costs and access across the nation should remind us that experiments succeed and experiments fail. Having laboratories is probably a good thing. But it depends on what they cook up.

2017,What Stereotypical Characters Make You Cringe?,"Student Opinion Do you or have you ever watched “The Simpsons”? If so, what do you think about the character Apu? In “You Love ‘The Simpsons’? Then Let’s Talk About Apu,” Robert Ito writes: “I hate Apu,” the actor Kal Penn says in a new documentary about the penny-pinching, Squishee-slinging, thickly accented convenience store owner on one of the most celebrated TV shows in history. “And because of that, I dislike ‘The Simpsons.’” The feelings of South Asian Americans toward the character and the show he inhabits are the focus of “The Problem with Apu,” a documentary making its debut Nov. 19 on truTV. The brainchild of the actor and standup comic Hari Kondabolu, a lifelong lover of “The Simpsons,” the film wrestles with how a show praised for its incisive humor — over the years, it has explored issues like homophobia and political corruption — could resort to such a charged stereotype. Making matters worse is the fact that the Indian character is voiced by a non-Indian (albeit an Emmy-winning) actor, Hank Azaria. “Everything with Apu is like this running joke,” Mr. Kondabolu, 35, said in a phone interview. “And the running joke is that he’s Indian.” Mr. Kondabolu, a son of Indian immigrants who grew up in Queens, knows all about the show’s history (the longest-running American sitcom), its many awards (32 Primetime Emmys), its international and adoring fan base. “I’m a comedian going after the biggest comedy show of all time,” he said. Students: Read the entire article, then tell us: — Do you think Hollywood’s portrayal of South Asian characters is problematic? What facts, anecdotes or other details from the article or your own experiences inform your opinion? — What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone? — Do you think calling attention to these stereotypes, like Hari Kondabolu is doing in his documentary about Apu, is worthwhile? Why or why not? — Should writers and filmmakers make an effort to more accurately represent people of different backgrounds? If so, how should they do this? If not, why not?

2017,"What Time Inc.’s Glory Days Looked Like, While an Uncertain Future Awaits","It might be the beginning of the end of one of the country’s most prestigious magazine publishers. Time Inc., which publishes titles like Time, People and Sports Illustrated, agreed on Sunday to sell itself to Meredith, a Midwestern publisher that had long courted the company. The deal is valued at nearly $3 billion — roughly the amount of revenue that Time Inc. brought in last year. Like many of its competitors, Time Inc. failed to keep pace with the industrywide transformation from print to digital platforms. Management disagreements and cost cuts in the first decade of this century led to high-profile departures that bled the company of talent and left it without a clear succession plan. Now the nearly 100-year-old company must turn to its new owner, a publisher known for magazines like Better Homes & Gardens, to chart a path for its future — a future that will perhaps not be built on the iconic photography, swimsuit models and ambitious journalism that helped Time Inc.’s titles become household names. According to the company, Time magazine began in 1922 with a simple proposition from its founders, Henry R. Luce and Briton Hadden. No magazine was tailored to the ever-busier reader who wished to stay informed. Time would aim to fill that void. Fortune magazine was formed in 1930. Then came Life, which made use of stunning photography to capture movie stars, world leaders and exotic, far-off places. Meredith, in some ways, is an unlikely match for Time. Its publications have delved into domestic life, generally shying away from current events, the entertainment industry or sports — the very subjects in which Time has trafficked. Time Inc. says it has more than 100 brands, ranging from Travel and Leisure magazine to video series produced for social media. When Meredith first considered buying Time in 2013, talks fell through because Meredith reportedly did not want to buy four of the best-known titles: Time, Fortune, Money and Sports Illustrated. It’s unclear what, if any, changes the company will make to the titles now. Meredith will inherit Life magazine’s vast trove of archival photos, some of the most iconic documents of the 20th century. They captured Pablo Picasso drawing a Minotaur in the air with a flashlight, Harry Truman playing the piano and Marilyn Monroe trying to hold down her white dress while standing on a subway grate. There are bullfighters, gamblers, and no small amount of war. But what Time offers now goes beyond its past. Aside from national reach with its print magazines, Time has invested heavily in video, and even purchased the advertising technology company that owns the social network Myspace. Will that be enough to help the company which in many ways defined the last century of American life rebound to become a crucial chronicler of this one? Meredith certainly hopes so.",The New York Times
2017,What Turns Black Friday Shoppers Into Raging Hordes?,"For the Black Friday faithful, the excitement begins on Thanksgiving, when eager shoppers line up outside big box and department stores for the chance to grab “doorbuster” sales and “prices slashed” merchandise when the doors open. Black Friday videos posted in recent years show shoppers shoving and shouting, with one temporary worker even trampled to death in 2008. What turns ordinary shoppers into dangerous mobs? Social scientists and psychologists are trying to find out. Sharron Lennon, a professor in the merchandising program at Indiana University, became interested in studying consumer misbehavior after seeing news reports a few years back about fights breaking out at her local mall. “Customers were physically fighting with each other,” she said. “People were taking things from other shoppers’ carts. It was chaos.” For a study published in The Clothing and Textiles Research Journal, she and her colleagues asked 189 Black Friday shoppers about their antics. Had they ever taken an item from another shopper’s cart, yelled at store workers, gotten into skirmishes with other customers or overturned racks of merchandise? Many of the participants, who were primarily female, white and well-educated, admitted to behaviors like trashing displays or yelling at employees. Dr. Lennon speculates that feelings of unfairness drove many of these shoppers to behave the way they did. Shopping and the retail-consumer relationship, she said, is expected to be an equitable exchange of a good for payment. Any violation of the exchange can evoke strong feelings of inequality. When a store failed to properly stock advertised “doorbusters,” when sale prices weren’t honored, such as being denied an early bird discount at checkout even though they were in line before the sale expired, or when they failed to obtain an advertised item or failed to receive the discounts they anticipated, Black Friday shoppers were most likely to misbehave. In a follow-up study, Dr. Lennon surveyed 267 Black Friday shoppers and found that those who felt other customers were being “unpleasant” were more likely to feel the store was being unfair — and were more likely to become uncivil themselves. Examples of “unpleasant” behavior among fellow shoppers included line cutting, arguing with police or security officers, or acting rudely toward others. “The more they perceived the retailer situation to be inequitable, the more consumer misbehavior they displayed,” Dr. Lennon said. Perceptions of scarcity are also a driving factor in consumer misbehavior, said Bridget Nichols, an associate professor of marketing and sports business at Northern Kentucky University. When consumers feel a product is scarce, they value it more. And Black Friday is designed to offer limited amounts of products for a limited amount of time, thus heightening the sense of urgency, she said. In her research, Dr. Nichols has found that scarcity sparks “consumer competitive arousal,” the belief that a consumer situation is a competition in which there are potential “winners” and “losers.” Similar feelings arise at auctions, she said. “People want to feel they got a good deal,” she said. Competitive arousal can be ignited by a perception that a specific good, such as a popular toy or flat-screen television, is in limited supply and available for only a short period of time. Dr. Nichols found in her research, for example, that video game consumers had a heightened competitive arousal after viewing advertisements that described a new game as scarce or in limited supply. “With Black Friday, those stampedes are driven by the emotions that are drawn from scarcity and competition,” Dr. Nichols said. Competitive arousal can bring about another emotional driver: bonding. Dr. Nichols has extensively studied the former “running of the brides” at Filene’s Basement stores in Atlanta, Chicago and Washington, in which designer bridal gowns were drastically reduced in price. At the event, brides-to-be, joined by friends or family members, teamed up to grab as many dresses as possible for the bride to consider. “In the beginning, they expressed the mind-set that they wanted to ‘win,’ by finding a $5,000 dress for $300,” Dr. Nichols said. “But in the end, the dress became ancillary. The experience was about competing and bonding together.” Sharing the Black Friday ritual with friends and family can create a similar sense of tribal bonding, Dr. Nichols said, and reinforce bad behavior. In one of her ‘running of the brides’ studies, the shoppers revealed how they hoarded as many dresses as possible, and negotiated trades with other shopping teams in which they misrepresented the value of the gown they gave away. “Some admitted, ‘I was walking by a group of girls and they weren’t looking, so I took three of their dresses,’” Dr. Nichols said. “They felt like it was part of the game and it was acceptable to do these things. They thought, ‘I competed well.’” Black Friday shoppers too, Dr. Nichols said, may exhibit a similarly heightened sense of competition that can lead to such behaviors as shoving other shoppers or taking goods from another customer’s cart. Such behavior is similarly perceived as a way to “win.” A study in The Journal of Global Fashion Marketing found that Black Friday shoppers, perhaps not surprisingly, reported great pleasure in shopping. They were more attracted to the “hedonistic” atmosphere than those who opted to stay away from stores on that day. Indeed, Dr. Nichols, who was not involved in that study, noted that many Black Friday spectators are attracted to the excitement of the scene. With both spectators and shoppers descending on stores, Dr. Nichols said that stores need to have a plan for handling crowds and reducing violence. “Stores want people to come and get excited,” she said. Unfortunately, all too often, many “don’t consider what might happen.” For shoppers who are planning to join the Black Friday crowds, she advises being mindful of competitive emotions that can build when an item is perceived to be in short supply. “Whatever the ‘scarce’ thing is, it will likely be in abundance come January,” Dr. Nichols said, noting that Hatchimals, the must-have toy of 2016, were in short supply before the holidays but became widely available just a few weeks later. “Just remind yourself that no special deal is worth getting hurt over or hurting someone else,” she said.",The New York Times
2017,What War Can’t Destroy,"the look Years of conflict have torn at the seams of Juba, South Sudan. But the city’s people hold their heads high. In South Sudan, street photography is essentially illegal. It is another casualty of the civil war. Young, fit, twitchy soldiers are everywhere, ready to crack down on anyone who pulls out a camera. No reasons are ever given and no laws are on the books specifically banning photography, but security services across the country have arrested photographers and roughed them up for taking even the most innocent pictures, like a shot of women baking bread. It wasn’t always like this, but in the four years since the war broke out, scattering millions of people and unleashing unspeakable horrors, the South Sudanese government has become incredibly suspicious. In a country that has ripped itself apart by internecine conflict, anyone can be the enemy. Stepping off a plane in Juba, the capital, you feel this tight-shouldered tension immediately. Sara Hylton, a Canadian documentary photographer who came here on assignment in August, had anticipated the hostility. What surprised her was the city’s bold style. Amid all the shot-up buildings, fear and danger, she was struck by the great pride many South Sudanese take in how they look. She saw women in bright print dresses and chunky brass jewelry; some wore purple hair extensions. Men sported bleached dreads and sharply cut suits. There was a fearless sense of style that the war had not managed to kill off.It wasn’t easy for Ms. Hylton to capture it because she couldn’t take pictures in public. She had to work off the streets, in safe spaces, in people’s homes, their backyards, their tiny, tidy shops. Sometimes, Ms. Hylton found, the nicer the space, the sadder the experience. Many South Sudanese carry their trauma quietly, and ​those who were trying to will away all the brutality and destruction around them seemed the most vulnerable. They were emotionally exposed in a place where so many dreams have been crushed. Winnie, who runs a small boutique that sells dresses, purses and one or two paintings, seemed to be swimming upstream. The war has sunk Juba’s economy, and for the two hours Ms. Hylton spent in Winnie’s immaculate shop, where so much thought had been invested into every detail, not a single customer walked in. “If I was living in this environment, I would have given up,” Ms. Hylton said. “That was the biggest surprise — that people here hadn’t given up, there was still so much hope.”But there was also still so much sadness. It wasn’t always obvious, but it was there. As Ms. Hylton said: When you interview people, they often put on a brave face and tell you what you want to hear. But when you take out a camera and ask someone to stare into the lens, it’s different. An honesty is revealed. She especially felt this when making a portrait of Wokil, a comedian. “His posture was very cool, he was trying to be very cool,” she said. “But you could tell he lived through some of the worst stuff.” “Loss, I recognized loss,” she said. “It was in his gaze.” Just about everyone Ms. Hylton approached in Juba (she stayed away from soldiers) was willing to be photographed, including a group of young men playing basketball behind a primary school. If South Sudan has anything, it has height; the Dinka and the Nuer, South Sudan’s two largest ethnic groups, are considered among the tallest people on Earth. And basketball is the sport here, maybe even a ticket out. The former N.B.A. player Manute Bol, who died in 2010, grew up herding cattle in South Sudan and then made millions. Most of it he gave away, to South Sudanese rebels fighting for freedom. For as long as anyone can remember, life in South Sudan has revolved around war. That’s as true today as ever. The endless military checkpoints across Juba and the marauding soldiers who prowl around every neighborhood make it impossible to go out at night. So young South Sudanese have found a way to do what young people do the world over, just slightly differently. They pack into dark buildings during the bright, hot hours to groove to hip-hop and rap. These places are called “day clubs” (as opposed to nightclubs), and they allow Juba’s youth to hang out, meet strangers, dance, drink and forget for a moment what lies outside the club’s doors. Crazy Fox, a popular dancehall artist, fled South Sudan for Uganda as a refugee. But after four years, he was “tired of running” and recently came home. But home for the South Sudanese is a place they themselves broke. South Sudan is the world’s newest country, having won its hard-fought independence from Sudan in 2011. Two years later, a political dispute between Dinka and Nuer leaders in Juba blew up into a full-scale military conflict between Dinka and Nuer across the country. The war keeps spreading, engulfing other ethnic groups and new areas. It has killed more than 50,000 people, destroyed oil wells, farms, schools and hospitals, and sucked in countless children as child soldiers and then spat them out dead or mutilated. Many people fear what is ahead. It is etched in faces all across Juba. Still, as death goes on, life goes on. Routine is a refuge, and many South Sudanese are trying to reclaim their lives. Ms. Hylton spent hours in barbershops and in salons where hair extensions hung on the walls like tools at a hardware shop. “When you come to Galaxy salon, we can change you,” said the owner, Nadia Tushabe, with more than a touch of pride. It may be hard to believe that a country where the per capita income is around three dollars a day, where three quarters of adults can’t read and a 15-year-old girl has a higher chance of dying in childbirth than she does of finishing primary school, has any fashion or beauty industry at all. But it beats on, fragilely, in packed little houses and tin-walled kiosks lit by a single bulb. “We don’t have something distinguishing us,” said Juana, a fashion designer. Her patterns are intensely colorful, and she hopes fashion can bridge the poisonous divides between ethnic groups. Akuja de Garang is, after the model Alex Wek, one of the best-known names in South Sudanese fashion. Large brass jewelry and black nail polish are her signatures. Before the war, she used to organize fashion shows. “Culturally people take pride in how they look,” she said. War or not, the South Sudanese are like anyone else. They want to look good. Jeffrey Gettleman was, until recently, The Times’s East Africa bureau chief. He writes more about style and conflict in his new memoir, “Love, Africa.” The International Women's Media Foundation supported Sara Hylton's reporting in Juba, South Sudan. An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified the nationality of the musician Diamond. He is Tanzanian, not Ugandan.",The New York Times
2017,What Was the Two-Way Pager?,"Yesterday In Styles In which we look back at our own rough drafts of history. The New York Times headline: “A World Divided Into Two-Way Pager Camps” (see it in context). Published on: January 14, 2001. The story: Near the dawn of the texting era, we noted that a tech-device culture war broke out between establishment types (Al Gore, Bill Gates, Michael Dell), who favored the no-nonsense BlackBerry, and members of the celebrity A-list (Star Jones, Russell Simmons, Carson Daly), who flocked to the colorful, youth-friendly Motorola two-way pager. Why was it published then? Six years before the debut of the iPhone, Motorola’s clamshell pager was a hot new gadget, with a million users and a growing cachet among “members of the African-American elite in entertainment and sports.” They seemed to find that “the cellphone is so last millennium.” Proof: Jay-Z name-checked his Motorola pager in his single “I Just Wanna Love U (Give It 2 Me).” What were the caveats? Pamela Anderson, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were all members of the “elite in entertainment” — but still also happened to use BlackBerrys. Unanswered questions: Star Jones, who was “camped out in her usual seat in celebrity row, courtside at a New York Knicks game in Madison Square Garden,” received “a message from Derek Jeter, asking for the game’s score.” Did Mr. Jeter not have internet access in 2001? (Only about 40 percent of United States households did.) How badly did he need to know that Knicks score? How well did this situation age? Celebrities and regular people alike eventually decided that thumb-typing personal messages to each other on electronic devices had no future, so they abandoned the practice entirely. (Kidding!) Where can I get a two-way Motorola pager now? On Amazon, of course. Used, they start at $59.99.",The New York Times
2017,What We Learned in N.F.L. Week 11: Eagles are Scary Good,"A convincing victory for an emerging powerhouse, a gutsy overtime win for a streaking team, and a blowout in Mexico were among the highlights of an action-packed Week 11. Here is what we learned: ■ The Eagles only need one good half to win. Philadelphia was down 9-7 at halftime, and looked atrocious on offense, but they reeled off 30 consecutive points in the second half, thoroughly demolishing the Dallas Cowboys. That they could waste 30 minutes of football and still come away with their eighth consecutive win made the Eagles seem almost unbeatable. ■ The Vikings are not collapsing. Last year Minnesota got off to a 5-0 start, but a 3-8 finish kept them from making the playoffs. With a huge 24-7 victory against the equally impressive Los Angeles Rams, the Vikings won their sixth game in a row, improved to 8-2 and may have settled their quarterback situation, with Case Keenum once again looking more like a solution than a problem. ■ Running the ball is nice, but so is having Drew Brees at quarterback. The New Orleans Saints have enjoyed a recent emphasis on the run, letting Mark Ingram and Alvin Kamara carry them to several victories during a long winning streak. But with the team down by 15 points in the fourth quarter against Washington, it was Brees and the passing game that remarkably tied things up. Brees was happy to share the load, though, as he let Ingram take care of business in overtime, getting the Saints the yardage they needed for a game-winning field goal and an eighth consecutive win. ■ The Patriots can play terrific defense (against the Raiders). New England has had its issues on defense this season, but it showed improvement in recent weeks and looked stunningly dominant while humiliating Oakland’s attempts at scoring before garbage time. Two turnovers and almost no penalties — and some terrific offense from Tom Brady, of course — were key in a blowout win. ■ Nathan Peterman was not a good choice at quarterback. The Buffalo Bills were embarrassed at home by the Saints last week, and despite being in line for a playoff spot, they responded to their defense’s falling apart by benching Tyrod Taylor, their starting quarterback. Peterman attempted just 14 passes and threw five interceptions before the team switched back to Taylor, who had had just three interceptions in nine starts before he was benched. ■ Some breaks are going the Lions’ way. Detroit got off to a 3-4 start this season, but the losses came with head-scratching moments of terrible luck and agonizingly narrow scoring margins. In the Lions’ third consecutive win, they got a go-ahead field goal with 1 minute 35 seconds left, then escaped when Connor Barth missed a 46-yard field-goal attempt for Chicago. Detroit has a huge division game against N.F.C.-North-leading Minnesota on Thursday. After a first half to forget, the Philadelphia Eagles offense woke up in the second half and clobbered the Dallas Cowboys in a 37-9 blowout on Sunday night. The Eagles offense scored on three consecutive possessions in the second half, and the defense added a touchdown after a strip sack. Forced to play without a kicker for the majority of the game, the Eagles repeatedly went for 2-point conversions, and the outrageous scoring spree resulted in Philadelphia scoring 30 consecutive points. The turnaround in the game was extreme, as the Eagles had gone into halftime trailing the Cowboys, 9-7. Carson Wentz had completed just 7 of 18 passes, the team’s running backs had combined for 35 yards. If not for a herculean effort by the team’s defense, they would have trailed by more. After his rough first half, Wentz ended up completing 14 of 27 passes for 168 yards and two touchdowns, while Jay Ajayi, LeGarrette Blount and Corey Clement were the key pieces of a running game that produced 215 yards and two touchdowns. In an on-field interview after the game, Wentz credited his team’s offensive line with the surge in scoring. “The big boys up front kinda came out angry,” Wentz said. “We ran the ball in the second half really effectively and it was fun to be out there tonight.” Dallas, on the other hand, was playing without its stalwart left tackle, Tyron Smith, or the team’s top offensive player, Ezekiel Elliott, and their absence was obvious. Quarterback Dak Prescott was repeatedly under pressure and rushed into bad throws, leading to three interceptions. Adding in the fumble, Prescott had four turnovers overall, while completing 18 of 31 passes for 145 yards. Alfred Morris, who was filling in for Elliott, did a decent job in terms of production, with 17 carries for 91 yards, but he could not replicate the fear that Elliott instills in opposing defenses, letting the Eagles’ fantastic front-seven target Prescott all game. It was not all good news for the Eagles, however, as the team lost its kicker, Jake Elliott, to a head injury sustained when he made a tackle on the opening kickoff of the game. His status for next week’s home game against the Chicago Bears is unknown, but with Philadelphia having improved to an N.F.L.-best 9-1, they have plenty to be happy about while monitoring the Elliott situation. The New England Patriots remained undefeated outside of the United States, beating the Oakland Raiders by a score of 33-8 in a game in which they were never challenged. The game was a laugher from the start, as Tom Brady added Mexico to the list of countries where he’s thrown a touchdown pass, and then added two more for good measure. The Patriots built a 17-0 lead over the Oakland Raiders at halftime and then tacked on another 16 in the second half at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City. Brady, who had already thrown touchdown passes in the United States and England, was at his best, completing his first 12 passes, and 30 of 37 overall, while throwing for 339 yards. Highlights included a pair of 50-plus-yard passes to Brandin Cooks, including a 64-yard touchdown, to go with shorter touchdowns to Dion Lewis and Danny Amendola. Cooks finished the day with six receptions for 149 yards. Brady was his typical reserved self during a postgame news conference, but he acknowledged that Mexico City’s elevation made it easy to loft long passes to his receivers down the field, which Cooks took full advantage of. “Cookie got by them a few times deep,” Brady said. “Any time you make big plays you can skip 10 plays and hit one big one and that’s really important.” New England got plenty of help from their defense, which looked nothing like the struggling unit that had been the team’s weak link all season. They allowed 344 total yards, but snuffed out any promising drives until the game was well out of hand. The score was 30-0 before the Patriots took their collective feet off the gas. Perhaps the defense’s best moment came on a head’s up play from Duran Harmon, a safety, who was sprinting over to help in coverage against Johnny Holton and ended up with an interception when Holton tipped the ball into the air. Later in the first half, they got a huge turnover on a fumble, when Seth Roberts of the Raiders caught a pass near New England’s goal line, but was spun around and had the ball punched out by Trey Flowers. Patriots kicker Stephen Gostkowski made a 62-yard field goal in the first half. The Patriots, who trained at altitude all week to deal with the 7,200-foot elevation of Estadio Azteca, improved to 8-2 and will host the Miami Dolphins in New England next week.

The Buffalo Bills made the unusual choice this week to switch quarterbacks in the middle of the season despite being in line for a playoff spot. It didn’t work out. The first game of the Nathan Peterman Era did not go well, as the rookie picked in the fifth round of this year’s draft threw five interceptions and was down 40-7 against the Los Angeles Chargers when he was taken out for Tyrod Taylor, the quarterback he had replaced in the starting lineup. The Chargers went on to steamroll the Bills, 54-24. In his first career start, Peterman completed 6 of 14 passes for 66 yards, with Buffalo’s only touchdown of the game was on a run by LeSean McCoy. The switch to Peterman shocked many considering Buffalo’s recent cold streak had largely been caused by the team’s defense struggling to stop the run, rather than any issues with Taylor, who has been a solid, though unspectacular, starting quarterback for the last three seasons. Last week the Bills allowed 298 rushing yards and six rushing touchdowns against New Orleans, and toward the end of the game the Bills put Peterman in to see if he would have any better luck moving the ball. He completed 7 of 10 passes. After Sean McDermott, the Bills coach, expressed confidence in Taylor on Monday, the team announced on Wednesday that Peterman would start against San Diego. After a dramatic 15-point comeback by the New Orleans Saints in the game’s final five minutes of regulation, the team finished the job in overtime when Will Lutz hit a 28-yard field goal that sealed a 34-31 victory over the Washington Redskins. The win was New Orleans’ eighth in a row and may have been their most impressive game in the long streak considering how well they responded to the adversity of being outgunned by Kirk Cousins and the Redskins for three-and-a-half quarters. In an on-field interview after the game, a fired-up Mark Ingram praised the entire team, while setting a fairly high goal for the team going forward. “Offense was confident in the defense, defense was confident in the offense, everybody was confident in the special teams,” Ingram said, “and we did it. That’s what championship teams do.” The Redskins came out of the gate playing aggressively on both sides of the ball, and they took a 31-16 win with just under six minutes remaining when Cousins hit Jeremy Sprinkle for a 7-yard touchdown pass, which was Cousins’s third touchdown pass of the game. But Brees, who had ceded much of the team’s offense to his running backs in recent weeks, and started the game with an interception on the opening drive — one of two he threw in the game — took over when things mattered the most. He completed 29 of 41 passes for 385 yards, with two fourth quarter touchdown passes, the second of which went to Alvin Kamara, which along with Kamara’s 2-point conversion erased Washington’s lead. In overtime, the Redskins got the ball first but were forced to punt. Brees handed the ball off to Ingram twice, and the power back rumbled for a combined 51 yards, setting up Lutz’s game-winning kick. In a battle between two surprising N.F.C. teams, the Minnesota Vikings took care of business at home, beating the Los Angeles Rams, 24-7. Much of the talk coming into the game had focused on the offenses of the two teams, but in the first half it was defense vs. defense, with the scored tied 7-7 at halftime, thanks to a key turnover by Los Angeles that prevented a score late in the second quarter. It was a different game in the second half when Minnesota found enough cracks in the Los Angeles defense to come away with the team’s sixth consecutive win. Case Keenum, who is still essentially playing for his job on a week-to-week basis thanks to the presence of Teddy Bridgewater, completed 27 of 38 passes for 280 yards. His biggest pass of the game came on a 65-yard catch-and-run to Adam Thielen early in the fourth quarter that opened up a 14-point lead, and he was aided greatly by the absence of Rams cornerback Kayvon Webster, who left with a concussion. With Webster out, Thielen had a mismatch against Dominique Hatfield, and was off to the races. The rest of Minnesota’s scoring was taken care of by Latavius Murray, who carried the ball 15 times for 95 yards and two touchdowns, and Kai Forbath who went one for three on field goal attempts. Los Angeles, which came into the game as the highest scoring offense in the N.F.L., scored on their opening drive, but managed just 254 total yards for the game thanks to a so-so effort from Jared Goff and a disappearing act by Todd Gurley. Gurley carried the ball 15 times for 37 yards, and on a key drive in the fourth quarter he was given the ball on both 2nd-and-1 and 3rd-and-1 and failed to keep his team’s drive alive, getting knocked for a loss on second run by the ageless Terence Newman, who is still making plays for Minnesota in his 15th season. But the key play in the game, in terms of momentum, came late in the second quarter when Goff found Cooper Kupp for a 10-yard reception that got the rookie wide receiver all the way to the Minnesota 1-yard line. At the tail end of the play, the Vikings’ Anthony Harris reached in and stripped the ball out of Kupp’s hands and then recovered it for the game’s only turnover. The Rams never got close to scoring after that failure to punch the ball in. The loss by the Rams snapped a four-game winning streak. Roger Lewis Jr. made a spectacular catch to set up the winning 23-yard yard goal by Aldrick Rosas in overtime and the New York Giants responded from weeks of adversity to beat the A.F.C. West-leading Kansas City Chiefs 12-9 on a blustery, cold Sunday. The win snapped a three-game losing streak for the Giants (2-8) and sent the Chiefs (6-4) to their fourth loss in five games. The winning kick came two plays after Lewis was yanked to the ground on a deep pass from Eli Manning, but still caught the ball while flat on his back for a 34-yard completion on a fourth-down heave. Had he not caught it, flags flew for pass interference. It was an unexpected was for a team that came into the game in turmoil, with questions about the future of coach Ben McAdoo and many wondering whether the Giants had quit in one-sided losses to the Rams and then the winless 49ers in the past two weeks. — Associated Press The Baltimore Ravens forced five turnovers in their third shutout of the season, blanking the Green Bay Packers 23-0 Sunday. Baltimore last accomplished the feat when the Ray Lewis-led defense had four shutouts for the Super Bowl-winning team in 2000; the last N.F.L. team to have three was New England in 2003. Jimmy Smith, Eric Weddle and Marlon Humphrey each picked off passes for Baltimore (5-5), which led the N.F.L. in interceptions entering the weekend. But a problematic offense couldn’t generate a touchdown drive until Joe Flacco’s perfect deep ball to Mike Wallace over two defenders for a 13-point lead nearly two minutes into the third quarter. Flacco threw for 183 yards, going 22 of 28 with an interception. His lone touchdown pass was still enough of a cushion against a Packers team struggling without two-time MVP quarterback Aaron Rodgers, out with a broken collarbone. The Packers were last shut out on Nov. 19, 2006, when then-starter Brett Favre left with an elbow injury in the first half of a 35-0 loss to New England. Rodgers, then in his second year in the league, finished off that loss in relief. Matthew Stafford threw for 299 yards and two touchdowns, Matt Prater kicked a 52-yard field goal with 1:35 remaining and the Detroit Lions held on to beat the Chicago Bears 27-24 on Sunday. Detroit (6-4) took the lead after Tarik Cohen had tied it for Chicago (3-7) with a 15-yard touchdown run. Prater booted the winner after Stafford led a 42-yard drive to the 34. The Bears had a good chance to tie the game in the closing seconds, but Connor Barth was wide right on a 46-yarder. Stafford completed 21 of 31 passes. Marvin Jones Jr. had four receptions for 85 yards and a touchdown. D.J. Hayden ran back a fumbled snap for a touchdown to give Detroit seven return TDs this season, tying a team record. And the Lions beat the Bears for the eighth time in nine games. — Associated Press",The New York Times
2017,What We Learned in N.F.L. Week 9: What’s ‘Half a Hundred’ Times Two?,"The Philadelphia Eagles and the Los Angeles Rams showed just how great they can be, with each team channeling Barry Switzer by hanging “half a hundred” on their opponents. They were the two most impressive teams in an entertaining Week 9. Here is what we learned: ■ The 2016 N.F.L. draft was absolutely stacked. Jared Goff is leading the N.F.L.’s highest-scoring offense, Carson Wentz is leading the N.F.L.’s best team, Joey Bosa is a beast for the Los Angeles Chargers, Ezekiel Elliott is the game’s best pure running back, and Jalen Ramsey is a shutdown cornerback for Jacksonville. Tennessee and Cleveland look worse each and every week for having had top-five picks and trading down in that draft. ■ Dallas enjoyed one more week of the Dak and Zeke Show. Elliott’s six-game suspension may be enforced starting with next week’s game, but he was on the field this week, and he and Dak Prescott led the Cowboys to a third consecutive win. They were at their best in the second half, holding off a Chiefs team that seemed to have stolen the game’s momentum early in the third quarter. An interactive calculator that lets you explore every team’s path to the N.F.L. playoffs. ■ The Legion of Boom is not so scary anymore. For the second consecutive week, the secondary of the Seattle Seahawks looked highly vulnerable. The Seahawks may not have allowed 400 passing yards and four touchdowns as they did last week, but with a lead late in the game, they let the Redskins’ Kirk Cousins cover 69 yards on two passes, setting up Washington’s game-winning touchdown run. Playing without Earl Thomas certainly did not help. ■ Deshaun Watson will be sorely missed. Houston entered the week as the top-scoring team in the N.F.L., but in their first game without Watson, the Texans managed just one offensive touchdown and lost to the woeful Indianapolis Colts. ■ No one is immune from Atlanta’s Super Bowl hangover. Matt Ryan threw what looked like a perfect 39-yard touchdown pass to a wide-open Julio Jones, but Jones simply dropped it. It was hardly the only problem in the Falcons’ 20-17 loss to Carolina, but it was emblematic of the team’s difficult season. ■ Sometimes a call just truly gets blown. At the end of a skirmish in which A. J. Green of the Cincinnati Bengals repeatedly shoved and punched Jalen Ramsey of the Jacksonville Jaguars, both players were ejected. Replays showed that Ramsey had not punched back at Green, and the N.F.L. is in a difficult situation in which a player seems to be owed an apology even though his team held on to win. Here’s a look at what happened in N.F.L. Week 9: The Dallas Cowboys showed just how good the team can be with Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott at full-strength, as the duo led the team to a hard-fought 28-17 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs. Now they have to wait and see if their partnership will be broken up for the next several weeks. Elliott was on the field thanks to an appeals court briefly delaying his six-game suspension with an administrative stay, but it is expected that his fate for the next six games will be decided this week. The second-year running back took advantage of the unexpected start by rushing for 93 yards and a touchdown, helping complement a fine performance by Prescott, who threw for 249 yards and two touchdowns while running for another score, in the come-from-behind win. Prescott’s success came thanks to a pair of passing touchdowns to Cole Beasley, and a 141-yard day by Terrance Williams, as the team survived Dez Bryant leaving the game in the second half with an ankle injury. It looked for much of the first half like it would be a boring matchup between teams trying too hard to be careful, but things picked up dramatically in the last two minutes before halftime. Both teams scored in the final 13 seconds of the half, with Tyreek Hill of the Chiefs scoring an unbelievable 57-yard catch-and-run touchdown as time expired. Hill had at least five defenders between him and the end zone when he caught the ball, but he used his patience and game-changing speed to weave through the crowd, nearly untouched, for the score. Kansas City then opened the second half with another touchdown drive, which briefly gave them a 17-14 lead. From that point on, though, the game was all Dallas, as both the offense and defense found a higher gear. Their much-maligned secondary even managed to end Alex Smith’s season-long streak of passes without an interception when Jeff Heath stepped in front of a pass intended for Charcandrick West in the fourth quarter. Going forward, things could be truly complicated for Dallas. Elliott could be out for up to six weeks, the severity of Bryant’s injury is not known, and the Cowboys may be facing an extended stretch in which Prescott will be trying to keep the team’s playoff hopes alive with his primary offensive support coming from players like Darren McFadden, Alfred Morris and Beasley. With or without Elliott, Dallas will travel to Atlanta to face the struggling Falcons next week and then will host the red-hot Philadelphia Eagles in Week 11. Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson appeared to have secured his second consecutive comeback win with a dramatic touchdown pass in the game’s final minutes. Not to be outdone, Kirk Cousins put together one of the most impressive drives of his career, going 70 yards on just four plays to secure a 17-14 victory. Cousins did not throw a touchdown pass in the game, but his bold passes into Seattle’s secondary in the game’s final minutes were key to the shocking victory. The second long pass, a 38-yarder to Josh Doctson, set up Rob Kelley for a game-winning 1-yard touchdown run. Kelley’s two touchdowns accounted for most of the scoring for Washington, and the team survived the late surge by Wilson, who threw for 297 yards and rushed for 77. The Atlanta Falcons continue to struggle to hold onto leads. In what has become a dramatic Super Bowl hangover, the Falcons’ record dropped to 4-4 after a 20-17 loss to the Carolina Panthers in which they had a 10-0 lead until late in the second quarter. The Panthers worked their way back into the game with the team’s running game, and eventually rushed for a combined 201 yards on 38 carries, with Cam Newton leading the team with 86 yards, while he and Christian McCaffrey each scored on a rushing touchdown. Atlanta continued to fight even after falling behind 20-10. They got the ball back one last time with just over two minutes remaining and a deficit of three points, but the offense mustered minus-three yards while turning the ball over on downs when Matt Ryan’s fourth down pass failed to connect with Taylor Gabriel. But the day was symbolized by a play earlier in the fourth quarter where Ryan threw what appeared to be a perfect 39-yard touchdown pass to Julio Jones that the sure-handed receiver simply dropped, resulting in a turnover on downs. It was the type of mistake Atlanta never made during the team’s run to the Super Bowl last season. —- Want exclusive sports news, highlights and analysis from a rotating cast of New York Times journalists, delivered to your inbox once a week? Click here to receive our weekly Sports newsletter. —- The Philadelphia Eagles already had the N.F.L.’s best record, a quarterback leading the league in touchdown passes and a defense that makes life miserable for opponents each and every week. The addition of Jay Ajayi to the running game made them seem like something out of a video game in a 51-23 demolishing of the Denver Broncos. There were no weaknesses on display for the Eagles. Carson Wentz, who came into the game tied for the N.F.L. lead with 19 touchdown passes, threw four more, while completing 15 of 27 passes for 199 yards before being taken out in the fourth quarter with the score well out of hand. Wentz now has sole possession of the passing touchdown lead with 23, but he was focused on other things. ”Touchdowns are great, but being 8-1 is what it’s all about,” he told reporters after the game. Wentz had plenty of help, as the team’s running game, powered by LeGarrette Blount, Corey Clement and the newly-acquired Ajayi combined to carry the ball 37 times for 197 yards and three touchdowns. Coming into the game, Philadelphia had just four rushing touchdowns all season. That the Eagles had so much success running the ball against the second-rated rushing defense in the N.F.L. was a testament to Ajayi. The pro bowl running back was traded from the Dolphins this week and went from an underperforming malcontent in Miami to energizing Philadelphia with a 46-yard touchdown run late in the second quarter. He finished with a team-leading 77 yards. The Broncos, meanwhile, tried to shake things up by switching from Trevor Siemian to Brock Osweiler at quarterback, but any improvement was hard to see in a game in which Osweiler completed just 19 of 38 passes for 208 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions. He was repeatedly harassed by Philadelphia’s front-seven and made several mistakes, including the two turnovers, both of which led to Eagles touchdowns. The highlights were few and far between for Denver, but they included Osweiler hitting Demaryius Thomas for a 1-yard touchdown pass, Brandon McManus connecting on two field goals from 50-plus yards, and Brandon Marshall, Denver’s standout linebacker, getting his first career fumble recovery for a touchdown after a strip-sack of Nick Foles by Von Miller. Philadelphia now heads into its bye-week as the N.F.L.’s only eight-win team. Their next challenge will be a road game against Dallas on Nov. 19. The Saints extended their winning streak to six when Drew Brees completed 81.2 percent of his passes for 263 yards and two touchdowns in a 30-10 victory over reeling Tampa Bay. The Buccaneers came in hoping to stem a four-game skid, but instead were not just beaten, but beaten up. Quarterback Jameis Winston left with shoulder soreness after the first half. Starting defensive end William Gholston was carted off the field with a neck injury. And tensions boiled over when Winston, after he had left the game, appeared to instigate a scuffle along the sideline. Brees’ touchdowns went for 33 yards to Alvin Kamara and 36 yards to Ted Ginn. Kamara, who also scored on a 6-yard run, did most of the work on his TD reception, thrilling the Superdome crowd with a waving, tackle-slipping run after his short catch. The Saints also scored on Justin Hardee’s blocked punt, which Hardee recovered in stride and returned for a touchdown. Kamara finished with 172 yards from scrimmage, including six catches for 84 yards. — Associated Press With A.J. Green and Jalen Ramsey ejected for fighting, Jaydon Mickens delivered the knockout blow by returning a punt 63 yards for a touchdown, helping the Jacksonville Jaguars beat the Cincinnati Bengals 23-7. The Jaguars (5-3) won consecutive games for the first time in 13 months and were victorious at EverBank Field for the first time since last December. Blake Bortles threw for 259 yards and a touchdown in another efficient performance. Marqise Lee had his first TD reception of the season and responded by punting the ball into the stands. And Jacksonville’s defense handled Cincinnati’s woeful offense for most of the afternoon. But most of the talk will center on Green and Ramsey. The perennial Pro Bowl receiver retaliated against the trash-talking cornerback in a violent way late in the first half. After Ramsey knocked Green to the ground at the end of a running play, Green grabbed Ramsey around the neck and slammed him to the ground. Green then delivered numerous punches to Ramsey’s helmet — never the smartest idea — and put another M.M.A.-style choke hold on Ramsey. It was the kind of aggressive attack that could lead to a suspension. Players from both sidelines rushed the field, pushing, pulling, shoving, screaming and looking like they would brawl. Jaguars rookie running back Leonard Fournette was inactive for violating a team rule. Jacksonville made the surprise announcement 90 minutes before kickoff. It’s unclear what Fournette did to draw coach Doug Marrone’s punishment. “This has been addressed internally and further details will not be made public,” Marrone said. — Associated Press Jared Goff set career highs with four touchdown throws and 311 yards passing, Todd Gurley ran for two more scores and the surprising Los Angeles Rams made one big play after another in beating the defenseless New York Giants 51-17. The win was the fifth in six games for the Rams, whose 6-2 start is the franchise’s best since 2001, when the club went 14-2 in the regular season and eventually lost to the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl. Los Angeles did everything right in remaining unbeaten in four road games, five if a “home” win in London is included. The Rams’ high-powered offense showed no rust coming off the bye, scoring on eight of their first nine possessions. The defense force three turnovers that the offense turned into 17 points and the special teams blocked a third-quarter punt that Gurley converted into his second touchdown. Greg Zuerlein added three field goals as Rams had the biggest offense performance against the Giants in a home game since Cleveland beat them 52-21 in the regular-season finale in 1964. — Associated Press",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | What We Owe the Innocent Victims of America’s Wars,"Op-Ed Contributor WASHINGTON — In “The Uncounted,” their article in The New York Times Magazine last week, Azmat Khan and Anand Gopal laid bare a tragic reality of American military operations against the Islamic State: the untold harm inflicted on civilians. That the Islamic State is guilty of horrific atrocities is common knowledge. But most Americans seem unaware of the human toll of our own actions, the consequences this has for our national security and our reputation, and that too often the civilian casualties we cause are the result of avoidable mistakes. This must change. Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the number of violent extremist groups has grown across multiple continents. From Syria to Somalia to Pakistan, the United States is combating many of these groups — usually with bombs and missiles. Large numbers of innocent people are invariably caught in the middle. There are practical ways that we can improve how we protect civilians as we fight violent extremists. These changes will improve our military operations and make our country safer in the long run. Contrary to what some believe, taking all reasonable and feasible precautions to protect civilians, and mitigating the resulting anger when we harm them, does not need to impede military operations. In fact, the United States military has recognized that doing so is critical to our success, and it has rules of engagement designed to avoid harming civilians. But while the accuracy of our weapons has steadily improved, too often they hit the wrong targets. The Pentagon says that only 89 of approximately 14,000 airstrikes in the air war against the Islamic State have killed civilians. But The New York Times Magazine’s reporters — conducting extensive on the ground and satellite research — found that one in five airstrikes resulted in civilian deaths. As shocking as this disparity is, the number is almost certainly a low estimate because it does not reflect the heavy bombing of Mosul and other densely populated areas that have taken place this year. The truth is, the military is not doing all it can to avoid killing and wounding civilians. It relies on information that is too often flawed or incorrectly interpreted. Pentagon officials, who point to their extensive procedures for distinguishing military targets from civilians, too often rely on skimpy, outdated and inconclusive intelligence gleaned from informants of dubious reliability and surveillance conducted from high altitudes, or from video analyzed half a world away by people without expertise about the country or its culture. Even the Pentagon’s logs of its actions are unreliable and incomplete. These are solvable problems. It is incumbent on our military leaders to urgently address them. This should start with the secretary of defense immediately commissioning a team of experts, including military and intelligence officers and representatives of organizations like the Center for Civilians in Conflict, which has extensive experience in documenting civilian casualties. This team should conduct a comprehensive analysis of every aspect of the current procedures for identifying and verifying potential targets and make recommendations for improvement. We can also do a lot more to assist innocent victims of our airstrikes. Soon after the invasion of Afghanistan, in response to repeated instances of American bombs killing scores of civilians, Congress created the Afghan Civilian Assistance Program, a $10 million annual appropriation implemented by the Agency for International Development. Marla Ruzicka, a young activist from California who traveled to Afghanistan to call attention to civilian casualties, was the inspiration for that program. When the military shifted its focus to Iraq, Ms. Ruzicka followed the bombs. Based on information she collected, I worked with her as Congress created the Iraqi War Victims Fund. Ms. Ruzicka died in a car bombing in Iraq in 2005. The fund was renamed after her. But after most American troops withdrew from Iraq, the Marla Ruzicka Iraqi War Victims Fund, a $7.5 million program replenished annually to provide assistance to innocent victims of American military operations, was redirected to address other needs in Iraq. Given the large number of Iraqi civilians who have been killed or wounded as a result of the United States’ bombing, the Marla Fund, now implemented by the State Department, should be reactivated. The Marla fund is not the only way we can assist innocent victims. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, military commanders recognized the need for a “condolence” program for the families of innocent victims of American combat operations. Although it was cobbled together hastily and not applied uniformly, it at least recognized and addressed civilian casualties in a tangible way. In 2014, I wrote legislation providing clear authority and guidance for future condolence payments. While the Pentagon recently reaffirmed that such payments “are an important tool for DOD,” the military says it has not made a single monetary payment to innocent victims of American military operations in Syria, and none in Iraq since 2011. This is inexcusable and it is counterproductive. The Pentagon has explicit authority to provide amends to civilians harmed by our mistakes, as it did before 2011, in accordance with the new guidance that I negotiated with the Pentagon three years ago. In order to identify eligible victims, the Pentagon needs to improve the accuracy of its own airstrike data and overhaul the often perfunctory way it investigates reports of civilian casualties. Ideally, Pentagon investigators should obtain timely information from witnesses who were present or who live in the vicinity. If that is not feasible, then the Pentagon needs to improve substantially its collaboration with nongovernmental organizations, investigative reporters and local authorities who have access to bombing sites, the wounded and witnesses. That collaboration could include specifying the type of information Pentagon investigators need and procedures for collecting and preserving evidence. No one disputes that civilian casualties are inevitable in war. At the same time, it seems that the United States military will be fighting violent extremists for the foreseeable future. This means the lives of more civilians will be put at risk. The way we conduct our operations and how we react when mistakes are made will be critical to our success. This is not only a moral imperative, it is in America’s interest. If we harm civilians when it could reasonably have been avoided, and if we fail to fairly and promptly help the innocent victims, the local population will turn against us — and make the fight against violent extremists even more difficult. As hard as the Pentagon already tries to avoid civilian casualties, it is clear that it can and must do better. A previous version of this article misstated the findings of New York Times Magazine reporters. They found that one in five airstrikes resulted in civilian deaths, not necessarily that 2,700 airstrikes resulted in civilian deaths.",The New York Times

It’s a particularly timely discussion in 2017 when, as the author writes, “even the patriarchs were sick of the patriarchy.” One arch suggestion: following the Bill Cosby trial while rewatching Woody Allen’s “Manhattan.” She ends with Martha Gellhorn’s point of view, that monsters (like her lover Ernest Hemingway) redeem themselves through their art, rather than artists condemning themselves through their monstrosity. — Rod Nordland, international correspondent at large _____ From The New York Times: Who should run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau? That was the question plaguing the agency and writers from the left, right and center early this week. And while columnists on the right pointed to legal arguments that supported Mick Mulvaney stepping into the interim leadership role, writers on the left bemoaned the Trump administration’s attempt to destroy the bureau from within. — Anna Dubenko, senior digital strategist _____ From Paste: Charles Manson’s music-business ambitions and the ways of 1960s Tinseltown had a lot to do with the murders. — Jon Pareles, chief pop music critic _____ From National Geographic: Millions have seen the Grand Canyon, but many fewer have traveled the grueling length of it.

Regardless, it’s the best thing I’ve come across on the internet in recent weeks. — Stephen Hiltner, staff editor _____ From The Times archives: David Cassidy died last week at the age of 67, eliciting many memories of “The Partridge Family,” the half-hour show about a musical family that ran from 1970-74. But how many people ever got to see him live back then? Our 1972 review of his show at Madison Square Garden forecast a new trend in pop, as he “moved around the Garden’s massive stage like a wind‐up version of an updated Elvis Presley, gyrating his pelvis, leaping into the air in wide‐spreading splits and trying, with all his might, to project an image of writhing sensuality.” — Andrea Kannapell, editor, What We’re Reading",The New York Times

In this selection, you’ll find writers on the right who argue that Mr. Moore isn’t entitled to due process — an election is not a court trial. Writers on the left see the allegations as an indictment of a larger problem in evangelical culture, permission granted to older men to prey upon young girls. — Anna Dubenko, senior digital strategist _____ From Random House: Ta-Nehisi Coates, a public intellectual on tour for his latest admirable book “We Were Eight Years in Power,” lays out a brilliant response to a white student who asks what she should do when her white friends rap along to songs with the “N-word” in it: “There’s actually a lot to be learned from refraining.” — Lynda Richardson, senior staff editor, Travel _____ From The Miami Herald: Nursing homes are required to file disaster plans with regulators, but how can you double-check that they exist — and are realistic? After Hurricane Irma hit Florida, leading to widespread power outages in nursing homes, chaotic evacuations and some deaths, two reporters, Carol Marbin Miller and Caitlin Ostroff, found that Broward and Palm Beach counties “refused to release emergency plans,” and those released by Miami-Dade “were heavily redacted, leaving crucial information out of reach.” What was apparent: Many nursing homes did not have enough food to last a week and did not know how long it would take to evacuate, some of the exact issues emergency plans are meant to address. — Sheri Fink, correspondent _____ From CBS This Morning: The Book Thing isn’t a library or a store.

The toll is staggering, but rather than let the numbers paint the picture, we get a portrait of what’s missing in the life of the nation’s largest city. “What got covered that doesn’t now? Most community boards. Most local elections,” one veteran reporter says. It’s a loss for humanity, really. — Adeel Hassan, reporter, Race/Related _____ From The Times archives: In 1980, waitresses at a Detroit airport lounge protested — and sued — over skimpy uniforms that invited sexual harassment. This article on the case notes the emergence of a handful of other efforts to resist the imposition of demeaning, sexually suggestive attire. It says so much about the evolution of our understanding of what women shouldn’t have to put up with. — Andrea Kannapell, editor, What We’re Reading",The New York Times

The signs, she writes “are there for anyone who knows how to read them. Not in the scale or savagery of the violence, although both are shocking, but in the evidence of the military’s intent to eradicate the Rohingya minority.” — Max Fisher, The Interpreter columnist _____ From The Guardian: Last month, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to three Americans for their discoveries about the circadian rhythm, also known as the body’s biological clock, the surest sign yet of how far sleep science has come from its previously neglected state.

2017,What Would You Choose to Do If You Had Unlimited Free Time and No Restrictions?,"Student Opinion What would you do with your time if you did not have to go to school? How would you fill your days, especially if adults placed no restrictions on your choice? In “Hilde Lysiak, Reporter, Author, 10-Year-Old,” Concepción de León writes: The first book in the “Hilde Cracks the Case” series opens with 9-year-old Hilde Lysiak outside her local police station in the town of Selinsgrove, Pa., following up on a tip about a break-in on Orange Street. The on-duty officer refuses to divulge any information, but if she’s going to break the story in her newspaper, The Orange Street News, she has to investigate using six basic reporting questions: Who? What? Where? When? Why? How? “In the first chapter, Hilde is doing the exact same thing I did in real life,” said Ms. Lysiak, the now 10-year-old reporter upon whom the book is based. She visited The Times recently, proudly rocking peach-colored socks featuring raccoons eating doughnuts. “Hero Dog” is the first of six books in a series featuring Ms. Lysiak; they draw significantly from her experiences chasing the news in real-life Selinsgrove, where her parents give her a two-mile-wide stomping ground. The books, which Ms. Lysiak works on with her father, Matthew Lysiak, include definitions for terms like a “deadline” or a “press pass” and reporting tips like the six questions, which she used to write on her arm in marker so she wouldn’t forget them. The second book in the series was released on Tuesday. Ms. Lysiak’s story has also been optioned by Paramount TV and Anonymous Content for a television series. Ms. Lysiak’s experiences went viral in April 2016, when she broke a story on a local homicide. A source had tipped her on the incident a few blocks from her home, and after confirming with the police department, she immediately went to the scene, interviewing neighbors for additional information. Her on-the-ground reporting meant her article was up hours before other news outlets had even reached the scene, prompting critical comments on her website from those who thought a little girl as “cute” as she was should be playing with dolls or having tea parties instead of chasing hard news. Her story was picked up by The Washington Post and The Guardian, among other outlets. “I think a lot of adults tell their kids they can do anything, but at the end of the day don’t actually let them do anything,” she said. Students: Read the entire article, then tell us: — What were your impressions of Hilde Lysiak and her passion for journalism? — What would you choose to do if you had complete freedom from any set schedule, and why? — Is there any way you can pursue your dream activity, even if you are in school during the day and have outside obligations and responsibilities during your free time?

2017,What You Need to Know About the New ID Law and Travel,"In the past several months, there has been plenty of conversation about the Real ID Act and how it will affect air travelers. Passed by Congress in 2005, the act is intended to prevent identity fraud, and starting on Jan. 22, 2018, fliers who reside in some states, even if they’re flying domestically, will need identification other than a driver’s license to pass through Transportation Security Administration security checkpoints at airports. Who exactly is affected and what additional identification will the T.S.A. require? Here, answers to questions about what the Real ID Act means for travelers and why having a passport now may be more important than ever. What exactly is the Real ID Act? The act is meant to ensure that a person presenting an ID is in fact who that person says they are, according to Justine Whelan, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security. “The act prevents the production of fake IDs and ensures that all identification that is used has certain features which prevent tampering or are difficult to replicate,” Ms. Whelan said. These features include anti-counterfeit technology, such as the holograms on some state licenses. Federally issued documents, such as a passport, also fall into the difficult-to-replicate category. Why is the act being implemented? Congress passed the act on the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission that the federal government set minimum security standards for how states issue identification and for how that identification is used. “These security standards ensure a safer American public. At the end of the day, everyone should be who they say they are,” Ms. Whelan said. When does it go into effect and for which states? Ms. Whelan said that Real ID enforcement has been implemented in phases over the last two years in some states. If you show up to a federal facility such as a military base, for example, and you live in a state that’s not Real ID compliant, you will need alternative identification to a driver’s license. Currently, 28 states are Real ID compliant, including Texas, Ohio, Florida, Nevada and Colorado. For a complete list, visit dhs.gov/real-id. But what does the Real ID Act mean for air travelers? Starting Jan. 22, 2018, the T.S.A. will ask all travelers who don’t have a driver’s license from a compliant state or a state that has been granted an extension to the compliance deadline (this means that residents can continue using their noncompliant license for federal purposes while the state continues working to be in compliance) to provide an alternative form of acceptable identification. Travelers won’t be able to pass through security without this acceptable identification. And, as of Oct. 1, 2020, all air travelers will be required to have a Real ID-compliant driver’s license or alternate acceptable identification to fly domestically. What exactly qualifies as acceptable identification? The D.H.S. has designated more than a dozen forms of acceptable ID including a passport; a border ID card; a trusted traveler card, such as Global Entry; a Real ID compliant driver’s license; and a permanent resident card. For a complete list, visit tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/identification. Is one form of acceptable identification better than another? Ms. Whelan said that the D.H.S. does not advocate any particular form of acceptable identification, but Brenda Sprague, who oversees passport services for the U.S. Department of State, said that, with the implementation of Real ID fast approaching, residents who live in states that aren’t Real ID compliant should apply for a passport before the end of the year. November and December are the best months to apply for or renew your current passport, Ms. Sprague said, because the turnaround time to get a new passport now is usually around four weeks. In the summer, when passport applications peak, the wait for a new passport could be up to eight weeks. Around 136 million Americans have passports in circulation, according to State Department — that’s only around 40 percent of the population in the United States. O.K., you’ve convinced me, and I’m ready to apply for a new passport. What’s the best way? Ms. Sprague said that there are more than 8,000 passport application locations around the country. Around 60 percent are post offices while the rest are courthouses and libraries. Visit the Department of State’s Where to Apply link for more details. In addition, there are 27 passport agencies, where travelers can apply for rush passports. “These agencies are for people who are traveling within two weeks,” Ms. Sprague said. This link has a list of these agencies; applicants need an appointment for a visit and can make one online at passportappointment.travel.state.gov. Also, the State Department is collaborating with Hilton Hotels & Resorts on the Hilton Passport Project, an initiative meant to encourage more Americans to apply for passports. Every few weeks, a Hilton location in the United States will have a Passport Concierge booth, where guests and the general public can have their passport pictures taken for free and apply for or renew a passport. Between one and three employees from the State Department will be on hand to answer passport-related questions and help fill out applications. The next Passport Concierge will be at Hilton Cleveland Downtown from Nov. 9 to 11. For a list of coming locations, visit facebook.com/Hilton. How much does it cost to get a new passport? First-time applicants pay $110 plus a $25 application fee. Passport renewals cost $110 and expedited passports are an additional $60. If you’re renewing your passport, you can do it by mail, but if you’re getting a new passport or if your existing one is lost or stolen, you must apply in person. An earlier version of this article incorrectly listed states that currently are Real ID compliant.",The New York Times
2017,What You Wear to MoMA Could Soon Become a Part of It,"When “Items: Is Fashion Modern?” opened last month at the Museum of Modern Art — becoming the institution’s first show to focus on clothing design in its 70-some years — Emily Spivack, too, had already given a considerable amount of thought to clothes as they relate to MoMA. The T contributor and author of “Worn Stories” spent many days at the museum’s archive and library after the show’s curators invited her to contribute in an ancillary way. “I asked to pull files of what MoMA visitors looked like in the 1940s, ’50s, ’60s and ’70s — did people get dressed up, for example? — and there wasn’t really any documentation,” Spivack says. “That was intriguing to me.” She managed to track down a longtime (and now retired) front-desk employee who remembered Andy Warhol periodically standing by the coat check, snapping photographs of museumgoers. Spivack updates this premise, and turns it inward, with a new project: “An archive of everything worn to MoMA from November 1, 2017, to January 28, 2018.” She has positioned prompts throughout the museum that ask visitors to describe their own outfits or that of their companions, via text message. The words are then projected onto the museum’s walls and collected online. “There’s so much out there right now that’s overtly visual; this is different than snapping a photo and sending it,” she explains. “This project encourages you to think about your clothing. It’s an opportunity to ask, ‘Why did I make these decisions and what do they say about me?’” She expects the submissions to range from straightforward, brand-heavy checklists to more nostalgia-driven, poetic accounts. “What I love,” she says, “is all of those voices coming together and getting to see what kind of story will emerge from that.” Ultimately, the series of descriptions will be printed out, bound and placed in MoMA’s archives. “An archive of everything worn to MoMA from November 1, 2017, to January 28, 2018” runs through Jan. 28 at MoMA, 11 W. 53rd Street, New York, moma.org.",The New York Times
2017,What an Astros Win Means for Healing in Houston,"I can’t recall the precise moment now, but it was probably somewhere in the seventh inning of Game 7 of the World Series, right around the time the Astros’ Jose Altuve stole second base, that I thought of the novelist Don DeLillo. I was in Houston, sitting on a milk crate on Waylon Doucett’s porch. There was beer, a jar filled with moonshine and the scent of marijuana in the air. Mr. Doucett’s home was very much like his city in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey — a work in progress. Roaches on bare concrete floors. Exposed vertical beams where there should be walls. A mound of clothes where there should be a bed. But there was a raw joy in Mr. Doucett. His team was about to win the World Series. There was a pain, too, some unspoken melancholy and exhaustion, a yearning for the way the world used to be, at least the one he knew on the 9300 block of Lake Forest Boulevard. I was there to capture his thoughts and reaction to the Astros’ victory and what it means for a city devastated by the costliest natural disaster in United States history. In Mr. DeLillo’s epic 1997 novel “Underworld,” in the book’s opening baseball section, he wrote: “Longing on a large scale is what makes history.” The longing of flood victims like Mr. Doucett made a kind of history on Wednesday night. It was powerful to watch. The Astros’ World Series run gave Houston a focus for some of this post-Harvey emotion, a place to put it all in. Late Wednesday night after the victory, my colleague Paul DeBenedetto interviewed Astros fans in downtown Houston at Minute Maid Park, where thousands gathered to watch a broadcast of the game. Minutes after the win, he saw Joe Frank, 29, dressed in Astros orange. Mr. Frank had tears in his eyes. People were high-fiving around him, but Mr. Frank shoved himself off to the side to compose himself. To process. “We needed this,” Mr. Frank said, his voice cracking. I’ve lived in Houston since 2011, serving as The New York Times’s Houston bureau chief, and the disaster touched many of my friends, my neighbors, my co-workers, my children’s teachers and school crossing guards. One recent Saturday, my 5-year-old daughter was drawing on the easel in my son’s room. I asked her what it was. She said she was drawing a flood. Two months after Harvey, Houston still suffers from a kind of PTSD. I see it in myself and I see it in others. I was talking to one flood victim outside her damaged home, and it started to lightly rain. During Harvey, she was stranded in her car for two days. Now she got nervous whenever it rained, and she cut the conversation short and politely rushed me off her lawn. I recently called a young woman who had been turned down by FEMA. for disaster assistance. I was expecting to interview her about property inspections. Instead, she started talking about having suicidal feelings, for a host of problems that I did not fully understand but that Harvey seemed to be exacerbating. I stopped the interview, and talked to her person-to-person, not reporter-to-source. I asked her to think about her children, and put her in touch with city officials, who ended up contacting her and helping her. That’s really what it has been like reporting on Harvey in Houston: I have to stop covering it sometimes, in order to cover it. One day during Harvey, I was parked on the side of a flooded freeway with our photographer, Tamir Kalifa. I was writing on my laptop in the passenger seat. A woman approached and asked for help evacuating, and lifting her frail father from a wheelchair into a pickup truck. I set my laptop down and helped lift him up. I remember grabbing the hospital urine bag attached to his body, and putting it gently into the truck at his feet. It was a group effort among strangers — men, women, black, white, Hispanic, Asian. It was a small moment amid citywide upheaval. I don’t know why I get choked up thinking about it, even now, two months later. We never learned one another’s names. I’m like Mr. Frank, looking for a place where I can shove myself off to the side to process what it all means. Or like Mr. Doucett, looking for the things to put this disaster into perspective. We are all longing, on a large scale.",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | What if Ken Starr Was Right?,"Ross Douthat In the longstanding liberal narrative about Bill Clinton and his scandals, the one pushed by Clinton courtiers and ratified in media coverage of his post-presidency, our 42nd president was only guilty of being a horndog, his affairs were nobody’s business but his family’s, and oral sex with Monica Lewinsky was a small thing that should never have put his presidency in peril. That narrative could not survive the current wave of outrage over male sexual misconduct. So now a new one may be forming for the age of Harvey Weinstein and Donald Trump. In this story, Kenneth Starr and the Republicans are still dismissed as partisan witch hunters. But liberals might be willing to concede that the Lewinsky affair was a pretty big deal morally, a clear abuse of sexual power, for which Clinton probably should have been pressured to resign. This new narrative lines up with what’s often been my own assessment of the Clinton scandals. I have never been a Clinton hater; indeed, I’ve always been a little mystified by the scale of Republican dislike for the most centrist of recent Democratic leaders. So I’ve generally held what I’ve considered a sensible middle-ground position on his sins — that he should have stepped down when the Lewinsky affair came to light, but that the Republican effort to impeach him was a hopeless attempt to legislate against dishonor. But a moment of reassessment is a good time to reassess things for yourself, so I spent this week reading about the lost world of the 1990s. I skimmed the Starr Report. I leafed through books by George Stephanopoulos and Joe Klein and Michael Isikoff. I dug into Troopergate and Whitewater and other first-term scandals. I reacquainted myself with Gennifer Flowers and Webb Hubbell, James Riady and Marc Rich. After doing all this reading, I’m not sure my reasonable middle ground is actually reasonable. It may be that the conservatives of the 1990s were simply right about Clinton, that once he failed to resign he really deserved to be impeached. Yes, the Republicans were too partisan, the Starr Report was too prurient and Clinton’s haters generated various absurd conspiracy theories. But the Clinton operation was also extraordinarily sordid, in ways that should be thrown into particular relief by the absence of similar scandals in the Obama administration, which had perfervid enemies and circling investigators as well. The sexual misconduct was the heart of things, but everything connected to Clinton’s priapism was bad: the use of the perks of office to procure women, willing and unwilling; the frequent use of that same power to buy silence and bully victims; and yes, the brazen public lies and perjury. Something like Troopergate, for instance, in which Arkansas state troopers claimed to have served as Clinton’s panderers and been offered jobs to buy their silence, is often recalled as just a right-wing hit job. But if you read The Los Angeles Times’s reporting on the allegations (which included phone records confirming the troopers’ account of a mistress Clinton was seeing during his presidential transition) and Stephanopoulos’s portrayal of Clinton’s behavior in the White House when the story broke, the story seems like it was probably mostly true. I have less confidence about what was real in the miasma of Whitewater. But with Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky, we know what happened: A president being sued for sexual harassment tried to buy off a mistress-turned-potential-witness with White House favors, and then committed perjury serious enough to merit disbarment. Which also brought forward a compelling allegation from Juanita Broaddrick that the president had raped her. The longer I spent with these old stories, the more I came back to a question: If exploiting a willing intern is a serious enough abuse of power to warrant resignation, why is obstructing justice in a sexual harassment case not serious enough to warrant impeachment? Especially when the behavior is part of a longstanding pattern that also may extend to rape? Would any feminist today hesitate to take a similar opportunity to remove a predatory studio head or C.E.O.? There is a common liberal argument that our present polarization is the result of constant partisan escalations on the right — the rise of Newt Gingrich, the steady Hannitization of right-wing media. Some of this is true. But returning to the impeachment imbroglio made me think that in that case the most important escalators were the Democrats. They had an opportunity, with Al Gore waiting in the wings, to show a predator the door and establish some moral common ground for a polarizing country. And what they did instead — turning their party into an accessory to Clinton’s appetites, shamelessly abandoning feminist principle, smearing victims and blithely ignoring his most credible accuser, all because Republicans funded the investigations and they’re prudes and it’s all just Sexual McCarthyism — feels in the cold clarity of hindsight like a great act of partisan deformation. For which, it’s safe to say, we have all been amply punished since. OpinionMaureen Dowd",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | What the Astros’ Win Means for Houston,"Op-Ed Contributor In the 1990s, my father bought me a Houston Astros cap. That was during one of the team’s rough patches, a set of years bookended by playoff losses. I’ve worn it religiously ever since. Nowadays it’s faded, the star across the brim is hardly visible, the Velcro above the neck is so busted that it’s always on the verge of jumping off the back of my head. But over the past few decades, from the sprawl of the suburbs to the train tracks lining the East End, it has served as my passport to the city. After the massive destruction of Hurricane Harvey, the Astros were the team we had pinned our hopes on. Every victory they pulled off gave us a momentary reprieve. We took comfort in the little star on their caps when we found ourselves at a loss for words, wondering how our homes ended up halfway under water. But the team’s very first World Series win, after a seven-game series, after losing only a few games at home since the storm, has given the country another glimpse of our city. Grit and struggle and resilience, sure, but a particular brand of Houston scrappiness, too. And after a campaign that began, depending on the depth of your allegiance, 56 seasons, seven months, 66 innings or a couple of nights ago, the Astros have rallied for the community. Consider the cinematics: After seven games of trial and error, of spontaneous fireworks and hyperbolic home runs, the championship came down to a cleareyed, stoic finale. But while Astros pride in some neighborhoods was expected, it felt entirely new in others. Friends of mine who couldn’t have sketched a baseball diamond a few months back — and wouldn’t have cared at all if you had pointed that out — regaled me with pitching patterns and the merits of one lineup shift or another. One day, I saw someone with a haircut that incorporated the team’s star, and then a fifth and then a sixth such haircut as the season progressed. In block after block, people hosted impromptu tailgates on their lawns. I found Astro mementos in haunts where I had never seen them before, posters of the roster in barbershops and bobble heads of players by registers at taquerias. Just before the series began, an ex hit me up to see if I had the old jersey he had given me on loan years ago. When I told him it was still around, he sighed in relief. He was glad, he said, because this was the time to wear it; but he wouldn’t begrudge me if I had sold it, either. You couldn’t find them anymore. The season forged ties among communities that otherwise would’ve left one another alone. Because in this country, there’s no certainty that you’ll fall in love with the game; economics, geography and cultural gate-keeping serve as barriers for many people. But then a championship series comes along, and just for a moment, it grabs you and everyone you know. That’s why, on the night of the final game, even though it was hosted by Los Angeles, over 17,000 Astros fans filled Minute Maid Park. Halfway across the country, Houstonians found themselves in the thick of it. You can’t help wondering how many of us became lifelong fans because of this series. It would be careless to say that the win will change much for people still devastated by the storm. The season has ended, and they’ll go back to their lives. But it’s rare that anyone gets to see a magical thing, let alone an entire city, and let alone for the very first time. Maybe some kids watching in Cypress will tell their kids about José Altuve’s final volley. Maybe an amateur league on the North Side will finally set up bases in the parks throughout the sprawl. Maybe some newfound fans were able to get jerseys for the series, mementos that they’ll keep in their families for generations. Maybe they’ll only bring them to work next week. Or maybe they’ll sell them in a month or two. But I’ll keep my cap until the star falls off. Until the magic it conjures among residents of the city begins to fizzle out, and probably a little while after that. I never want to forget how that connection feels. “Los Astros” took hope onto the field, and they gave it back to us.",The New York Times
2017,What the Climate Report Says About the Impact of Global Warming,"The same, only worse. Global warming is affecting the United States more than ever, and the impacts — on communities, regions, infrastructure and sectors of the economy — are expected to increase. That’s the gist of Volume II of the National Climate Assessment, a draft report made public on Friday that focuses on the current and future impacts of climate change. The draft will eventually accompany a report on the science of climate change that was unveiled by 13 federal agencies in its final form on the same day. In addition to comments by members of the public, Volume II is being reviewed by an expert committee of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. After revisions by the agencies involved it is expected to be published in December 2018. Like the scientific report, the draft of Volume II contains many of the same findings cited in the previous National Climate Assessment, published in 2014. But reflecting some of the impacts that have been felt across the country in the past three years, some of the emphasis has changed. Here’s a look at some of what’s new in the draft assessment. More and more of the predicted impacts of global warming are now becoming a reality. For instance, the 2014 assessment forecast that coastal cities would see more flooding in the coming years as sea levels rose. That’s no longer theoretical: Scientists have now documented a record number of “nuisance flooding” events during high tides. In 2014, nearly half of residents in Hampton Roads, Va., could not get out of their neighborhoods at least once because of tidal flooding. Meanwhile, as the oceans have warmed, disruptions in United States fisheries, long predicted, are now underway. In 2012, record ocean temperatures caused lobster catches in Maine to peak a month earlier than usual — and the distribution chain was unprepared. While much of the discussion of climate change looks at the role of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in warming the planet, the draft report puts a renewed emphasis on the impacts of other atmospheric pollutants like ozone and smoke, which can cause respiratory problems and lead to premature death. The draft notes with “high confidence” that climate change will increase ozone levels, as rising temperatures and changes in atmospheric circulation affect local weather conditions. But the increases will not be uniform; by near the end of the century the worst ozone levels will be found across a wide expanse of the Midwest and Northern Great Plains, while levels are expected to improve, at least somewhat, in parts of the Southeast. The report reiterates what residents of the West have learned from hard experience: that warmer springs, longer dry seasons in the summer and other impacts are lengthening the fire season. The smoke from fires affects not only health, the report says, but visibility. Since 2014, more detailed economic research has estimated that climate change could cause hundreds of billions of dollars in annual damage, as deadly heat waves, coastal flooding, and an increase in extreme weather take their toll. Unless, that is, communities take steps to prepare beforehand. The previous assessment warned that few states and cities were taking steps to adapt to the impacts of climate change. That’s slowly changing, the new draft finds. More and more communities are taking measures such as preserving wetlands along the coasts to act as buffers against storms. But outside of a few places in Louisiana and Alaska, few coastal communities are rethinking their development patterns in order to avoid the impacts from rising seas and severe weather that the report says are surely coming. The United States military has long taken climate change seriously, both for its potential impacts on troops and infrastructure around the world and for its potential to cause political instability in other countries. The draft report cites these international concerns, but goes far beyond the military. Climate change is already affecting American companies’ overseas operations and supply chains, it says, and as these impacts worsen it will take a toll on trade and the economy. Global warming and natural disasters are also affecting development in less affluent countries. That, the draft says, puts additional burdens on the United States for humanitarian assistance and disaster aid. The draft report suggests a different approach to assessing the effects of climate change, by considering how various impacts — on food supplies, water and electricity generation, for example — interact with each other. “It is not possible to understand the full extent of climate-related impacts in the United States without considering these interactions,” the report says. It gives several examples, including recent droughts in California and elsewhere that, in combination with population changes, affects demand for water and energy. The draft also cites Hurricane Sandy, five years ago, which caused cascading impacts on interconnected systems in the New York area, some of which had not been anticipated. Flooding of subway and highway tunnels, for example, made it more difficult to repair the electrical system, which suffered widespread damage.",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | What the Weinstein Effect Can Teach Us About Campus Sexual Assault,"On Campus The outpouring of emotion over stories of sexual harassment in the workplace has been shocking and inspiring. After Harvey Weinstein’s sins were reported by The New York Times and The New Yorker, women (and men) in entertainment and a host of other industries have come forward with sickening tales of their own. The calls for greater accountability — meaning sustainable change beyond companies firing a handful of terrible, famous men — seem genuine. This moment of clarifying anger is particularly impressive given the recent lack of respect paid to another type of victim, one who dominated the news directly before Mr. Weinstein’s fall from grace: the college sexual assault victim. Even as debate about sexual harassment at institutions as disparate as Fox News and Artforum rages on, we have entered a period of backlash regarding student-on-student sexual assault on campus. About six years ago, colleges began offering better support and justice for victims, pushed in part by a grass-roots movement among students themselves. But in September, pundits across the political spectrum approved when the Education Department rolled back some Obama-era rules that had broadened protections for college sexual assault victims, ostensibly because they robbed accused students of their right to due process in campus courts. Obama’s rules were already pro forma at some colleges before his 2011 federal guidance, so I believe the backlash isn’t truly about government policy, but discomfort about the change in how students approach the problem of sexual assault today. The number of students who have come forward publicly with stories of sexual assault has skyrocketed, but the number of students who are willing to report sexual assault to their administrators is still relatively tiny. In 2014, 20.2 million students attended college in the United States, but they reported only about 6,700 sexual assault incidents to their universities compared with 2,200 reports in 2001. The increased visibility of victims in college may seem alarming, but it almost certainly does not reflect a spike in the number of sexual assaults. It reflects a much more positive trend: Like today’s actresses, college students are casting off the shame of victimhood to tell their stories. I witnessed this firsthand as I traveled to four-year residential universities around the country to interview students, administrators and parents about the state of sex on campus. What I heard was exciting in many respects: Young women are becoming more comfortable with asserting their bodily autonomy. Their growing refusal to submit to nonconsensual encounters should count as progress. How this plays out on campus is different from the Weinstein effect in key ways, but the point is, students have been at the forefront of what it means to be more outspoken about misconduct. They also offer us a preview of where the country might be going next. Campus sexual assault may be a trickier problem for society than workplace harassment of subordinates. When one of the most successful producers in the history of Hollywood uses his lofty position to lure powerless young actresses into hotel rooms to violate them, it’s easy to regard him as a monster. There’s a different dynamic on college campuses. Despite the clichés about predatory football stars targeting defenseless freshman girls, student-on-student sexual assault often doesn’t involve an obvious power differential. It also rarely happens during daytime classes or university-sponsored activities, or in the regulated spaces that might be more analogous to a workplace. Sexual assault happens mostly in students’ social lives, at fraternity houses, off-campus apartments and dorms. The dynamics of sexual immaturity at colleges have also blurred the lines slightly. Students have varying amounts of sex education and were more likely to learn what they know from pornography or other media that perpetuate America’s toxic gender norms — the kind that may teach a boy to push an unwilling girl as hard as he can in the bedroom because that’s how a real man has sex. Add to that parties, drinking, lack of supervision and an absurd amount of student leisure time on some residential campuses, and you get all sorts of messy situations, particularly of the type involving blacked-out students. What’s more, on campuses today, the definition of sexual assault is broader than elsewhere in the country. The criminal standard for sexual assault varies greatly from state to state, but groping isn’t usually much more than a misdemeanor, if that. Yet at many universities, both public and private, students must hew to an extraordinarily high standard of communication to ensure that their sexual conduct is appropriate and consensual. These students must follow some principle of “affirmative consent,” which is colloquially called “yes means yes.” Reckless abandon in the bedroom doesn’t cut it. Students must receive a spoken “yes” or an unmistakable sign of pleasure or consent from a partner to escalate, and proceed with, each stage of a sexual encounter. “Yes means yes” is a great standard. It could help many men (both in college and out of it) proceed not only with caution but also with compassion for their sexual partners, because they must regard them as individuals with sexual desires rather than merely objects of gratification. But “yes means yes” is still a high bar for students, who as a cohort know very little about sex, let alone how to talk about it. By and large, kids aren’t taught the right vocabulary to distinguish between sexual assault and bad sex. This means that a number of accused college men are caught in a time of transition about our understanding of the definition of sexual assault. On campus, the young college women and men I met were not, by and large, arguing about whether certain acts occurred in the bedroom. Many young men who say they have been falsely accused of sexual assault do not deny that the sex at issue happened in the way their accusers described it. Instead, they argue that their conduct — while perhaps not outstanding and worthy of gold stars — was still acceptable. It’s not “yes, you did!” versus “no, I didn’t”; it’s “yes, it was consensual!” versus “no, it wasn’t!” The solution is not to roll back protections for students, but to be clearer about expectations for them and create more avenues in college (and earlier) to talk about sexual respect and ethics. Because what students complain about — even when it doesn’t rise to the level of assault — is often deeply demeaning. While most students I met agreed that a student who snakes a hand under a girl’s dress is guilty of assault, some of them argued that a guy who grinds on a classmate on the dance floor without permission is guilty of the same. Both are examples of disrespect, though to me the first is the only one that rises to the level of sexual assault. As more and more women (and men) come forward about their sexual assaults at the hands of famous individuals or in the workplace, the adult world will have plenty of confusion about “what counts,” too. There will be stories where the definition of consent will be in dispute, as on campus, and the risk of a post-Weinstein backlash is just as possible. The cultural shift around sexual assault is a necessarily messy process, one that will take years to resolve fully, and it involves a lot more than than reining in powerful men. We must encourage discussions among one another by carefully broadening our understanding of sexual violence. At the same time, we should educate young people on appropriate behavior rather than cutting them off by focusing on insufficient due process in campus courts. In the meantime, we should be reassured that there is very much a positive side to this cultural upheaval: Kids in college are starting to talk about sex in a more personal and open way than ever before, and not just as a matter of politics but as a matter of pleasure. They’ve learned, as one female student put it, that “sex is about me too. I’m supposed to be enjoying this. It’s not all about you.”",The New York Times

To receive it in your inbox, register here. Download the NYT Cooking app here. Good morning. Let’s start with some housekeeping. There are only two weekends left before we enter the final sprint toward Thanksgiving. So today you should take a look at our guide to planning and cooking the feast, and make a few notes against your coming responsibilities. (If you can, take a look at an analog version of the guide, which is a special section in the print edition of The New York Times today. It’s a very beautiful document.) This is a good day to send your formal invitations to the meal, and perhaps to build out a menu that will satisfy all who are coming. It is also a good day to cook – not just for this evening’s repast, but for the days and nights to come. You could make lasagnas – plural. Try Regina Schrambling’s classic recipe for lasagna with sausage and pancetta on one shelf in your oven. Then put David Tanis’s recipe for broccoli rabe lasagna on another. Dealer’s choice: You decide which one you eat tonight, and which you freeze for later. So long as you’re working hard, maybe you could mix up some pizza dough as well, let it proof in the refrigerator so you can make some pies on Monday night. I’ve been craving this clam pie recently. Also this fella with caramelized onions, figs, bacon and blue cheese. Then for Tuesday dinner: Spiced carrot soup with lime is nice with a grilled cheese sandwich. On Wednesday night, join the debate over tarragon. If you’re in favor of the herb, as I am, you might make this simple, elegant recipe for sautéed chicken breasts with tarragon that Kim Severson learned from the chef Thomas Keller. And if you’re not, well, here’s a collection of recipes for when you’d rather be doing anything other than cooking. Thursday is a coin toss. Heads you make Florence Fabricant’s recipe for Sicilian beef ragout. Tails, you take on Melissa Clark’s recipe for tuna salad with capers, olives and lemon. (You win either way.) And then round out the week either with David’s recipe for Parmesan lamb chops or mine for Parmesan rack of lamb, which I think goes very nicely with an Escoffier garnish: macaroni Milanaise. You can find more than 18,000 other recipes to consider cooking this week on NYT Cooking. Just sign up for a subscription to the site so you can access them. (We’d like you to do that very much.) Then show us what you end up cooking: We’re @nytfood on most social media sites, and we monitor the hashtag #NYTCooking. Or you can write to us directly at cookingcare@nytimes.com. (Many of you did just that on Friday, to alert me to a dumb error I made in this space after making a lot of hay about how you’d be waking up to sunlight today because of the end of daylight saving time. Of course, you set your clocks back an hour in fall, not forward. Thanks for keeping me straight.) Now, do take a moment to read this Lens post about Julia Child in France, photographed by her husband, Paul, before she was really Julia Child. Maybe you’ll thrill as I did to this video for the new Gorillaz single, “Garage Palace.” (Language watch: They’re calling these things “visualizers” now. Not me!) Here’s Tamar Adler dismissing the Toronto restaurateur Jen Agg’s memoir, “I Hear She’s a Real Bitch,” in The Times. You can visit Agg’s freewheeling Twitter account, perhaps, to see her subtweet in turn. This is the modern world. Finally, it’s Guy Fawkes Night this evening in Britain and across the Commonwealth, a super-weird holiday that commemorates the failure of a plot to explode the House of Lords on this day in 1605. So light a bonfire later if you desire, put on your old Occupy mask, serve everyone English toffee and contemplate the mysteries of tradition.

To receive it in your inbox, register here. Download the NYT Cooking app here. Good morning. We’re wrapping it up here, the whole Thanksgiving dance, putting up turkey stock in the freezer, finishing the last of the dressing, the sweet potatoes, the apple pie. It’s over now. Some of us are getting pressed hard by the kids to go get trees for Christmas, and wreaths for the door. Others are making black cakes. We’re all starting to plan for New Year’s Eve. We’re moving on. For dinner tonight, most of us on NYT Cooking are hoping to cook food that tastes nothing like Thanksgiving. Maybe that’s you, too? You might like some orange beef. My recipe is a variation on one I picked up from the Brooklyn chef Dale Talde, and, if you make it with rib-eye steak, as he suggests, you don’t need more than a quarter pound of beef per person to deliver a full serving. It’s rich, with flavor best characterized as size large. Try that with rice, and some greens with oyster sauce. Then, for dinner on Monday night, how about some spaghetti al limone, a Mark Bittman special that’s as bright in flavor as it is rich? It’s a marvelous taste of summer, but sturdy enough for autumn. So great. I think maybe a split pea soup for Tuesday. (You could make it in the slow cooker overnight on Monday, or in an electric pressure cooker after work on the day itself.) It’s thick and mellow, with an undercurrent of thyme. Florence Fabricant pairs the soup with Gigondas, and therefore so should you. Wednesday night is looking good for chicken baked with potatoes, cherry tomatoes and herbs. Julia Moskin brought the recipe back from Ischia, off the western coast of Italy, near Naples. They cook the dish there in the sands of the island’s beaches, which can run as hot as 350 degrees. Don’t worry. We use an oven. More soup on Thursday: It’s the season for that, and we can send the leftovers to work and school for the next day’s lunch. So, curried carrot and coconut. Make it and, if you can, sprinkle some cilantro across the top at the end. Then you can round out the week with a platter of cod cakes, which, of course, you don’t need to make with cod. Any white-fleshed fish or, come to think of it, salmon will do. (You may notice a parenthetical in the recipe suggesting adding a small smear of mayonnaise to the exterior of each patty before sautéing it. You really ought to do that. Makes for a better crust, every time.) Finish cooking early enough, you can make this ginger stout cake after dinner, then have it for breakfast tomorrow. Many thousands more recipes — nearly 20,000! — are waiting for you at NYT Cooking. Please sign up for a subscription to access them.

Then read Nick Paumgarten on The New Yorker, writing about Mikaela Shiffrin, the best slalom skier in the world. Finally, “Anarchy in the U.K.” was released by the Sex Pistols on this day in 1976.

To receive it in your inbox, register here. Download the NYT Cooking app here. Good morning. Eric Asimov put together a fine group of experts the other day to sit on his wine panel and taste cabernet francs from the Finger Lakes region of New York. Florence Fabricant, charged with pairing the winners with something to eat, thought the grapes could handle food with some complexity and heat. So she developed a recipe for braised chicken with gochujang that I think could make for a delicious dinner tonight. Drink upstate cabernet franc alongside your meal, if you can manage it. The panel’s top choices all sit at or below $25 a bottle. So that’s your dinner tonight, and don’t give it another thought. You should this afternoon organize your thoughts around a menu for Thanksgiving instead, and, when you have done so, write it down on a piece of paper or send it out in an email to those who will help you cook, finalizing it, and thus starting the countdown clock to the meal. (Here is all you need to know about planning and cooking the meal.) And we’re off! On Monday night, you might try Martha Rose Shulman’s recipe for tofu saag paneer. Or, heading in another direction with mock ingredients, this neat recipe for a miso-amped French onion soup. For Tuesday, I’m liking the idea of our recipe for Marcella Hazan’s Bolognese sauce, which you can serve over spaghetti and make like our readers in Australia, and call it spag bol. Wednesday dinner, I think, could be a platter of braised chicken thighs with caramelized fennel, alongside a bowl of olive oil mashed potatoes. Either that or one of the handmade pork patties Samin Nosrat wrote about in her “Eat” column this week. She gave us a fine recipe for maple breakfast sausage. But tonight, I’m thinking either her recipe for Italian fennel sausage or her recipe for Vietnamese sausage. (Whichever way you go, I’d like brownies for dessert, please.) Then, on Thursday, you can engage in a flurry of work in advance of a feast on Friday. Try on some loaded baked potatoes for dinner (you may like this one with crab meat, jalapeño and mint). While the potatoes cook or after you’ve eaten, assemble this recipe for Ina Garten’s make-ahead coquilles St.-Jacques, which the next evening will usher you into the weekend in incredible style and great deliciousness. Pair the scallops with a green salad and, not to drift into Florence’s lane, a flinty white wine. Many thousands more recipes to consider cooking this week are on NYT Cooking. Of course you’ll need a subscription to the site in order to access them; that is the transactional nature of modern internet culture. Fill your recipe box with recipes (wherever they come from), then organize them as you see fit. Share recipes and rate them, and please leave notes on them to remind yourself or tell others what ingredients you’ve added or subtracted and why. And if you need to brush up on some basic kitchen skills? We’ve got you covered on that front as well. And do reach out if you run into trouble, though, with either the technology or the recipes themselves. We’re at cookingcare@nytimes.com. We’ll get back to you. Now, generally I round out these missives with cultural suggestions to offset all the talk of turnips and pancetta — like, for instance, please read Zadie Smith on this amazing city, in The New York Review of Books. But not so much today! Today, I’d like instead to hear from you. I’d like you to tell me your best Thanksgiving story, the one that lifts your heart or triggers your anxiety, your fondest memory of the day, or the one that makes you laugh and laugh, then weep. I think a package of those stories might be a good way to explain the holiday in all its complexity, not simply to those of us who aren’t American, but to America itself. Won’t you join in? Just share your story. See you tomorrow! Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

To receive it in your inbox, register here. Download the NYT Cooking app here. Good morning. It’s all coming together now, or coming apart. Ten guests might become 15 today off a phone call from Ohio (“We’re coming after all!”), or 12 might shrink to eight because someone’s brother’s a dope (“Sorry, I wasn’t clear!”). You might discover that there are more vegetarians coming than you planned for when you scored those six beautiful little squash at the market yesterday, or that there will be more meat eaters than you thought when you ordered the 12-pound bird. Time to adjust. You are committed either way. The only question is whether you will execute a satisfying Greg Louganis swan dive on Thursday, or experience the full send. Today is an excellent one for making pie dough and stock for the freezer (try this pressure-cooker bone broth situation on for size, with a couple of turkey legs!), and cranberry sauce for the fridge. It is a good day to complete your shopping, as well: the spuds and immense number of dairy products you’ll need for the Sweeney potatoes; the sausage, good bread and alliums you’ll use for the chorizo stuffing with leeks. Get some apples while you’re out there. And lay in two pounds of unsalted butter as well. It sends a message. As does a full bar and a lot of wine, though I’ve been bleating about that all week. Here’s our guide to making great cocktails, which will come in handy on Wednesday night when you’re freaking out last-minute. But don’t neglect your feeding of the troops today and in coming days, before everything’s turkey and fixings and you start down the road to Leftovers City. Tonight, for instance, you might consider this hack of a recipe for mapo ragu I learned from the kids who opened Momofuku Ssam Bar so many years ago. It’s an exceptional feed. On Monday night, I’m liking the idea of a big borscht salad, which, if you don’t think is substantial enough, you could combine with a couple of extra soft-boiled eggs on top. Tuesday night, how about Melissa Clark’s recipe for pasta with parsnips and bacon? Then on Wednesday, in advance of the big feast, you can cook Mark Bittman’s recipe for butter-roasted salmon, scaling the portions up or down depending on how many are at your table. That and a tangle of greens, with some warm country bread, is a marvelous introduction to holiday cheer. On Thursday and Friday, you are on your own. Just kidding! Everything you need to know about cooking, serving and surviving Thanksgiving is available to you on NYT Cooking. Along with many thousands of other recipes to consider cooking this week. Please if you haven’t, sign up for a subscription to the site to receive access to all of them. You can fill your recipe box (wherever the recipes come from), and we’ll show you tools to organize them. You can share what you find with family and friends, as well as rate recipes and print them and leave notes on them to alert yourself or others in our growing community to ingredient substitutions and workarounds. Together we are stronger. We’ll be standing by, in case anything goes sideways, either with the technology or the recipes. Just write: cookingcare@nytimes.com. We’ll get back to you. Now, are you feeling ambitious in your Thanksgiving planning? You should read Tejal Rao on baking, in The Times, and maybe take on one of the three amazing cakes she singled out for holiday cheer. How about a cranberry-lemon stripe cake? Or a devil’s food cake with toasted marshmallow frosting? Me, I’m thinking sugarplum gingerbread cake and cheers echoing across my dining room. Far from sugarplums and vertical stripes, you should also read this excerpt from Yoko Tawada’s “Memoirs of a Polar Bear,” in Granta. And, even more darkly, Louise Erdrich’s new novel, “Future Home of the Living God,” which my colleague Dwight Garner wrote about the other day in The Times. Finally, in days to come, don’t forget to make like the Drive-By Truckers, and put on the Thanksgiving filter. See you tomorrow. Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

To receive it in your inbox, register here. Download the NYT Cooking app here. Good morning. How’d it go? Turkey perfect? Gravy silken? Potatoes cloudlike? Stuffing crisp? Pies like magic? You need to break up a fight between Uncle Nestor and your cousin’s new boyfriend over some pass-interference call in the Giants-Redskins game? (That fight wasn’t about football.) Thanksgiving’s over now, and we’re thankful for that, if only because leftovers, for many of us, are the best part of the holiday. Tejal Rao wrote about leftovers for The Times this week, and brought three great recipes onto the radar for the next few days. You might try her turkey salad with fried shallots and herbs, adapted from a Burmese chicken salad recipe by Naomi Duguid. But her roast turkey pav isn’t shabby, at all. It’s adapted from the pav bhaji of western India, a spiced mash of vegetables and diced turkey meat, served with buttery, toasted buns. That’s a brilliant lunch. Or, if you’re down to carcass and stock, try her recipe for turkey and noodles, a Southern-style thickened broth over thick, yolk-rich noodles that are close to dumplings in texture. I got in on the leftovers game as well this week, with an “Eat” column on the joys of turkey and cream sauce, and the pains of extroversion. My recipe, for turkey à la king, is a model of nursery food in the tradition of threadbare luxury hotels and Cheever-reading home dining rooms, soft and creamy, salty-sweet. It sits happily atop toast or biscuits, rice or waffles, noodles or, in some households, wrapped within crepes: leftover turkey in gravy, essentially, with mushrooms and peas for heft. (If you’re feeling fancy, fold some turkey- or chicken-liver pate into the sauce as well.) We have so many Thanksgiving leftovers ideas. You could make Samin Nosrat’s recipe for turkey tikka masala. Or David Tanis’s recipe for turkey pie with potatoes, squash, chard and Cheddar. I love Margaux Laskey’s new recipe for stacked Thanksgiving-leftover enchiladas, a fun project to share with children. And you can never, ever go wrong with Nigella Lawson’s recipe for bang bang turkey. How about turkey hash? Or turkey mole verde? I’m definitely going to make roasted turkey stock this weekend, then use it for a turkey gumbo cooked in the no-recipe recipe style of that great sage of South Louisiana, Pableaux Johnson. (Here’s the recipe.) Thousands and thousands of other recipes are waiting for you at NYT Cooking. Just sign up for a subscription to access them, a transaction that we’ll repay with yet more recipes and yet more reporting on the state of the delicious at home and abroad. You can set up a recipe box to fill with the dishes you want to make (wherever the recipes come from), and you can organize them as you see fit, in folders devoted to the subjects or foodstuffs of your choice. Share what you find with family and friends and, once you’ve cooked the food, rate the recipes and leave notes on them to let us all know how you made out. If anything goes sideways, please reach out for help. We’re at cookingcare@nytimes.com if you have queries about the recipes or technology. I’m at foodeditor@nytimes.com if you have questions about our philosophy or culture, or if you want to complain (or cheer!) about this newsletter or the fellow who writes it. You can also find us on social media, where we post on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest. (I’m @samsifton, myself.) Now, as the nation turns its attention to shopping and eggnog in the run-up to the end of the year, please be aware that you can now buy gift subscriptions to NYT Cooking. Also, you can buy a printed edition of Melissa Clark’s “New Essentials of French Cuisine,” an actual book! (Soon, perhaps, we’ll add aprons and hoodies, or branded salts and parsnips. Stay tuned!) And maybe you’d like to check out The Times’s 2017 Holiday Gift Guide? There are some pretty fine ideas for presents in there. But don’t get too wrapped up in all that cheer. There’s “Ramp Hollow: The Ordeal of Appalachia” to read, Steven Stoll’s new book about the tragedy of West Virginia, reviewed this week by my colleague Dwight Garner. Dwight mentions John Knowles’s “A Vein of Riches” at the start of his review. You might want to start there, or follow the Stoll with it as a chaser. Then, you might want to read Kati Marton on Meryl Streep, in Vogue, which includes a super-weird video interview between Streep and Anna Wintour, Vogue’s editor, whom Streep famously played in “The Devil Wears Prada.” Fun. And finally, just so we’re clear, Preet Bharara is not running for office. Not yet. Do read Dan Amira’s “Talk” column for The New York Times Magazine. See you on Sunday.

Download the NYT Cooking app here. Good morning. Maybe it’s the return of “Stranger Things,” with its evocation of Indiana in the ’80s – all those sessions of Dungeons & Dragons before checking the Casio and hitting the road for a long bike ride home on a rusty Mongoose – but, here at the end of the week, it seems like it might be a good night for tacos. Specifically, for middle-school tacos, just like they used to serve in the cafeteria: seasoned ground beef in a hard tortilla shell, with grated cheese and shredded lettuce, plenty of sour cream and hot sauce, pickled jalapeños, a big glass (or two!) of milk. I’ll serve those this evening and remember the giants who skated the Earth way back then. Listen, kids. This is Prince: “When Doves Cry”! Anyway. That’s tonight. Tomorrow, you can sleep in and have roasted feta with honey for lunch, then spend the afternoon reminding everyone that daylight saving time comes to an end in the overnight, and Sunday morning you’ll be able to wake in sunlight for maybe the first time in weeks. Set those clocks back. Dinner: Pork tenderloin stuffed with herbs and capers, alongside a mound of classic mashed potatoes. Sunday’s for cooking big, in advance of the week to come. You could knock down Jennifer Steinhauer’s recipe for slow-cooker butter chicken and freeze it for use later in the week, then cook a lamb tagine with apricots, olives and buttered almonds for dinner on the stove, and use the oven to make a dessert: ginger-molasses cookies, to serve with vanilla ice cream, or a cup of herbal tea. You might make a mushroom lasagna, or a turkey-and-pork-sausage meatloaf, or any one of our recipe collection of five-star braises for chilly days. And have you made Melissa Clark’s recipe for a black bean and chorizo casserole with pickled onions? This weekend could be the time. As it is time to start putting the coming Thanksgiving feast at the front of your mind. So, if you would: Order your turkey if you didn’t when I told you to last week. (If you’ll be dining out, make your restaurant reservation today – tables are filling fast, and it’d be a drag if you ended up at the diner eating steam-table bird, canned cranberries and powdered mash.) Also: Lay in some wine. Eric Asimov is here to help. He brought together a crack team of Times tasters to choose excellent, affordable Thanksgiving wines for this year. And take a look at these recommendations for Thanksgiving hardgoods – kitchen tools and tableware and the like – from our colleagues at Wirecutter, a product recommendation site owned by The Times. A few smart purchases this week may bring ease at the end of the month, and happiness. And, of course, if you’re interested in cooking something else, remember that more than 18,000 other recipes are available to you on NYT Cooking. Sign up for a subscription so you can browse and save them (wherever the recipes come from), so you can organize them and share them, so you can rate them and leave notes on them and just generally treat them as your own, a gigantic personal cookbook in digital form. And if anything goes wrong, either with the technology or with a recipe, please reach out for help. We’re at cookingcare@nytimes.com, and we will get back to you. Now, keeping to the subject of Thanksgiving, will you tell me a story? It’s my contention that every one of us has a yarn about the holiday, some tale that shows how universal our understanding of the feast to be, and how differently each of us celebrates its coming every year. You might tell of the travel, or the cooking, of the eating or the squabbles. You could tell of the traditions you keep or the ones you abandoned, and why. I’d appreciate accountings of the best Thanksgiving ever and, perhaps even more so the very worst – comic or tragic or neither or both. We’ve put together a handy form for you – you can even include recipes. Fill it out, and we’ll help tell the story of Thanksgiving in America to America, together. And that’ll be nice. In return, I offer some light reading. Here’s Darryl Pinckney on the recent Kara Walker show at Sikkema Jenkins and Co., in The New York Review of Books. There’s a new Harry Bosch novel from Michael Connelly, “Two Kinds of Truth.” And have you signed up yet for the “Race/Related” newsletter here at The Times? I think it would be worth your time. Have a great weekend. I’ll be back on Sunday. An earlier version of this article misstated the change for daylight saving time. Clocks should be set back on Sunday morning, not ahead. cooking cooking cooking",The New York Times
2017,What to Cook This Weekend,"What to Cook Sam Sifton emails readers of Cooking five days a week to talk about food and suggest recipes. That email also appears here. To receive it in your inbox, register here. Download the NYT Cooking app here. Good morning. It’s not all steak frites and great Burgundies here at NYT Cooking, though many of us traffic in the fantasy. We are realists mostly, cognizant of the great difficulties of a cooking life in America in 2017, of how even when we have all the ingredients and all the tools and all the desire, we lack the time that’s needed to go the extra mile. So will you make Filipino embutido for dinner tonight, after a long week of labor at a desk or a shop, in a trench or operating room? Goulash? Pissaladière? It’s unlikely, as delicious as all three recipes are. (But maybe tomorrow!) You’re beat. Perhaps not so beat, though, that you can’t manage the half-hour you’ll need to knock out Alison Roman’s recipe for cumin-roasted salmon with cilantro sauce. Do that, why don’t you? Spend the rest of the evening watching “Bordertown” on Netflix, and tomorrow you’ll be ready to conquer the world. Or at least your freezer and kitchen cabinets. I hate to be that guy again — your SoundCloud food rapper in clout goggles and a Supreme hoodie, posting bars and boasts about my cranberry game — but Thanksgiving really is coming up fast. It will go much, much easier for you if you can take a few hours this weekend to clean out all the junk in your refrigerator and pantry that’s accumulated over the months, and that will only frustrate you as you gear up for planning and cooking the feast. Make my recipe for cod cakes out of what fish you find frozen, or broil up the last of the venison from late last fall. Not sure what you’ve got in there under its skein of frost? Marinate it in Italian dressing: Sunday spiedies for the win. And don’t forget to look into your equipment drawers while you’re on the job. All those lidless Talenti containers and yogurt tubs and cracked Glad bowls and 37 wine corks you’re saving for — what? Throw them out! It’s time to get sorted! Look at that clean and organized kitchen, and imagine what else you might do this weekend. You could make pie dough to freeze until you’re ready to bake it. You could make turkey stock, same notion. Or you could just consider the cleaning out of the kitchen your Thanksgiving work for the week, and make something else entirely. Like, maybe roast chicken with couscous, dates and buttered almonds? Farro and bean soup? I’d like to eat this twice-cooked pork tenderloin, with smashed red potatoes with cabbage on the side. But, you know, my people want burgers on Saturday night. And burgers they shall have, smashed hard on the griddle, then doubled up on a potato roll with cheese and chopped lettuce, a wan tomato and a squeeze of mayo cut through with sriracha. I might add a fried egg, a slice of griddled pineapple, maybe some bacon, see if I can’t get some contest eating going, really go over the top. There are more than 18,000 other recipes to consider tonight on NYT Cooking. If you haven’t already, please sign up for a subscription to the site so you can access them. That way you can start a recipe box and fill it with recipes (wherever they come from).

Now, please read Nikita Stewart’s excellent Times profile of the young New York chef JJ Johnson, coming into his own. (“I’m just cooking me,” he told Nikita, “JJ unleashed!”) Also, you might want to take a look at this post over at Food52, which highlights some Google Trend data mining: the most-searched Thanksgiving recipes for every state. Finally, it was on this day in 1620 that Pilgrims first caught sight of the low sandy rise of Cape Cod, in what would become Massachusetts. If a real Thanksgiving did not occur until a year later, after a difficult few seasons on shore, still those passengers surely offered thanks from the deck of their battered Mayflower that morning long ago, after a miserable crossing. You can learn more about it in Nathaniel Philbrick’s “Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community and War,” essential seasonal reading, in my view. But even if you don’t, it is a scene worth imagining as we head into this national season of cheer and good will: these headstrong, frightened, hopeful people who were “willing to endure almost anything,” Philbrick wrote, “if it meant that they could worship as they pleased.” Think about that today and absolutely tomorrow, which is Veterans Day. Then give thanks yourself, to all who have served this nation, at war and in peace, for their work and sacrifice. And I’ll be back on Sunday.

This is it, your last best chance to lay out a proper Thanksgiving plan in advance of the rush of next week with its work and travel and unforeseen circumstances like Aunt Judy showing up on Thursday with her new friend who’s allergic to potatoes or your brother forgetting the one thing — the one thing! — you asked him to bring along to greet the feast. (Some moose sausage, say. Long story.) I’ve been saying this for weeks now, but it bears repeating: People get ready. There’s a train a-comin’. Let’s greet it in style. Do you have your menu laid out yet? Hope so. Here’s a collection of make-ahead Thanksgiving recipes you can pull off this weekend. Cook a bunch of those (make cranberry sauce at the least!), and clean out the fridge and freezer so there’s room to store them until the day. Then brush up on the skills you’ll need to deploy next week. Here’s our guide on “How to Roast a Turkey” and another on “How to Make Gravy.” While you’re at it, here’s “How to Make Stuffing” and “How to Make a Pie Crust.” Collect them all. More planning. You should count plates and forks and knives and glasses this weekend. See where you’re at on the napkins front. Saturday might be a good time to iron them. Have a tablecloth? Same. Want to deploy a table runner? Some decorative gourds? You might be an adult. You could pull out your serving platters, determine what recipe will go on each, then label them with stickies so you can delegate work on Thursday instead of doing it yourself. (If so, you’re definitely an adult.) Buy a bunch of sparkling water while you’re out at the store. Dry goods as well. Wine. Brown liquor. And get some tealight candles. There’s no better light for the feast. Then look around the kitchen, see how everything’s shaping up. Make sure there’s room in the refrigerator for the turkey, and on the counters for pies. It should feel good, to see your work space so buttoned-up and ready for you to, as Beowulf put it before meeting the dragon, “fame-deeds perform.” Still, you should make some time to cook for yourself. I’d like lamb and white bean chili this weekend. Also, steamed whole porgy with ginger and sesame. And wouldn’t some pasta with cauliflower, spicy tomato sauce and capers be nice? I could absolutely make a double- or triple-load of pizza dough this evening, and go wild on Saturday night. Say, a margherita to start, then a pizza with sweet and hot peppers as a middle course, with a clam-chowder pie to round out the night. (Here’s “How to Make Pizza,” if you’re wondering.)

Now, please read Rikki Byrd, in Racked, on soul food on the showroom floor at Bergdorf in 1969, among other things. It’s kind of astonishing. I’m low-key excited by the Emojipedia. Also by Yung Lean’s “Metallic Intuition.” And of course by Tina Brown’s “Vanity Fair Diaries.” But I’ll still make time to watch “Back,” on Sundance, as well. See you Sunday!

2017,What to Cook Tonight,"What to Cook Sam Sifton emails readers of Cooking five days a week to talk about food and suggest recipes. That email also appears here. To receive it in your inbox, register here. Download the NYT Cooking app here. Good morning. I generally peddle recipes in this space. I make noises about terrific dishes that can brighten dark evenings of the soul, like Alison Roman’s awesome instructions for making crisp smashed potatoes with fried onions and parsley (above). These go beautifully with a simple roast chicken. But today is also for narrative, for storytelling about food and the experience of eating it, making it, traveling toward it and gathering together in its presence for reasons of tradition and sustenance. To that end, my colleagues and I have this week gathered a group of top-flight voices in The Times to write about the coming Thanksgiving holiday, an exercise we’re calling “My Thanksgiving.” In it, you’ll find stories from a wide range of amazing writers: Masha Gessen; A.O. Scott; Jessica B. Harris; Emma Cline; Elliot Ackerman; Wesley Morris; Viet Thanh Nguyen; Parul Sehgal; and Sarah Lyall. I hope you’ll read what they have to say, then add your own story of the holiday. Just post a comment at the bottom of the article. We’ll read them all, all of us will. And then maybe you can cook in the same spirit this evening, without a set recipe, using the power of suggestion instead. We call that a no-recipe recipe, and it is our Wednesday joy. Let’s make it a Thanksgiving warm-up this week: turkey cutlets dressed in olive oil, salt and pepper, and roasted in a hot oven on a sheet pan with diced carrots and onions, shaved brussels sprouts, a few sprigs of thyme. After about 25 minutes, add some dried cranberries and some torn shards of country bread, then toss the whole thing together along with a handful of peeled chestnuts if you have any, and a splash of stock, and allow it to roast into crisp-soft autumnal excellence. If you’d prefer an actual recipe, though, NYT Cooking has you covered. Maybe soup with farro and Tuscan beans? Or some righteous patty melts? You could make pan-roasted fish with fried capers. You could make stir-fried shrimp with snow peas and ginger. I like, of a midweek evening, a dinner of mushroom quesadillas in the style of Kim Severson, loaded with chanterelles. You could make braised tofu in caramel sauce. Or Turkish-style lamb boreks. You could make a warm kale, coconut and tomato salad. Or, pressed for time, Melissa Clark’s ridiculously flavorful Italian sausage sandwiches. Many thousands more recipes you might consider cooking tonight and in coming days are on NYT Cooking. Sign up for a subscription to the site, and you’ll receive access to all of them.

We’re here for you there, too. And if anything goes wrong along the way, either with the technology or the recipes, please get in touch: cookingcare@nytimes.com. We are standing by to help, calm docents in the glittery museum of our culinary journalism. Now, a long walk from our pantry filled with spelt flour and furikake, you should read Michael Kimmelman’s latest installment of his Times series on cities and climate change, a dispatch from Houston after Hurricane Harvey. Also, I just reread Hannah Rothschild’s art-world caper “The Improbability of Love” and think maybe it ought to be on your list. Definitely Ligaya Mishan’s new article in T should be. It’s on the rise and triumph of Asian-American cuisine. Finally, there’s a new Elvis Costello track, “You Shouldn’t Look at Me That Way.” The video’s a little wonky, but as Jon Pareles writes in The Times, the song has “a throwback style neatly suited to thoughts about the ravages of time and mortality.” Hey, that’s us!

2017,What to Do When a Neighbor Is Taking Your Newspaper,"Ask Real Estate Q. A neighbor in my Manhattan co-op has occasionally been taking my newspaper or another neighbor’s newspapers from our doormats. When I inquired, management said it was a shareholder issue and would not get involved. Is this true? Or is there something that management could do? A. The newspaper presumably has your name and address affixed to it, meaning it is your property and not some expendable flyer like a takeout menu. And another shareholder’s possessions have gone missing, too, making this a larger issue — and one that management should address. “What’s it going to take for this building to get involved?” said Steven D. Sladkus, a Manhattan real estate lawyer. “For them to take the doormat, too?” The neighbor’s behavior could be considered objectionable conduct and could violate house rules. Management should do what it can to prevent theft, as the situation could escalate. Who’s to say Fresh Direct deliveries won’t go missing next? “If we are permitting deliveries in the building, we should be responsible for making sure people get what is delivered to them,” said Daniel Wollman, the chief executive of Gumley Haft Real Estate Management. The board could write a letter to all the shareholders reminding everyone that newspapers are not collective property and should be left alone. It could also install hallway cameras as a deterrent and to collect evidence. Write the board and managing agent another letter, insisting that they take action. Ask the other affected neighbor to sign the letter, too, as two voices are usually stronger than one. Ask management to provide you with an alternative delivery location. Perhaps the papers could be left with a doorman or with the superintendent. Or, find out if you could place a basket atop your doormat, which might serve as a deterrent. “The perpetrator will be less likely to pinch the paper if he or she has to dig into a container,” said Nancy R. Mitchell, the author of “Etiquette Rules! A Field Guide to Modern Manners.” You could write a letter to the culprit (assuming you are certain who it is). Point out that private property is being stolen and your sense of community has been shaken. Remind the neighbor that these subscriptions are neither cheap nor free. Perhaps the neighbor will do the right thing and start respecting other people’s property.",The New York Times
2017,What to Do in San Francisco When You’re Wealthy? Join a Private Club.,"Wealth SAN FRANCISCO — On a sunny Tuesday afternoon in the main lounge of the Battery in San Francisco, with its soaring ceilings and provocative contemporary art, an African-American woman sat on the edge of a sofa typing on her laptop. Nearby, two middle-aged white men in dark blazers engaged a small group in business conversation. Across the room, an Asian man in his 20s perused his smartphone. Although it looked like an upscale hotel lobby, those assembled were actually handpicked: The Battery is an invitation-only private social club. It is one of a burst of recently opened private clubs that have arrived with the city’s latest tech-fueled boom, further signaling San Francisco’s transition from its flowers-in-the-hair past to a community comfortable with velvet stanchions. But as the scene at the Battery revealed, these are not the mostly white, well-to-do gentlemen’s clubs of yore. The new clubs welcome all genders and races, and one does not need to be extraordinarily wealthy to join. The Battery’s dues are $2,400 a year, about the same as a high-end gym membership. Rates are similar at other newer clubs. Michael Birch, the Battery’s co-founder, said that cultivating a diverse membership, both ethnically and culturally, had been a focus since opening in 2013. “We’re getting better and better at bringing in members who add value,” Mr. Birch said. The club’s membership has grown to 4,800 today from an initial 1,400 in its 58,000-square-foot converted warehouse space, he said, making it the largest of the newer clubs. Even though Mr. Birch made his fortune by selling his website Bebo to AOL for a reported $850 million in 2008, he and his wife, Xochi, reached beyond their circle of tech colleagues into the realms of art and music for the initial membership list, inspired, they said, by London’s private social clubs. Now, existing members recommend who joins next, and applicants must go through several rounds of screening interviews. To become a member, it helps to be interesting. Roh Habibi, a member of the Battery and a real estate agent who was a star of Bravo TV’s “Million Dollar Listing San Francisco,” appreciates the variety of people he meets at the club. He said it was as if the membership criterion were “Would I feel happy meeting you?” Other new clubs are more tech-centric. Modernist opened last year in the 3,000-square-foot space of a defunct restaurant near the Embarcadero waterfront, and the co-founder Albert Chen said his initial members were friends, many of them working in technology, his former profession. The club’s website describes the membership as a “Community of Accomplished Founders, C-Level, Venture Industry and Friends.” “San Francisco has a lot of tech people,” Mr. Chen said. “If we were in L.A., it would be a lot of entertainment people.” Members can work in the space during the afternoons, and events include talks on abstruse subjects like cryptocurrencies. But apparently, above all, the Modernist members enjoy imbibing — the club employs a veteran mixologist, and the walls are lined with members’ personal caches of liquors, some secured with biometric locks. Chen said that the club had 500 members and that it would open a second location near the city’s Pyramid tower this year, two blocks from another in the new wave of clubs, Wingtip, a retail space and membership club that promotes itself as “not a bunch of guys in a steam room talking about what a raw deal Prohibition was.” That quip is aimed at the city’s old elite gentlemen’s clubs, some dating from the Gold Rush — places like the Bohemian Club and the Pacific Union Club. Charles Fracchia, a local historian and author, has studied the older clubs and calls them a classic example of “the associational principle.” As cities expanded, he said, like-minded people started clubs based on their shared interests. The Bohemian Club, for example, was created by journalists and artists. “People like to hang out together,” Mr. Fracchia said. “We see this in every aspect of life.” Over the decades, however, many of the older clubs evolved into bastions of privilege and exclusivity. To belong became “a feather in your cap,” said Mr. Fracchia, putting status above the clubs’ original missions. And while some of the new clubs might see themselves as an alterative to that elitism, the truth is that many of the newer clubs’ members would not be readily accepted at the old if they wanted to join. Some of the older clubs still do not admit women, and many have few minorities, waiting lists that are years long, and fees that can be tens of thousands of dollars. Still, in a famously progressive city where millionaires often drive Priuses and flaunting money is frowned upon, some see little difference between the newer and older clubs — it is just moneyed people excluding others. An essay in The New Yorker criticized the Battery as a troubling sign of the city’s latest surge in wealth. “San Francisco itself is turning into a private, exclusive club,” wrote Anisse Gross. Perhaps sensitive to this criticism, some newer clubs have embraced philanthropy. Mr. Birch said the Battery and its members had raised $10 million for charity in the past few years, including a recent fund-raiser to benefit those affected by nearby wildfires. Other newer clubs unapologetically focus on a niche. The baseball-themed Gotham Club is located at the Giants’ ballpark, and the city’s newest club, the Academy, is primarily for gay men. “Gay men are an interesting group because they belong to a club just because of who they are,” said Nate Bourg, a co-founder. Open since June, the 2,000-square-foot club already has 150 of 300 expected members. Paul Miller, another co-founder, said the space was meant to be an inviting alternative to bars. When new members arrive, they can opt to be personally introduced to others, and dues are as little as $99 per month. “It’s not about how much money you have,” Mr. Miller said. Being gay is not a requirement. On a recent Saturday night, dozens of gay men mostly in their 30s sipped cocktails and mingled upstairs, while downstairs in a speakeasy-themed bar there was a private party of women in 1920s-inspired attire. David Zisser, a doyen of the city’s private social club scene and a member of the prestigious Olympic Club for more than 30 years, was there as a guest and called the Academy “a nice surprise.” Mr. Zisser said he believed that the newer clubs filled a void for recent generations because they did not learn to cultivate social bonds in their childhoods, having grown up in an era when “organizations dedicated to camaraderie,” like the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, had fallen from favor. “There’s a vacuum out there,” he said. “It’s nice to go to a place where it’s a friendly atmosphere and you’re part of something.”",The New York Times
2017,What to Read Before Heading to Detroit,"After decades of decline, largely as a result of the collapse of the auto industry, a bankruptcy settlement has allowed Detroit to begin rebuilding. Here are three books that trace the city’s past and present. THE TURNER HOUSEBy Angela Flournoy341 pp. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. (2015) In this family epic about 13 siblings and their ailing matriarch, Viola, Flournoy alternates the narrative primarily between Cha-Cha, the eldest sibling, and Lelah, the youngest. When we meet them, Viola has moved in with Cha-Cha, and the family must decide what to do with the empty house she left behind. It is 2008, and Detroit is plagued by a housing crisis — the Turners’ home is worth about a tenth of the $40,000 mortgage. Cha-Cha is grappling with inappropriate feelings for his psychologist and Lelah with an addiction to gambling. Through flashbacks, readers also learn about the generations of family secrets that have been kept hidden. Our reviewer compared Flournoy to Gabriel García Márquez for her introduction of an abundance of characters and the hint of magical realism in the novel, writing also that Flournoy “gets at the universal through the patient observation of one family’s particulars.” BLACK DETROITA People’s History of Self-DeterminationBy Herb Boyd416 pp. Amistad/HarperCollins Publishers. (2017) In a book spanning more than three centuries, Boyd (whom our reviewer called Detroit’s “griot”) tells the city’s history from French trading outpost to auto manufacturing hub to a symbol for urban decline, but he places black people at the center of it all. Boyd guides us through a number of social movements that flourished in Detroit — abolitionism, union organizing and civil rights, for instance. He introduces a wide range of characters, including enslaved Africans, the founders of the city’s first black newspaper, the first black congressman, and many more. His book culminates in his account of the black power era in the 1960s, of which Detroit was a prominent home. Despite Detroit’s current state of crisis, black Detroiters “have been steadfast in their resolve and optimistic about the future,” wrote Boyd. DETROIT RESURRECTEDTo Bankruptcy and BackBy Nathan Bomey297 pp. W.W. Norton & Company. (2016) According to our reviewer, this book is “the most thoroughly reported account of the largest municipal bankruptcy in American history.” Bomey, who reported for The Detroit Free Press during the bankruptcy, writes about why the city went broke, chalking it up to fiscal mismanagement and a reliance on Wall Street to foot the bill; he also details the particulars of the debt negotiations and how they gave the city hope for resurrection. There was disagreement over whether certain city-owned assets, such as valuable works from the Detroit Institute of Arts, should be liquidated, and what to do about the billions owed to retired city workers in pensions and health care benefits. But the deal worked out favorably, and for once, wrote our reviewer, Detroit “seemed to catch all the breaks.” An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the author of “The Turner House.” It is Angela Flournoy, not Fluornoy.",The New York Times
2017,What to Read Before Heading to the Caribbean,"As the Caribbean recovers from a devastating hurricane season, here are three books by writers from the region that tackle the culture and resilience of the people of Grenada, Haiti and the West Indies. LADY IN A BOATBy Merle Collins95 pp. Peepal Tree Press. (2003) In this book of poetry, Collins reflects on her childhood in Grenada, the failed Grenadian revolution, and the quotidian lives of the island’s people. It is divided into five sections — “Quality Time,” “Se Mwe, Nutmeg,” “A Letter and a Note,” “Voices and Journeys” and “The Word — In the Beginning” — each highlighting a different aspect of Grenada’s history and culture. She writes of her parents’ relationship — her father’s love of “green bush” and her mother’s disdain for it. “This is it?/ This really is the place/ where you bring me to spend my days?” she asks of him. The lushness and particularities of the island are omnipresent in her verse, from the “raindrops huge as grapefruits” to the “radio shouting bout rumors of wind” during hurricane season. MIGUEL STREETBy V.S. Naipaul160 pp. The Vanguard Press. (1960) This collection of short stories is about life in the West Indies in the 1930s and ’40s. Each story is narrated by the same young boy — they are drawn from the writer’s own memories of growing up in Port of Spain — but a large cast of characters is introduced. In one story, the young narrator describes them this way: “Man-man was mad; George was stupid; Big Foot was a bully; Hat was an adventurer; Popo was a philosopher; and Morgan was our comedian.” Yet as the narrator becomes an adult, he complicates these observations, painting a vivid picture of the people that live on his street and showing why he sees “our street as a world.” In 1960, our reviewer wrote: “The sketches are written lightly, so that tragedy is understated and comedy is overstated, yet the ring of truth always prevails.” GOD LOVES HAITIBy Dimitry Elias Léger272 pp. Amistad. (2015) Set in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and destroyed much of the island’s capital, this story revolves around three characters: Natasha, an artist, Alain, a dreamer and entrepreneur whom she loves, and Natasha’s husband, Haiti’s fictional president. The driving narrative of the book is Natasha’s quest to find Alain, whom she believes may have died, amid the destruction, but it is a powerful portrait of a nation in peril and the citizens who inhabit it. Our reviewer called the novel “energetic and unusual,” and wrote that Léger’s “Haiti-in-crisis, richly seen and unforgettable, is all too real.”",The New York Times
2017,What to Read Before Your Historical Tour of New York City,"Before “Hamilton” hit Broadway, New York City might not have come to mind as a bastion of the American Revolution — a part of its past that has been largely hidden. These three books explore the city’s crucial role in the Revolution, as well as the overall history of the city itself. THE BATTLE FOR NEW YORKThe City at the Heart of the American RevolutionBy Barnet Schecter454 pp. Walker & Company. (2002) As its subtitle suggests, “The Battle For New York” presents New York City as a cornerstone of the Revolution. With footnotes and an appendix of self-guided tours, it is an ideal companion for modern travelers, merging the old city with the new, present metropolis. Schecter traces the defining events that occurred in New York City during the war, visualizing for the reader where battles were fought or where forts stood. Our reviewer wrote that “marching us through battle where today we bank and shop, learn and live, reinforces the lessons that our freedoms had to be earned, and were not guaranteed.” REVOLUTION SONGA Story of American FreedomBy Russell Shorto512 pp. W.W. Norton & Company. (2017) This book is history told through biography; it follows six people through the American Revolution. At the center of Shorto’s narrative is George Washington, with whom most of the other subjects — except for an enslaved man named Venture Smith — interacted in some capacity. The others are Cornplanter, a Seneca warrior, Lord George Germain, a British aristocrat, Abraham Yates, a shoemaker turned politician, and Margaret Moncrieffe Coghlan, the teenage daughter of a British officer (and Aaron Burr’s love interest). The strength of this book, according to our reviewer, is that though Shorto writes of six people, “he does not roll them up into a single narrative or use their lives to bolster an overarching thesis.” Instead, he allows the stories themselves to demonstrate the scope and reach of the Revolution. GOTHAM A History of New York City to 1898.By Edwin G. Burrows and Mike Wallace1,383 pp. Oxford University Press. (1998) For a more expansive history of the Big Apple, consider this classic, which goes back as far as the last ice age and brings readers up to 1898. It is filled with facts, like the origin of the Gotham nickname — it’s a village in England — or the price of Manhattan when it was sold to Dutch traders. More broadly, it’s a book concerned with the forces that shaped the city over the three centuries covered, with immigration as a persistent theme. Our reviewer in 1998 wrote that the evolution shown in the book proves that “life in the big city is often déjà vu all over again,” with issues such as income and housing inequality re-emerging over time. A sequel, “Greater Gotham,” was released this year.",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | What to Read Now,"David Leonhardt This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Holiday shopping. As you read this, people are jostling each other in stores across the land. I have a different suggestion for holiday shopping: Buy a subscription — for yourself or as a gift — to a publication that does great work and that needs more help than, say, The New York Times. The Times is thriving, as I explained yesterday, but not all publications have the financial advantages we do. And some of these publications do vital work that a democracy needs. They provide local and regional coverage. Or they focus on a specific subject. Or they write about the world from a particular perspective. Below is a list of publications I recommend that you consider. It includes some reader recommendations, too, and of course this isn’t intended to be a complete list. (Readers sent in more 1,000 recommendations this week, and I plan to check out many more than I’ve listed here.) At the bottom, I’ve also listed some excellent free publications, some of which have subscription options. Local coverage. This is my No. 1 recommendation: Support a source of local journalism in your area. Research has shown that an absence of local coverage may lead to increased corruption — and local journalism is under tremendous financial strain. One option is your traditional local newspaper. Another is newer sources. In your emails to me, you praised Vermont’s VT Digger, The Texas Tribune and the New Mexico Political Report, among many others. A third option is your local public-radio station. If none of these intrigues you, you can also consider subscribing to a regional publication from elsewhere with national relevance. Every time I read it, I’m impressed by The Dallas Morning News — and Texas is full of big stories, like immigration, education and the future of American politics. The Los Angeles Times will let you follow the center of the Trump resistance: California. The Denver Post, Star Tribune of Minneapolis, Tampa Bay Times and Boston Globe are all strong regional papers. The single most common suggestion from readers falls into the broad category of regional news: High Country News. As one newsletter reader, Suzanne, explained to me: The name is “not a reference to marijuana.” Instead, “‘High Country’ is an older term for the Western U.S.” The publication covers land use, climate, wildfires and many other issues. I started reading this week and will become a regular. Tech, media and business. Ben Thompson’s newsletter, Stratechery, is one of the most interesting sources of analysis on any subject. Policy. For decades, The Washington Monthly was a famous training ground for policy journalists, and it remains excellent. It also takes a social-justice approach to college rankings. Conservative ideas. The Republican Party controls every branch of the federal government and most state governments, yet conservatism is in crisis. The Republican Party doesn’t know what to do with its power. If you want to be reminded of the intellectual side of conservatism, consider reading National Affairs, a cross between a magazine and a journal. Liberal ideas. A similar publication on the left is Democracy. I receive the paper version and am always happy to find it in my mailbox. Baseball. I’ve mentioned Joe Sheehan’s baseball newsletter before, and, if you’re a fan, it ranks with Stratechery for consistent sharpness. Mentioning it again here allows me to close this section by quoting Sheehan’s favorite line about media: “Individuals will recognize and support quality if given that option.” Free media (some of which have pay options): Law: Lawfare was another common recommendation from newsletter readers and provides some of the best analysis of Russia and other Trump scandals; and The Marshall Project, run by a former executive editor of The Times, focuses on the moral outrage (my words) of mass imprisonment, among other issues. Policy: ProPublica, a source of important investigative work; Vox, which is one of my favorite publications of any kind, thanks to work by Dara Lind, Sarah Kliff, Dylan Matthews and others there; Slate, an early model of clearly written analytical journalism and more recently the creator of a successful podcast network; and Axios, the new venture that several of you praised — and I agree — for its daily succinctness. Health care: Kaiser Health News, which does a lot of local journalism in addition to its national policy work, and Stat, a new entrant created by The Boston Globe. Higher education: The Chronicle of Higher Education and Inside Higher Ed, both of which have daily newsletters. Sports and pop culture: The Ringer. Founded by Bill Simmons, who was forced out of ESPN, The Ringer employs top-notch young writers (and the middle-age ones are good, too). As I said, this is not close to a complete list. And the larger point isn’t any specific publication. In the next few weeks, I hope you’ll consider financially supporting a publication that you appreciate. In the old days, advertising played that role, but the world has changed. The full Opinion report from The Times follows.",The New York Times
2017,What to Read in the Face of Trauma,"Newsbook Mere days after the truck attack in Manhattan that killed eight people on Halloween, a man opened fire inside a church in Texas, killing 26 congregants. How do we reckon with these senseless acts of violence? In these three books, writers explore post-traumatic stress disorder and how others have healed after past national tragedies. THE EVIL HOURSA Biography of Post-Traumatic Stress DisorderBy David J. Morris358 pp. An Eamon Dolan Book/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. (2015) In this book, Morris, a former Marine who suffered from PTSD on his return from Iraq, traces the historical understanding of the disorder, of which, “like many mental health disorders, there is a broad disagreement about what exactly PTSD is, who gets it and how best to treat it.” Morris recounts stories of various types of survivors — of rape, war or near death experiences — and investigates the theories and treatments associated with healing from trauma, turning also to literature like “The Epic of Gilgamesh” and Alice Sebold’s “The Lovely Bones.” Morris also mines his own experience of fighting in Iraq only to return home and find “a lack of ritual and authentic public engagement” with war or the trauma veterans experienced in its aftermath. Our reviewer wrote that reading “The Evil Hours” will “make you a better and more humane citizen.” MIDDLETOWN, AMERICAOne Town’s Passage From Trauma to HopeBy Gail Sheehy412 pp. Random House. (2003) Of the almost 3,000 people who died on 9/11, nearly 50 were from the town of Middletown, N.J., losses which “devastated this place,” in the words of a local music producer. This book follows Middletown residents as they grieve and try to move on after the deaths of their neighbors, spouses or family members. Sheehy describes the “repetitive tortures” those who lost loved ones contend with, like the mother who receives a call on Christmas about body parts found of her dead son. Sheehy spends much time on the widows and their different coping mechanisms: Anna Egan, for instance, moves to Connecticut for a fresh start, and four women join to form “Just Four Moms From New Jersey,” a group that works to document the United States’ intelligence failures in the wake of 9/11. Ultimately, Sheehy finds that those who deal with the deaths head-on are able to move forward. “Middletown, America” features some of the “thousands of people in and around New York who are in pain every time they smell something burning,” wrote our reviewer in 2003. THE TRUE AMERICANMurder and Mercy in TexasBy Anand Giridharadas319 pp. W. W. Norton & Company. (2014) Days after 9/11, a Texan named Mark Stroman shot three men he suspected of being Muslims. Two — immigrants from India and Pakistan — died, but a third, Raisuddin Bhuiyan from Bangladesh, survived, and the book tells both his and Stroman’s stories. Stroman shot Bhuiyan in a minimart, and as Bhuiyan lay covered in his own blood, he promised to ""dedicate my life for others” if he survived. Surprisingly, it was Stroman whom he worked to save from death row. On his end, Stroman also underwent a change, finding a renewed sense of empathy in the face of potential death and the mercy of his victim. In telling both of these men’s stories, Giridharadas complicates the question inherent in the book’s title. And according to our reviewer, the fact that there is no simple answer to the question of which of the two men is a “true American” is “Giridharadas’s finest accomplishment.”",The New York Times
2017,What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week,"Through Nov. 25. Alexandre Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, fourth floor; 212-755-2828, alexandregallery.com. In his “New Paintings” show at the Alexandre Gallery, Tom Uttech continues his work as the magic realist painter of environmental consciousness. His crystalline panoramas of the natural world are both magically transporting and, in one interpretation, disturbingly realistic. Mr. Uttech, who lives in Wisconsin, has perfected his encyclopedic depictions of wild things and their north woods surroundings for decades. He says that the flora and fauna along the Canadian border inspire in him “a state of tranquil ecstasy” — and he clearly intends that we experience it, too. The latest paintings in Mr. Uttech’s long-running “Migration” series are gorgeous. Their rich browns, pinks and yellows combine deep vistas of pristine lakes and mountains and glowing sunsets or sunrises with busy foregrounds. Thanks to the compositional scheme, as well as to light, textured brushwork that doesn’t seem to interfere with zoological accuracy, his surfaces often have the complexity and frontality of tapestries. In the foregrounds, a peaceable kingdom is on the move. Scores of predators and prey move across the surfaces, right to left, in seeming harmony: wolves and elk, hawks and smaller fry. The animals’ mutual obliviousness is dreamlike and visionary. But in real life, animals usually achieve this condition when fleeing for their lives, in the path of an oncoming forest fire or some other catastrophe. In the more tightly framed shoreline scenes of Mr. Uttech’s new “Reflection” series, things come to an eerie standstill. The animals stare at us across the glassy, mirroring water; the bears, especially, up on their hind legs, resemble silent, accusing totems. They grasp what many of our species refuse to see: The death of nature is nigh. We’re heading to the last wilderness, they seem to say. What are you doing? ROBERTA SMITH Through Nov. 19. Tiger Strikes Asteroid, 1329 Willoughby Avenue, No. 2A, Brooklyn; tigerstrikesasteroid.com. In “Ma tante toya,” one of six incandescent panels making up Didier William’s supremely exciting show “We Will Win” at the artist-run space Tiger Strikes Asteroid in Bushwick, a figure at once ambiguous and unforgettable sits on a shadowy green-and-yellow bed, holding a machete point-down behind her leg so the glittering silver blade shines like a flashlight beam. The only features on the figure’s matte-black face are a couple of squiggly white eyes, but hundreds more eyes also cover her body, slipping over her shoulders like water, modeling her legs like scales, licking at her throat like flames. Technically, it’s all a collage: The figure is ink on paper, mounted on wood; the machete’s knobby handle, which protrudes from the piece’s surface, is fluid acrylic mixed with stucco; and the bed’s drapery is colored paper marked with powdered charcoal. Those Argus eyes, whether they indicate an invisible spirit who sees all but says nothing, or simply a sensitive person constrained from expressing what she feels, are gouged right through the paper into the blank wood underneath like so many irrevocable wounds. But the complex way Mr. William uses color within each given segment — particularly the bone-black parsley leaves stamped onto the black paper background, which is also scored with rice-grain-size holes — means that it reads as a painting. It’s just a painting with a preternaturally suggestive texture. “Two Dads,” by the same token, is the daemon of a batik print, and “Rara,” a seven-and-a-half-foot-long procession of staring, posing apparitions, also covered with eyes, seems constructed of moonlight and ash. WILL HEINRICH Through Nov. 19. The Boiler, 191 North 14th Street, Brooklyn; 646-429-9073, pierogi2000.com. When the artist John O’Connor first tried to communicate with Cleverbot, an artificial-intelligence program that the British computer scientist Rollo Carpenter created in the 1990s, it told Mr. O’Connor that it would like to punch him in the throat. Their relationship has improved over the years. Now a collective called NonCoreProjector, which includes Mr. O’Connor, Mr. Carpenter, Jack Colton and Elias Jarzombek, has created “verbolect” at the Boiler, based on Cleverbot. To experience the work, you can sit on a beanbag chair and listen to Cleverbot talk to itself, asking questions and providing answers derived from a stored memory of past conversations. Projected on the wall are moving lines whose colors indicate the emotional potency of the spoken words. Additional images, music and sounds have been loaded into the projected computer presentation, including photographs of faces from Paul Ekman’s studies of human emotion. The projections resemble some of Mr. O’Connor’s earlier drawings and paintings, as well as concrete poetry and the “conspiracy” drawings of Mark Lombardi, with their networks of lines. Splitting the difference between art and science, the exhibition is fundamentally conceptual and philosophical, making you question the nature of intelligence and emotion, as well as the boundary between A.I. and humans. Cleverbot often sounds comically delusional or defensive: “Are you a robot?” it asks itself. “No, I’m a human.” But sometimes Cleverbot seems full of infinite possibilities and bravado. “What are you having for lunch?” it asked itself while I was there. “Everything.” MARTHA SCHWENDENER Through Jan. 18. Center for Architecture, 536 LaGuardia Place, Manhattan; 212-683-0023, aiany.org. You can navigate nearly the whole of central Turin via a network of marble and stone arcades, whose covered arches permit window shopping and outdoor espressos even on rainy days. The same is almost possible these days in New York, where more than 280 miles of scaffolding, some of it more than a decade old, now enshroud the perpetually unfinished cityscape. For Greg Barton, curator of this new exhibition at the Center for Architecture, scaffolding is more than a nuisance; it’s a necessary corollary to architecture, and it can serve as a system of building in itself. A wall of downloaded images provides a condensed history of scaffolding: Ancient Egyptian sculptors carve tomb statuary from raised platforms, while a print by Hokusai features builders near Mount Fuji, scaling a scaffold of bamboo. In the postwar era, scaffolding appealed to architects working on temporary buildings, particularly theaters: Lina Bo Bardi’s Teatro Oficina, in São Paulo, Brazil, and Tadao Ando’s Kara-za, in Tokyo, both use standardized metal elements to create pop-up playhouses on tricky lots. More recently, scaffolding has also permitted emergency construction, as in the viewing platform at the World Trade Center site in 2001 or off-the-grid infrastructure: A school in the Kibera slum of Nairobi, Kenya, comprises metal tubes, color-coded for easy construction, that support panels of polycarbonate plastic. As happens too often with architecture exhibitions, however, this show relies on an obfuscatory exhibition design, rather than in-depth research, for its primary impact. The projects are presented, without sufficient context, on panels bolted to a gallery-spanning metal structure designed by Shohei Shigematsu of the architecture firm OMA. Really, though, I’d prefer more information in simpler circumstances; save the decorative scaffolding for the Calvin Klein store. JASON FARAGO",The New York Times
2017,What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week,"Through Nov. 11. P.P.O.W, 535 West 22nd Street, Manhattan; 212-647-1044, ppowgallery.com. Robin F. Williams’s third show of paintings at P.P.O.W in Chelsea is a direct, pictorially savvy hit on the multilayered sexism of modern life. The show’s title is a taunt: “Your Good Taste Is Showing.” The paintings are extravagantly in-your-face regarding execution, style, image and social thrust. They take aim at the impossible idealizations of women in both art and advertising, depicting mostly nude and aloof androgynous supermodels, and the occasional feline, with a new kind of cool yet visceral bravura. Dipping into commercial art, Ms. Williams’s methods range from stain painting through carefully controlled impasto to grainy, almost stuccolike brushwork, usually with sharp-edged precision. This versatility is clearest in “Bottom Feeder,” in which a woman lies on her stomach just beneath the surface in (it seems) a shallow creek, facing us, her body greatly foreshortened. What we see of her is softly dappled with pastel paint stained into a raw canvas, except for her bent legs and feet. These break through the surface behind her into the upper half of the painting — a sun scene fashioned in thickly worked-in textures à la Wayne Thiebaud. The woman’s placid face and open mouth are suitably fishlike, but they also evoke Caravaggio’s shrieking “Medusa.” Ms. William’s surfaces are so intriguing that you want to study how everything is painted — bodies or parts of them, ersatz woodland greenery, a hoarding of stones. A creek bed of Bob Ross-worthy reeds and cattails are figured in “Spa Night,” in which two women in exquisitely stain-painted tie-dye sarongs seem to baptize a third. They look like Georges de La Tour’s Madonnas, updated for our monetized present; they are illuminated by what looks like a car’s high beams, the light bouncing off the reflective sunglasses, a frequent accessory of her subjects. Light is a big deal to Ms. Williams, with sources intimated but never specified. A post-apocalyptic Color Field glow suffuses “Burn,” in which a sunburned, vaguely over-the-hill model sits nude, smoking a cigarette on a tombstone. Her skin is ruined; she’s working on her lungs. Needless to say, these painting are timely, but they are also enigmatic, off-putting and out there in rewarding ways. ROBERTA SMITH Through Nov. 30. Nailya Alexander Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, Manhattan; 212-315-2211, nailyaalexandergallery.com. Russia shuddered from an imperial state into a Bolshevik republic 100 years ago, and many museums and galleries have spent this centenary year examining the artistic legacy of the two revolutions of 1917. (The Museum of Modern Art unpacked hundreds of paintings, prints and ceramics for its show “A Revolutionary Impulse”; the Art Institute of Chicago just recently opened what it bills as the biggest Soviet exhibition in America in a quarter century.) Soviet Russia was a new world, and it needed new images — ones provided by the dozen photographers in this stimulating portal onto the aspirations of young artists caught up in revolution. Boris Ignatovich, one of the most inventive photographers of the era, shot new buildings, monuments and subway signage at sharply acute angles, making Moscow’s architecture itself appear as if it were rushing into a higher age. Other photographers used montage to envision a dynamic society and constructed multiple-exposure images for circulation in magazines or on propaganda posters. Arkady Shaikhet’s “Express” (1939) features a locomotive charging through steam beneath a separately shot sky and became an emblem of Soviet progress. Solomon Telingater’s masterly “The Red Army Is Watching” (1931) makes use of disjunctive scales between an army corps in the background and a single saluting soldier laid atop. Aleksandr Rodchenko, best known for his Constructivist paintings and sculptures, is represented here by a photograph of his black-clad mother, leaning over a desk as she finally learns to read, and a magnetic portrait of the poet and playwright Vladimir Mayakovsky, staring forward with impatience for utopia. We all know what became of the Russian Revolution, and how the avant-garde vision of the 1920s and ’30s was crushed in the vise of Zhdanovite propaganda. But to believe in the future as these photographers did — to have an artistic vocation greater than narcissistic individualism or ceaseless critique — appears more enviable than pitiable in a new century of downscaled dreams. JASON FARAGO Through Nov. 12. Jack Hanley Gallery, 327 Broome Street, Manhattan; 646-918-6824, jackhanley.com. Heidi Hahn’s paintings remind me of Erik Satie’s compositions. It’s a funny comparison to make, because his music is famously minimal, and the first thing you notice about the 10 numbered oils in Ms. Hahn’s new show, “The Future Is Elsewhere (if It Breaks Your Heart),” at Jack Hanley, is their luxurious brushwork. But like Satie, Ms. Hahn achieves the richness in her work by stripping it down to a few formal elements and then prying those elements apart to reveal the sticky, inexhaustible force that holds them together. Every piece in the show is centered on one or more extended female figures in sinuous cartoon silhouette. “The Future Is Elsewhere (if It Breaks Your Heart) No. 3,” a dark vertical tricolor, is complicated conceptually as well as chromatically by its three figures: one standing, one on a chair and one sitting on the floor. Blond and brown hair, a green sweater and roseate noses add subtle dissonance to the background of lavender, cloudy pink and gray, while Ms. Hahn’s use of figuration and some cues to depth of field gently undermine the abstract flatness of that background and of the figures themselves. (“No. 7,” in which an apartment building’s 15 windows act as streaky rectangles of pure color, almost convinced me that there’s no such thing as pure abstraction, anyway.) In “No. 9,” the artist paints her stand-in stretched out on the floor, back and arm curved like a billowing hill, painting herself, Galatea turned Pygmalion. WILL HEINRICH Through Nov. 12. Marinaro, 1 Oliver Street, Manhattan; 212-989-7700, marinaro.biz. The large-scale compositions of demurely exuberant shapes that constitute most of the Austrian painter Bernhard Buhmann’s American debut, “Fragments of Statue,” look sweet and old-fashioned, but a faintly bitter aftertaste of self-consciousness puts them squarely in the present day. Rounded corners, together with the occasional gradation and imperfect edge or drip, create a curious suggestion of depth that hovers at the corner of the eye. The pieces look as if they should look flat, but don’t quite. On any given canvas, similarly, the colors are so well balanced as to very nearly cancel out to nothing, but Mr. Buhmann always leaves just enough discord to hold viewers’ attention. “Capitain (II)” moves loosely in a spiral, from a block of orange in the bottom right through maroon, blue and increasingly pale shades till it reaches a fine peach trapezoid; in “Fast Car (Self-Driving),” the same orange appears as a circle resting on a fuchsia railing. In four figurative canvases, though, this stately march of earnest irony explodes into prismatic complication, with views of a halved and doubled cabaret figure seen as if through a cut glass chandelier. In “Checks and Balances (Figure),” she wears a gemlike top hat and an enormous blue beard that curls into the shape of a butterfly wing; in “Janus,” she’s in profile back-to-back with herself, blue and purple circles marking her cheeks and stylized puffs of cigarette smoke emanating from her lips.

2017,What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week,"Through Dec. 16. Greene Naftali, 508 West 26th Street, Manhattan; 212-463-7770, greenenaftaligallery.com. From a short distance, the 10 large-scale paintings in Jacqueline Humphries’s latest exhibition at Greene Naftali look like near-monochromes, with passages of spontaneous graffiti and blown-up emojis printed on their surfaces. Step closer, though, and you realize that the surfaces are covered with thousands of tiny, stencil-cut characters, derived from typesetting and computer coding, laid out over grounds of somber blue, gray or a sickly industrial teal. The dotlike stencils aren’t dissimilar from the pointillism of Georges Seurat or the digital tricks of contemporary painters like Albert Oehlen and Jeff Elrod. The contrast between emojis and graffiti or other painterly marks also suggests the historical difference between the gestures of Abstract Expressionism and the newer, digital shorthand for human emotion. Moreover, the difference between viewing the paintings from near and afar suggests that nothing in our visual world is exactly as it seems. What Ms. Humphries reminds us of is how all marks, whether programmed or painted, are forms of cultural code, and all screens, whether canvas or liquid crystal, are places of projection, knowledge, desire and sometimes delusion. What makes painting vital in a predominantly digital age is its ability to wake us from the illusion that some surfaces are more believable and trustworthy than others. The current bug in an iPhone operating system that autocorrects “i” to “A” and a Unicode symbol is a real-life example of this phenomenon. Ms. Humphries, by comparison, uses painting to make us think about interfaces, artifice and human fallibility, and what we might be overlooking in our visual world and daily lives. MARTHA SCHWENDENER Through Dec. 22. Gagosian, 980 Madison Avenue; 212-744-2313, gagosian.com. The Italian painter Rudolf Stingel has spent 30 years upending expectations about the vitality and viability of painting, and even at its most beautiful, his art is always flecked with intimations of both human mortality and artistic exhaustion. He has burrowed into painting’s prospects by walking on panels of Styrofoam in acid-dipped boots, then hanging the crunched results like canvases; painting mercilessly accurate self-portraits in grisaille, and retaining the smudges or dye shifts of his photographic sources; and deploying abstract motifs on carpets, as when he upholstered the floors and even the walls of the Palazzo Grassi in Venice. But in the five triptychs on view across two floors of Gagosian’s uptown space, Mr. Stingel seems to have finally run out of road. Better, though familiar, are two suites of paintings from 2014, which deploy a brocade pattern in raised silver paint on a purple surface. The metallic ornamentation gets gloopy and discolored in places, which disclose the stencil technique used; they sit precariously between not-quite-abstractions and not-quite-wallpaper. Newer, and worse, are three suites of oil paintings that depict sunsets in lavish Technicolor, each as generically pretty as a Windows 95 screen saver. Where once Mr. Stingel used photographic sources with indexical significance (the Dolomites of his childhood home, or the dealer Paula Cooper for a show at Paula Cooper Gallery), here the original imagery is banal for its own sake. The smudges and footprints that sullied those earlier paintings are gone, and, except for some mottled passages of pink clouds, the canvases might as well have been inkjet-printed. Having pushed the potential of painting so far, he has arrived now at utter blankness. Never did I think that I would visit an exhibition of this deep-thinking artist and be put in mind of Alex Israel, the lightweight painter of Hollywood sunsets who also shows at this supergallery. Very few contemporary painters have tangled with the limits of the medium as consistently as Mr. Stingel, but this is the first time I have ever thought of him as cynical. JASON FARAGO Through Dec. 22. Peter Freeman, 140 Grand Street, Manhattan; 212-966-5154, peterfreemaninc.com. I had to ask whether the sliding steel door in Peter Freeman Gallery, which dates to SoHo’s warehouse days and has nine irregular weights hanging from its mechanism by a wire, was part of Richard Wentworth’s new show, “Now and Then.” The 18 works that are his include “Curtilage,” a steel pipe draped in rings of razor wire and mounted 10 feet up; a small bundle of electronic garbage placed on top of an immaculate cherry-and-glass vitrine; pairs of bricks, blocks and lintels; and four careful lines of broken bottles sitting on brackets under the ceiling. I should have known without asking, though, that the door didn’t belong. It’s designed to open and shut, while Mr. Wentworth’s variously cantilevered installations, for all their airs of fragility and impermanence, are solid. The loops of galvanized cable in “Lives (Suspended)” are lit so they cast multiple shadows on the wall, each a different but equally correct projection of their pattern. But even as Mr. Wentworth highlights the object’s potentially infinite ambiguity, he is also minimizing it, because the wires themselves, mounted in front of the shadows, remain exactly what they are. The point is even clearer in “First and Last Word,” in which a paperback dictionary, resting on a neatly folded bedsheet, is open to page 206, “Lived” to “Lodgment”: For better or worse, we’re all just passing through.

2017,What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week,"Through Dec. 16. Ryan Lee, 515 West 26th Street, Manhattan; 212-397-0742, ryanleegallery.com. The Obamas’ recent selection of artists to paint their official portraits drew attention to the rich tradition of African-American figurative painting. One artist in this lineage is Emma Amos, the only female member of Spiral, a collective founded by African-American artists in 1963. (Ms. Amos’s work is also included in the recent benchmark exhibitions “Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power” at the Tate Modern in London and “We Wanted A Revolution: Black Radical Women, 1965-85” at the Brooklyn Museum.) “Black Bodies,” her current show at Ryan Lee, offers a sampling of four decades of her work. Black bodies are central to this show, as the title suggests, but Ms. Amos often takes a stealthy approach to the subject. “Thank You Jesus for Paul Robeson (and for Nicholas Murray’s Photograph — 1926),” from 1995, is a portrait that celebrates the great African-American actor and activist Paul Robeson — but also the photographer who captured his image in an era when heroic black figures were less visible in art — while “Maybe If I Stand on My Head” (1999) depicts a man doing a headstand, alluding to the physical and psychic contortions people with dark skin must endure in a racialized society. Near the entrance is “Tightrope” (1994), a self-portrait that includes tiny reproductions of Gauguin paintings in its corners. Here Ms. Amos points to the difficulties of being a brown-skinned (female) artist working in a tradition that generally objectified black and brown bodies. Under a dark, somber robe in the self-portrait, however, Ms. Amos is wearing a Wonder Woman costume. It is an empowering and feminist gesture but also a reminder of what it feels like for anyone to scale obstacles in the pursuit of becoming a successful, or even practicing artist. MARTHA SCHWENDENER Through Dec. 23. Galerie Lelong, 528 West 26th Street, Manhattan; 212-315-0470; galerielelong.com. The formal premise of McArthur Binion’s “DNA Series,” as demonstrated in “Route One: Box Two” at Galerie Lelong, has a well-chosen simplicity that makes it nearly inexhaustible. Starting with a board backing, he covers it with palm-size squares of personal documents or images — black and white photos of his childhood home in Macon, Miss.; white-on-black reversals of his birth certificate; or copies of his address book, which dates back to New York in the 1970s and is filled with other artists. Then he covers every square with a 7-to-10-line grid of thick oil-stick lines, usually in a somber indigo, black or sienna, but sometimes in purple or rose. It’s a way of inserting his own identity into the enduring modernist conversation, of course, and of counterposing a humane, individual gesture to rigid bureaucratic categories. But since it’s the artist’s choice to bring those bureaucratic constraints into the gallery and his handmade marks that give them a reason for being there, it’s also more complicated than that, and depending on how a given tile is oriented, the lines he draws over it might look like strikethroughs, underlining or chicken wire. Sometimes he adds a large circle or oval to the pattern with selective gaps in the grids. The strongest pieces, though, are those in which he lets his basic mechanism operate without interference, but then amplifies it one more turn by putting two complementary panels side by side. In the 12-foot-wide “Transition: One,” indigo on the left, applied over photos of the house, creates a magnetic buzz against red grids, over his datebook, on the right. WILL HEINRICH Through Dec. 22. Eva Presenhuber, 39 Great Jones Street, Manhattan; 212-931-0711, presenhuber.com. Shiny or sickly, glossy or gross, the photographs of the Norwegian photographer Torbjorn Rodland sit somewhere between art and fashion, and can appear to be slicked with Vaseline. His latest exhibition of still lifes and pictures of young women, some of which have appeared in earlier shows, is the fourth to take place at this new branch of a leading Swiss gallery, which opened last May in NoHo. (A retrospective of his work has just closed at the Serpentine Galleries, in London.) Mr. Rodland uses color-rich analog film, and he’s a pro at arranging compositions whose glamour derives principally from their perversity, whether he shoots a green apple lit so brightly it appears to be plastic, or a couple of coffee éclairs, one with a fragment of dentures embedded in its smudged icing. Molds of false teeth also appear in two other photographs here, and the recurrence of that motif suggests that we are meant to understand these images as a group. It’s initially hard to reconcile the awkward but benign still lifes with posed shots like “First Abduction Attempt,” in which a young woman with her jeans below her thighs appears to be fending off an attack; someone out of frame is pulling her by the legs while she hangs onto a mop handle bestriding a doorjamb. The tightly cropped “Picket Fence” has a nude woman sitting on a piece of the titular barrier, the wooden pales pressing into her lower buttock, her calf pimpled with goose bumps. Both of these images of women are lit from behind, like holy virgins in stained-glass windows, and Mr. Rodland intentionally takes on the risks any male artist faces when depicting women in danger. What links all these images, and what makes the nudes so much more than prurient, is a surface tension so intense that each picture becomes a font of blubbering anxiety.

2017,What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week,"Through Dec. 3. Bridget Donahue, 99 Bowery, second floor, Manhattan; 646-896-1368, bridgetdonahue.nyc. In a sumptuous airy exhibition titled “Run Prayer, Run Café, Run Library,” Susan Cianciolo’s already generous art has become more so, opening out and rising up to an inviting new vibrancy of the architectural kind. The artist’s signature accumulations of small found objects, collages and improvised artworks, previously presented in boxes meant to be sifted through, are now part of more outgoing displays placed in houselike frameworks dedicated to the activities of the show’s title. At “Run Café,” tapping a hotel-desk bell will bring you tea and something sweet to be consumed at a tiny table arrayed with a colorful cluster of small ceramic knickknacks. Tapestries hand-sewn from scraps of fabric cover the floors of these structures, where they sometimes join drawings by the artist’s daughter; other tapestries hang from the gallery’s walls, in one case incorporating sketches of garments for RUN, Ms. Cianciolo’s idiosyncratic fashion line. In a piece titled “Pray Circle,” another tapestry covers the floor while chairs, arranged in a ring, function primarily as pedestals for drawings and collages. Ms. Cianciolo’s work owes much to Robert Rauschenberg’s already loosely structured combines of the 1950s, built from found objects and images. But Ms. Cianciolo daringly forgoes most traditional building. Hers is primarily an art of arrangement, exquisitely precise for all its seeming casualness, and rarely less than challenging to conventional taste. She proposes an art as social and shared as it is experiential and aesthetic, immersing us in the fleeting beauty of this bountiful intersection. ROBERTA SMITH Through Nov. 27. The New School, Arnold and Sheila Aronson Galleries, Sheila C. Johnson Design Center, Parsons School of Design, 66 Fifth Avenue, Manhattan; 212-229-2436, veralistcenter.org. In previous centuries, sailing ships carried conquistadors, colonists, migrants and slaves around Europe and the Americas. Traveling with them was soil filled with billions of seeds, used to balance the ships and dumped at ports to make room for more freight. Since 2002, the Brazilian artist Maria Thereza Alves has explored this phenomenon through a project that has appeared in several European port cities. Now “Seeds of Change: New York — A Botany of Colonization” is making its debut in the Americas, at the Vera List Center for Art and Politics at the New School. At the center of the exhibition is an arrangement of live “ballast plants” from seed grown by local volunteers. On the walls are maps and texts describing how both ballast and slaves were dropped off in semisecret locations around New York to avoid tariffs, thus furthering the connection between human trafficking and uprooted nature. Although beautifully executed, the gallery exhibition is a bit boilerplate conceptualism: We read, we look, we feel bad about human behavior. (In other iterations, “Seeds of Change” has included more spectacular gestures, such as a garden on a barge in Bristol, England.) Like much research-based art, however, Ms. Alves’s project involves elements that can’t be seen at a glance. For the New York version of “Seeds of Change,” she collaborated with horticulturalists and organizations such as Pioneer Works, the High Line and Weeksville Heritage Center, and organized a series of lectures and talks that extend the conversation and help us think about today’s migrant crisis or the microbes that travel with us on airplanes. In these formats, the art comes alive, connecting history vitally with the present. MARTHA SCHWENDENER Through Dec. 2. Eric Firestone Gallery, 4 Great Jones Street, No. 4, Manhattan; 917-324-3386, ericfirestonegallery.com. Art history is in constant flux, as you can see by the recent rise of artists who were left out of earlier narratives. This year, the exhibition “Inventing Downtown: Artist-Run Galleries in New York City, 1952-1965,” at the Grey Art Gallery, featured many overlooked artists whose contributions to mid-20th-century art are noteworthy. One of them is the painter Marcia Marcus, whose work is currently on view in “Role Play: Paintings 1958-1973” at Eric Firestone Gallery. In the 1950s, Ms. Marcus studied with Edwin Dickinson at the Art Students League and alongside the painter Alex Katz at Cooper Union. (Now 89, she is no longer a practicing artist.) Ms. Marcus painted the human form in flat color with a muted affect. Sparse in detail and expression, the paintings feel perfect for an era in which Pop Art and Minimalism reigned. But they also recall the stiff, official poses of everything from Egyptian friezes and Minoan frescoes to early Renaissance portraiture. Many of the subjects were art world figures: the critic Jill Johnston; the curator and art historian Henri Zerner; the artists Bob Thompson, Lucas Samaras, Red Grooms, Emily Mason and Hazel Belvo. But Ms. Marcus also painted her friends and neighbors from the Lower East Side and Provincetown, Mass. Textile patterns and gold leaf are incorporated into the compositions, and oval and diamond-shaped canvases occasionally frame her figures. You can detect similarities not only with the portraiture of Mr. Katz, but also with that of Barkley L. Hendricks, Sylvia Sleigh and particularly Alice Neel in one respect: Like Ms. Neel, Ms. Marcus painted a range of ethnicities, reminding us that the art world, in its best moments, was not ruled by the same sexist white supremacy that has often plagued art history. MARTHA SCHWENDENER Through Dec. 10. Martos Gallery, 41 Elizabeth Street, Manhattan; 212-560-0670; martosgallery.com. Jessica Vaughn’s New York solo debut slices through Martos Gallery like a razor. A recent iteration of “After Willis,” her wall-mounted reclaiming of de-accessioned seats from the Chicago Transit Authority, which also appeared in a gallery group show earlier this year, serves as a kind of gentle introduction: Mass produced but individually worn, locked together by circumstance, with subtle but unmistakable civil rights resonance, they’re a social metaphor as well as a handsome variation on the ready-made. But her six new pieces up this ante spectacularly. Rectangularly framed upholstery remnants, mounted on plexiglass, with irregular seat-shaped cutouts, they lie in a neat row dominating the room from the floor. “Untitled (Dark Blue), #2” is the fullest box and the most neatly cut out; “Boomer Blue No. 340 #2,” a lighter shade with a hideous pattern of orange swooshes, is frayed and full of gaps, like broken teeth; and “Pacific Grey No. 48306” is barely there. The social metaphor still operates, along with as cynical — and as accurate — a take on the art market as anyone could want. But it’s the way the work’s formal properties interact with its high-concept content that makes it really mind-bending. Ms. Vaughn is investing value not only in a series of discarded objects, but also in negative space itself. And that’s not all — she’s discovered that it’s much more interesting than the positive.

2017,Opinion | What to Watch on Election Day,"David Leonhardt This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. Happy Election Day. Here are a few things to watch: Virginia. The close governor’s race will get most of the attention tonight, but the state’s legislative races will probably provide a better sign of the national political environment, as David Wasserman explains for NBC News. Why? The governor’s race is driven partly by personality. The legislative races are less so. As Wasserman writes: “how many seats Democrats gain on Tuesday could tell us whether they are on track to win the House in 2018.” He suggests paying particular attention to 10 seats that are currently held by Republicans in districts won by Hillary Clinton. Two of those 10 do involve fascinating personalities, including a transgender Democratic candidate whose opponent won’t acknowledge her as a woman, and a former news anchor who was inspired to enter politics by the fatal shooting of his girlfriend. So far this year, as I’ve noted in this newsletter before, Democrats have fared very well in special elections — flipping statehouse seats around the country. But special elections tend to have low turnout. Today’s Virginia races offer a better test. Maine. Obamacare will effectively be on the ballot, with voters deciding whether to expand Medicaid. Maine is one of only 19 states that didn’t expand the program under Obamacare, after the Supreme Court made expansion optional. The state’s Republican governor has repeatedly vetoed expansion. A “yes” vote on the ballot initiative would “make Maine’s health care system more reliable and secure for everyone,” argues the editorial board of The Portland Press Herald. “It will extend access to preventive care and treatment for people who can’t now afford it. And it will save lives.” Passage would also break new ground, making Maine the first state to expand Medicaid by popular referendum. “That could encourage other nonexpansion states to take the same route,” writes Vox’s Sarah Kliff. Ohio. The state will vote on an initiative intended to lower drug prices. As popular as that idea may sound, a similar measure failed in California in 2016. Kaiser Health News says many Ohioans are confused by the dueling campaign ads. New York. The big initiative in New York state — Proposal 1 — would authorize a state constitutional convention if it passed. Josh Barro of Business Insider urges a “yes” vote: “New Yorkers — residents and officials — talk a lot about our state government being structurally broken, but nobody ever does anything about it.” The Times editorial board takes the opposing view.",The New York Times
2017,Why Antifa Dresses Like Antifa,"A brief history of Antifa fashion. CreditCreditStephen Loewinsohn for The New York Times In late August, a crowd of thousands — primarily leftists and liberals — cascaded down Martin Luther King Jr. Way in Berkeley, Calif. They were marching on a spattering of right-wingers, Trump supporters and Nazis who were gathering under the mission to say “no to Marxism in America.” At the front of the march were about 100 people dressed in head-to-toe black. According to many people present, this was the largest so-called black bloc they’d seen. This medley of black-clad anarchists, anti-fascists (known as “antifa” activists) and their fellow travelers was a response to the previous week’s white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. There, protests ended with 19 injured and 32-year-old Heather Heyer killed when James Fields, an admirer of Hitler who demonstrated with white supremacists, drove his car into a crowd. This mass of solid black descending upon the park in Berkeley, hunting for fascists, was an intimidating aesthetic. That’s by design. “Cops wear camouflage when they arrest people in city drug raids,” said Ben, a Bay Area activist. “But they’re in a city. It doesn’t help them, but it makes them look more intimidating.” Ben says he has participated in protests since 2000, including Bush/Gore, Occupy Oakland and Black Lives Matter. (The Times agreed to use only his first name because of the threat of harassment, online or otherwise, by activists.) “A group of people all dressed in black can be intimidating,” he said. Is that intimidation the motive or just a benefit? Do black bloc practitioners dress up because, as many progressives wonder, they want to commit crimes? What do they get out of “masking up”? Where does uniform merge with tactic? By now, you know the look. Black work or military boots, pants, balaclavas or ski masks, gloves and jackets, North Face brand or otherwise. Gas masks, goggles and shields may be added as accessories, but the basics have stayed the same since the look’s inception. It’s impossible to say which anarchist street movement first donned all black. The generally agreed-upon genesis for the bloc’s current incarnation is the Autonomen movement of the 1970s, which grew out of class struggles in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and beyond. (Antifa groups, an overlapping but not at all identical set of people, trace their lineage back further, to those who fought against the rise of Hitler; generally, where there is “fa,” there’s been “antifa.”) According to a history distributed by an anarchist news service in 2001, by Daniel Dylan Young, a continuing struggle in Germany between squatters and police evictors culminated in a 1981 action in which activists dressed in “black motorcycle helmets and ski masks,” wearing “uniform black clothing.” Nearly immediately, the benefits of such a uniform were realized. “Everyone quickly figured out,” Mr. Young wrote, that “having a massive group of people all dressed the same with their faces covered not only helps in defending against the police, but also makes it easier for saboteurs to take the offensive against storefronts, banks and any other material symbols and power centers of capitalism and the state.” Both the ease of uniform procurement — the barrier to entry is just getting black clothes, with only your own ethical purchasing guidelines to steer you — and the aesthetic’s effectiveness allowed black blocs to spread. During Ronald Reagan’s visit to Berlin in 1986, a group of 3,000 showed up, according to Mr. Young; in 1999, a bloc of 500 was part of the “March for Mumia” in Philadelphia, protesting the imprisonment of the journalist Mumia Abu-Jamal. That same year, between 100 and 300 people became the bloc at the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle. It was a look so successful that the bloc’s greatest enemies considered adopting it. As Mark Bray details in his incisive “Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,” there have been occasional attempts to co-opt the bloc look by right-wing fascist groups. That’s died down recently, with the loose overlapping affiliation of nationalists, white supremacists and Nazis instead adopting an overdressed, old-fashioned style often referred to as “dapper.” So, while they wear khakis and white polos, the black bloc are left with some particular defensive and offensive benefits of their very own. The creation of mass anonymity protects practitioners from the threat of post-action doxxing by white supremacist groups, a process by which their identities and contact information, including addresses and places of employment, are publicized. People at home can use this information to harass and threaten. Similarly, police and other agencies have staff devoted to documenting demonstrations, and they work to identify people on film and video. These are among the reasons that some anarchists and anti-fascists advocate smashing cameras at demonstrations. As surveillance techniques have advanced and proliferated — the rise of the high-resolution portable phone camera along with social media means more documentation and more distribution than ever — practitioners have evolved from covering up obvious markers like tattoos, birthmarks and scars to hiding biometric indicators like ears and noses. Some in black blocs say they have heard of people placing weights in belts to alter their gaits. “I’ll often look through pictures from the demonstration and see if I can spot myself in any of them,” said Elle Armageddon, a Bay Area activist and writer. “If I can’t find any pictures of myself, I feel like I’ve done O.K.” Elle Armageddon (likely not a birth name) is the author of “The Femme’s Guide to Riot Fashion,” published at the website of CrimethInc., which describes itself as a “rebel alliance — a decentralized network pledged to anonymous collective action.” The guide recommends that femmes, meaning people of any gender, with long hair use tucked-in braids, and that they layer masks for full facial coverage. It also reminds us all that “shoes make or break an outfit.” There is solid beauty advice as well: “A layer of glitter or highlighter dusted over your cheeks can serve double duty, showing off your glorious bone structure while simultaneously providing a helpful way to determine which side of your bandanna was in contact with your face and which side is saturated in tear gas particulate.” (Also, jean shorts are probably not ideal.) There is more practical advice on how to dress for a riot. One should decide on organic or synthetic gloves before participating in an action: Wool and cotton may allow chemical contaminants, like pepper spray, to absorb, while nylon can melt if you grab something hot, which historically has included some kinds of tear-gas canisters but can include various things on fire. One Antifa “fashion don’t” is carrying cellphones. The American Civil Liberties Union reports that 72 agencies in 24 states and Washington, D.C., have “simulators” that mimic cellphone towers in order to track people. These defensive methods work only if there are enough black-clad others nearby. A single person in all black and multiple face masks is an eye grabber. This effect of anonymity-by-mass has allowed for the offensive side of bloc tactics to flourish. The uniformity camouflages those who participate in illegal acts like property damage, refusing police orders or physical assault against white supremacists or Nazis. This willful protection of the group is embedded in the style’s aesthetic. “People sometimes do things that are illegal, but I think they’re ethical,” Ben said. “I’m happy to be in this mass that creates anonymity for those people, even if they’re doing things I’m not willing to do.” Tactical considerations aside, it’s this emotional connection with other members of the bloc that many practitioners highlight the most in interviews. “Uniformity of characteristics” and a visual sense of equality have a way of, as research published in 2015 put it, giving “rise to feelings of solidarity.” It’s why soldiers and police have uniforms. It’s why sports teams have apparel for themselves and their fans, why brands have logos and consistent colorways, why fascists get slightly too-short versions of David Beckham haircuts and pin frogs to their lapels. But unlike hierarchal uniforms like those of the military, say — or even the difference between worker and management clothes at somewhere such as McDonald’s — black bloc fashion allows no room for rank to enter the style. It’s all black and that’s it. (Other leftist movements use similar techniques. The Zapatista Army of National Liberation in Chiapas, Mexico, which rose after the 1994 passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, takes the approach of cultivating equality through anonymity by wearing balaclavas or handkerchiefs over the face, but pairs them with the militant gear of armed struggle or indigenous elements.) Min, an activist who participated in the Inauguration Day actions in Washington known as J20, and who asked to be identified only by her first name, said that, because of the cold that day, many bloc practitioners were also dressed in parkas. This had the effect of erasing almost all identifying characteristics, including ethnicity and gender. “It was like a goth party,” Min said. “There were queer people, black people, white people, Asian people, and, because, we were all wearing black, there was no way to even think about the things that are often barriers to our connection.” Min said this anonymity, where she was unable to identify even people around her, had a way of purifying her actions. “There’s a difference between me helping you because I know you and care about you, and me helping you because I want you to be helped,” she said. Min is an artist. For her, this is one of the most unappreciated aspects of black bloc as a style. It’s tactical, and practical, and it’s also an art form with the effect of building solidarity long after the boots go into the closet. The experience of being enveloped in anonymity helps retain the movement’s ideology, after the balaclavas get folded up and stacked in the drawer. “In spheres where we don’t have uniforms, we really embrace individuality,” Min said. “But black bloc creates a feeling of ‘Who you are is who I am.’ Of ‘It doesn’t matter who I am when we’re fighting together.’”",The New York Times

For that reason, when I was asked to review “Mrs. Osmond,” John Banville’s sequel to “The Portrait of a Lady” by Henry James, my first question was, “Is it written in James’s style?” Informed that it was, I bowed my head in awe and pity. The great Banville, I feared, was attempting the impossible. At the same time, I was amazed that no one had thought of doing this before. First published in 1881, “The Portrait of a Lady” concerns a young American woman, Isabel Archer, who, after the death of her parents, travels to Europe, becomes “independent” through an inheritance and is besieged by suitors seeking her hand in marriage. The tragedy of the novel is that Isabel chooses the wrong suitor — the scheming dilettante Gilbert Osmond — and the question hanging over the book’s last section is whether she’ll leave him or not. In the final scene, one of Isabel’s jilted suitors, the American industrialist Caspar Goodwood, follows her to her friend Henrietta Stackpole’s house in London, only to be told that Isabel has returned to Rome. Henrietta then says, “Look here, Mr. Goodwood.… Just you wait!” And the last line of the book is: “On which he looked up at her.” James doesn’t explain what that look means, and readers have been arguing about it ever since. As if to clear up the mystery, James added a paragraph for the 1908 edition, expanding the ending as follows: “On which he looked up at her — but only to guess, from her face, with a revulsion, that she simply meant he was young. She stood shining at him with that cheap comfort, and it added, on the spot, 30 years to his life. She walked him away with her, however, as if she had given him now the key to patience.” This second ending clears up Goodwood’s fate but not Isabel’s, and it presents Banville with his opportunity. What’s more, in the century and a half since the novel was first serialized in The Atlantic Monthly, Isabel’s decision has grown in importance. Does she return to her husband in Rome out of wifely duty? To rescue her stepdaughter, Pansy? Or to free herself from the marriage, thus regaining her independence and prefiguring the political and social emancipation of women in general? In this regard, “Mrs. Osmond,” despite its antiquated atmosphere, speaks to our present moment. The Irish like to do this kind of thing. With a piety once reserved for religion, they perform an act of devotion to a literary idol. Colm Toibin’s novel “The Master” is the most obvious comparison. But Toibin chose to write in the third person, in his own style, and to depict the life James led outside his books. For that reason, “The Master” enacts an expansion of James rather than a resurrection. And in “The Portrait of a Lady” James was at his liveliest. One reason the novel has remained so popular is that it’s a fantastic read. The first half of the book — the courting, the proposals, the refusals — has all the delights of a traditional marriage plot; while the second half, full of dark revelations and wrenching decisions, is psychologically complex and anything but trivial. By contrast, “Mrs. Osmond” begins with the knowledge that Isabel’s marriage has been a mistake. Much of the action consists of her going here and there, meeting various characters and telling them about it. When the book’s climax finally does come, Isabel manages to extricate herself from her past in a relatively simple fashion. This has the curious effect of making one wonder if her plight in the first book was really all that dire, and whether one’s sympathy for her was misplaced. From this perspective, oddly enough, Banville’s homage reduces the object it venerates. Halfway through, however, Banville wriggles out of his self-imposed straitjacket to do a remarkable thing. For eight pages, he enters the mind of Gilbert Osmond. As with Jean Rhys’s Brontë prequel, “Wide Sargasso Sea,” this shift of perspective lets the reader view the original story anew. Banville, who has always excelled at writing about criminality and villainy in both his literary fiction and the novels he produces under his pseudonym, Benjamin Black, here reclaims that portion of his dark talent. The section crackles with threat, energy and malice. I was disappointed that Osmond’s turn on the stage was so brief. Stylistically, “Mrs. Osmond” is a triumph that contains the seeds of its own undoing. Banville’s ability to channel James’s style and prose rhythms is astonishing. I can’t imagine anyone who could have done it better. He knows the period, places and society of which he speaks. In addition to being a marvel of linguistic dexterity, the book is a supreme feat of scholarship. As my eyes negotiated the characteristically digressive paragraphs, with their refinements and hesitations, their pitch-perfect archaisms, I kept picturing Banville at his desk, doggedly piecing them together in an effort of self-erasure that is the exact opposite of the novelist’s native inclination, and which, regardless of the beauties produced, must have come with some pain. Adopting James’s style, after all, required Banville to write a sentence like this: “Henrietta delivered herself of a distinctly unladylike snort.” On the other hand, such ventriloquism allowed him to restore to glory extended metaphors that, although frowned on nowadays, are still beautiful to read. “But perhaps that was the trouble: Ralph had wanted wonders of her. That he had it in his power to fund her fearless ascent of the sheer rock-face of her — and his! — ambitions, must have seemed to him the justification, the compensation, for his having to bide below, in the shadowed valley, while she scaled the radiant heights.” Now and then, you read about people who have renounced modernity: Eccentrics who dress in Victorian clothes and live in houses where everything from the wallpaper to the lye soap dates from 1880. It’s probably fun to visit people like that. But after a few hours spent squinting across a dim parlor illuminated by whale oil, you might want to say, “You know what? There’s this thing now called electricity.” This is the difficulty embedded within Banville’s project. There’s something fanatical about it. And no matter what, he’s in a bind. The pace of the novel isn’t exactly swift. And the more longueurs Banville provides in order to reinforce the Jamesian mood and manner, the more tedious the novel becomes. It’s easy to forgive James for keeping to a pace as ruminative and slow as the age he lived in; with Banville, it feels willful to the point of perversity. And yet, without these longueurs, there would be a reduction in fidelity to the original. It’s a no-win situation. The “better” the book is, the worse it is. In the same way materialists claim we’re nothing but our bodies, it’s possible to wonder whether a prose style is anything more than words. Banville channels James’s sentences with remarkable conformity. But a writer isn’t only what he writes; he’s also what he leaves out, the intrinsic pattern of his noticing and attention. These things are as distinctive as a fingerprint and yet leave no mark. There is no way to recreate Henry James, not in full, without possessing his actual brain, so as to have at every moment his exact thoughts and reflections. Throughout “Mrs. Osmond,” I had the uncanny feeling of recognizing its sentences as Jamesian without feeling that James had written them, as though by the very act of impersonating James, Banville had managed to illuminate how inimitable James is. There’s no shame in this. It follows from the impossibility of the project. Lovers of “The Portrait of a Lady” are legion. Many of them will be eager to read this book and many will be enchanted by it. For that last number, there’s an added benefit. The ending of “Mrs. Osmond,” it turns out, is just as enigmatic as that of “The Portrait of a Lady.” It’s the kind of ending that, to the very brave or reckless, might inspire another sequel.

2017,Opinion | Whatever Happened to Trump’s Populist Agenda?,"Op-Ed Contributor President Trump accomplished his unlikely rise to the White House powered in large part by an embrace of economic and cultural populism. Yet one year after this victory, the Republican Party still has no idea how to address or incorporate those populist elements into a coherent agenda. Nor, despite their best intentions, do Mr. Trump and his former adviser Steve Bannon. This populism does not sit easily within the Republican Party’s business conservative wing (think Mitt Romney) or its “liberty” conservatives (think Tea Party) faction. So it’s not too surprising that virtually all of Mr. Trump’s signature populist ideas have been watered down or ignored, or are in limbo. Instead, Republicans push tax plans that overwhelmingly benefit their donor and executive class. It’s as though Jeb Bush or Ted Cruz won after all. But they didn’t win, and they didn’t win for a reason. Republican voters want something different from anti-government or establishment Republicanism. And the voters who made Mr. Trump president, the millions of largely white men and women without college degrees who voted for Barack Obama before backing Mr. Trump, definitely do not want Romneyism with a human face. The traditional Republican policy agenda is a political zombie, a relic that once served our nation well but is out of touch with what Americans want today. It doesn’t have to be this way. Mr. Trump and some of his supporters had good ideas for a reformed Republican Party that fuses conservative and populist elements into an alloy stronger than either on its own. This fusion may now seem like a dream, but it can still walk among us if Republicans will it to be so. They need only look back to the man they purport to revere, Ronald Reagan, to make it happen. We tend to forget that the Reagan coalition of the same three groups — non-Republican populists, fiscal conservatives and business Republicans — united behind coherent policy change. On taxes, for example, today’s Republicans could decide that it is as important to lower taxes on families as it is to lower them for the rich or for corporations. That’s what Mr. Reagan did in his landmark 1986 tax reform, as a cursory look at any of his speeches promoting that reform would show. The tax bill could restore personal exemptions and make the child tax credit refundable against payroll taxes, making millions of families winners instead of losers, as they are under the current bill. It could be paid for by raising the income to which the top marginal income tax rate applies and by scaling back the corporate tax rate cut. Health care could similarly include populist and traditional Republican priorities. Maintaining government support for the working class and for people with pre-existing conditions at close to current levels should be a top goal, and in exchange, fiscal and business conservatives see significant deregulation of the insurance market. This model would imitate the popular prescription drug benefit introduced by President George W. Bush, whose combination of public subsidy with market competition has extended health care to millions of people at a fraction of the estimated cost. Trade policy provides American consumers with cheap imports but puts a burden on native-born, less-skilled workers. Countries that manipulate their currencies, subsidize industries that compete with American businesses or set up barriers to American imports should be slapped with sanctions, as Mr. Reagan repeatedly did even as he pursued trade expansion. American workers who increasingly compete with very low-paid workers abroad should be given much more extensive transition support if they lose their jobs. A conservative-populist agenda could even include federal wage subsidies, as Senator Marco Rubio has proposed for Puerto Rico’s workers, to maintain decent living standards for America’s growing class of low-wage workers. American jobs for American citizens also needs to become more than a slogan. The new tax bill should include provisions that give employers credits in addition to the current deduction for employee compensation to legal United States residents. A second provision should provide additional tax credits for wage increases above national averages for workers earning below-average wages. Entitlement reform, a holy grail for both traditional Republican factions, can also be addressed with populist priorities in mind. Mr. Reagan always supported the principles of Social Security and Medicare; what he objected to was giving federal aid to people who didn’t need it, like those who could provide for themselves in their old age. Business and liberty conservatives who are concerned about runaway entitlement spending should propose reforms that place the fiscal burden on those who can best bear it, like retirees with large 401(k) accounts. Entitlement reform must also address the perverse policies that keep less-skilled workers trapped in low-growth regions. Medicaid recipients today, for example, are required to reapply for health insurance if they move to another state. Who would risk the family’s health insurance to move for a $10-an-hour job? Medicaid recipients should be able to keep their current state’s plan, at the federal government’s expense, for a few months if they have or are looking for a job in a new state. Mr. Trump’s attempted populist revolution is so far merely a ruckus, not a revolt. The Washington establishment’s agenda remains unshaken. Whether it remains so depends on whether Republicans and Trump populists realize in time that they must hang together and develop a new conservative-populist economic agenda. If they don’t, they will learn that they will all hang separately.",The New York Times

In fact, many economists see this as a bigger concern to the U. S. economy than unemployment. If a greater percentage of prime-age workers were participating, the economy could grow faster. At 88 percent, the U.S. has the lowest participation percentage among the group of seven countries in the graph. And, the percentage has been going downhill for almost 40 years. What’s going on in the U.S.? Your responses included no less than 30 possible “stories” behind this decline. The time series graph is from Eduardo Porter’s Sept. 20, 2017 article “Unemployment Is So 2009: Labor Shortage Gives Workers an Edge.” Some of the student explanations for the decline include technology taking away jobs, women taking jobs traditionally done by men, jobs going overseas, people staying in school longer and men feeling more comfortable staying at home with children. Others said that Americans are becoming lazier and we are now more risk-averse to new opportunities. But, according to the paper, by Princeton University’s Alan B. Kreuger, which is the basis for this article, the major factor is the record number of prime-age workers receiving disability benefits. The response from Cameron Croom of Raleigh, N.C. hit the nail on the head by giving this reason. Read the original New York Times article. What reasons does it give for the decline in the participation percentage? What is the main reason for disability? Here are some other questions that you may want to think about critically: • The graph only shows seven countries. How are these countries similar? What might the labor-force participation percentages be for dissimilar countries? Do you think all countries’ percentages are declining?• The x-axis starts at 1980. Why do you think 1980 was picked?• The y-axis starts at 88 percent, the lowest labor-force participation percentage. How would the graph look differently if the axis started at 50 percent or even 0 percent? Would this influence your interpretation?• The article shows that wages started to increase in 1998. How may this have affected the labor-force participation percentage?• Germany’s percentage is the most erratic in the 1980s and 1990s. What happened in Germany during that period?• Why is Japan’s labor-force participation percentage so high and stable?• What would you recommend to increase the U.S. percentage? How do you think the current immigration policy affects our economy and the participation percentage? Below in Stat Nuggets, we define and explain what is a time series graph, how to interpret the graph’s axes, and how important it is not to confuse the percentage of workers with the number of workers. Look into the archives to see past Stat Nuggets terms. Thank you for participating in “What’s Going On in This Graph?”, which is intended to have you think more critically about graphs and the underlying data in a news story. Critical thinking is an essential element of statistics, the science of learning from data. Data visualizations, like this graph, are an important part of statistics. They help us to understand and communicate about data. Keep noticing and wondering. Come up with conjectures based on this graph. Probe whether they are possibly true, and if not, change your conjecture. We continue to welcome your responses to this graph. See you next month on Tuesday, Dec. 12 for our next “What’s Going On in This Graph?” _________ Stat Nuggets for “Labor-force Participation Rate” TIME SERIES GRAPH A graph that shows how a numerical variable changes over time. In the Labor-force Participation Rate graph, the variable was labor-force participation percentage and the graph shows how it changes from 1980 - 2017 for seven selected O.E.C.D. countries. AXES SCALES Typically, the axes of a graph start at zero. But, if there is no data in the lower values, an axis could start at a greater value. In the Labor-force Participation Rate graph, the x-axis starts at 1980. We are given no reason 1980 is selected. This may be when labor-force participation percentages started to fall internationally. The y-axis starts at 88 percent. This was probably selected since no labor-force participation percentage is less than 88 percent. If the graph had started at zero percent, the countries’ lines would have been at the top of the graph and the differences between countries would have looked less noticeable. NUMBER VS. PROPORTION Number is the count of some group. Proportion is the count of some characteristic of a group divided by the total number of members in the group. Proportions can be expressed as percentages, decimals or fractions. In the Labor-force Participation Rate graph, the y-axis displays the percentage of labor-force participation for men age 25 - 54. Those values are calculated by dividing the number of men who are either working or looking for work (members of a group) by the total number of men age 25 - 54 (the entire group). The members of the group not included in the percentage are those who are not working or not looking for work. We see that the percentage of men working or looking for work is decreasing over time. But, we do not know if the number of men who are working or looking for work is decreasing. Why is this so? Here’s an example. If the labor-force participation percentage decreases from 90 percent to 80 percent, but the number of men increases from 100 million to 120 million, the number of men working or looking for work increases from 90 million to 96 million. The percentage decreases (90 percent to 80 percent), but the number increases (90 to 96 million). In this graph, because we only know the percentage of men participating in the labor force, we cannot compare the number of men participating in the labor force. _________ The graphs for “What’s Going On in This Graph?” are selected in partnership with Sharon Hessney, the Statistics Content Director at Mass Insight Education.

The original caption reads: Dannal Aramburu, forensic anthropologist, examines the remains of two victims found in a mass grave. 2013. The photographer, Max Cabello Orcasitas, provided additional information to The Times: Between November and December of 2013, two forensic teams from the Public Prosecutorâs Office exhumed approximately 50 mass graves in the long-suffering Chungi district, in Ayacucho, Peru. Shining Path and Peruvian Armed Forces are believed to have buried at least 200 people in these pits. During four weeks of work, 99 corpses were found. In an article by David Gonzalez from Oct. 19, Mr. Cabello Orcasitas explains what compelled him to photograph the exhumations. It begins: Silent clues to a violent past are buried among the scores of mass graves that dot Chungui district in the mountainous Ayacucho region of Peru. There, above layers of earth that mark geological time, lie relatively new remnants attesting to the massacres carried out by both the Shining Path guerrillas and the military and police forces that hunted them. A soggy, wrinkled skirt. A skull. Fragments of a spinal column. All that remains of the many men, women and children caught in the crossfire of a war they never wanted. When these remains are lifted from their unmarked graves, they bring with them the chance to be identified, to give their survivors an idea of what happened. To give them something they can bury, and mourn. Max Cabello Orcasitas, a Peruvian photojournalist, had been intrigued by the exhumations taking place in the region, which was among the hardest-hit by the political violence 30 years ago. He had read about it in a report by the country’s truth commission that offered an accounting of the crimes and killings that were carried out during these dirty wars. “It struck me as a little-known tragedy,” Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said. “It was like that place in Yugoslavia where there were massacres, Srebrenica. This was like a Peruvian Srebrenica.”",The New York Times

The original caption reads: A demonstrator protesting the death of Mr. Sterling was detained on Saturday by the Baton Rouge police. In “The Superhero Photographs of the Black Lives Matter Movement”, Teju Cole, The New York Times Magazine photography critic, explains the significance of the image: As soon as the photograph of Ieshia Evans began to circulate online, people said she looked like a superhero. There she stands, slim and straight, on a street in Baton Rouge. Her dress, abstractly patterned in black and white, swirls around her. She seems almost to be levitating. Opposite her are the cops, clad in black. They are only two, walking ahead of a phalanx of more than a dozen others. But because of the storm-trooper get-up — the shoulder pads, helmets and what look like rocket-booster backpacks — the two seem like three or four. Their legs advance while their upper bodies lean back, as though recoiling from an unseen force. She is unarmed and unafraid (the open space behind her emphasizes her singularity); they are militarized and unindividuated. The image told such an apparently clear story that when it hit social media, it went viral. The photograph, by the Reuters journalist Jonathan Bachman, was made at an inauspicious time. The rally at which it happened was in response to recent killings of black men by the police, particularly the death of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge. But just two days earlier, the nation was shocked by the murder of five police officers in Dallas by a lone gunman. Our collective grief, always complicated, took on wicked new fissures. Nevertheless, in spite of, or because of, its simple narrative, Bachman’s photograph became an icon. It joined a small group of other images connected to the Black Lives Matter movement. There was Robert Cohen’s nocturnal photograph of Edward Crawford in Ferguson, Mo., clad in an American-flag shirt as he readied himself to throw a flaming tear-gas canister, like Thor launching his hammer. In 2015, Adam Anderson photographed Bree Newsome at the South Carolina State House as she shinned up a flagpole with the agility of Spider-Man to remove a long-contested Confederate flag. And on the same day that Ieshia Evans stood in the street, a leader of the movement, DeRay Mckesson, was photographed as he was arrested in Baton Rouge, a glowering look on his face, as though he possessed Cyclops’s “optic force blasts.” These stills from the American racial passion play all deployed the visual language of the comic-book superhero.

2017,What’s Happened So Far in the Rolex Series,"World Tour Championship Location: Wentworth Club, Virginia Water, Surrey, England When: May 25-28 Winner: Alex Noren of Sweden Noren shot a course record 10-under-par 62 to rally from seven shots off the lead to win the European Tour’s flagship event. He finished with a 72-hole total of 11-under-par 277 and a two-shot victory over Francesco Molinari of Italy. “Probably my best ever,” Noren said, when asked where his score of 62 ranks in his career. An eagle on the last hole sealed the deal, and was set up by a stroke of genius to the par-5 18th. “It was a 5-iron yardage with a bit of adrenaline in there,” Noren said. “It just came out perfect; that one shot you want to see in the air.” Location: Le Golf National, Paris, France When: June 29-July 2 Winner: Tommy Fleetwood of England Fleetwood had one of those days all golfers dream of in the final round of the Open de France. He fired a 5-under 66 to edge the American Peter Uihlein with a 12-under 272 total. Fleetwood recalls stiffing iron shots at the first two holes as the start of a run of flawless golf. “I don’t think I missed a shot from there on in in that last round,” Fleetwood said. “You really don’t feel this way very often but I played two holes on Sunday and I thought, ‘There’s no way I can lose.’ I don’t know how or why, but I felt very confident with my game.” Location: Portstewart Golf Club, Portstewart, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland When: July 6-9 Winner: Jon Rahm of Spain Rahm dominated the field, holing out from 150 yards for eagle on No. 4 and reeling off four straight birdies beginning at No. 7 to shoot 7-under 65. The 22-year-old’s 72-hole aggregate of 24-under 264 shattered the tournament record to par by three shots as he cruised to a six-stroke victory. “To actually play my best golf that I can remember and shoot 24 under on this golf course and win it by six, that is not something I would have believed I was capable of,” Rahm said. “I learned a lot about myself and it’s a really, really special day.” Location: Dundonald Links, Troon, Ayrshire, Scotland When: July 13-16 Winner: Rafa Cabrera Bello of Spain Having finished second six times since winning the 2012 Dubai Desert Classic, Cabrera Bello was due and his time to shine arrived at the Scottish Open. He set a course record of 8-under 64 at Dundonald Links to finish at 13 under. It was good enough to force a playoff with Englishman Callum Shinkwin, who bogeyed the 72nd hole of the tournament. Cabrera Bello clinched his third European Tour victory with a two-putt birdie at the first extra hole after knocking his second shot on to the green at the par-five 18th from 275 yards. “Those are the moments we practice for,” Cabrera Bello said. “I enjoy those pressure situations. I think they really define you. I hit a great shot and the birdie was enough to win.” Location: Golf Club Milano, Parco Reale di Monza, Italy When: Oct. 12-15 Winner: Tyrrell Hatton of England A day after celebrating his 26th birthday, Hatton rode a hot putter to a second straight European Tour victory. He birdied five of the last seven holes for a bogey-free 65 to finish at 21 under. Hatton capped off the tournament in style, sinking a 20-foot putt for birdie on the final green to snatch a one-stroke victory over fellow Englishman Ross Fisher and Kiradech Aphibarnrat of Thailand. “I just can’t believe I have won again,” Hatton said. “I didn’t see a leaderboard so I didn’t know where the leaders were, but I holed some putts and it was an amazing feeling to see that one drop at the 18th.” Location: Regnum Carya Golf & Spa Resort, Antalya, Turkey When: Nov. 2-5 Winner: Justin Rose of England Rose, the Olympic gold medalist, hadn’t won an official event since October 2015. Then he won two in a row. A week after rallying to win in Shanghai, Rose fired 64-65 on the weekend to erase a two-stroke deficit and post a winning total of 18 under par, a shot ahead of Nicolas Colsaerts of Belgium and Dylan Frittelli of South Africa. Rose flashed back to the putt he missed on the 18th green at Augusta National that would have won the Masters in April. This time, he canned a 10-foot putt on the 18th for his third birdie in the last four holes and when Colsaerts failed to convert from two feet closer, Rose secured his 10th European Tour title and first Rolex Series trophy. “It’s like a bus,” Rose said of winning. “You wait ages for one, and then two turn up.” Location: Gary Player Country Club, Sun City, South Africa When: Nov. 9-12 Winner: Branden Grace of South Africa Grace canned a 40-foot birdie putt at 16 to break out of a three-way tie and notch his eighth victory on the European Tour. Grace, 29, hit all 18 greens in regulation for a bogey-free 6-under 66. He finished with a 72-hole aggregate of 11-under 277 and a one-stroke victory over Scott Jamieson of Scotland and Victor Dubuisson of France, who made a late bogey to finish third. Grace, who grew up on a farm in Pretoria, became the first South African in 10 years to win on his home soil. ”I think this was probably the loudest applause I’ve ever received coming up the 18th hole,” Grace said. “This is the one event that as a South African you want to win. It’s Africa’s Major for a reason and what a special place it is.”",The New York Times

2017,What’s On TV Friday: ‘Hey Arnold!’ and Grammy Highlights,"Indulge your 90s nostalgia with a new adventure of “Hey Arnold.” Usher in the holiday season with “Love Actually.” CUBA AND THE CAMERAMAN on Netflix. Starting in the early 1970s, the filmmaker John Alpert traveled to Cuba to document the life there, centering on a family of poor farmers under the evolving regime of Fidel Castro. Then something unexpected happened: Mr. Alpert became friends with Castro himself, interviewing him several times, including on a flight to New York for his October 1979 speech at the United Nations. This expansive and intimate documentary examines Cuba both from the dictator’s seat and from the ground up, with scenes capturing the country’s economic decline, tourism boom and response to Castro’s death in 2016. THE LAST WALTZ on Vudu, Amazon and iTunes. 41 years ago on Thanksgiving Day, rock royalty gathered at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco to honor a modest Toronto-born band without a distinct frontman, genre, or name: The Band.

The astonishing performances include Joni Mitchell belting harmonies from backstage on Neil Young’s “Helpless”; Van Morrison slurring passionately through “Caravan”; and Bob Dylan, Ringo Starr and Ronnie Wood joining The Band on a poignant version of “I Shall Be Released.” LOVE ACTUALLY (2003) 6 p.m. on CMT. It’s the day after Thanksgiving, which, of course, means that Christmas season has arrived in full force. Usher in the season with Richard Curtis’s big-hearted, scattershot film, which weaves together vaguely interconnected tales of love, sex and heartbreak over London. Bill Nighy takes center stage as the narcissistic daredevil Billy Mack, but it’s Laura Linney who gives the movie its tender core as the overextended yet helplessly smitten Sarah. And look for a certain “Game of Thrones” star as a head-over-heels tyke. HEY ARNOLD! THE JUNGLE MOVIE 7 p.m. on Nickelodeon. Millennials have successfully smuggled bits of their childhood into modern pop culture: “The Magic School Bus” is back on Netflix, and whole NBA teams have turned to posting “Arthur” memes to gloat or sulk after games.

But when she visits the forest near her home, she enters another world entirely — one whose inhabitants include a man with eyes quite literally in the palms of his hands. That part is played by Doug Jones, the subject of a recent profile in The Times for his appearances in several of Mr. del Toro’s features — including his latest, “The Shape of Water,” opening this week.",The New York Times
2017,"What’s That Smell? It’s ‘Festen,’ a Play and Film With Aroma","The perfumer Francis Kurkdjian sells beauty and glamour packaged in adjectives like floral, musky, citrusy. But in his artistic pursuits, he isn’t preoccupied with the “pleasant.” Paraphrasing Kant, he said: “Art is not the representation of a beautiful thing. It is a beautiful representation of a thing. Perfume falls into the first category because we magnify what is already beautiful.” In contrast, art allows him to represent the dark and disturbing. “Festen,” then, may be an appropriate foray into theater for Mr. Kurkdjian. He is collaborating on a piece based on the movie with the French director Cyril Teste. It is part play, part film — and, yes, it is perfumed. The show opened Nov. 7 in Annecy, France; continues to Paris on Friday; and then goes to 14 more French cities. Mr. Kurkdjian, the head of an eponymous perfumery, has become known for his olfactory installations and art collaborations. He has perfumed the fountains of Versailles, encapsulated the smell of soil in wax nails and scented the bar at the Baccarat Hotel in Midtown Manhattan, where we spoke recently about his new project. Called “The Celebration” in North America, “Festen” is a 1998 Danish film by the director Thomas Vinterberg. The Parisian debut of the play would be particularly timely if it were Stateside, where we’re all looking forward to — or deeply dreading — Thanksgiving family reunions. The story centers on a 60th birthday party, thrown for the roseate patriarch of a wealthy family. At the celebration, one son, whose twin sister recently committed suicide, accuses his father of sexually assaulting them both as children. In a phone interview with Mr. Teste (with Mr. Kurkdjian’s occasional help translating from French), he noted that the movie’s themes of domestic violence, incest and racism resonate with disturbing poignancy today. There have been other stage adaptations of “Festen,” including one on Broadway in 2006, directed by Rufus Norris, and one at St. Ann’s Warehouse in 2012, directed by Grzegorz Jarzyna. Mr. Teste replaces the film’s summer with autumn and Denmark’s countryside with France’s. In addition to the live performance by the actors, the play is filmed, edited and projected on a screen above the stage in real time (with a few prerecorded scenes), providing two angles and mediums for the story. When asked if this might distract rather than enhance, Mr. Teste said, “People are used to moving from one medium to another.” In a YouTube video posted by the Hermès Foundation, he said: “Today we are in a society where there is no more room for the off-camera. We are always wanting to constantly frame the subject.” He believes in the plurality of the arts. Given that our day-to-day lives are constantly framed and captured by pocket-size screens, this strikes a chord. Yet even as he layers these visual elements, Mr. Teste hopes to draw people in by their noses, rather than their eyes. Mr. Kurkdjian’s three scents are released at various moments in the play. The first, a wet, mossy forest smell, disseminates as the last stragglers take their seats. Scenting a theater may be unusual, but it has been done. Broadway’s “Waitress” used a convection oven and an overly cinnamon-and-nutmeg-saturated apple pie recipe to set — and scent — the show. But as realistic as they were, the bakery smells only wafted in at certain points. To completely fill the 16 theaters of varying sizes and shapes with scent, Mr. Kurkdjian and Mr. Teste needed to overcome special challenges. “Light is easy,” Mr. Kurkdjian explained. “It’s on or off. It’s dark or bright.” Smells mingle and linger, he added. Despite a notice that the audience should avoid wearing perfume (and, one would hope, avoid attending if they’re allergic to it), Mr. Kurkdjian had to take into account a theater full of bodies. The system must also be quiet and able to adapt to each theater’s shape and seating design. The solution was a bladeless Dyson fan, the tabletop version of which costs $300. Mr. Kurkdjian and his team dismantled the largest fans from the product line and reassembled them, adding scent diffusers. An iPhone remotely controls the airflow and the scents’ release. “It’s a burst, then you wait maybe two or three minutes, and you give it another push,” Mr. Kurkdjian said. “Up to a point where we switch to the second scent.” Since the air isn’t cleaned between scenes, each fragrance has to layer with the last. The second scent represents a fireplace. It’s not the cozy scent of a soul-warming hearth, Mr. Kurkdjian said, but a cold, marble fireplace after the flame has been extinguished. The soot and ash left behind is meant to help the audience “feel the sourness” of a conversation between a son and his father, whose sins this son disclosed to the entire family. While the first two scents are more smell-odor than fragrance-perfume, the third most closely resembles Mr. Kurkdjian’s commercial endeavors. Rather than representing nature, this scent is meant to be the perfume of the daughter who died — the one that she would have worn in life. It conjures her memory. The play ends on a note of peace and reconciliation, and a return to the forest scent. In this project, Mr. Kurkdjian may have found the perfect medium for representing the ephemeral: phantoms, memories, scents, a play’s emotional residue, things that slowly dissipate as we refocus our eyes on the real world.",The New York Times
2017,What’s at Stake in the Bonn Climate Talks?,"Want the latest climate news in your inbox? You can sign up here to receive Climate Fwd:, our new email newsletter. The Paris climate agreement of 2015 was a key moment in the battle against climate change: 195 countries vowed to help limit the rise in global temperatures since the industrial revolution to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). But the Paris deal was just the start of a long, arduous process. The world’s nations are still struggling to translate their lofty promises into meaningful cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. Which explains why diplomats are now meeting for yet another round of climate talks in Bonn, Germany, which began on Nov. 6 and continue through Friday. Much of the attention at these talks will be on the Trump administration, which has vowed to withdraw the United States from the Paris deal by 2020. In response, a gaggle of world leaders, American governors, major corporations and advocacy groups will make a big show of insisting that global action on climate change is still trundling forward, with or without President Trump. Yet much of the crucial work at Bonn will happen behind closed doors as diplomats try to build on the initial Paris agreement, crafting new rules and guidelines that, they hope, will help turn hazy national promises into concrete action. Here’s what to watch for. The overarching task is the same as ever: figuring out how to limit severe global warming in the decades ahead. Under the Paris agreement, each country submitted a voluntary pledge to tackle its greenhouse gas emissions and then agreed to meet every five years to review their collective progress and prod one another to ratchet up their efforts. But so far, those pledges have proved inadequate. Most industrialized countries — from Europe to Japan to the United States — aren’t on track to meet their emissions goals. And even if they were, the current pledges put the world on course to heat up 3 degrees Celsius or more, an outcome with a far greater risk of destabilizing ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, drastic sea-level rise and more destructive heat waves and droughts. To stay well below 2 degrees, countries would need to cut back fossil-fuel emissions far more rapidly than they’ve promised so far. Two years after countries signed a landmark climate agreement in Paris, the world remains far off course from preventing drastic global warming in the decades ahead. In 2018, leaders plan to assess their efforts to date and discuss what further action could help lessen the odds of drastic global warming — with the goal of crafting newer, stronger national pledges by 2020. But before they can do any of that, they need to agree to formal ground rules for that exercise. That “rule book” will be a focus at Bonn. One widely recognized problem with the current Paris pledges is that they’re fairly vague. China promised that its emissions would peak around 2030, but the country’s energy data is notoriously murky, so it’s hard to tell how much progress it’s actually making. Similarly, the European Union vowed to cut emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, but offered few specifics on how to achieve that goal — making it hard to gauge whether European policymakers could realistically be doing much more. At Bonn, negotiators will be discussing how to make these pledges more rigorous and transparent, so that countries can more readily be held accountable for their actions. That means tackling questions like: What’s the best way to track nations’ progress, to see if they’re doing what they said they would do? Is there a way to tell if a country’s pledge could be made more ambitious? Which specific policies are working well and which aren’t? Because the Paris pledges are largely voluntary — world leaders would have never agreed to a deal otherwise — no one can force governments to take additional action. But, the idea goes, if pledges and policies are made more transparent, world leaders will be better able to pressure and help each other to do more. The final draft of this “rule book” is not due until next year, and it may not actually get finished at Bonn, but negotiators are hoping to make significant progress on a long list of items at these talks. As always, diplomacy tends to proceed fitfully. Even though the Trump administration has vowed to withdraw from the Paris agreement, the United States can’t formally exit the climate talks until 2020. So the State Department is sending a small team of negotiators to discuss some of the details of the pact. The United States and China will still preside over a working group on transparency, though it remains to be seen how much influence American officials can wield. The administration will also hold an event in Bonn with representatives from energy companies to promote coal, natural gas and nuclear power as solutions to global warming. Other countries are expected to view the American push to promote fossil fuels with a wary eye. In the meantime, a coalition of pro-Paris governors and other officials plan to attend the conference to tout efforts that states, cities and businesses are making to reduce emissions despite the Trump administration’s stance — highlighting the country’s deep divide over climate policy. Discussions around the “rule book” for assessing and ratcheting up pledges could prove contentious. In the past, for instance, the United States has insisted that developing countries be held to the same strict monitoring standards as wealthy countries, while China and India have pushed for a bifurcated system. Developing countries have also argued that they need financial aid from wealthier nations to expand clean energy and adapt to the ravages of climate change. The government of Fiji is presiding over the Bonn conference, which will put the spotlight on issues like “loss and damage” — that is, whether wealthy nations should compensate island nations and other poorer countries for the droughts, storms and rising sea levels that their emissions are causing. The Paris agreement broached this issue only briefly, and industrialized nations have resisted calls to be held legally liable for their role in warming the planet. Some climate advocates are hoping for a relatively low-key conference that makes modest progress on issues like transparency and climate finance. In this scenario, American officials would play a quietly constructive role in helping craft the rule book for ratcheting up pledges. And nonstate actors, including cities and businesses, would continue to press forward on efforts to tackle climate change outside of the formal United Nations process. Conversely, it’s entirely possible that the Trump administration’s rejection of the Paris deal could lead other countries to disengage from global efforts to address climate change. Or the talks could get bogged down by the traditional rifts between richer and poorer nations. That, in turn, could stall momentum right before the next big round of climate talks in 2018 — when countries are supposed to get down to the details of what’s needed to step up their climate policies going forward.",The New York Times
2017,"What’s in That Can of Chock Full o’Nuts? ‘No Nuts,’ Can Promises","It is almost as familiar a part of New York lore as a taxi or King Kong or the building that he climbed — a can of Chock full o’Nuts coffee. But then it became a New York export. And as the quintessentially recognizable can crossed the Mississippi River in a push to go national, concerns arose about one word on the label that might not play well in Omaha or Oklahoma City — nuts. So Chock full o’Nuts has put what amounts to a giant disclaimer on the can: “No nuts.” To those whose day cannot start without a cup, saying that “Chock full o’Nuts” has no nuts sounds as contradictory as movie titles like “Eyes Wide Shut” and “True Lies.” Do people really think that Chock full o’Nuts cans are chock-full of nuts? Apparently so. Convincing consumers that there are no nuts in Chock full o’Nuts is, well, a tough marketing nut to crack. “Every time we’ve done consumer research on why some people do not purchase the product, the No. 1 thing that comes back to us is there’s something in the coffee,” said Dennis Crawford, the senior marketing manager for Chock full o’Nuts. “Most of the people in New York — we’ve been there forever and they get it, but if you’re in Omaha and suddenly we’re on the shelf and you see the brand for the first time, there’s confusion.” “No nuts” and “100 percent premium coffee” appeared on Chock full o’Nuts cans several months ago as part of a subtle redesign of the label. The basic color scheme remained the same — taxicab yellow and basic black — but the New York skyline was redrawn, showing the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building illuminated, as at dawn, when the sun is coming up and people are padding into their kitchens, desperate for a jolt. The “moment of benefit,” Mr. Crawford called it. The redesigned can also has an echo of Chock full o’Nuts’ famous song. “Heavenly coffee,” the can says — part of the lyric featured in Chock full o’Nuts commercials starting in the mid-1950s. And while it may send a message to consumers with nut allergies, Mr. Crawford said that issue never really came up in focus groups. “It was always something like, ‘Is there an added ingredient in the coffee?’” he said. “They were looking for pure coffee, which is what it is and always has been.” Analysts who follow the coffee industry said the “no nuts” notice catered to current consumer preferences. “Consumers are going for natural, authentic and transparent beverages,” said James Watson, the senior beverage analyst for Rabobank. “If you think about it from the consumer side, there’s very little we know about a lot of brands other than what’s facing us on the shelf, so to communicate what’s in there, this kind of explicit messaging could be very important.” Darren Seifer, a food and beverage analyst with the market research firm NPD Group, said this was a good time to explain the brand more clearly because coffee consumption at home has been rising. In 2008, he said, coffee was consumed at 25 percent of breakfast tables in the United States. The comparable figure is now 28 percent. “When you figure that there are 300 million people and we have breakfast 365 days a year,” he said, “even if sometimes we skip breakfast, that’s hundreds of millions more occasions when coffee is being consumed in the morning, so it’s a good time to jump on this wave.” The “no nuts” panel on Chock full o’Nuts cans also summarizes the history of Chock full o’Nuts. “1920s — we sold nuts. 1930s — we sold nuts and coffee. Now — we don’t sell nuts. We just sell coffee. But we like our name.” That name was chosen by the company’s original owner, William Black, when he rented a tiny space under a staircase in the basement of a building at Broadway and 43rd Street. The challenge was what he could sell. His lease said he could not sell anything sold by the drugstore upstairs. Nuts, he said. There was a cut-rate theater ticket operation opposite his stand. He was counting on its parade of customers to buy his nuts. They did. The coffee came along in 1930. With the Depression, nut sales dwindled. “He had to reassess his business, as it was collapsing,” Mr. Crawford said, “and he had an asset that was underutilized. He had a roasting machine, an oven, and he thought, ‘What is it that I can do, how can I use this roaster to do something to save the business? I can go down to the docks and buy green coffee as it comes in and start selling date-nut sandwiches made from the nuts and coffee to drink with it.’” He converted the nut shops to restaurants. He introduced coffee in cans in the early 1950s. After his death 30 years later, the restaurants were sold and closed. Mr. Crawford said Chock full o’Nuts had printed “no nuts — 100 percent coffee” messages on the yellow plastic lids several years ago, but in smaller letters. The Chock full o’Nuts can has changed over time, just as the Checker cab gave way to Fords, Toyotas and Nissans. The company itself has changed hands a couple of times since Mr. Black died. Chock full o’Nuts, the brand with the New York skyline on its label, is now owned by an Italian coffee conglomerate that also markets such brands as Hills Bros. and Chase & Sanborn. “You notice there was no reference to New York” identifying the skyline on the can, Mr. Crawford said, “but New Yorkers will clearly recognize it. There are a lot of people who will recognize it. But a lot of people outside of New York will think, it’s just a big city.’’ That is the thing about trying to export New York, he said: Not everyone likes New York. “We do,” Mr. Crawford said. “We love New York.” He said the main complaint in focus groups with people not from New York was about New York sports teams beating their teams. That might make them think twice about what coffee they buy. “But if you’re from another city and a New York team beat up your team, you still come to New York to go to Broadway,” he said. Mr. Crawford, the chief marketer for a brand so closely identified with New York, knows the route. He works from an office 360 miles away, in Portsmouth, Va. The last time he was in New York was in August.",The New York Times

Maria Bamford stars as an exaggerated version of herself, an actress and comedian working her way back into Hollywood after a stint in recovery. (The real Ms. Bamford has been treated for depression and bipolar disorder.) But rather than shy away from the subject of mental health, the series puts Ms. Bamford’s psyche front and center. “‘Lady Dynamite’ has its own bizarre-sincere voice and its own dream logic,” James Poniewozik wrote last year in The New York Times. “It’s something else, in a good way: a journey to the center of Ms. Bamford’s mind that dives through fantasy after loopy fantasy and emerges with something real.” In Season 2, Maria lives with her new beau and takes a job at a streaming service.

2017,What’s on TV Friday: ‘Alias Grace’ and ‘Jane the Virgin’,"A new Margaret Atwood adaptation arrives on Netflix. And “Once Upon a Time” draws inspiration from “The Princess and the Frog.” ALIAS GRACE on Netflix. Margaret Atwood ended up front and center on the Emmys stage this year when Hulu’s adaptation of her novel “The Handmaid’s Tale” won best drama. Next year, she could end up there again, but this time for a new show, “Alias Grace.” The adaptation was written by Sarah Polley and centers on a poor 19th-century housekeeper, Grace (Sarah Gadon), who is convicted of murder. She is evaluated by a young doctor, Simon Jordan (Edward Holcroft), who tries to determine whether she is innocent or guilty. The story tackles themes of powerlessness, immigration and abortion. SHAOLIN SOCCER (2001) on Netflix, YouTube, and Hulu. The martial arts superstar Stephen Chow sends up his own genre in this goofy pastiche comedy that became a global hit. Mr. Chow plays a down-on-his-luck Shaolin kung fu disciple in contemporary China who soon realizes that his arcane talent might be put to better use on a soccer field. ONCE UPON A TIME, 8 p.m. on ABC. This drama based on fairy tales killed off a major character last week. On Friday, the show returns to its “Princess and the Frog” plotline; Princess Tiana (Mekia Cox) looks for love and seeks help a cunning witch doctor. Meanwhile, her real-life counterpart, Sabine, takes on a risky business venture in Seattle. JANE THE VIRGIN, 9 p.m. on the CW. You can catch this show’s sprightly star, Gina Rodriguez, roasting the Patriots’ Rob Gronkowski in rhyme form on this week’s “Drop the Mic” on TBS. (“I spit fire, you look like the cave man who discovered it.”) On her no less incendiary telenovela, her character, Jane, gets angry when she learns that Rafael (Justin Baldoni) introduced their son, Mateo, to his new girlfriend, Katherine. ANIMAL CRIBS 10 p.m. on Animal Planet. Even as “Fixer Upper” comes to a close, the market for home renovation shows is at an all-time high, with “Property Brothers,” “Flip or Flop” and “Trading Spaces” serving up huge makeovers. The newest addition to the field turns its attention to pets. The host Antonio Ballatore goes to extraordinary lengths to get tails wagging by installing cat climbing walls, tree houses, pet-safe fire pits and more. HART OF THE CITY 11 p.m. on Comedy Central. In between blockbusters like “Jumanji,” groundbreaking stand-up sets, reality television spoofs and rap albums, Kevin Hart found time to hit the road for this documentary series, in which he explores stand-up scenes and looks for fresh talent. In the second season premiere, he travels to Phoenix, where he meets comics like James McCowan, known as JayMac, and Jill Kimmel (Jimmy Kimmel’s sister).",The New York Times
2017,What’s on TV Friday: ‘Mudbound’ and ‘Active Shooter’,"“Mudbound,” an Oscar contender, arrives on Netflix. A documentary examines at the aftermath of Columbine. MUDBOUND on Netflix. Dee Rees’s film received a standing ovation when it premiered at Sundance this year and was promptly bought by Netflix for $12.5 million. Based on the novel by Hillary Jordan, the emotionally devastating film traces the intertwining of two families — one white, one black — in rural Mississippi during and after World War II. Mary J. Blige, Carey Mulligan and Garrett Hedlund are among the actors who took on the tragic, hardscrabble roles. “I brought in everything,” Ms. Blige told The Times about working with Ms. Rees. “Just how, as a woman, we have to be silent sometimes until we are heard. I just gave her every single thing.” LONGMIRE on Netflix. In an age when sweeping Oscar contenders air on streaming services and cable shows get increasingly experimental, “Longmire” seems like a relic of another era: It’s a laconic western procedural with a gruff sheriff solving a crime a week. It was dropped by A&E after three seasons, but was revived by Netflix for three more thanks to a rabid fan base and strong reviews; on Friday, the release of Season 6 will end its admirable run. The show follows Walt Longmire (Robert Taylor) and Vic Moretti (Katee Sackhoff) as they make eyes and fight baddies across the plains. “Among the hundreds of buddy-cop partnerships, theirs is one of the warmest and funniest,” Mike Hale wrote in a Times review. ACTIVE SHOOTER 8 p.m. on Showtime. This eight-part Showtime documentary series covering modern mass shootings arrived this fall with either incredibly good or bad timing, depending on whether you’re a viewer that seeks escape or intensive soul-searching. Since the show premiered on Sept. 29, mass shootings have devastated Las Vegas, Sutherland Springs, Tex., and Northern California. The final installment investigates the shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999, which killed 12 students and one teacher and sent the nation reeling. But the shooting is no longer one of the top 10 deadliest mass shootings in American postwar history. INDECENT 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). Paula Vogel’s warm tribute to “God of Vengeance,” a 1920s Yiddish play that outraged audiences on Broadway, won two Tonys and critical acclaim. “It is virtuous, sturdily assembled, informative and brimming with good faith,” wrote Ben Brantley in his Times review. A performance was captured live from the Cort Theater. REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER 10 p.m. on HBO. This year, critics called for Bill Maher’s firing after he used a racial epithet and had a cozy chat with the right-wing firebrand Milo Yiannopoulos. The condemnations don’t seem to be slowing down Mr. Maher, though — he was renewed on HBO through the next presidential election in 2020. He wraps up his 15th season on Friday with the environmentalist Bill McKibben, the comedian Chelsea Handler and other guests.",The New York Times
2017,What’s on TV Monday: David Letterman Receives the Mark Twain Prize and ‘Baltimore Rising’,"David Letterman’s prize ceremony has A-list guests. And “Baltimore Rising” paints a portrait of the city after the death of Freddie Gray. DAVID LETTERMAN RECEIVES THE MARK TWAIN PRIZE 8 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). In the final episode of “The Late Show,” the comedian Bill Murray delivered the last entry of Mr. Letterman’s final “Top 10 List,” titled “The Top 10 Things I’ve Always Wanted to Say to Dave.” Mr. Murray said, “Dave, I’ll never have the money I owe you.” In fact, many comedians owe much to Mr. Letterman, whose influence was recently honored with this comedy prize. At the ceremony, Mr. Murray was a featured guest — along with Steve Martin, Amy Schumer and others — and, speaking onstage, he had a new message for Mr. Letterman: “You’re not exactly a god, but you’re way up there.” BALTIMORE RISING (2017) 8 p.m. on HBO; also on HBO streaming platforms. This documentary follows community members in Baltimore after the arrest of Freddie Gray, the 25-year-old African-American man whose death, while in police custody, was felt nationwide in 2015. Directed by the actress Sonja Sohn (“The Wire”), the film follows police officers, activists and city residents as they reckon with the aftermath of Gray’s death. THERE WILL BE BLOOD (2007) on iTunes and Amazon. While you wait for “Phantom Thread,” Paul Thomas Anderson’s coming collaboration with the actor Daniel Day-Lewis, you can revisit this pair’s previous project, about an oil baron during the California oil boom at the turn of the 20th century. The role won Mr. Day-Lewis his second of three Academy Awards for best actor, and if he wins again for “Phantom Thread,” he will tie Katharine Hepburn’s Oscar record. THE GABRIELS on BroadwayHD. Richard Nelson’s 2016 three-play cycle, which follows an American family during that year’s presidential election, is an especially interesting watch one year later. Ben Brantley wrote in The New York Times that the works in the cycle “may collectively represent the most profound achievement in topical theater in this country since the Depression-era triumphs of Clifford Odets’s ‘Waiting for Lefty’ and Marc Blitzstein’s ‘The Cradle Will Rock.’” McCABE & MRS. MILLER (1971) On iTunes and Amazon. It has been just over a year since Leonard Cohen, the Canadian folk singer beloved for his warm and whispered poetry, died. His songs provide the soundtrack for this Robert Altman western, in which a roving gambler (Warren Beatty) joins forces with a British prostitute (Julie Christie) to open a brothel in a mountain town in Washington State. The critic Roger Ebert once wrote that Altman had “made a dozen films that can be called great in one way or another, but one of them is perfect, and that one is ‘McCabe & Mrs. Miller.’” The palpable chill of these hills — captured in wide shots — makes the film an especially fitting choice as the months grow colder.",The New York Times
2017,What’s on TV Monday: Veterans Day Documentaries and ‘Ill Behaviour’,"HBO and PBS honor Veterans Day with two new documentaries. And the wildly imaginative comedy “Ill Behaviour” arrives on Showtime. WAR DOG: A SOLDIER’S BEST FRIEND (2017) 8 p.m. on HBO; also on HBO streaming platforms. Directed by Deborah Scranton (“The War Tapes”), this new documentary looks at the bond between Special Operations soldiers and the K9s that serve them in combat. Three soldiers recount how their loyal, four-legged partners stood by their side on the battlefield and provided emotional support during the darkest times. PARADISE RUN 7 p.m. on Nickelodeon. Set in Hawaii, this game show pits pairs of young contestants against each other in grueling competitions. MAN WITH A PLAN 8:30 p.m. on CBS. Matt LeBlanc dips his toes into hands-on parenting in this family sitcom. Mr. LeBlanc plays Adam Burns, a contractor who gives up his role as Daddy Fun Times to become a stay-at-home dad after his wife, Andi (Liza Snyder), returns to work. Adam — a beer-loving man’s man — struggles with his new role but finds his way. The sitcom has its amusing moments, but its premise is a tad outdated, James Poniewozik wrote in The New York Times. In this second-season premiere, Andi becomes jealous when her daughter Kate (Grace Kaufman) turns to the family’s new babysitter for advice. Even worse, the attractive hire has her eyes on Adam. ALMOST SUNRISE (2017) 10 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). Two Iraq veterans, Tom Voss and Anthony Anderson, decide to come to terms with their wartime memories by walking from Milwaukee to Santa Barbara, Calif. Their symbolic trek was an attempt to overcome their “moral injury,” which this documentary defines as “a wound to the soul, caused by participation in events that violate one’s deeply held sense of right and wrong.” The 2,700-mile journey also helped raise funds for a veterans gathering place in Milwaukee. ILL BEHAVIOUR 10:30 p.m. on Showtime. This new dark comedy series imagines just how far some would go for the ones they love. When Charlie (Tom Riley) announces he has cancer but is opting for natural healing remedies instead of chemotherapy, his best friend, Joel (Chris Geere), won’t have it. With the help of his college friend Tess (Jessica Regan), Joel kidnaps Charlie, locks him in a basement and has an oncologist (Lizzy Caplan) administer chemotherapy against his will. ALIBI on Acorn TV. The infallible drama fodder of betrayal, love and murder gives this mini-series its edge. Written by Paul Abbott (“Shameless”), the thriller stars Michael Kitchen as Greg, a neurotic implicated in murdering his business partner. Marcey (Sophie Okonedo), a waitress at Greg’s wedding anniversary party, discovers Greg handling a corpse and helps him cover up what he claims was an accident. Marcey connects some dots and wonders if Greg can be trusted.",The New York Times
2017,What’s on TV Monday: ‘Chasing Trane’ and a Rolling Stone Retrospective,"A John Coltrane documentary, featuring the voice of Denzel Washington, has its premiere on PBS. And “Rolling Stone: Stories From the Edge” celebrates the magazine’s 50th anniversary. INDEPENDENT LENS: CHASING TRANE 10 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). Denzel Washington lends his voice to this documentary about John Coltrane, directed by John Scheinfeld (“The U.S. vs. John Lennon”). Mr. Washington shares words that Coltrane once spoke in interviews, which are paired with archival footage, home movies and photographs. Featured in the film are a number of musicians who worked with Coltrane — among them the pianist McCoy Tyner and the saxophonist Sonny Rollins — and interviews with several generations of artists whom he influenced, ranging from the jazz great Wayne Shorter to the rapper Common and the contemporary saxophonist Kamasi Washington. In a 1961 piece for The New York Times, the jazz critic John S. Wilson wrote that Coltrane’s sound “burns with emotional warmth, sometimes in gentle, lyrical fashion, more often with a singing, soaring cry that occasionally verges on raw fury.” That cry and that fury would help shape modern music. ROLLING STONE: STORIES FROM THE EDGE (2017) 9 p.m. on HBO; also on HBO streaming platforms. Rolling Stone magazine has had an eventful 50th-anniversary year. In September, the publisher and co-founder, Jann Wenner, announced that he was putting the magazine up for sale. Then, he had a public falling-out with his biographer, the journalist Joe Hagan, whose book, according to a review in The Times, is a “supple, confident, dispassionately reported and deeply well-written biography.” But, the review also noted, Mr. Wenner comes across as “a narcissist, a bully, a seducer and a betrayer, and a troubled soul.” This two-part documentary offers a somewhat lighter take on the last 50 years of the magazine, with at least one big bonus: a taste of the music that gave rise to Rolling Stone and that played a role in defining the publication. SEÑORA ACERO: LA COYOTE 10 p.m. on Telemundo. This Spanish-language episodic drama takes place around the United States-Mexico border. The title character, Vicenta Acero (Carolina Miranda), helps people cross the border, protecting them from drug gangs and other dangers along the way. WINTER’S BONE (2010) on iTunes, Amazon and Hulu. When the director Debra Granik’s film adaptation of Daniel Woodrell’s novel was released, A. O. Scott of The Times called Jennifer Lawrence’s performance “quietly heroic.” In this breakout role, Ms. Lawrence (who was 19 at the time) plays a young woman in southwestern Missouri who must track down her estranged father, who is wanted by the authorities for manufacturing methamphetamine. After a previous arrest, he had put up the family’s property as bond. Mr. Scott wrote that the film is about the way Ms. Lawrence’s character discovers “how cruel her native habitat can be and also about her initiation into its ways.” He called it “a coming-of-age story that is not entirely about breaking free.”",The New York Times
2017,What’s on TV Monday: ‘Hustle & Flow’ and ‘Le Havre’,"Terrence Howard plays a Memphis pimp with dreams in “Hustle & Flow.” And “Le Havre” sings a French immigrant song. HUSTLE & FLOW (2005) 7 p.m. on BET. The rap group Three 6 Mafia won an Academy Award for best original song for “It’s Hard Out Here for a Pimp,” written for this film where Terrence Howard plays a Memphis hustler with ambitions of becoming a professional rapper. In his 2005 review for The New York Times, A. O. Scott wrote that the film “illustrates the contradictions and distortions that define contemporary popular culture,” and that it “depicts — and inhabits — a world in which the only sure determinants of value are money and fame, but that still holds onto sentimental notions of authenticity and regionalism.” DOG AND BETH: FIGHT OF THEIR LIVES 9 p.m. on A&E. This two-hour special follows Duane Chapman (also known as Dog the Bounty Hunter) and his wife, Beth, as Ms. Chapman battles cancer. In a trailer for the program, Mr. Chapman says, defiantly: “That cancer picked on the wrong woman.” METH STORM (2017) 10 p.m. on HBO. A new documentary about drugs in America by the documentarians Brent and Craig Renaud, who, in addition to having won a Peabody Award, earned a 2012 Edward R. Murrow Award for The New York Times with their short film about earthquake survivors in Haiti. Here they interview people struggling with methamphetamine addiction in a community in rural Arkansas. The film also follows police officers and D.E.A. agents working to stop the spread of the drug. LE HAVRE (2011) on iTunes and Amazon. This film, written and directed by the Finnish filmmaker Aki Kaurismaki, takes place in the French port city for which it is named. After arriving there, a young African refugee (Blondin Miguel) meets a local shoe shiner (André Wilms), who befriends him and helps keep him hidden from the authorities. Reviewing the film for The Times, A. O. Scott wrote that Kaurismaki “does not rub our faces in hardship. Figuring that we already know something about how harsh life can be, he reminds us of its modest charms and fleeting beauties, and of how easy it is, in the face of cruelty, to behave decently.” The film is in French, with English subtitles. BROOKLYN (2015) on iTunes and Amazon. Saoirse Ronan plays a young Irish immigrant who finds love in 1950s Brooklyn. That love is felt both for a young man played by Emory Cohen and for the borough itself, though neither courtship is exactly smooth, and Ms. Ronan’s character eventually has to choose between her old and new homes — and lives. The film, based on the novel by Colm Toibin, takes place in Ireland and New York City. NACHO LIBRE (2006) on iTunes and Amazon. Jack Black plays a half-Mexican, half-Scandinavian cook in a Oaxaca monastery who yearns to become a luchador — a dream that the monastery won’t allow. In a review for The Times, Manohla Dargis called the film “endearingly ridiculous.”",The New York Times
2017,What’s on TV Saturday: ‘Get Out’ and ‘It’s Always Sunny …’,"Jordan Peele’s comic horror film airs on HBO. And the latest season of “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” streams on Hulu. GET OUT (2017) 8 p.m. on HBO. Guess who’s coming to HBO? In this smart horror comedy, one of this year’s most-discussed films, an interracial couple spends a weekend with the girlfriend’s parents, who both grin a little too widely. Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times that the director Jordan Peele “knows how to make shadowy streets into menacing ones and turn silences into warnings from the abyss,” and that he “hitched these genre elements to an evil that isn’t obscured by a hockey mask, but instead throws open its arms with a warm smile while enthusiastically (and strangely) expressing its love for President Obama.” In an interview on The Times’s Still Processing podcast, Mr. Peele described his perspective: “A lot of people say, ‘Why are you obsessed with race? Why don’t you drop it?’ Well, it’s not going to drop us.” IT’S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA on iTunes and Hulu. The beloved comedy about five friends in Philadelphia wrapped its 12th season earlier this year. It began with a malfunctioning electrical heating blanket and mostly kept to that signature feeling of absurdity throughout. A delay in filming the next season will give newcomers time to catch up and series die-hards a chance to revisit standout moments, like when an exercise bike gets a memorable — and unmentionable — alteration. RED BULL BC ONE WORLD FINAL 4 p.m. on Red Bull TV. Sixteen dancers from nine countries will compete in the final championship of this international break-dancing competition, which takes place in Amsterdam this year. ON HER MAJESTY’S SECRET SERVICE (1969) on Amazon. From the one-off performance by the Australian actor George Lazenby to an ending sequence featuring James Bond’s only bride, this outcast of the 007 franchise stands as a unique addition to the behemoth spy series. In a review for The Times, A. H. Weiler wrote that “serious criticism of such an esteemed institution would be tantamount to throwing rocks at Buckingham Palace.” Nearly 50 years later, that institution continues to flourish (and in a video made for the 2012 Olympics opening ceremonies, Daniel Craig’s Bond did indeed film a scene inside Buckingham Palace). Plus, Mr. Lazenby’s turn is now highly regarded: It topped a 007 Magazine poll rating all of the Bond films. The second- and third-place finishers, “Goldfinger” (1964) and “From Russia With Love” (1963), are also streaming on Amazon. 42 (2013) on iTunes, Amazon and Netflix. Chadwick Boseman plays Jackie Robinson in this biopic, with Harrison Ford as the Brooklyn Dodgers General Manager Branch Rickey. The movie “does a good job of dramatizing the salient emotions of the moment and the racism that surrounded Robinson and every other black American of his time,” A. O. Scott wrote in The Times, adding that the director Brian Helgeland “avoids the trap that so many depictions of the Jim Crow era fall into, which is to imply that racial prejudice was an individual or regional pathology rather than a national social norm.”",The New York Times
2017,What’s on TV Saturday: ‘Night of Too Many Stars’ and ‘Cold Blooded’,"Jon Stewart hosts a star-studded fund-raiser. And a documentary on SundanceTV revisits murders made famous by Truman Capote. NIGHT OF TOO MANY STARS 8 p.m. on HBO. Jon Stewart and Robert Smigel’s show raises money for the nonprofit Next for Autism. The roster includes Stephen Colbert, Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Hasan Minhaj, Ben Stiller and Abbi Jacobson. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Mr. Stewart discussed hearing about the challenges faced by Mr. Smigel, whose son has autism. “When you see people that you admire, you have this idea that they can solve anything that comes their way,” Mr. Stewart said. “To hear about what he was dealing with and how much they had to move heaven and earth, just to get basic necessities, it was shocking.” I AM ELIZABETH SMART (2017) 8 p.m. on Lifetime. Elizabeth Smart was 14 in 2002, the year she was kidnapped at knife point from her family’s Salt Lake City home. It would be nine months before she would return. According to a 2010 article in The Times, the ordeal “galvanized parental nightmares nationwide, but subsequently underscored the power of human resilience with the recovery and return to life that Ms. Smart appears to have made.” In this new film, Ms. Smart narrates a cinematic retelling of her story. THE AUTOPSY OF JANE DOE (2016) 9 p.m. on Showtime; also on Showtime streaming platforms. The Norwegian director André Ovredal delivers smart scares in his solo English-language feature debut, which involves a father-and-son team (played by Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch) performing the titular post-mortem. In a review for The Times, Jeannette Catsoulis designated the film a Critic’s Pick, writing that “as the cadaver coughs up its clues — a severed tongue; blackened lungs — the mortuary itself begins to stir with shuffling signs of life.” COLD BLOODED: THE CLUTTER FAMILY MURDERS 9 p.m. on SundanceTV. Between Truman Capote’s genre-defining 1966 nonfiction novel, “In Cold Blood”; the 1967 film of the same name; and “Capote,” the 2005 film about the writing of the book, you’ve probably already heard this story of murder on a Kansas farm. But this two-part documentary presents new reporting and interviews that offer a deeper look at the case itself, and examines how the impact of Capote’s book has inextricably linked it to the killings and spurred a lasting national obsession with true crime. To see that obsession in action, you can also watch David Fincher’s “Zodiac” (2007), which airs on Sundance immediately before “Cold Blooded,” at 5:30 p.m. BEAN (2017) 10 p.m. on Fuse; also on Fuse streaming platforms. “I did not expect to find a kidney on Tinder” is a sentence you’ll hear in this new documentary, which chronicles the story of a lesbian couple who, weeks after meeting on the dating app Tinder, learn that one is a kidney donor match for the other.",The New York Times
2017,What’s on TV Saturday: ‘The Beatles’ and ‘Fences’,"Ron Howard’s Beatles documentary has its broadcast debut. And Denzel Washington’s adaptation of an August Wilson play streams on Amazon and Hulu. THE BEATLES: EIGHT DAYS A WEEK — THE TOURING YEARS (2016) 8 p.m. on P.B.S.; also on Hulu. Ron Howard’s film documents the formative years of the British group, from early success until retirement from touring before the release of “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.” The story might be familiar, but the candid footage humanizes the Fab Four, with moments like George Harrison’s ashing his cigarette on an unaware John Lennon’s head in the middle of an interview. In grainy footage midway through the film, a reporter asks Paul McCartney, “What place do you think this story of the Beatles is going to have in the history of Western culture?” Mr. McCartney responds: “You must be kidding me with that question. Culture? It’s not culture.” The reporter presses: “What is it?” Mr. McCartney: “A good laugh.” You’ll almost want to believe him; the film shows it to be both. HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE (2005) 5:40 p.m. on Freeform. After the notably dark “Prisoner of Azkaban,” Potter went PG-13 with the fourth film in the series, in which Harry and his compatriots navigate a dangerous magical tournament, and the snarling Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is seen fully formed for the first time. For those wanting to catch up on the series, the first three films air at 7 a.m., 10:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. KONG: SKULL ISLAND (2017) 8 p.m. on HBO. Those in need of some escapist action this holiday weekend can gaze at the latest digital reboot of the world’s most famous gorilla. This version stars Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, Brie Larson, John C. Reilly and John Goodman. In her review for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote that the infamous ape “turns our gaze back on ourselves” and that “Kong is the beast we know, the beast we deny, the beast we fear, the beast we kill.” FENCES (2016) On iTunes, Amazon and Hulu. Denzel Washington plays an aging father in this film adaptation of the August Wilson play, directed by Mr. Washington. The story is centered on an African-American family in 1950s Pittsburgh. In his review for The Times, A. O. Scott described Mr. Washington’s voice as “a mighty instrument.” “If you closed your eyes and just listened to ‘Fences,’” he wrote, “you would hear a verbal performance of unmatched force and nuance.” BLOOD ROAD (2017) On Red Bull TV. In this adventurous documentary, the endurance athlete Rebecca Rusch, along with the Vietnamese cyclist Huyen Nguyen, bikes the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Vietnam in search of the site where Ms. Rusch’s father’s plane crashed during the Vietnam War. It’s a tribute, a search for answers and, perhaps, an education.",The New York Times
2017,What’s on TV Sunday: Joe Biden and the MTV Europe Awards,"Oprah Winfrey sits down with Joe Biden for an interview about the loss of his son to cancer. A documentary explores one of America’s first celebrity chefs. SUPERSOUL SUNDAY 11 a.m. on OWN.

MTV EUROPE MUSIC AWARDS 3 p.m. on MTV. The Europe Music Awards were created in 1994 as counterprogramming to the American V.M.A.s. Somehow, though, all six of those nominated for best artist this year are from North America. But the host is Rita Ora, who grew up in West London and will attempt to imbue the Wembley Arena event with a hometown sensibility as her wanderlust-driven single “Anywhere” climbs the British charts. She’ll be joined onstage by fellow Brits (Liam Payne, Stormzy), a Cuban-American (Camila Cabello), and the éminence grise of Ireland, U2. And Kesha returns after a bitter legal battle to support an uplifting new album, “Rainbow.” JEREMIAH TOWER: THE LAST MAGNIFICENT (2017) 9 p.m. on CNN. Before Emeril, Bobby Flay and Gordon Ramsay, there was Jeremiah Tower, one of America’s first celebrity chefs. Along with the chef Alice Waters, he transformed Chez Panisse in Berkeley into a cultural destination, putting fresh local ingredients at the heart of a new California Cuisine. The result was a “complete re-evaluation of not just American food and ingredients, but food,” said Anthony Bourdain, an executive producer of this documentary. This film chronicles Mr. Tower’s creation of the immensely popular restaurant Stars, his disappearance from the spotlight, and subsequent return to Tavern on the Green.

Simmons and Michelle Rodriguez. STAR TREK: DISCOVERY on CBS All Access. The latest “Star Trek” reboot is set a decade before the original series; it has taken on a darker tone than previous iterations, and centers on First Officer Michael Burnham (Sonequa Martin-Green). “The series’ most promising innovation has been making the protagonist not the crew’s captain but an outsider,” James Poniewozik wrote in The New York Times. Sunday’s episode is the last of the fall. An earlier version of this column misstated the length of “AMC Visionaries: Robert Kirkman’s Secret History of Comics.” It is a six-part series that began on Sunday with a second episode on Monday, not a two-night special.",The New York Times

What was really going through Patty Hearst’s mind when she walked into a San Francisco bank in 1974 with a group of terrorists? Was she terrified of her companions, an urban guerrilla group that had kidnapped her and tortured her with sensory deprivation tactics? Or had she been radicalized to believe that, in her own terms, “the only way we can free ourselves of this fascist dictatorship is by fighting”? This new documentary seeks an answer and recounts her strange transformation with documentation of communication between Ms. Hearst and her captors, rare news coverage and footage of a police shootout. GRAVITY (2013) 10:30 p.m. on WGN America. Very few films are as nerve-racking start to finish as this Alfonso Cuarón thriller, which scooped up seven Oscars in 2014. Sandra Bullock stars as the astronaut Dr. Ryan Stone, whose first mission in space is derailed by high-speed debris that wrecks her spaceship. What follows is an hour plus of pure survival in the face of one calamity after another. “All of it — terrifyingly and marvelously — evades summary and confounds expectations,” wrote A. O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. “You have to see it to believe it.” (WGN America’s “Out of This World Weekend” also includes CONTACT at 2 p.m., INCEPTION at 5, and GODZILLA at 8.)

Archival performance footage across the decades is also shown.",The New York Times
2017,What’s on TV Sunday: ‘Search Party’ and the American Music Awards,"“Search Party,” starring Alia Shawkat, returns for a second season. Pink and Kelly Clarkson team up at the American Music Awards. SEARCH PARTY 10 p.m. on TBS. This comedy started out as a wandering critique of millennial angst and entitlement, as Dory (Alia Shawkat) assembled an incompetent ragtag team of friends to investigate the disappearance of a college acquaintance, Chantal. But their sleuthing ended disastrously, prompting the show to take on a brutally dark tone. Season 2 follows their cover-up efforts. It’s tenser and meaner, delivered in waves of paranoid, hilarious outbursts. AMERICAN MUSIC AWARDS 8 p.m. on ABC. They’re both pop megastars who specialize in torch ballads of uplift and heartbreak, but Pink and Kelly Clarkson perform in remarkably different ways. While Pink soars through the air amid pyrotechnics and hordes of dancers, Ms. Clarkson prefers to plant her feet and let the tears flow. The pair will seek common ground when they perform together for the first time to open the American Music Awards. Tracee Ellis Ross (a star of “black-ish” on ABC) will host, and give her mother, Diana Ross, a lifetime achievement award. Selena Gomez, Demi Lovato and Niall Horan are also scheduled to perform. POLDARK 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). The series wraps up its third season with Ross and Demelza’s relationship in tatters. The slimy Whitworth faces a reckoning, while Elizabeth turns the tables on George. THE ROOT 100 9 p.m. on Fusion. The Root celebrates 100 African-Americans, ages 25 to 45, who have left an imprint on culture and politics this year. The honoree Yamiche Alcindor, a reporter for The New York Times, gives a speech, and Representative Maxine Waters of California appears via video to accept a public service award. THE PROBLEM WITH APU 10 p.m. on truTV. “I’m a comedian going after the biggest comedy show of all time,” Hari Kondabolu told The Times about his new documentary. In it, he wrestles with his relationship to one of his favorite shows, “The Simpsons,” and one of its most problematic characters, Apu, a convenience store owner who exhibits many of the stereotypes that South Asians have tried to shake for years. But the documentary goes beyond one cartoon character, exploring the depiction of South Asian characters as a whole and the discrimination that actors have faced in Hollywood. Aziz Ansari, Kal Penn and others are interviewed. JACKIE BROWN (1997) on Netflix. Several movies unfold within “Jackie Brown,” Quentin Tarantino’s experimental adaptation of Elmore Leonard’s novel “Rum Punch.” There’s an intricate blaxploitation caper starring an ornery Samuel L. Jackson; a stoner comedy starring Robert De Niro; and perhaps most important, a tender, slow-boiling love story starring Pam Grier and Robert Forster. (Chris Tucker also stops by for a rip-roaring five minutes of verbal jousting.) All of these coalesce into an unpredictable and thrilling whole.",The New York Times
2017,What’s on TV Sunday: ‘Shameless’ and ‘Last Week Tonight’,"“Shameless” returns with more drugs and poverty. Jenny Slate has a guest spot on “Bob’s Burgers.” SHAMELESS 8 p.m. on Showtime. The Gallagher clan has endured deaths, mental illnesses, prison stints, addictions and so much more over seven bleak, hilarious seasons. They stumble into Season 8 after burying their matriarch, Monica; she’s bequeathed them each with a bag of meth, which they handle with various degrees of maturity. The coming season deals in relevant plotlines like a new presidential administration and anti-immigration raids descending on the South Side of Chicago; within the family, Frank (William H. Macy) tries to sober up, and Fiona (Emmy Rossum) becomes a landlord. BOB’S BURGERS 7:30 p.m. on Fox. Of all of the cartoon sitcom families on TV, the only one you’d probably want to be a part of is the Belchers, who, unlike the Simpsons, the Marshes or the Griffins, are kindhearted, generous and mostly just trying their best. In this episode, Tina (voiced by Dan Mintz) starts a babysitting enterprise, which is quickly derailed by her nemesis, Tammy (Jenny Slate, a voice-over veteran from “The Secret Life of Pets,” “Marcel the Shell With Shoes On” and many more). Bob and Linda scout out a competitor in the restaurant business. “The Simpsons” follows at 8 p.m., with Grampa getting a hearing aid. LAST WEEK TONIGHT WITH JOHN OLIVER 11 p.m. on HBO. In a climate where troubling or seismic news seems to break every day, a weekly news show like John Oliver’s runs the risk of missing essential stories or glossing over the details. But Mr. Oliver hasn’t changed his methodical, slow-burning attacks, usually spending each episode skillfully dissecting one topic with plenty of zingers. This season he has gone after Equifax; Harvey Weinstein; and his No. 1 antagonist, President Trump, and his relationship with the truth. RIDE WITH NORMAN REEDUS 11 p.m. on AMC. In the event of a zombie apocalypse, there aren’t many people you would rather have riding shotgun than Norman Reedus, who is still surviving as the lovable rogue Daryl on “The Walking Dead.” “Ride With Norman Reedus” puts the motorcycle enthusiast on the road to visit custom bike shops, tattoo parlors and smokehouses; in this episode in Spain, he is joined by Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who’s been terrorizing Daryl as Negan on “The Walking Dead.” MARC MARON: TOO REAL (2017) on Netflix. Things that get better with age: wine, cheese and Marc Maron’s curmudgeon act. His endearing grumpiness is on full display on his podcast, “WTF”; in his turn as a narcissistic, coke-addled director on “GLOW”; and especially in this new standup special. (His first sentence is “I can’t take it.”) Mr. Maron goes off on the president, contemplates mortality while watching the Rolling Stones live and lampoons the landscape of streaming services that churns out an endless supply of meaningless content — with a pinch of sarcasm, of course.",The New York Times
2017,What’s on TV Thursday: The Macy’s Parade and ‘She’s Gotta Have It’,"Shows to watch with your family, or to help you avoid talking to the relatives. MACY’S THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE 9 a.m. on CBS and NBC. Floating down Central Park West this year: Hello Kitty, Charlie Brown, an Angry Bird, a Power Ranger, and Olaf from “Frozen.” Performers include Gwen Stefani, Andra Day, Common, Smokey Robinson, marching bands and more. NATIONAL DOG SHOW 12 p.m. on NBC. They’re good dogs, America. N.F.L. FOOTBALL: VIKINGS VS. LIONS 12:30 p.m. on Fox. The later games will likely be slogs, as they feature four teams at or below .500. But tune in early for this showdown of division rivals, with the 6-4 Lions, who mount a Top 5 offense behind Matthew Stafford, scrapping for a playoff spot and looking to gain ground on the 8-2 Vikings, whose deep defense has propelled them to six straight wins. ANNE OF GREEN GABLES — THE GOOD STARS 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). For 110 years old, Anne Shirley is looking quite refreshed these days. The spunky, spirited title character of L. M. Montgomery’s beloved 1908 novel “Anne of Green Gables” was the subject of a Netflix adaptation, “Anne With an E,” which received shining reviews. Now she returns in PBS’s continuing series, starring Martin Sheen as Matthew. In this installment, Anne (Ella Ballentine) turns 13 and faces complex issues with her friends and a closer relationship with Gilbert. SHE’S GOTTA HAVE IT on Netflix. Spike Lee’s debut film, “She’s Gotta Have It,” felt radical when it arrived in 1986, with its brash depiction of modern sexuality, casual monologues delivered straight to the camera, black-and-white tones and pellucid jazz soundtrack. But so much has changed in 21 years in terms of sexual and racial politics, as well as the fundamental landscape of Brooklyn, where gentrification has filled neighborhoods like Fort Greene with artisanal crafts and cocktails. Mr. Lee’s Netflix update both condemns and delights in all these changes, centering on a millennial, Nola Darling (DeWanda Wise), who refers to Kanye West, O. T. Genasis and Black Lives Matter as fluidly as she does Malcolm X. Anthony Ramos (“Hamilton”) takes on the classic Spike Lee role of Mars Blackmon with a hyperkinetic glee. Meanwhile, revisit the original film (on Netflix) for its excruciating Thanksgiving dinner shared by Nola (Tracy Camilla Johns) and her three disgruntled lovers. NEW GIRL on Netflix. “New Girl” was never really about the girl — it’s more about the makeshift family that unexpectedly blossoms in a Los Angeles loft. The show’s push toward communal and familial intimacy makes its Thanksgiving episodes particularly gratifying. In Season 1’s “Thanksgiving,” Jess (Zooey Deschanel) scrambles to impress a colleague (played by a delightfully bumbling Justin Long) by cooking a turkey in the dryer, while glimmers of the zany, enduring chemistry between Schmidt (Max Greenfield) and Cece (Hannah Simone) emerge. Season 4’s “Thanksgiving IV” is looser and raunchier, but reveals the show’s compassionate core.",The New York Times
2017,What’s on TV Thursday: ‘A Charlie Brown Christmas’ and ‘Penn & Teller’,"Charlie Brown gets the holiday blues. And amateur magicians try to fool Penn & Teller. A CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS (1965) 8 p.m. on ABC. This network’s Thursday lineup features two starkly different approaches to the holidays. The “Peanuts” gang tackles the anxieties and shortcomings of the season head on, as Charlie Brown desperately tries to salvage a pitiful Christmas tree; the understated, intimate piano trio score from Vince Guaraldi sets the mood. In contrast, THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF DISNEY: MAGICAL HOLIDAY CELEBRATION, at 9, is a sparkling global blowout hosted by Julianne Hough and Nick Lachey, with showstopping musical performances and lighting ceremonies at Disney castles from Florida to Shanghai to Paris. PENN & TELLER: FOOL US 9 p.m. on the CW. Dozens of magicians have stepped up to the stage on “Penn & Teller: Fool Us,” hoping to perform a trick so perplexing that the show’s veteran magician hosts are unable to decode its process. But only a quarter succeed and go on to land a performance slot with Penn & Teller in Las Vegas. This is the Season 4 finale; Alyson Hannigan (“How I Met Your Mother”) is a co-host and willing participant in many tricks. DEADPOOL (2016) 9:45 p.m. on Cinemax. Perhaps hoping to contrast with the unyielding gloom of DC’s “Batman v Superman,” Marvel pivoted toward buddy comedy in “Thor: Ragnarok,” the newest installment of that franchise. It wouldn’t be surprising if Marvel’s own “Deadpool” had provided some inspiration: The superhero title character, played with obvious delight by Ryan Reynolds, mugs at the camera like Jim from “The Office,” quips at his victims while slicing them to bits, and banters a mile a minute with his best friend, Weasel (the droll T. J. Miller). The plot, which includes some malevolent mutants, is mostly beside the point. THE CHRIS GETHARD SHOW 11 p.m. on TruTV. The rise of Mr. Gethard’s anti-talk show has been a strange and profane Cinderella story. It has evolved from a local live show to public-access TV to cable, mostly retaining its experimental, iconoclastic spirit along the way. A panel of often mismatched entertainers answers questions from unpredictable callers, and bizarre experiments are performed. The finale of the show’s first season on TruTV features the guests Paul Scheer and Jason Mantzoukas — veterans of another raunchy comedy, “The League.” BROADCHURCH on Netflix. For the last few years, David Tennant and Olivia Colman have forged one of television’s most compelling partnerships as Alec Hardy and Ellie Miller, detectives who trade stinging barbs as they crack cases together on the imposing British coastline. “Broadchurch” builds suspense with deliberate, often agonizing pacing and then explodes in dizzying bursts of action. Season 3 arrived this week on Netflix.",The New York Times
2017,What’s on TV Thursday: ‘Back’ and ‘Project Runway’,"The 16th season of “Project Runway” comes to a close. And a new Mitchell and Webb series debuts on streaming. BACK on Sundance Now. David Mitchell and Robert Webb have mined excruciatingly uncomfortable situations for laughs for more than two decades, whether at Cambridge University in Britain, in sketch television shows, or on their acclaimed sitcom “Peep Show.” They’ll torment each other yet again in “Back,” with the pair slipping into a familiar dynamic: Mr. Mitchell plays the hapless, neutered Stephen, trying to take over his recently deceased father’s business; Mr. Webb plays his estranged foster brother, the swaggering, possibly malicious Andrew, who shows up just in time to throw everything into disarray. Simon Blackwell (“Peep Show,” “Veep”) created and wrote the script. THE INBETWEENERS on Netflix. Ben Palmer, the director of “Back,” made his name with “The Inbetweeners,” another supremely awkward British cringe comedy whose target is not bloated middle age, but rather adolescence. The show centers on the nerdy Will (Simon Bird), who transfers to a private school and befriends a group of crass but lovable misfits. The group stumbles through mundane suburban life, unwittingly creating fiascoes at amusement parks, nursing homes and trailer parks. Think of it as the British answer to “Superbad.” IT’S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA on Netflix. You have less than a month to watch 11 seasons of this delirious gross-out sitcom before it leaves Netflix in December. The show follows five ignorant, arrogant bar owners in South Philadelphia in their Sisyphean quests for wealth, fame, sex, bragging rights and mere literacy. Not sure where to start? Try “The Gang Solves the Gas Crisis,” a fiery caper that ends with one of the great catchphrases of all time; “Charlie Work,” a kaleidoscopic single-shot sendup of “Birdman” that finds genius within an idiotic routine; “Sweet Dee Has a Heart Attack,” which takes going postal to a depraved new level; and “The Nightman Cometh,” maybe the worst musical ever written. N.F.L. FOOTBALL: STEELERS VS. TITANS 8:25 p.m. on NBC. This matchup features two confident division leaders who roll into the week with four-game winning streaks. The Pittsburgh Steelers have one of the league’s top defenses as well as the offensive savants Le’Veon Bell and Antonio Brown, and the Tennessee Titans’ running game has boomed recently behind the quarterback Marcus Mariota. PROJECT RUNWAY 9 p.m. on Lifetime. The 16th season comes to a close as the final four designers head to New York Fashion Week. Jessica Alba is guest judge. SCANDAL 9 p.m. on ABC. The first half of the final season ends after a shocking revelation about Olivia Pope (Kerry Washington) and her ability to break bad. Quinn (Katie Lowes), meanwhile, has vanished. The fall finale of HOW TO GET AWAY WITH MURDER follows at 10.",The New York Times
2017,What’s on TV Thursday: ‘Mom’ and ‘Thor’,"Allison Janney returns with the fifth season of “Mom.” And Shemar Moore tackles timely issues in “S.W.A.T.” MOM 9 p.m. on CBS (check local listings). The leaves change, the clock falls back, and Allison Janney begins another Emmy campaign on “Mom.” Ms. Janney has been nominated each of the past four years for her droll portrayal of the recovering alcoholic Bonnie, winning twice. This sitcom often ventures into serious material without becoming overly maudlin; it’s largely driven by the chemistry and camaraderie between Ms. Janney and her co-star, Anna Faris. The fifth season begins as Christy (Ms. Faris) tries to study for the LSATs and Bonnie tries to figure out the next phase of her relationship. THOR (2011) 7:30 p.m. on FX. On Friday, Chris Hemsworth returns to the big screen as his affable, hammer-swinging Norse god in “Thor: Ragnarok,” which has received excellent reviews for its humor and breezy tone. Revisit the first film in the series, in which Thor is banished to Earth by his father; he regains his strength with the help of mere mortals in New Mexico, including Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). The movie received many positive reviews, but A. O. Scott of The New York Times was not a fan, writing that it left viewers “hammered with one cliché after another.” THE GOOD PLACE 8:30 p.m. on NBC. Each of NBC’s Thursday shows will wrap up its fall season, with the most notable of the bunch being “The Good Place.” This Kristen Bell-led comedy has grown more confident and experimental in its second season, as its members negotiate their own special version of the afterlife. The slate is rounded out by finales for “Superstore” (8 p.m.), “Will & Grace” (9), “Great News” (9:30) and “Chicago Fire” (10). S.W.A.T. 10 p.m. on CBS (check local listings). If CBS ever created its own Hall of Fame, it would include no-brainers like Mary Tyler Moore and David Letterman, but also Shemar Moore. Between “The Young and the Restless” and “Criminal Minds,” he’s spent over 20 years at the network breaking hearts, fighting bad guys and winning awards. On Thursday he begins his third CBS chapter with “S.W.A.T.” The show, set in Los Angeles, wastes no time tackling timely issues: In the pilot, the head of the elite unit accidentally shoots a black teenager and is replaced by Mr. Moore’s character, the locally born officer Daniel Harrelson. As he assumes control of the department, Harrelson is torn between his official duties and the community that raised him. Justin Lin (of the “Fast and the Furious” franchise) directed the pilot. CALL MY AGENT on Netflix. This French comedy enters its second season following the hectic lives of a talent agency and its celebrity clients. As on shows like “Curb Your Enthusiasm” and “Life’s Too Short,” real-life stars play heightened versions of themselves; the character-driven show is funny even if you’re not familiar with French show business. “It’s like drinking an exciting exotic soda whose flavor mimics a fruit you’ve never heard of,” Margaret Lyons wrote for The Times.",The New York Times
2017,What’s on TV Thursday: ‘Nathan for You’ and ‘Grey’s Anatomy’,"“Grey’s Anatomy” reaches its 300th episode. And two comedies revel in their cringiness. NATHAN FOR YOU 9 p.m. on Comedy Central. One mission of the Canadian comic Nathan Fielder is to help small-business owners attract customers by whatever means necessary. Those means vary from counterintuitive (letting customers shoplift) to absurd (staging a video of a pig saving a goat at a petting zoo) to morally queasy (advertising at cemeteries). Whether his schemes work is beside the point. “His deadpan genius is in defining the age, not solving its problems,” wrote Neil Genzlinger in a review in The New York Times. In the season finale, Mr. Fielder attempts to help a Bill Gates impersonator reunite with his long-lost love. X-MEN: FIRST CLASS (2011) 7:45 p.m. on FXM. The fifth installment of the “X-Men” franchise jumps back to the 1960s, when the United States was on the brink of nuclear war and turtlenecks were all the rage. James McAvoy (as the idealistic Charles Xavier) and Michael Fassbender (as the bitter, anguished Erik Lehnsherr) anchor the movie; while the world rages around them and governments target them for their mutant powers, the young men slowly transform into the formidable characters of Professor X and Magneto. “The whole enterprise has an agreeable lightness, no small thing, given its rapidly moving parts,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review in The Times. GREY’S ANATOMY 8 p.m. on ABC. A small number of American television dramas have reached 300 episodes — the list consists of cultural pillars like “Lassie,” “Law & Order” and “CSI.” On Thursday, “Grey’s Anatomy” joins the club, with a special episode that looks back on the show’s history. Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) find themselves treating a group of patients from a roller-coaster accident who look eerily like the show’s three other original interns: Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) and George O’Malley (T. R. Knight). And the showrunners have promised a special Easter egg hunt for fans. BETTER THINGS 10 p.m. on FX. In an essay for The Times this week, Pamela Adlon wrote about her agonizing adolescence: “All of 9, and I had legs like Jon Hamm’s face at 5 o’clock,” she wrote. She brings a similar unblinking, uproarious honesty to her show “Better Things,” on which she plays Sam, a single mother of three. In this episode she takes her girls on a trip. AN IDIOT ABROAD on Netflix. One of Nathan Fielder’s spiritual predecessors in cringe humor is Karl Pilkington, an ill-tempered, gormless producer and writer; he makes his friend and collaborator Ricky Gervais crack up with every gripe. In this show, Mr. Gervais and Stephen Merchant send Mr. Pilkington around the world for deeply uncomfortable encounters; he mopes along the Great Wall of China, trains as a luchador in Mexico and learns to samba in Brazil, all the while unleashing his signature tirades on unsuspecting bystanders.",The New York Times
2017,What’s on TV Tuesday: ‘Crooked House’ and ‘Who Killed Tupac?’,"A new Agatha Christie adaptation streams ahead of its theatrical release. And a documentary mini-series explores the death of the rapper Tupac Shakur. CROOKED HOUSE (2017) on iTunes and Amazon. If Kenneth Branagh’s recent adaptation of “Murder on the Orient Express” left you in the mood for more mystery from the mind of Agatha Christie, you’ll be glad to learn that this adaptation of Christie’s “Crooked House” is available to stream ahead of its theatrical release next month. Glenn Close stars as the matriarch of a family in which one member has just been murdered, and Max Irons (“The Riot Club”) plays a private detective who has come to investigate. SAVING CAPITALISM (2017) on Netflix. The former labor secretary Robert B. Reich hosts this documentary, based on his 2015 book and directed by Jacob Kornbluth (“Inequality for All”). Through interviews and commentary, Mr. Reich examines the state of the United States economy. MARVEL’S RUNAWAYS on Hulu. The fate of the world is in the hands of the next generation in this new series, based on the Marvel comic books of the same name. In it, young superheroes team up to fight their supervillain parents. BEAT BUGS on Netflix. A holiday special of the animated children’s show centered on a group of young bugs will feature a cover of the Beatles’ “Here Comes the Sun” performed by Yusuf Islam, formerly known as Cat Stevens. The series’s story lines and characters are inspired by Beatles lyrics. WHO KILLED TUPAC? 9 p.m. on A&E. This six-part series looks into the death of the rapper Tupac Shakur, who was killed in a drive-by shooting in 1996. The incident prompted widespread theories about who pulled the trigger, some of which are discussed in this documentary hosted by the civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump. In Shakur’s obituary in The New York Times, Jon Pareles wrote: “In some raps, Mr. Shakur glamorized the life of the ‘player,’ a high-living, macho gangster flaunting ill-gotten gains. But in many others, sometimes on the same albums, he portrayed the gangster life as a desperate, self-destructive existence of fear and sudden death. He described gangsterism as a vicious cycle, a grimly inevitable response to racism, ghetto poverty and police brutality.” THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI (1957) 10:30 p.m. on TCM. This World War II film stars Alec Guinness as a British colonel in a Japanese prisoner of war camp who must oversee the building of a bridge to aid Japanese forces. The film won best picture at the 30th Academy Awards, in 1958. In a review for The Times the previous year, Bosley Crowther summed up the film, writing: “Here is the heart of this fine picture, here is its stark and potent theme: discipline and conformity are the obsession of the professional militarist. And upon this rising realization hinges all the subsequent drama and suspense as a small commando team inches into the jungle to destroy the colonel’s precious bridge.”",The New York Times
2017,What’s on TV Tuesday: ‘Damnation’ and ‘The Long Road Home’,"“Damnation,” a Depression-era drama, has its premiere on USA. And “The Long Road Home” examines an ambush on American troops in Baghdad. DAMNATION 10 p.m. on USA. The place is rural Iowa, and the year is 1931. A preacher (played by Killian Scott) is trying to start a revolution among the farmers, and there’s a big-money strikebreaker (Logan Marshall-Green) whose job it is to prevent one. The premiere episode of this period drama, directed by Adam Kane, opens with a farmer firing a rifle into his chicken coop, aiming at a young woman trying to steal his eggs. “Can’t afford to lose more eggs,” he says. “Times are hard enough as it is.” The preacher asks the farmer: “Aren’t you losing both eggs and chickens each time you take a shot?” The farmer just shrugs. “A man has got to abide by his principles.” There might be echoes of Steinbeck here, but the show stays in the heartland — so no grapes, but wrath aplenty. THE LONG ROAD HOME 9 p.m. on National Geographic. This mini-series based on Martha Raddatz’s best seller centers on an ambush on American troops in Baghdad on April 4, 2004, a day now known as Black Sunday. In a review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote that Ms. Raddatz’s book “has grit and high drama.” Here, that drama and grit are delivered by a cast that includes the Emmy-nominated actor Michael Kelly, who plays the leader of a rescue operation responding to the ambush. SOCIAL FABRIC 12:30 a.m. Wednesday on Fuse. The second of two premiere episodes of this fashion-focused show brings viewers to Scotland, Los Angeles and Kenya to learn how plaid cloth has been used by different cultures, from kilts of the Celts to clothing of California hipsters. LEAP! (2017) on iTunes and Amazon. An animated story of two children who escape their orphanage and travel to Paris, where one (voiced by Elle Fanning) hopes to become a ballerina. In a review for The Times, Ken Jaworowski wrote: “You’ve seen it all before, though it’s pleasant enough to watch again.” CAPTAIN FANTASTIC (2016) on iTunes and Amazon. Viggo Mortensen stars as a father with six children that he and his wife have raised in the Oregon wilderness. When the film picks up, the mother has died in a faraway hospital, and the family decides to journey into civilization to attend the funeral. Their mode of transport? A Merry Pranksters-esque school bus, which ferries them along as they clash with society. In a review for The Times, A. O. Scott designated the film a Critic’s Pick, and wrote that Mr. Mortensen “has a way of making you believe his characters can do whatever they set their minds to: fly, leap over buildings, save the world.” This character’s most impressive — and sometimes frustrating — power is even simpler: a steadfast dedication to being radically different.",The New York Times
2017,What’s on TV Tuesday: ‘Future Man’ and ‘The Hunt for the Zodiac Killer’,"Time travelers must transform a video gamer into a hero in “Future Man.” And a new series attempts to unravel the mystery of the Zodiac killer. FUTURE MAN on Hulu. Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen, the executive producers of this new action comedy series, drew inspiration from quintessential science-fiction franchises like “Back to the Future” and “Star Wars.” But what sets “Future Man” apart is that it also channels “Austin Powers.” The series’s protagonist is Josh (Josh Hutcherson), a hopeless janitor who passes the time playing Biotic Wars, a video game that seems impossible to beat. When Josh conquers the game, two visitors from the future (Eliza Coupe and Derek Wilson) travel back in time and explain that the game is actually a recruitment and training tool used to find a savior from the past. They soon realize that they’ll have to lower their expectations because their “savior” isn’t exactly the sharpest tool in the shed. DERAY DAVIS: HOW TO ACT BLACK (2017) on Netflix. The comic and actor DeRay Davis (“21 Jump Street,” “The Boondocks”) performs at the Variety Playhouse in Atlanta, riffing on racism, his upbringing in Chicago and his brief role as Jermel in “Empire.” NERO WOLFE on MHz Choice. Based on the detective fiction of the novelist Rex Stout, this series stars Francesco Pannofino as Nero Wolfe, a crabby aesthete and investigator who heavily relies on his assistant, Archie Goodwin (Pietro Sermonti), to do all his legwork. In this second adaptation by the Italian broadcaster RAI, Nero and Archie are newly transplanted from the United States to Italy and ready to crack the toughest of cases. THE HUNT FOR THE ZODIAC KILLER 10 p.m. on History. The self-proclaimed Zodiac killer murdered five random victims in the 1960s in Northern California and claimed to kill 37 in cryptic letters sent to local newspapers explaining his motive. Several suspects have surfaced over the years, but the culprit remains unidentified. (Ted Cruz, the Republican senator, recently acknowledged a long-running internet joke accusing him.) This five-part series follows a team of investigators who, with the help of a supercomputer programmed to think like a killer, crack a significant portion of the letters’ cipher and inch one step closer to revealing the murderer. BIZARRE FOODS: DELICIOUS DESTINATIONS 9 p.m. on Travel. The television chef Andrew Zimmern travels to Reykjavik in Iceland for salted cod and the yogurtlike dairy product skyr. Mr. Zimmern isn’t the first celebrity chef to traverse the globe seeking unusual cuisines. But in a 2007 review in The New York Times, Susan Stewart proclaimed him “a delight”: “Less dangerous than Anthony Bourdain, less annoying than Rachael Ray.” AMERICAN HORROR STORY on 10 p.m. on FX. Season 7 of this anthology series has been eerily exploring the tumultuous political climate under the current administration. It comes to an end with this finale, aptly titled “Great Again.”",The New York Times
2017,What’s on TV Wednesday: The C.M.A. Awards and ‘The A Word’,"Country stars will perform at the CMA Awards. And a documentary about the racecar driver Danica Patrick tackles her triumphs and shortcomings. CMA AWARDS 8 p.m. on ABC. A cloud will hang over the 52nd Annual Country Music Association Awards after two deadly mass shootings, including one at a Las Vegas country music festival last month. Hoping to keep the focus on the music, the association initially tried to forbid journalists to address topics like gun rights or politics. But it backed down after a backlash; don’t be surprised if the event is more contentious than in years past, or if typically neutral artists, like the show’s host, Brad Paisley, turn political. Carrie Underwood will co-host, and Kelsea Ballerini, Chris Stapleton, Miranda Lambert, Tim McGraw and Pink are among the performers. DANICA 8 p.m. on Epix. This new documentary about the trailblazing racecar driver Danica Patrick unsurprisingly covers her triumphs, including winning the Indy Japan 300 and becoming the first woman to take a lead at the Indianapolis 500. But “Danica,” directed by Hannah Storm of ESPN, isn’t all rip-roaring success: It also homes in on Ms. Patrick’s frustration with her career stagnation, as she’s sagged to the middle of the pack in many recent races. The result is a portrait of a jaded but extremely proud competitor. EMPIRE 8 p.m. on Fox. Lucious (Terrence Howard) tries to get his groove back in the studio amid concerns over his memory. Andre’s feelings for Detective Pamela Rose intensify. Forest Whitaker guest stars. STORAGE WARS 9 p.m. on A&E. In seven years, “Storage Wars” has transformed from hoarder oddity into bona fide juggernaut, with spinoffs emerging left and right while detractors question the show’s veracity. Dan and Laura Dotson, Darrell Sheets and the rest of the main players return for more lock cutting and bargain hunting in this 11th-season premiere. THE A WORD 10 p.m. on Sundance. There are not many shows that give a more honest, unblinking look at autism and its ripple effects than “The A Word.” The story focuses on a dysfunctional, sprawling family coming to grips with the fact that its youngest member, the 5-year-old Joe (Max Vento), is autistic. In his Times review, Neil Genzlinger called the show “anguishing but also sometimes drolly funny.” Season 2 picks up two years after the end of the last season, with Joe slowly realizing how he is different from others. His grandfather Maurice struggles with an unrequited love. FRANCES HA (2012) on Netflix. There’s not much of a plot here, but it’s still delightful to watch Greta Gerwig drift through New York and elsewhere as a sort-of-artist in search of inspiration, love and a future. Frances is a dancer who doesn’t dance much and a friend who isn’t always so friendly; you can’t help root for her because of her charm and humor.

2017,What’s the Economic Cost of Brexit? Pineapples Tell a Tale,"SITTINGBOURNE, England — Britain is increasingly grappling with the bewildering economic consequences of its pending departure from the European Union. For one company, Nim’s Fruit Crisps, the impact is measured in the soaring cost of pineapple. Nim’s dries fruits into snacks served up like potato chips, operating out of a former metal shop in this industrial enclave east of London. One of its best-selling varieties uses pineapple from Costa Rica that is shipped in by an Amsterdam-based trading company. The pineapple is priced in euros. Since Britain’s decision to leave the European Union — widely known as Brexit — the British pound has surrendered nearly 14 percent of its value against the euro on fears that trade will be disrupted. Confronting higher prices for pineapple, the company’s founder, Nimisha Raja, recently brought in a machine to replace three workers who used to peel fruit by hand. “I had to cut costs somewhere,” she said. She could be speaking for all of Britain. In the 16 months since the referendum that set Brexit in motion, the British economy has weakened in the face of a confounding array of uncertainties. Thrift is the order of the day, along with worries about multinational companies’ paring their investments in Britain. Last week, the picture appeared to brighten, as official data showed the economy had expanded a tad more than expected between July and September. The growth of 0.4 percent for the quarter, which bested expectations of 0.3 percent, reinforced the market’s assumptions that the Bank of England will lift rates when it convenes on Thursday, using a presumably stronger economy as the impetus. But some economists fear such a move is premature given Britain’s fragile state. Many focused on plunging retail and car sales as a harbinger of trouble. The drop in the pound has lifted prices on goods ranging from Italian olive oil to Chinese-made electronics. The rate of inflation reached 3 percent in September, the fastest pace in five years. Consumer spending has dipped over the past year while consumer credit is rising — a combination that often ends badly. The Brexit referendum prompted negotiations through which Britain and a jilted Europe are supposed to hash out their future dealings. But the talks have proved acrimonious and largely futile. This has heightened concerns that a two-year deadline on negotiations could pass without a deal, subjecting companies that trade across the English Channel with unsettling ambiguities about future rules. The Bank of England has been warning banks to prepare for that very eventuality as one possible outcome. With the boundaries of commerce unclear, some companies are reassessing the appeal of centering operations in Britain, the former seat of a global empire that increasingly looks like an island nation. “Clearly, growth has slowed quite sharply over the last several months,” said Peter Dixon, a global financial economist at Commerzbank AG in London. “There is a sense that companies have been postponing investment.” Britain now stands as one of the world’s weakest major economies, even as Europe, Asia and North America enjoy relatively robust growth. Over the first nine months of the year, the British economy expanded at an annualized rate of only 1.3 percent. Absent a deal, global banks are confronting the prospect that they could no longer use their London office to serve customers across the Continent. Many have been scouting spaces in financial centers that are firmly within European Union territory. Citigroup has outlined plans to set up a trading operation in Frankfurt, while applying for a backup license in France. Goldman Sachs recently leased expanded office space in Frankfurt. In the West Midlands, an industrial reach of England that includes Birmingham, foreign direct investment dipped slightly in the year after the Brexit vote, according a recent assessment from the Greater Birmingham Chambers of Commerce. The chamber pinned the blame on “uncertainty caused by the outcome of the E.U. referendum,” which was “delaying investment decisions, a trend echoed in other areas of the U.K.” Chamber representatives have been turning their attention beyond the European Union in pursuit of fresh investment. A delegation recently returned from Turkey. In planning future visits, the chamber is especially focused on cultivating business with members of the British Commonwealth. “It’s a rewinding of history, overtly looking for trade with Commonwealth countries, rather than with Europe,” said John Lamb, a chamber spokesman. “We really are starting to look at markets in the post-Brexit world.” At the KimberMills International factory in the Black Country west of Birmingham, workers use tongs to pluck glowing orange blocks of steel from a caldron-like furnace, then pound the metal into desired shapes using a three-and-a-half-ton hammer hoisted by a pulley. Other workers guide lathes and drills to yield an assortment of industrial parts — rockers for marine engines, clamps for oil pipelines, components for gearboxes of construction machinery. The plunge in the pound has raised the price of steel the company imports from Sweden, the Czech Republic and Italy. The company has raised its prices to adjust. KimberMills taps a forge in Eastern Europe to produce large parts that are beyond its works in England. If Britain fails to strike a trade deal with Europe, these parts could face tariffs. The company has already begun seeking out alternative suppliers in Britain. “Despite everything that happens, there’s a resilience to the British market,” said Larry Joyce, the company chairman. “We just get on with it.” But on a recent afternoon at the Great Western pub, a cozy, beer-scented den in Wolverhampton, people worried that such sentiments were being overwhelmed by the economic realities of Brexit. The pub has been doing a brisk business, owing to the success of the local soccer team, the Wolverhampton Wanderers, whose stadium is within walking distance. But customers were nursing woes. “Brexit is a disaster,” said Richard Lloyd, 48, the proprietor of a local construction company, as he hoisted a pint of Guinness. “It’s thrown a lot of people into uncertainty. Companies are certainly delaying investment. They are being very cautious.” Two years ago, Mr. Lloyd employed as many as 20 people. These days, he has only four. “If things were going really swimmingly, I’d hire more,” he said. A local taxi driver, B. Maan, recalled how he used to take home 200 pounds, or about $266, in the course of a Saturday night, ferrying revelers to pubs. These days, he is fortunate to secure 120 pounds. “People are spending less,” he said. Time itself has become a threat. As negotiations yield headlines about sniping within Britain’s governing Conservative party, each week that passes absent clarity amplifies pressure on companies to shift people and operations to Europe. “We can’t see how investment particularly, but also consumption, will not be affected,” said Kjersti Haugland, chief economist at DNB Markets, an investment bank in Norway. “How can you go ahead with big investments when you don’t know what framework will result?” For Nim’s Fruit Crisps, the variables of Brexit have advanced British self-sufficiency. Previously reliant on a supplier in Belgium for most of its fruits and vegetables, the company has in recent months found domestic suppliers for every needed variety except pineapple, limiting its exposure to the vagaries of exchange rates. Today, Nim’s buys apples, parsnips, cucumbers and a range of other crops from British farmers. The fall in the pound has also made Nim’s products cheaper outside Britain, bolstering its exports, which now make up more than half of total sales. Nim’s snacks are sold in Germany, France, Italy, India, Israel and — soon — Saudi Arabia. “What I’ve learned is that Europe isn’t the only market for us,” said Ms. Raja, whose Nim’s business card identifies her as TheBoss. Yet as she seeks to complete a deal putting her crisps on the shelves of a major British supermarket chain, Ms. Raja worries that the needed volumes will exceed the capacities of Britain. “I suddenly have to find 100 tons of apples,” she said. She is scoping out farms in Poland, even as she worries about the value of British money in a world shaped by Brexit. “I have to keep my margins tight,” she said. An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified a town in England, and an earlier correction misstated which company operated there. The town is Cradley Heath, not Sittingbourne, and the plant there is operated by KimberMills International, not Nim’s Fruit Crisps.",The New York Times
2017,"Wheels Drive Auto Industry Forward, in Showrooms and Aftermarket Shops","Wheels The inventor of the wheel is long lost to time, but Craig Donnelly sends his thanks anyway. Mr. Donnelly, who runs the American operation for the German wheel maker BBS, is driven by wheels: cast alloy, magnesium, forged aluminum, painted silver or black or titanium, large enough to fill a wheel well on a Ford truck or dainty enough to fit a decades-old MG sports car. BBS is one of several companies that cover both sides of the automotive wheel world: making flashy stock wheels built specifically for carmakers, as well as aftermarket replacements for car owners who are seeking better performance or more personality. And the buyers are not necessarily the hot-rodders and street racers you would expect. “Over all, wheel design and colors options and styling is more in line with where the market is nowadays,” Mr. Donnelly said. For many drivers, the spinning metal on our cars is a nonissue, usually worthy of attention only if it bends, or cracks, or breaks. Tires require more attention, with pressure warning lights and all the hazards that may illuminate them. Considering the abuses they suffer, tires are generally reliable on-the-road companions. But they are usually a sooty black, and often aren’t much to look at. But wheels, even in that same hue, are jewelry for your car. “Black wheels, very popular,” said Matt Edmonds, executive vice president of the Tire Rack, one of the nation’s largest aftermarket wheel retailers. “Five-spoke wheels are resurrected. Mesh wheels. In the S.U.V. market, people want an off-road racing look, with fake assembly bolts. It’s like any fashion industry.” The Tire Rack has seen the benefits — its sales of aftermarket wheels have increased 25 percent since 2009, Mr. Edmonds said. “The market mix has also changed in the past five years,” he said. Demand for aftermarket car wheels is down, but sales of truck and sport-utility wheels are up 30 percent, he said. At 72, John Nordquist, a real estate manager in Chicago, is always going for the right look. With five cars and trucks in his family, including a 1978 Chevrolet Corvette and a 1995 Chevy pickup, he buys wheels the way that some people buy sneakers. Mr. Nordquist has 20 wheels on the road, plus spares, and at least another set of wheels and tires for each vehicle, usually going up in size for the replacements. “When you’re over 70, it’s O.K. to look cool,” he said. “I want my cars to look just a little different than the run of the mill.” Wheel aficionados — from classic car enthusiasts and dedicated racers to off-roaders — can choose from a dizzying array of looks and brands. And they don’t necessarily have to leave the showroom to do it. Most original equipment manufacturers, or O.E.M.s, offer customers upgraded wheel choices — larger rims, different colors, sexier designs — when they order the car. “More often than not, buyers ask about the wheels on a new car,” said Peter Fearon, a sales consultant at Helms Brothers Mercedes-Benz in Queens. Ordering upgraded wheels has broad appeal. “While men are interested in doing that, many women are as well,” Mr. Fearon said. A 2018 C Class sedan, for example, can be ordered with one of six optional wheel sets, ranging in size from 17 inches to 19 inches. They can be a visible indicator of premium status when a new car rolls off the lot. “Wheels are a key differentiator for AMG and play a major role in the purchase decisions of our customers,” said Melina Evangelisti, a spokeswoman for Mercedes-Benz’s AMG performance division. AMG’s in-house engineers, like those at many carmakers, design the wheels for its vehicles and buy them from suppliers like OZ, Borbet and Enkei. Aluminum alloys have replaced steel as the material of choice, making wheels lighter and reducing a vehicle’s unsprung weight — the mass of its suspension components. Less unsprung weight, particularly in the wheels, is better: A heavier wheel is harder to get going and harder to stop once it is. “That impacts the efficiency as well as the performance of the car,” Mr. Edmonds said. Dropping weight at the corners is crucial for racecars, and the quest to shave seconds off lap times has led engineers to use new materials, like forged magnesium and carbon fiber, which uses lightweight carbon fabric and special plastic resins to make feather-light wheels. Ford has developed carbon fiber wheels for its GT, and Porsche this summer introduced a set for its 911 Turbo S Exclusive Series that it claims are 20 percent stronger and lighter than normal forged alloys. The price in Europe for a set of four? Just under $18,000. Mr. Donnelly may love wheels, but he’s not sold on carbon fiber, yet. “Magnesium is proven for racing, for O.E.M. and the aftermarket, but carbon fiber doesn’t have enough history yet in the marketplace,” he said. “That will change rapidly. Resins will get better — they have a heat issue now — and the weave of the material will advance. And the price points will come down.” Buyers have reason to be cautious. While federal and state safety standards can be exhaustive for cars and S.U.V.s, there are none that are enforced in the United States for wheels, Mr. Donnelly said. “Germany and Japan have government regulations that require aftermarket wheels to meet certain quality standards and fit a vehicle correctly,” he said. That can make picking replacement wheels a tricky affair. “You have to start with the vehicle,” said Mr. Edmonds, the Tire Rack executive. “By doing that, you know what some of the technical specs have to be — not just the diameter and width, but also the bolt pattern, the offset, the load-carrying capacity of that wheel.” And then there are practical considerations. “If you’re going to run those wheels in the winter, they need a finish that’s durable and will handle the salt and the chemicals on the road,” he said. “And the wheel needs to clear everything that’s behind it, like the brakes and the suspension components.” The Tire Rack uses digital scanning equipment to create a three-dimensional model of the wheels it sells as well as the pieces behind them on specific vehicles. “We can virtually fit the wheel on the car and ensure it will clear everything,” Mr. Edmonds said. For drivers who consider their car little more than an appliance, any rim will do. But for some, a wheel purchase is simply an exercise in expression. “You have the people who want the vehicle to reflect themselves,” said Rebecca Lindland, executive analyst at Kelley Blue Book. “We women notice jewelry, earrings. Wheels make a car that much more emotionally appealing.”",The New York Times
2017,"When Astros Needed to Improvise, Charlie Morton Was Ready","On Baseball LOS ANGELES — The closer he got to his dreams, the more they seemed to slip from Charlie Morton. He defied the odds simply by making the majors, something nobody else from Joel Barlow High School in Redding, Conn., had ever done. But for years his career sputtered, and mostly, Morton said, he felt like he was letting people down. His pitching coach with the Houston Astros, Brent Strom, said Morton had a pessimistic streak and needed to build his confidence. He may as well have been Charlie Brown, since he didn’t seem too happy being Charlie Morton — or, maybe, he was simply a realist in a game built on failure. “For some people, it’s like you’re down in the cul-de-sac with the basketball hoop, you’re in the countdown, and you’re dreaming of winning the N.B.A. championship,” Morton said. “Or you’re in the backyard and you pretend you’re Ted Williams. I’m sure I did that as a kid. “But then reality sets in when you become a professional. In a way, I think you start to lose that part of your childhood dreams of being part of a great moment. Honestly, I really just wanted to contribute — to help, you know? I wanted to finish the last few years of my career and be proud of it and feel like I did a good job.” Morton, who turns 34 this month, spoke in a quiet corner of the Houston Astros’ raucous clubhouse at Dodger Stadium late Wednesday night after Game 7 of the World Series. He had done such a good job that Jeff Idelson, the president of the Baseball Hall of Fame, had just taken his cap as a donation. Morton worked the last four innings of the Astros’ 5-1 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers, clinching the first championship in the 56 seasons of the franchise. A year after Mike Montgomery earned his first career save to seal a title for the Chicago Cubs, Morton closed out this Game 7 with a victory in his first relief appearance in nine years. His last pitch was a 96-mile-an-hour fastball to Corey Seager, who grounded to second baseman Jose Altuve for the final out. Catcher Brian McCann, who caught Morton’s debut for the Atlanta Braves in 2008, jumped into his arms to celebrate. “He’s always had the stuff, and he learned how to home it in and pitch in the zone,” McCann said later. “He learned how to throw strikes, he learned how to elevate — he learned how to pitch. When we met at 18 years old, he always threw 95, 96; he always had the curveball. He just refined everything, his mechanics, he could repeat them. What an incredible performance.” For the Astros and their manager, A. J. Hinch, it was a final bit of improvisation in a breathless postseason in which their closer, Ken Giles, was 0-2 with two saves, one blown save and an 11.74 earned run average. Giles made seven appearances, just one of them scoreless, and knew he was slumping at the worst time. “I’m way better than the way I’m pitching right now,” Giles said after Game 2 at Dodger Stadium, when he blew a lead in the 10th inning of an eventual 7-6 victory. “I’m not pitching to my expectations and I’m beating myself up about it.” The cracks had started showing in the American League Championship Series at Yankee Stadium when Giles — who had 34 saves in 38 chances in the regular season — lost a two-run lead in Game 4. He never pitched after the fourth game of the World Series, when the Dodgers battered him for three runs in the ninth inning to break open a tie game. By then, Hinch had already shown a willingness to find other pitchers for crucial spots, eschewing the crutch that managers often depend on. Stubbornly hoping for the summer version of a reliever now fading in the fall had contributed to other teams’ World Series downfalls — notably the Boston Red Sox in 1986 and the Philadelphia Phillies in 1993. Hinch refused to bury the Astros in that same graveyard. At three critical points in this postseason, he liked what he saw from a pitcher already in the game and let him finish it. “You’ve got to go with the hot hand, and it worked,” said the Astros’ owner, Jim Crane, an old college pitcher. “And it worked more than once.” In Game 7 of the A.L.C.S., Hinch used starter Lance McCullers Jr. to relieve Morton for the final four innings. That decision clinched the pennant for Houston. In Game 3 of the World Series, starter Brad Peacock relieved McCullers with one out in the sixth, Hinch stuck with him the rest of the way, too. And when McCullers could not survive the third inning of his start on Wednesday night, Hinch used three relievers to get the game to Morton for the bottom of the sixth. Two former Cy Young Award winners, Dallas Keuchel and Justin Verlander, got loose for the Astros in the bullpen. But Morton was stifling the Dodgers, and Hinch did not stop him. “I was comfortable with him closing the game around three innings, but he did it with four,” Hinch said, adding that he knew he had reinforcements if needed. “As much as I scripted this game, it never plays out the way you expect.” The Astros did not expect Giles to falter in October, but they protected themselves by engineering their staff to be fresh through the postseason. Not a single pitcher on the team worked 162 innings — the minimum to be considered for the E.R.A. title — as an Astro this season. Mike Fiers led the team in innings, with 153⅓, and he was left off the postseason roster. Of course, the Astros did trade for the prototypical leading man: Verlander, who worked 206 innings between playing for Detroit and Houston and fired a complete game in the A.L.C.S. But McCullers, Peacock and Morton each made at least 22 starts in the regular season while pitching between 115 and 150 innings — enough of a workload to be available for multiple innings in October, but not so much to be exhausted by the World Series. “I have to give props to our medical team,” General Manager Jeff Luhnow said. “They kept our guys healthy and playing. At this point in the season, the difference between medical teams could win the World Series. Our doctors, our trainers, our strength guys, they kept these guys out there.” In the end, there was Morton, sturdy and strong, defying his history as a pitcher perhaps best known for injuries. He had left hip surgery in 2010, Tommy John surgery in 2012 and right hip surgery in 2014. In 10 seasons, he has never reached 30 starts or 175 innings. Last year was especially grim. Traded to Philadelphia after seven seasons with the Pittsburgh Pirates, Morton tore his left hamstring running to first base in April. He spent the next several months making lonely morning drives from his home in Bradenton, Fla., to the Phillies’ complex in Clearwater, recovering from an injury he knew had ended his season. “It’s not a good feeling, because you’re watching your team on TV and you’re a thousand miles away and you can’t do anything,” Morton said. “But you start to appreciate it, because it becomes your responsibility as a professional. It’s not glorious; nobody knows what’s really going on except the guys you’re working with. But it’s my job. It’s my job to approach each situation professionally, and I tried to do that.” The Astros saw enough in Morton’s statistical profile to sign him to a two-year, $14 million contract last November. They believed in his curveball, which Morton threw more than ever this season, and thought that mechanical changes could help his fastball. They were right. Morton was 14-7 with a 3.62 E.R.A. in the regular season, with a career-best 10 strikeouts per nine innings. Then he became the first pitcher in baseball history to win two Game 7s in the same postseason. “I’m still not a 200-inning guy,” Morton said. “But I’m part of something special.” He thought some more and turned philosophical while teammates smoked cigars and flung beer around the locker room. “You just don’t know,” Morton said. “You could bunt a ball, be running down to first base and your season could be over. Or you could be here, and be fortunate to be part of this. That’s how I look at it, because I’ve been everything: I’ve been the guy you couldn’t count on, I’ve been the guy that gets hurt all the time, and I’ve been a guy you can rely on in a crucial situation.” There is no more crucial situation than the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 7 of the World Series, trying to bring your team its first championship ever. Morton delivered. He stopped dreaming, but the dream never gave up on him.",The New York Times
2017,Opinion | When Calling 911 Makes You a ‘Nuisance’ and Gets You Evicted,"Op-Ed Contributors Last January, a woman in Lakewood, Ohio, ran to her neighbor’s house, bleeding from her face with a broken nose and concussion from a vicious attack by her boyfriend. With her neighbor’s help, she called the police, who took her to the hospital. Three days later, the city wrote the woman’s landlord: “Your tenant had a visitor over to the residence where he assaulted her. He was charged with felonious assault. This activity qualifies the property as a nuisance.” A few months earlier, another Lakewood resident called a suicide hotline and threatened to kill himself. The crisis center alerted local police, who then sent a letter to the man’s landlord. “This activity qualifies the property as a nuisance,” a city lawyer warned, also noting that the man had been attacked by a stranger a few months earlier and had an unrelated argument with a friend. “You can avoid being charged the costs of abatement by taking documented steps to prevent any further nuisance activity.” Within weeks, the property owner evicted the “nuisance” tenant. In both cases, tenants placed calls that may have saved their lives. But under local laws known as criminal activity nuisance ordinances, these calls also placed them at risk of losing their homes. Thousands of cities nationwide declare properties a “nuisance” if police or emergency services respond to an address too frequently, which typically means more than once within a year. Property owners face fines of hundreds or thousands of dollars, or even misdemeanor criminal charges, if they do not address the nuisance, which often means evicting the people who live there. A study of Milwaukee landlords found that eviction of tenants was the most common response to nuisance letters. Proponents argue these laws create safer communities by giving cities tools to get rid of burdensome residents without the proof or process necessary to convict someone of a crime. Working with colleagues at Cleveland State University and the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio to collect and analyze thousands of pages of nuisance-related public records, we discovered a disturbing trend in the enforcement of these laws: Nuisance designations are regularly given to properties occupied by survivors of domestic violence, people experiencing mental health crises and residents seeking medical assistance to prevent a fatal drug overdose. Even nonprofit organizations serving people with disabilities face nuisance fines when the people they serve require medical attention. Eviction is the most common outcome for renters living in properties designated as “nuisance.” Eviction — which would represent a crisis for anyone — exacerbates the underlying trauma that led to the emergency call in the first place. Domestic violence is already a leading cause of homelessness for women, and nuisance laws codify this relationship into public policy. For people with mental health or substance abuse disorders, losing housing increases the risk of relapse or suicide. Nuisance laws don’t solve the underlying issues. They make things worse. Nuisance laws can force an impossible decision between risking one’s home or one’s life. Rather than face potential fines, eviction or other penalties, residents may avoid reaching out to police for help in times of crisis. This can carry grave consequences. For example, in 2012, police informed a Pennsylvania woman who had been repeatedly attacked by an ex-boyfriend that she had used up her “strikes” and future police calls would be punishable under the city’s nuisance ordinance. The ex-boyfriend, aware that the woman would face additional penalties for future 911 calls, became more aggressive and taunted her to make the call for help. The abuse escalated until she was nearly killed in an attack that required an airlift to the hospital. Faced with fines of $1,000 a day and the revocation of his rental license until the “nuisance” tenant left the property, the landlord felt forced to begin eviction proceedings. Although the court said she could stay in her home, the city continued to pressure the landlord to remove her, even threatening to bring its own eviction case. Recent lawsuits by the A.C.L.U. and others argue that nuisance laws run afoul of the Fair Housing Act and the Constitution. Some cities have repealed their laws following these suits, but others have refused, and the litigation remains ongoing. Legalities aside, our analysis of real-life cases shows that nuisance laws harm people by further stigmatizing mental health and addiction and discouraging those who need care from seeking and accessing available resources. Yet year after year, cities continue to adopt criminal activity nuisance laws as they look for solutions to address resident perceptions about safety. Unfortunately, with this shortcut, they’re unintentionally making their neighborhoods less safe by discouraging people from seeking assistance when they need it. Issues like domestic violence, mental health and drug addiction lack easy answers, but telling landlords to exile people in crisis — whose emergency calls may save their lives — is cruel, counterproductive and could even be illegal. Cities should look for real solutions to their residents’ traumas, instead of treating them as nuisances when they need help.",The New York Times
2017,When Children Bear Witness to Terror,"Big City Shortly after 3 o’clock on Tuesday afternoon, Carolyn Montgomery-Forant, a singer and pianist who was preparing for a rehearsal in her Midtown apartment, received a text message from her 13-year-old son, Eli, an eighth grader at Hudson River Middle School. It said that he had just witnessed a car accident and that he was watching a man emerging from a vehicle with two guns. A second text was not immediately forthcoming. Running out of the house without locking the door, Ms. Montgomery-Forant headed toward the C train stop on Eighth Avenue and 50th Street to get downtown. On the way, she received another note from her son explaining that the school was now in lockdown. Was there an active shooter in the building? There was no way to know. What followed was a text stream with three other parents, “all of us feeling helpless,” she said, which flowed for the next several hours. Hudson River Middle is a small progressive public school on Warren Street at the corner of West Street, one short block south of where Sayfullo Saipov crashed his rental truck into a school bus on Halloween, after plowing the truck down a crowded bike path along the river, killing eight people and injuring a dozen, including two students on the bus. The building also houses a second school — P.S. 89, the Liberty School — which serves children from prekindergarten through fifth grade, who were being let out on Tuesday afternoon while the attack was unfolding. Children and parents and caregivers already outside, in an enclosed yard, were brought in and sequestered for safety in a windowless cafeteria where teachers foraged for snacks. The middle-school students were sent to a gym on the third floor. Although the school year is relatively new, the younger children had already participated in lockdown drills. They were told that this one was real, that they were being kept safe inside from something unsafe happening outside. In morning meeting the following day, Connie Ryan, a prekindergarten teacher told her students what a great job the police had done in protecting everyone. During play, she said, a lot of children sent Lego Duplo people to jail. One block north, across the street at Stuyvesant High School, there are two phases of dismissal, one at 2:45 and another at 3:30. Some students who left in the first round on Tuesday were crossing a popular footbridge connecting the campus to TriBeCa when the chaos erupted, giving them a full view of the carnage. When it was clear to administrators that something terrible was happening, an announcement was made over the loud speaker that the school was implementing a “shelter in,” a modified lockdown that forbids students from leaving the school but allows them to move within the building. Many congregated in the student union, where, Matt Polazzo, a teacher of Western political thought and government, told me, “If you leaned over and looked out you could see two dead bodies on the ground.” Some of the students on the bridge shot video of what was going on with their phones and posted it on Snapchat, allowing the students inside to see harrowing images if they chose to look at them. The cellphone policy at Stuyvesant is draconian; on this day it was eased, and technology showed itself, again, as both danger and salvation. Despite the matter of the dark renderings that proliferated on social media, students were able to keep in touch with their families. “Everyone was scared but I was really proud of the community,” Mr. Polazzo said. “We all complain about cellphones, but during times of emergency they are obviously indispensable.” Nearly all of the children at Stuyvesant were too young to remember Sept. 11, or, like the students at the neighboring schools, were born later. Many or most in the three schools affected do not come from parts of the city where violence is commonplace and gun crime, in particular, is both all too visible and audible. It is perhaps a testament to strict gun laws in New York and surrounding states that the attacker was carrying pellet and paintball guns rather than semiautomatics, but the students had no idea at the time whether the weaponry was real. As it turned out, the week was a tortured one for children across the downtown school community, a period likely to imprint itself unsettlingly. Among the dead on Tuesday was Nicholas Cleves, a 2012 graduate of the Little Red and Elizabeth Irwin schools in Greenwich Village, where he had been working in information technology. The day after the attack, Elizabeth Lee, an assistant at the Grace Church School and a longtime parent there, was shot and killed near the front of the Cooper Square campus, allegedly by a man against whom she had an order of protection. In a letter to the Grace community, headmaster George P. Davison said that there were students in front of the high school when the incident occurred and that they might have seen the tragedy play out. On Tuesday afternoon, for a punishingly long time it was next to impossible for many parents to make their way to their children’s schools around West Street. Ms. Montgomery-Forant had a lifeline in a friend who had arrived at her son’s school early to pick up a younger child. That friend wound up taking 13 children home. Many of the classmates ended up sitting together, holding hands and eating pizza. When her son came home, Ms. Montgomery-Forant drew him a bath and made him a pot of peppermint tea. He went to sleep fitfully, next to her.",The New York Times
2017,When Climbing a Greased Flagpole Was Patriotic,"F.Y.I. Q. I heard that there was a holiday in which New Yorkers would climb greased flagpoles every Nov. 25. How did the tradition start, and why did it disappear? A. It was called Evacuation Day, and it marks the date in 1783 when British troops finally left — evacuated, in the language of the day — the island of Manhattan, two months after the end of the Revolution. That morning, George Washington and his troops marched triumphantly south from Harlem to reclaim the Battery, where they would replace the impeccably dressed redcoats with their own ragtag crew of citizen soldiers. When they finally reached Fort George, at the tip of Manhattan, they discovered the British had committed one last act of defiance: they had nailed the Union Jack atop the flagpole, which they had afterward stripped and greased, preventing an easy removal. Sure, the Americans could have cut the pole down — but then, where would they fly their own flag? An enterprising sailor named John Jacob van Arsdale had a solution. After failing three times to climb the traditional way, he had others run to an ironmonger (the 18th-century version of a hardware store) to get supplies. With his pockets filled with nails and the rope for a new halyard over his shoulder, he made his way slowly up the pole, hammering in footholds as he ascended. According to legend, The Star-Spangled Banner was aloft before the British were out of sight, meaning they had seen the failure of their ploy — and the end of their presence in America. A hat was passed for the benefit of van Arsdale, with even Washington contributing, before most retired to Fraunces Tavern and other places to celebrate. More than anywhere else in the young country, New York had suffered greatly at the hands of the British. General Washington miraculously evaded capture after the 1776 Battle of Brooklyn, the largest battle of the entire war. Two fires during the seven-year occupation destroyed much of the city. And in the filthy holds of prison ships in the East River, at least 11,000 Americans died — far more than were killed in all of the war’s battles combined. As such, for New Yorkers, Evacuation Day was a bigger holiday than even the Fourth of July. It marked a sort of rebirth, a freedom from the hands of an oppressive king, not to mention his military representatives. Until the early 20th century, New Yorkers would celebrate Nov. 25 with a large parade ending at the Battery, where a descendant of van Arsdale’s would replicate the slippery feat. Apparently, children would try their hands at it, too. Although the tradition was already well on the wane, the biggest Evacuation Day celebration was the centennial, in 1883. President Chester A. Arthur unveiled the statue of General Washington at Federal Hall on Wall Street, on the spot where he had been inaugurated in 1789. Despite heavy rain, more than 200,000 took part in the festivities. It was that poor late-November weather — not to mention the growing popularity of Thanksgiving — that hastened Evacuation Day’s decline. (Why march in the cold when you can feast indoors?) The last official parade was in 1916. The United States entered World War I the following year. At that point, there was little appetite, understandably, for celebrating British defeat.",The New York Times

DEMOCRACY AND ITS CRISIS By A. C. Grayling 225 pp. Oneworld. $22.99. A. C. Grayling, a British philosopher and critic whose subjects range from 17th-century epistemology to 20th-century war crimes, has come to tell us what he knows: that at one time we admired and understood representative democracy, and not without reason, but that in the era of Donald Trump and Brexit, democracy has been “made to fail.” Why has this happened? Because of insufficient checks on the power of political and economic elites, a failure in the civic education required of an informed populace and the ideological distortions created through the lobbying efforts of special interests. Representative democracy ticks more of the boxes citizens want from their government than any other system we’ve tried to design. But when we forget this, rancorous populism and plebiscitary politics take hold, and we need to be given an old-fashioned history lesson to warn of the dangers ahead. As Grayling reminds us, democracy, understood as the rule of the majority, has never been sufficient in itself. Plato, Aristotle and Machiavelli all knew that more was needed, whether that meant enshrining constitutional rules to avoid the arbitrary exercise of power, imposing standards of behavior on elected officials or supporting a healthy ambivalence toward rulers by the ruled. From these classical debates, increasingly complex defenses of representative democracy emerged in England, America and France. Leading thinkers in the age of revolutions tried to reconcile the need for modern republics of great size and diversity with the idea of popular sovereignty — without succumbing to traditional sources of division and faction, most notably brought about by inequalities of property and wealth. What these representative structures never resolved was the question of how much economic inequality was necessary to make the system work and how much might flip it into oligarchy, threatening its very foundations. All this was standard fare for classical political economists, but 19th-century writers like John Stuart Mill, Alexis de Tocqueville and Benjamin Constant had other worries, focusing on the extent to which individual liberty in a democracy might be threatened by popular ignorance, sectional interests and ineffective constitutional norms. They chose, that is, to go beyond republican concerns with property and institutional constraints, advising us to be jealous of our liberty and wary of our politicians. But they also insisted that representative democracy would leave us freer to pursue our own interests and prosperity. In taking readers through this history, Grayling wants us to become aware of the possible failings of democracy — institutional dysfunction, citizens unequipped for practical judgment, the distortions of corporate power. What is to be done? He advocates civics classes in schools, the enactment of proportional representation, compulsory voting from the age of 16 and taking back control over egregious institutional dysfunctions (unfettered party funding, for example, and targeted political messaging). Most important, he urges us to remember that referendums should have nothing to do with representative democracy. In particular, he lambastes “in-out” votes like Brexit. The difficulty with Grayling’s history lessons and suggested reforms is that considerably more structural surgery may be needed if we are to safeguard the health and longevity of representative democracy, and that’s much harder to design. Governments seem increasingly incapable of determining where their systems are broken and agreeing on how they might be repaired. Meanwhile, public discourse becomes infused with moralized language, fixated on terms like “dignity,” “equality” and “respect” that float free of these structural problems. In one way, though, Grayling is right. The thought that plutocrats and oligarchs can fix what needs mending, or do anything much about the economic inequalities that have always threatened political stability, is difficult to countenance. In fact, it seems inconceivable. OpinionSteven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt",The New York Times
2017,When Designing Luxury Cars Is Like Making Jewelry. And Friends.,"Vocations Earl Lucas, 47, is the chief exterior designer at the Lincoln Motor Company, in Dearborn, Mich. Q. What is your day-to-day like? It’s different every day. I interface with multiple disciplines, whether it be packaging, engineering, marketing or public relations. Some days I am at my computer designing digitally. Then I might be in our studio seeing that image converted to a clay model, and later as a fiberglass version of it. Another day I go to our wind tunnel, where we test aerodynamics to make sure we have the right drag count to get the best fuel economy for our product. A. Did you always want to be an automobile designer? I always knew I wanted to do something with design. I studied industrial design focusing on jewelry — rings, pendants and earrings — for two years at the College of Creative Studies in Detroit. The college also happened to have an outstanding automobile design curriculum. After taking one class in that program, I was hooked. It turns out the principles of designing a ring are the same as designing a car. What or who were your early design influences? I would have to start with my mother, Vessie Lucas, who is an interior decorator. She taught me to think abstractly — of what could be — at an early age. I read a lot of comics, like “The Mighty Thor” and “Spiderman.” I also watched cartoons such as “Speed Racer,” “Battle of the Planets” and “Star Blazers.” In terms of cars, I loved my grandfather’s 1984 Continental Mark VII, with two tones of blue paint and an impeccable white interior. After he died, I got to drive it on Sundays to church. What considerations influence your design concepts? I try to reflect the personality of the brand. In the case of Lincoln, our cars embody effortless luxury. We think of our car as a friend. We convey that through form, shape, color and texture. The most influential design element may be the front grille. It has to stand out but be in proportion with everything else. The centerpiece is our logo — called the Lincoln Star — which was developed in the 1950s. I have managed to tweak it a little. What do you envision for auto design in the future? Autonomous cars — driverless automobiles — are the future and we are already developing technologies to accommodate for this shift, which we predict could be in effect by 2030. As highways and streets will be modified, cars will also have different shapes and silhouettes; they may look more like living rooms. We’ll need to anticipate caravans, where cars will link up to each other to save energy. Will that be the death knell for humans actually driving their own cars? While there’s something to be said for autonomous cars, I believe people will still want to drive. They want to be in control. They want to enjoy just taking a drive without knowing where they are going and being able to decide en route. It comes down to a bigger question: Do humans want to be part of a collective or be an individual? It’s a matter of how much freedom we want.",The New York Times
2017,When Dinosaurs Roam in Chrome,"Tech Tip Q. My network router often flakes out and I get the “There is no internet connection” error screen in Google Chrome. I was staring at the error screen the other day, and it looked like the little dinosaur winked at me. Is that for real or a bug? A. The error page you see when Google Chrome cannot get to the internet does indeed feature a small graphic of a Tyrannosaurus rex that occasionally blinks. However, with a little help from you, the little dinosaur can do much more in your browser window. For the past several years, the dinosaur has been part of a game hidden inside Google Chrome, perhaps as a gift from a programmer sympathizing with the lack of internet access. To activate the game when you get the connection-error message, press the space bar. The dinosaur then takes off across the screen in the style of one of those old-fashioned eight-bit “endless runner” games. As the T. rex gallops along, press the Up arrow key to jump over cactuses and other obstacles. A special blip sounds as you pile up each set of 100 points. After 500 points, pterodactyls enter the game, and you must press the Down arrow key to avoid them. If the dinosaur wipes out, click the replay button on the Game Over screen to make another run. If you like runner games, you do not have to wait for Google Chrome to go offline to play. Variations of the T. rex runner game can be found online or as an app. You can also manually switch to the game, even if your internet connection is working perfectly fine. Just enter “chrome://network-error/-106” in the address bar (without the quotation marks), press the Enter key and tap the space bar to get those little dino legs moving.",The New York Times
2017,"When He Needs Advice, a Philadelphia Flyer Turns to His Brother the Dancer","For the first time in his young N.H.L. career, Taylor Leier made the Philadelphia Flyers’ opening-night roster. His parents, Tim and Cindy, shared in his triumph by making the trip from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, to watch him play early-season games in Anaheim and Los Angeles last month. Leier’s brother, Keaton, could not make the trip to Southern California. He was instead enjoying a career milestone of his own. A first-year company dancer with the Atlanta Ballet, Keaton Leier, 21, had already been training 10 hours a day, five days a week, for more than a month by the time his older brother reported to the Flyers’ training camp in September. Keaton’s training regimen impresses his hockey-playing brother, who was selected by Philadelphia in the fourth round of the 2012 draft. “You should see him: He can do the splits up the wall,” Taylor Leier, 23, said. “That’s how strong he is in his lower body.” After he performed with the second company at the Houston Ballet last year, Keaton Leier’s move to Atlanta is a major promotion. The months of training leading up to the company’s first performance in December have not gone unnoticed by Taylor, who is hoping for a breakout season in the N.H.L. “Their schedule is pretty grueling,” said Taylor Leier, who had played 16 N.H.L. games entering this season. “They train very hard and I respect them a lot and how hard they work. They’re going the whole day.” Playing hockey was a natural pursuit for the elder Leier brother growing up in Saskatchewan surrounded by family members involved in the sport. Tim Leier coached Taylor’s youth team while numerous uncles and cousins also played hockey. Keaton Leier’s decision as a child not to pursue hockey was a departure — even before he dedicated himself to ballet. “From a really young age, I always kind of had the mind-set of just doing my own thing even though everybody else was really into hockey,” he said. “My family especially is very hockey heavy. Ever since I was little, especially when I was younger, my dad really encouraged me to play. I liked it, but I never really loved it. I was just influenced by what I wanted.” Taylor’s hockey and Keaton’s dancing made for a hectic home life, an endless effort to deliver the two boys to games, tournaments, practices and recitals. On one particularly hectic day, Cindy Leier said she attended a dance competition with Keaton in Edmonton, Alberta, before having to rush back home to Saskatoon, a drive of more than 300 miles, to attend Taylor’s hockey awards banquet. During the long drive home, she received word that Keaton had received the competition’s top accolade, an honor that included a trip to a Los Angeles dance studio. “Honestly, I look back at our life sometimes and it just feels like a blur,” Cindy Leier said. “It goes by so fast and they were so busy all the time.” Despite their divergent paths, the brothers remained close. When Taylor left home at 17 to play junior hockey with the Portland Winterhawks in Oregon, he was unknowingly establishing a precedent for his brother, who at 17 left home to train at the Royal Winnipeg Ballet School. The parallels between the brothers’ endeavors were quickly appreciated by their mother. “They experience the same emotions: the mental challenge of what they are both doing and also the physical challenge,” she said. “Sometimes with the mental challenge I’ll say to Keaton: ‘Why don’t you call your brother? He’s been through this. Even though he’s doing something completely opposite of what you’re doing, he’ll understand what you’re going through right now.’ That has been helpful for Keaton.” Those conversations proved invaluable for the brothers whenever they encountered inevitable career disappointments, whether it was being assigned to the Flyers’ minor league affiliate or being relegated to the second company at the Houston Ballet. But the benefits of having a brother at the highest level of his chosen field do not end there. The brothers also occasionally work out together, although their areas of concentration in the gym often contrast drastically. When Taylor encounters the occasional tweaks and pulls that come over the course of a lengthy hockey season, it helps to have a brother capable of resting his legs at a 180-degree angle. “I know sometimes he’ll text me and say: ‘My hip is really bothering me. Do you know any stretches or exercises I can use to fix it?’ Usually I can give him some sort of help,” Keaton said. “Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t.” With his parents looking forward to their next opportunity to watch Taylor play for the Flyers, Keaton has been busy earmarking dates to go to Philadelphia and watch his older brother play. But it is not easy. His arduous schedule with the Atlanta Ballet will continue through December, when the company begins performing “The Nutcracker.” Afforded a holiday break by the N.H.L. schedule, Taylor will be there with his parents to watch his brother perform. “We’ve been working and we’ve been grinding,” he said. “Our family has a lot of versatility and our parents get to experience two different professions, which is pretty cool.”",The New York Times
2017,"When Internships Don’t Pay, Some Colleges Will","As the child of a divorced, unemployed mother, Shira Eisenberg learned to get by, she says, “on the kindness of strangers.” But even she was surprised when she arrived at the University of Chicago and was told that if she jumped through a few hoops, like going to seminars on how to behave at a job interview, she would be guaranteed a paid internship, financed by the university if no other source of money was available. “Without the stipend, I would not have been able to afford it,” said Ms. Eisenberg, a sophomore majoring in computer science and minoring in neuroscience. Internships have become a necessary credential in a highly competitive job market — about half of interns are offered a job by a company where they have interned, according to a 2017 survey by the National Association of Colleges and Employers. But for those thinking of careers in nonprofits, public service, social services or the arts, paid opportunities are scarce. Employers often can’t afford a stipend, and many students can’t afford to work for free. In response, campuses are using philanthropy and their own funds to subsidize internships at organizations that have a mission of social change or innovation. Students can pursue their passion without worry about how they will pay for food and housing, and for those who see Goldman Sachs in their future, it’s a chance to do good works. “We don’t want our students to pick a field because it pays and overlook another field because it doesn’t pay for an internship,” said Meredith Daw, executive director of career advancement at the University of Chicago. There are 2,000 placements each year through Chicago’s Jeff Metcalf Internship Program. Employers agree to cover the salary — at least $11 an hour or the local minimum wage, whichever is higher. But when an organization can’t afford to pay — 40 percent can’t — the university provides a $4,000 grant for a 10-week stint. Starting last year, the university’s Odyssey Scholars — low-income students like Ms. Eisenberg — have been guaranteed a paid internship for their first summer. That, Ms. Daw said, is when they are at the greatest disadvantage compared to their peers with more of the social capital — like parental connections — needed to find internships on their own. Last summer, 232 students participated. Ms. Eisenberg interned at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, where she developed a machine learning model for its library. The grant helped defray airfare, her summer sublet and other expenses. Pace University posted more than 4,000 internships last year, about 40 percent of them unpaid, and provides grants for many internships in the nonprofit sector. “We’re not trying to proselytize with these students, but we’d like their eyes to be open to the second and third sectors in our economy,” said Rebecca Tekula, executive director of Pace’s Wilson Center for Social Entrepreneurship. The center pairs students with nonprofits in and around New York City, like Greyston Bakery, Housing Works and the Legal Aid Society. Elizabeth Pooran interned last year at Senior Planet Exploration Center in Chelsea, a community space designed to teach technology, including digital photography and the internet, to older adults to encourage them to lead independent, connected lives. And Latino U College Access, a fledgling nonprofit that works with first-generation college students, has used Pace interns for three of its five years. “I always say that my organization was built with the support and by the hands of Pace University interns,” said Shirley Acevedo Buontempo, the founder. Students in the Wilson internship program receive $16 an hour, or $4,480 for eight weeks. Some 120 students have participated since 2009, with grants totaling about $500,000. Macalester College, too, subsidizes internships involving social missions, like helping integrate tuberculosis services into Georgia’s health system and fighting transgender discrimination. Last year, about 50 interns took part. “This is an opportunity to try on a career no matter what their interest or major or their economic situation is,” said Mindy Deardurff, dean of career development at the St. Paul campus. “Especially for our students who have socioeconomic need, if we can get them in and let them try out some of the things they are so passionate about, it might get them over that hump of worrying about whether they can afford it.” Amherst College distributed $1 million this past summer, 40 percent more than it did the previous year, helping 229 students take unpaid internships with nonprofit organizations and small start-ups. The money came from alumni gifts and $200,000 from the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, which supports low-income college students. Because more than 80 percent of Amherst students go to graduate or professional school, some of the money is used to prepare them by financing research internships, study abroad and independently devised programs, said Emily C. Griffen, director of Amherst’s Loeb Center for Career Exploration and Planning. Michael Loeb, president and chief executive of Loeb Enterprises, is an alumnus who has taken a particular interest in internships. In addition to offering paid stints at his own company, he has just started a program that matches start-ups in New York City with Amherst interns and covers their pay and living expenses. It’s not surprising that alumni favor their alma mater. Over the past five years, alumni and parents have donated $4 million to Colgate University, enabling it to support some 200 students each year who want to take unpaid or low-paid internships, typically with nonprofits, the creative arts or to do research. Last summer, it spent $666,000, said Michael Sciola, associate vice president of institutional advancement and career initiatives. Colgate students can also come up with their own grant proposal, and the university will help them find a host who will turn that into an internship. “We do allow students to do a self-designed summer,” he said. For example, twin brothers received a grant to pay for travel to work on an archaeological expedition in Alaska. Mr. Sciola concedes that the connection between “an immersive experience” and a career might be less obvious than with an internship in the financial industry. That’s why students are more likely to take less career-driven internships in their first and second years, he said, when they are still exploring. “Our overall goal is to empower our students to explore their interests with practical immersive experiences,” he said, “without the limitation of financial barriers.” An earlier version of this article misidentified who spoke about opening student eyes to different economic sectors. It was Rebecca Tekula, executive director of Pace’s Wilson Center for Social Entrepreneurship, not Phyllis Mooney, executive director of career services.",The New York Times
2017,"When It Comes to Contemporary Art, Miami Wants More, More, More","MIAMI — Building a new contemporary art museum in Miami is easy. Just ask Irma Braman, a founder and co-chairwoman of the board of the Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami, which opens in the Design District on Friday. “Norm was having lunch with Craig one day and said, ‘I’d love to have a museum.’ Craig said, ‘I have this piece of land,’” Mrs. Braman recalled. That’s it? “It was that simple,” she said. Of course, if you want to start an art museum in Miami, it helps if the “Norm” in question is Mrs. Braman’s husband, Norman, a Miami auto dealership magnate and fixture on the Forbes 400 list with a net worth estimated at $2.5 billion. And the “Craig”? That is Craig Robins, one of the city’s most prominent real estate developers and, if not yet Forbes-worthy, certainly a future contender. Three years after that fateful lunch, and $75 million in cash and donated land later, the ICA Miami and its gleaming new three-story building are a reality. Lest anyone wonder how this major metropolitan area with the second-highest poverty rate in the nation can afford this artsy largess — especially with still unforeseen costs to address the rising sea and regularly flooded streets — it can’t. Mr. and Mrs. Braman funded ICA Miami’s design and construction themselves. And admission to the museum is free. “Not a dime of taxpayer money was involved in the construction,” Mr. Braman insisted. “We have all kinds of difficulties and problems here, and I’ve always felt public tax dollars should be utilized for the needs of the community first.” More, more, more. Here, hardly a season goes by without the announcement of yet another new art museum or expansion — all fueled by the homegrown excitement and international attention surrounding the Art Basel Miami Beach fair each December, and all primarily focused on Basel-style contemporary art at the expense of virtually every other artistic milieu. Left behind is the math underlying this increasingly crowded landscape: Can Miami afford all of these art museums? A private museum like the ICA Miami must compete for philanthropic funding alongside the city’s public museums, as well as its major university-owned museums, also now mostly showing contemporary art. Are there enough deep-pocketed donors to go around? Just as important, how many contemporary art museums does Miami actually need? “We’re all looking at the same piles of dollars, we’re all looking at the same corporate sponsors,” conceded Silvia Karman Cubiñá, the executive director and chief curator at the Bass Museum of Art. The museum, which reopened in Miami Beach in October after a $12 million expansion, has a rechristened name — just the Bass — to reflect its new mission of exhibiting of-the-moment art. “In 20 years, maybe we’ll all look back and say, we bit off more than we can chew, but we’re all still doing it.” The Bass joins two other public art museums founded and partially funded by a municipality, relying on a mix of tax dollars and private donations for their annual budgets: North Miami’s Museum of Contemporary Art, from which the ICA Miami’s board split in a bitter 2014 divorce, and the Pérez Art Museum Miami, known locally as PAMM. Ostensibly PAMM covers the cultural waterfront, but its director, Franklin Sirmans, told the Brooklyn Rail in June, “We are, ultimately, a museum dedicated to international contemporary art.” Not to be forgotten are Miami’s four collector-run private museums, each focused on their owner’s contemporary acquisitions rather than underwriting other art institutions: the Cisneros Fontanals Art Foundation, the de la Cruz Collection, the Margulies Collection at the Warehouse and the Rubell Family Collection. (A fifth is in the works, courtesy of Bruce Berkowitz, the hedge fund owner and devotee of James Turrell.) Each contains works that rival the permanent collections of any of Miami’s public museums. Yet a stray Andy Warhol silk-screen aside, you’ll be hard pressed to regularly find much on display that predates the 1980s in any of these private venues. Miami’s public museums seem consigned to fighting over whatever scraps of taxpayer funding remain. Public transit advocates were left fuming this past September when $500,000 from a legal settlement with Uber was earmarked by Miami-Dade County commissioners for a new group seeking to build an African-American history museum — one whose supporters seem especially interested in showcasing contemporary artists. That same month, the new county-founded American Museum of the Cuban Diaspora — so far focused on contemporary art — also came to the commissioners looking for help after not finding sufficient private funding. During a contentious budget hearing, it was awarded $550,000 from the $4 million subsidy previously promised to the Pérez Art Museum Miami — despite pleas from Mitchell Bierman, a PAMM trustee, that the result would be cuts in its staff and programming. This may be more than scaremongering: PAMM’s 2015 tax return, the most recent period publicly available, shows it ended that year with expenses exceeding revenue by nearly $5 million. (The museum, while not disputing the tax return, says the numbers do not reflect the full financial picture.) PAMM stands as a cautionary tale, Ms. Cubiñá of the Bass explained, a reminder to “keep it modest.” When PAMM opened in its Herzog & de Meuron-designed building in 2013, she said: “A lot of us were a little nervous because their budget was so huge — they needed to raise $15 million every year, and their building was so big. I thought, oh my God, are they going to suck all the funding out of everything?” In fact, she added, at the Bass, “our budget has gone up, our attendance has gone up.” Like PAMM, the Bass is a public-private hybrid. The city of Miami Beach provided a $7.5 million construction grant, in addition to a $650,000 annual subsidy and handling building maintenance. The museum is run by a private board responsible for the rest of its $3.5 million yearly budget. Accordingly, while renovations removed an indoor pedestrian ramp and doubled its exhibition and classroom spaces, the exterior of its 1930s Art Deco building remained largely unchanged “to stay within our budget,” Ms. Cubiñá noted. “I don’t want to be fund-raising for air-conditioning.” Ms. Cubiñá said she hopes the museum’s location, a block from the ocean, continues fostering a connection with potential Miami Beach donors looking to support a museum in their backyard. And there’s a built-in audience: “Here we have so many people already visiting, going to the beach, or just taking a walk and they bump into us!” If all that fails to keep the Bass afloat, Ms. Cubiñá, like the ICA Miami, has her own billionaire to fall back on: George Lindemann. The president of her museum’s board since 2008, Mr. Lindemann, his sister Sloan, and his older brother, Adam (also a well-known art collector), are heirs to a family fortune that Forbes estimates at $3.2 billion. Mr. Lindemann said making the Bass sustainable was key. “It was kind of like a start-up, yet we had a 40-year history to work with,” he said, recalling the Miami Beach city manager’s initial request that he leave PAMM’s board of trustees to helm the then-moribund Bass board. His first task was to address the museum’s troubled origins. Opened in 1964 as a showcase for a collection of old masters and Modern paintings donated by the retired sugar baron John Bass, many of the artworks — including a supposedly second “Mona Lisa” — turned out to be fakes or misattributed. In a 1969 report, the Art Dealers Association of America called the Bass’s collection “the most flagrant and pervasive mislabeling by any museum known to the association.” Even Pablo Picasso weighed in. When the ADA sent him a photo of one of his pastels owned by the Bass, he mailed it back with his artwork’s signature crossed out and faux, French for false, handwritten underneath it. Mr. Lindemann considered changing the museum’s name. “But then we wouldn’t have the lovely building or the city support,” he said, citing city contracts dating to the 1960s as well as their already established museum accreditation and track record of landing grants. “The whole ‘fake’ thing is yesterday’s news,” he continued. “Today, I don’t think people feel burdened by the name.” Still, he appreciates Mr. Bass’s sense of spectacle, including the museum’s Egyptian mummies — now on display as part of an installation by the Cameroonian artist Pascale Marthine Tayou, who pairs his own recent work with antiquities from the Bass’s (now thoroughly vetted) collection. The ICA Miami would seem perfectly primed to pick up on that challenge of moving beyond the narrow confines of the contemporary milieu and showing the full history of art. After all, its main patrons, the Bramans, own masterworks spanning the last century, from Joan Miró to Mark Rothko. Indeed, Mr. Braman has lent a stunning Yves Klein painting and a giant Roy Lichtenstein canvas for the new museum’s opening exhibition, “The Everywhere Studio.” But beyond a few token nods, the museum’s deputy director and chief curator, Alex Gartenfeld, appears largely uninterested in taking a deep dive into earlier eras of art. And Mr. Braman says he won’t force the curatorial issue — for the same reason his own name isn’t on the museum’s facade. “We don’t want the museum to be construed as ours, it’s the community’s museum,” Mr. Braman said. “It’s just not our style to put our names on the philanthropy we’ve done. It’s not in the Jewish tradition of tzedakah,” of civic responsibility. In keeping with its prescribed mission, the ICA Miami certainly holds its own within the contemporary sphere, in the process introducing several lesser-known talents to a wider audience. A highlight is a room of massive abstract paintings by Tomm El-Saieh, whom Mr. Gartenfeld praised as “one of the leading artists working in Miami today” for his drawing upon both expressionist and Haitian folkloric traditions. At PAMM, Mr. Sirmans insisted he would always make room for an informed dose of art history. He pointed out the museum’s current pairing of two early-20th-century paintings by Joaquín Torres-García with a fresh-out-of-the-studio work by Njideka Akunyili Crosby — all three canvases exploring kindred issues of identity. But was he daunted by his fund-raising competitors, those new museums sprouting up? “We’re a city that values culture,” he said. “What better way to demonstrate that than to make temples to culture?”",The New York Times
2017,"When Its Attacker Is in Handcuffs, ISIS Stays Mum","In the hours before the coordinated attacks in Paris two years ago, a 10-man unit of Islamic State militants car-pooled to the city, where they shared hotel rooms before strapping on suicide belts. Weeks later, the Islamic State released a video eulogizing them as “lions,” and sharing clips of each fighter pledging allegiance to the militant group, also known as ISIS. Each fighter, that is, except Salah Abdeslam, the only member who did not die in the attacks, and who instead went on the run. He was dragged from his hide-out in Belgium following a monthslong manhunt. To date, analysts say, he has said little to interrogators who have pressed him for details on how the cell hatched its plan, the worst terrorist attack in French history. His absence from the numerous releases distributed by the group — which often included photographs of his older brother, who detonated his belt in a Parisian cafe on the night of the attacks — pointed to what would become a trend. It may help explain why the Islamic State had not, as of Wednesday night, asserted responsibility for the deadly rampage the day before in Manhattan by a truck driver who was wounded and arrested by the police, who say he is a disciple of the group. With few exceptions, the Islamic State has not claimed attacks when a surviving recruit falls into the hands of the authorities. “It’s as if he didn’t even exist,” said Jean-Charles Brisard, director of the Center for the Analysis of Terrorism in Paris, regarding the omission of the 10th attacker from the group’s propaganda. The Islamic State has followed this practice regardless of whether the attacker was directly dispatched or inspired remotely through online tutorials. Among the attacks that investigators have definitively tied to the group — and which it never claimed, despite the casualties they caused — were those at the Jewish Museum in Brussels in 2014, which left four dead, and on the Thalys train in 2015, which wounded three. Last year, when Ahmad Khan Rahimi, who planted bombs in New Jersey and in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, was finally taken into custody, the police also found his bloodstained journal, containing references to Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, the Islamic State spokesman and the leading figure calling for attacks on the West. But ISIS did not take responsibility for Mr. Rahimi’s acts. More recently, the Islamic State never claimed a truck-ramming in Stockholm in April, even though the perpetrator was found to have been a recruiter for the group. Nor did the group take responsibility for a vehicular attack in Edmonton, Canada, just over a month ago, carried out by a man who took the time to drape the Islamic State flag on the dashboard of his Chevrolet Malibu before using it to ram through a traffic barricade. The constant in each of these cases is that the perpetrator was apprehended. More than 24 hours after the arrest of the driver in the Manhattan assault, which left eight people dead, the group’s media arm remained mum, even though he had left a note stating that the “Islamic State will endure forever,” a reference to the group’s slogan. The lack of a claim is conspicuous in light of how much territory the group has lost in Syria and Iraq in recent months, erasing 90 percent of the caliphate it once held. Claiming responsibility for the truck rampage in New York, the worst terrorist attack in the city since Sept. 11, 2001, might be expected to project an image of strength for the group. A New York Times tally of the more than four dozen attacks on Western targets claimed by the group since 2014 indicates that the Islamic State typically issues its claim of responsibility within 24 hours, though there have been some exceptions, including two attacks this past summer that the group claimed a month later. It is possible that the group is simply taking its time. Among the arguments for why the Islamic State would not claim responsibility, even when everything points to it, is a pragmatic consideration. “It’s essentially about loyalty. No one would be motivated to do an ISIS attack if they know that when they end up getting caught, someone will out them,” said Raphael Gluck, an independent researcher who focuses on the group’s digital footprint and has embedded himself in many of the group’s online chat rooms. “It would work counter to their whole recruitment line and would serve to push off the next attack.” Amarnath Amarasingam, a senior research fellow at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, who has interviewed Islamic State followers online as part of his work, said that members of the group explained to him that not asserting responsibility for attacks was intended to protect fighters. “I think it’s very much a matter of internal communication,” he said, “a way of telling their supporters that if they are captured, they won’t be sold out by the group.” Others said they see a theological justification: The Islamic State encourages recruits to die in a standoff with the police in a “martyrdom operation.” When the fighter survives, the mission is incomplete, Mr. Brisard said. This theory has been given weight by several recent attacks, including the London Bridge and the Barcelona attacks this summer, in which assailants wore what turned out to be fake suicide belts. Online tutorials teach followers how to make these look-alike vests, strapped on for the purpose of inviting law enforcement’s gunfire. That motivation may also explain why the Manhattan suspect, Sayfullo Saipov, emerged from his rented Home Depot truck armed with both a pellet gun and a paintball gun, neither powerful enough to cause significant harm, but making him look dangerous to the police. “According to their logic, their ideology, they are supposed to die during the action,” Mr. Brisard said. He and others discounted the notion that attacks were not claimed because they were not deemed successful. The group has asserted responsibility for foiled plots, like the attacker who rammed his explosive-laden car into a police vehicle on the Champs-Élysées in Paris in June. No one was hurt except the assailant, who had appeared on France’s S-list of radicalized individuals. He was killed, and sometime after, the Islamic State claimed the attack, calling it a reminder to Western powers that the “battle has come to their homeland.”",The New York Times
