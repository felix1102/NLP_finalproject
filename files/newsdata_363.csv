2018,Shelsky’s Branches Into Bagels,"Front Burner The appetizing emporium opens a new bagel shop in Park Slope, Brooklyn, with bagels and pletzels, a kind of large, flattened bialy covered with onions and poppy seeds. For Shelsky’s latest venture, it’s all about the bagels. At their new Park Slope location, the owners Peter Shelsky and Lewis Spada have brought on Matthew Tilden, who was at Scratchbread in Bedford-Stuyvesant, to bake bagels that, while quite plump, are denser, chewier and crisper than the usual examples of the genre. The partners are especially proud of their cracked pepper and salt bagel, their whole-grain bagel and their pletzel, a kind of large, flattened bialy covered with onions and poppy seeds. Shelsky’s smoked fish and other deli items fill the display cases. Bagel and bialy sandwiches are available, along with fried knish pastry filled with hot pastrami, sauerkraut and mustard. It’s food to go; seating is minimal. Shelsky’s Brooklyn Bagels, 453 Fourth Avenue (10th Street), Park Slope, Brooklyn, 718-855-8817, shelskys.com.

2018,Shop the Apocalypse,"Safety-orange jumpsuits, face masks, tactical vests: So-called war-core clothing is hot during these anxious times. A surfeit of dystopian apparel was evident on the men’s wear runways this year. Junya Watanabe showed nylon anoraks, wool lumberjack jackets and firefighter coats adorned with the kind of bright reflective tape usually seen on school crossing guards. Prada trotted out padded nylon vests that look like they could repel bullets and oversize rain suits that looked like they could protect against nuclear fallout. And for his Calvin Klein Collection show in February, Raf Simons, the creative director, dressed the male models in safety-cone-orange jumpsuits, knee-high waders and knit balaclavas, all of which gave new meaning to the term “fashion emergency.” If fashion is reflecting our anxious times, the most alarmist trend these days is the rise of military-inspired clothing and other utilitarian garb normally reserved for emergency responders, security guards and doomsday preppers. Style arbiters, including Vogue magazine, have taken to calling it “war-core.” “Fashion ideates what’s going on around it,” said Francesca Granata, an assistant professor of fashion studies at the Parsons School of Design in New York. And these days, she said, it is “making sense of societal anxieties or fears.” Cultural manifestations of our collective anxiety are everywhere, said Roseanne Morrison, the fashion director at the Doneger Group, a retail and forecasting consultancy firm in New York. She points to shows including “Black Mirror” and “The Handmaid’s Tale,” the video game Fortnite and the constant drumbeat of news about climate change, political unrest and economic troubles. “People like to mentally prepare for the end of the world,” Ms. Morrison said. “This blurring between reality and fantasy, we’re seeing it in books, we’re seeing it in movies, it’s affecting the psyche.” In other words, it’s the end of the world as we know it — dress accordingly. Younger designers have pushed the doomsday references further. Matthew Williams of Alyx, a brand based in Ferrara, Italy, created a tactical vest festooned with cinch straps, Velcro pockets and other details borrowed from military vests. And TakahiroMiyashita the Soloist, a men’s wear brand from Japan, offers perforated face masks and emergency ponchos emblazoned with the words “The Day The World Went Away.” “It is almost impossible not to make things that have some reaction to what is happening in the world,” said Craig Green, a British designer, whose fall 2018 collection offered playful interpretations of masculine uniforms including coveralls with oversize utility pockets. But war-core is not limited to the runway; it’s appearing on store shelves and in the streets as well. On Lyst, a fashion search engine, searches for camouflage are up 38 percent, including camo cargo pants by Ralph Lauren ($290) and a “reconstructed” version by Off-White ($1,190), according to Katy Lubin, a spokeswoman. Zumiez, a skate wear store outside of Seattle, sells items from Rothco, an army and military wholesaler, including a fluorescent orange rescue vest ($44.95) and a black tactical vest (which is sold out). The items appeal to trend-hungry young adults, not soldiers or construction workers, said Trevor Lambert-Lee, a men’s apparel buyer at Zumiez. Federico Barassi, the senior men’s wear buying director at SSense, an online retailer in Montreal, is betting on work wear jackets with reflective detailing, mechanic-style coverall jumpsuits and other disaster-themed pieces this season. “I see reflective things everywhere,” he said. “It’s part work wear and part street wear.” Fashion’s current fetish for work wear also seem to be trickling down to more proletariat-minded stores. Adam Levy, an owner of Dave’s New York, a family-run store in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan that specializes in utilitarian clothing, said that he has seen an uptick in sales of Carhartt jackets, Dickies pants and other “high-visibility” garments. “Wearing a functional piece of clothing in a nonfunctional environment turns heads,” Mr. Levy said. “It’s almost ironic.” Indeed, war-core fashion may not be the most practical clothing to wear in an emergency. “This runs contrary to the prepper mind-set,” said Jim Rawles, the founder of SurvivalBlog, a popular website in the United States for doomsday preparedness. “For a city dweller who is worried about getting run over by a cab, this all makes sense,” Mr. Rawles said. But “high visibility is basically drawing attention to yourself. And if there’s one thing preppers strive for, it’s low visibility.”",The New York Times
2018,Shopping for Tumblers,"Shopping Guide There is a good reason they’re the most common form of glassware. Tumblers — drinking glasses without stems — are the most multipurpose form of glassware, equally suitable for serving tap water and single-malt whiskey. In fact, they are so ubiquitous that they might not seem as glamorous as their stemmed siblings. But when they’re distinctive, they almost always attract attention, especially as part of a table setting for a special event. Glasses like tumblers “are not only functional, but also a really pretty part of the décor,” said Marcy Blum, an event planner in New York who has organized weddings for celebrity couples like LeBron and Savannah James, Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick, and Nate Berkus and Jeremiah Brent. Ms. Blum said she usually includes two stemmed glasses (for red and white wine) with each place setting, as well as one eye-catching tumbler for water, often in a color — like the yellow glasses she recently used on a table decorated with lemons for a wedding on the Amalfi Coast of Italy. “So many people picked them up,” she recalled, “and said, ‘Oh, they’re so beautiful.’” How heavy should a tumbler be? For serving scotch and bourbon, Ms. Blum likes hefty cut-crystal glasses that can be paired with oversized ice cubes; for water, she prefers more delicate tumblers. How many do you need? If your tumblers will see regular use, Ms. Blum suggested buying them in quantities of 10 to 12. What is the best everyday option? Ms. Blum recommended finding a simple, sturdy tumbler, like those made by Libbey. “When you’re groggily pouring your orange juice, if you drop it, it will usually bounce,” she said. “And if you break it, it’s not that expensive.” Hefty cut-crystal glass with thick base $280 to $370 a pair at Baccarat: 800-215-1300 or us.baccarat.com Textured tumbler formed by blowing molten glass into textile $15 to $20 each at Hay: 833-849-3025 or us.hay.com Colored glass with rounded bottom from Germany $35 each at March: 415-931-7433 or marchsf.com Purposely imperfect handblown tumbler $35 each at Simon Pearce: 800-774-5277 or simonpearce.com Tumbler with crystalline form from Sugahara of Japan $39 at Still House: 212-539-0200 or stillhousenyc.com For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

2018,Shopping for Votive Holders,"Shopping Guide The quickest way to add ambience to a party is with a cluster of votive candles. On festive winter nights, votive holders filled with flickering tea lights can add instant ambience to a room. “They give you that sparkling effect,” said the interior designer Miles Redd, who uses them often, especially when he’s entertaining. “It makes everything seem rich and glittering,” he said. Compared with standard taper candles, Mr. Redd continued, tea lights have a slightly more casual vibe — with less cause for worry. “Tapers sometimes drip wax on things, which can be a nuisance,” he said. “And votives are a little safer.” Also, “the light is lower, a little more discreet and softer.” For maximum impact, he suggested using them in multiples. “I’m a fan of more, for sure,” Mr. Redd said. “I put them on the mantel, I put them on tables, and I certainly put them on the dining table. They’re good anywhere you want a little pool of light.” What size is best? Smaller votive holders often look appealing arranged in clusters; larger ones make a statement when you use just a few. Are transparent votive holders best? Not necessarily, because you’ll see flickering light even if the flame is obscured from the side. “It all boils down to the look” you want, Mr. Redd said. Do you really need to buy a votive holder? Actually, you don’t, Mr. Redd said, noting that while he owns proper silver votive holders, he also likes to repurpose small cups to hold tea lights.

2018,Shopping for Wreaths,"Shopping Guide Hanging a wreath — either earthy or artificial — is the easiest way to decorate for the holidays. But why limit yourself to just one? When it comes to decorating for the holidays, few things are easier, yet more transformative, than hanging a wreath. “I think nothing is friendlier than putting a wreath on your door,” said Carolyne Roehm, the lifestyle author and tastemaker. “Maybe I’m just very hokey, but it’s so welcoming, and gives me a sense of warmth.” Perhaps that explains why she rarely limits herself to just one. “I put them everyplace,” said Ms. Roehm, whose latest book, “Design & Style: A Constant Thread,” was published by Rizzoli this fall. “I put them on my doors, some of my mantels and in windows. Years ago, I hung them from the ceiling like a chandelier.” And over time, she has experimented with a variety of materials. “I’ve gone from doing them in the traditional pine, balsam and fir, and adding juniper branches and berries,” she said, “to pine cones” — both natural and golden. “I’ve done them in real fruit. I’ve done them in fake fruit. I’ve done them in flowers.” No matter what a holiday wreath is made of, she added, the message it communicates is the same: “This is a time to think about a lot of lovely things.” What’s the best way to hang a wreath? “I’ll often use fishing line or a piece of twine and then cover it with ribbon, so it’s pretty,” Ms. Roehm said. “But sometimes I’ve just pounded an old nail into the wall.” Is it better to use real greenery or faux? “The fake ones are so much more sophisticated than they used to be,” said Ms. Roehm, who uses both. “I’ll take those and maybe add a bit of real greenery, or glue-gun or wire something into them to add my touch.” When should it come down? Ms. Roehm usually hangs her wreaths during the first week of December and removes them the first week of January.

2018,Should Aziz Ansari and Louis C.K. Talk About Accusations Onstage?,"On Comedy ATLANTIC CITY — On a Saturday night this month in a cavernous theater in a casino, an Aziz Ansari I had never seen before strode onstage. Wearing a black leather jacket and skinny jeans, he looked the same, but the old swagger was diminished, replaced by a certain world-weary exasperation. He began his set with a series of jokes poking fun at progressives who get furious online. He mocked the early summer uproar over cultural appropriation and a white girl from Utah who wore a cheongsam to prom, and sighed at those who criticized “The Simpsons” for the Indian character Apu. Later, he skewered competitive virtue-signaling, describing it as a game of “progressive Candy Crush.” The show’s major theme was contempt for “people trying to outwoke each other” online. What went unsaid was that since the last time he toured new material, Ansari had become the high-profile subject of an internet furor himself. An anonymous woman had published a detailed article about a date with him and accused him of inappropriate behavior. (Ansari has said that their encounter was consensual.) The article drew viral outrage, an equally forceful backlash and much commentary about dating culture and the #MeToo movement. Ansari, who will resume his tour of the United States and Canada in February, is now one of several male comics returning to the national stage after facing scrutiny for sexual conduct. T.J. Miller, who has been accused of sexual assault and denied the allegations, is performing around the country. And most famously, Louis C.K., who admitted to misconduct, has been working out new material primarily in short club sets locally, though he did an hour at a club in Long Island on Sunday, presumably laying the groundwork for a special. [Read about Ansari’s tour and a recent Louis C.K. performance.] Whether and how these men should return has been debated endlessly. They are back, and while their new work will raise political and moral questions, it also poses an artistic one: Should they talk about the accusations and their experience onstage? Ansari is a case study in the dangers of avoiding the subject, in part because his new act is such a reversal from his previous work. Among comics who play arenas, there has never been a more woke stand-up. Before he landed on a list of creepy men, he did politically conscientious bits about the scourge of creepy men. Before he talked dismissively about the critique of Apu, he actually appeared in the Hari Kondabolu documentary that criticized Apu. Perhaps having his private life revealed has not informed Ansari’s sudden shift in perspective, but I’d be surprised. Unless you know his personal story, some of his joke premises come off as coy, even nonsensical. For instance, he breaks the world down into three groups: hard-core Trump people, hard-core woke people and everyone else, a situation he compares to a Biggie-Tupac feud with Boyz II Men trying to stay out of it. Considering woke people online have much less power, clout and influence than the president, this is an odd way to view the world. But it’s possible to see how Ansari might think otherwise, how he feels alienated both from an administration he disagrees with and from those who associated him with Harvey Weinstein, Matt Lauer and other recently disgraced men. Ignoring his personal experience leaves a gaping hole in his act. Audience members who don’t know the back story might find this premise baffling. Those who do may see it as evasive. But is it? Art often makes points through metaphor and indirection. Arthur Miller didn’t need to mention the red scare in “The Crucible” to say something trenchant about it. So why is Ansari different? The answer has to do with the peculiar nature of stand-up, an art form in which the elephant in the room does not lurk in the background. It stands right in front of the microphone raising its trunk to the ceiling. To illustrate why, a quick tangent: The only time I met Louis C.K. was backstage at a comedy theater while I was working on an unrelated story several years ago. Louis C.K. made a surprise drop-in and told a joke about something funny his daughter told him, and since like him, I have two daughters, the older one around the same age as his younger one, this sparked my curiosity. When he walked backstage, I asked him which of his kids was he referring to? His response: “I just made that up.” I cover standup for a living and am well aware of its contrivances, and yet, I confess I was surprised, which is a testament to his skill, but also, I believe, to the conventions of standup. If the stories about Bill Cosby and Louis C.K. have taught us anything, it’s that we can’t trust the veracity of the personas comedians put forth for consumption, let alone the details of their jokes. But when gifted artists walk onstage presenting as themselves and tell the audience something about their lives, our first instinct is to believe it. Maybe we’re gullible or naïve, but that’s why standup personas make such good springboards for memoirs or sitcoms. It also helps explain the success of stand-up, the resilient allure of authenticity, the most overrated of virtues, and the challenge of comics who have lost trust with their audience. The persona of Aziz Ansari rested on the construction that he was a progressive guy sensitive to dating mores. (He even wrote a book called “Modern Romance.”) Louis C.K.’s persona was more complex. He persistently talked about sexual perversion and immorality but also led fans to believe that he was ultimately a good guy. He initially ignored his misconduct when he returned to performing but has reportedly started to talk about it onstage, and we’ll have to wait to see how his approach works. One major downside when someone as prominent as Louis C.K. brings up these stories is that the victims have no say in the matter and are dragged back into the experience. For swaths of their audience, the news about these men was not just disappointing. It was a betrayal of their work. That’s why the earlier versions of these comics are essentially dead. They can’t use some of their tools as they once did, and to flourish, they might have to find new ones. To some degree, Ansari already has. He’s a different comic: crankier, older, the kind of guy who says he doesn’t understand the younger generation. Ansari’s strength has never been in the originality of his jokes. He does a spin on a famous Jeff Foxworthy bit that has been done many times — in this case, Ansari says: “If you’ve had an arranged marriage, but it’s to your cousin, you might be an Indian redneck.” He’s also never been the most introspective of comics. So digging into his past onstage would be outside his comfort zone. There are clearly dangers to bringing up the date story that went viral, but there is also potential. Hearing a personal standpoint would be compelling. There is so much talk in the culture about what standup comics should or should not do, about the lines they are or are not allowed to cross. But perhaps there has not been enough consideration of the perils of too much caution. It’s hard to be a Kanye West fan in 2018, Ansari said in the show this month, adding that he’s going to stick with him. Some surely feel the same about Ansari. But comics have long been articulating things that audiences think and would never say out loud. So to leave the thing people are thinking unsaid not only defies expectations, it also reveals a fearfulness that has never been the foundation of great art. Sometimes, the safest bet is to take a risk. An earlier version of this article misstated the kind of dress that inspired a cultural appropriation uproar. It was a cheongsam, not a kimono, that a white girl wore to her prom.",The New York Times
2018,Should I Warn Prospective Tenants About My Noisy Neighbor?,"Ask Real Estate You have a right to speak up about conditions in your building, but you can’t deliberately make it harder for your landlord to rent out the apartment. Q: I live in a rent-stabilized apartment in Chelsea, next door to an extremely noisy neighbor who treats the place like a one-person karaoke bar. Complaints to the landlord and police have never resolved the problem. I’m moving out soon, which will take care of the issue for me, but I feel terrible about a future tenant suffering through this person’s noise. If the landlord brings prospective tenants through the apartment, is it wrong for me to tell them about the problem? Is there any other resource that might let me put a warning out there? A: You have a constitutional and statutory right to speak up about building conditions. However, you can’t go around bad-mouthing your neighbor to make it more difficult for your landlord to rent out the apartment. If you do, the landlord could sue you for intentionally persuading a tenant to not enter into a contract with the landlord. “The safer thing to do would be to shut up,” said Samuel J. Himmelstein, a tenant lawyer and partner at the Manhattan firm Himmelstein, McConnell, Gribben, Donoghue and Joseph. If the building had major ongoing problems, like a lack of heat or hot water, you could warn potential tenants. Tenants have done things like hang signs from windows stating the number of outstanding city violations, or hand out fliers to people entering the building. But even those steps carry some risk. “Proceed with caution, and only do it in an organized way,” with many tenants participating, Mr. Himmelstein said. Noise is often subjective, particularly in the city, which might explain why neither your landlord nor the police have stepped in. To you, the one-man karaoke show may be unbearable. To someone else, it may be nothing more than background noise, and worth tolerating in exchange for a rent-stabilized apartment in a prime Manhattan neighborhood. You could certainly voice your concerns on the internet. Many New Yorkers post lengthy gripes about their buildings on Yelp. Whose Your Landlord, a landlord ratings site, provides tenants with a space to complain. However, since your concerns are localized to your unit in the building, your review may not be all that helpful to other renters.

2018,Should Kids Whose Parents Could Earn Higher Salaries Get Financial Aid?,"The Ethicist I have a friend with school-age children who is a professional in a fairly lucrative field. The spouse is in a nonlucrative field. My friend chose to work fewer hours to spend time with their growing children, greatly reducing the family’s take-home pay in the process. This friend wanted the kids to go to an expensive private school that has a scholarship program with income requirements to qualify for student aid. Aid was applied for and received. I feel that it is inappropriate to use scholarship funds when the lack of income was merely a choice and not a circumstance. That scholarship money (which is limited) could have gone to a parent who had no capacity to make more money, regardless of effort. Do you think it was right that this friend received scholarship funds? Name Withheld Your letter scrupulously avoided specifying the genders of the parties. That’s helpful, because I have a hunch that many people would respond more sympathetically to a woman who decided to spend time raising her children — to take the “mommy track” — than to a man who made the same choice. And thinking that way reflects and supports unfortunate stereotypes. But I can’t accept your contention that it’s wrong to accept financial assistance — scarce funds to which one is entitled under the rules — if one could have obviated the need by making different career decisions. In particular, deciding to be more actively engaged in the lives of your children is an honorable choice, and I’d urge the school to support it. And how would you generalize your principle? There are people who could have gone into investment banking but instead brought their financial acumen to the nonprofit world. Yes, they chose to earn less money, but it can’t be right that they are thereby obliged to renounce the scholarships for which their kids are qualified. All of this takes place, of course, against a disquieting background: In our society, some parents must decide between private schooling that is excellent and public schooling that is not. If that is the situation here, these parents are entitled to do the best they can for their kids (given the constraints of honesty and obedience to the rules), even if it disadvantages others. But it would be better to live in a society where parents didn’t face that decision. My grandniece posted on Facebook that she is trying to raise money so that she can go on a trip to Nepal with other high-school students from her Christian school to “evangelize the unreached people” of South Asia. My husband and I can easily afford to contribute to her fund-raising effort, but I am opposed to evangelizing. I fully support mission trips when the participants travel to needy communities to provide assistance, but not when the object of the trip is to convert people to Christianity. I believe that we should honor — and work to understand — the religions and spiritual traditions in South Asia, not try to change them. Is there a way to support her without supporting the underlying reason for the trip? Name Withheld Missionaries will consider almost everyone in Nepal “unreached,” even though most Nepalis have a mobile phone. So your grandniece isn’t arriving to some premodern redoubt. Nor is she going to coerce or bribe or threaten people into changing, or pretending to change, their religion. She’s aiming to explain to them why she thinks Christianity is the true faith. It’ll be up to them to decide whether they agree with her. To assume that they can’t be relied on to do so in the light of their own best judgments is to risk condescension. Evangelizing Christians played a role in the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade, contravening settled traditions in both Britain and Africa; in late-19th-century China, missionaries played a role in ending foot-binding. All that was indeed good news. More recently, in Uganda, a handful of American evangelical ministers evidently helped spur the passage of legislation that sought to drastically increase the penalties for homosexual acts. That was bad news. It’s useless to try to draw up a ledger sheet here of good and evil. The point is that God and the Devil are in the details. Still, you might want to suggest to your grandniece that if she wants these South Asians to be open to hearing her good news, she should probably be open to hearing theirs, too. That way, she can make an effort to understand the traditions of the place she’s going, which you rightly suggest is a good idea. Whether she should honor those traditions as well depends on what they are — and she won’t be able to decide about that if she doesn’t know anything about them. There are, after all, a great many ways of not being a Christian. I worked in a creative industry that has a close-knit community. An individual in a prominent position within the industry has been accused of sexually assaulting several subordinates. This person is currently under investigation, which some are aware of, to varying degrees. I know and believe many of the victims. Here’s the snag: Not many within the industry are aware of the abuse. The individual is very good at covering their tracks, and the victims, for their own privacy, have avoided taking their details public. As a result, several former co-workers of mine, unaware of the assaults, have been vocal in supporting this person. I am horrified by the thought that these former co-workers and friends are being hoodwinked. Should I tell them that this individual has been accused of multiple sexual assaults? Or, given that I’m not a victim myself and that the information has been only quietly circulated, should I say nothing? If I keep quiet, am I enabling this abuser to continue their pattern of abuse? Name Withheld If you’re right, this abuser is wrongly gaining the support of your credulous co-workers. They surely wouldn’t be speaking up for this person if they knew what you know. Assuming you’re confident in your assessment of the facts, you should go ahead and tell them what you’ve learned. Otherwise, by allowing this abuser to gain undeserved support, you would indeed be helping to defer the day of reckoning. I’ve been divorced for 27 years, and my ex-wife died recently. Her pension plan called me trying to locate her. I told them that we’ve had absolutely no contact in 27 years. The pension plan called again and told me that I was her beneficiary. She has a son, but she hadn’t made him her beneficiary. Should I accept the money? Name Withheld I assume you think your ex-wife would have wanted the money to go to her son, not to you. If so, trying to make it happen would be more respectful of her will than scrupulous attention to what was long ago written on some piece of paper. Explore the most tax-efficient way of getting this money to her son. Where it doesn’t conflict with other moral imperatives, we should try to honor the wishes of the departed, including ex-spouses we haven’t seen in a long time. I teach journalism at a major state university, and one of my favorite courses is basic editing. I give 10 A.P.-style quizzes in the first half of the course, graded from 0 to 100. Student grades run from very low to 100. I always tell students the grade range when I hand quizzes back, but I exaggerate. If the lowest grade was 45, I tell them the lowest grade was 40. Similarly, if the highest grade was 90, I say it was 95. I do this so the worst-performing students don’t feel quite so bad and the high achievers have something to strive for. A colleague says I am being dishonest and serving no real purpose, but I see no harm. After all, I do record the accurate grades for everyone. What do you say? Name Withheld Isn’t one of the principles of basic editing in the field of journalism that truth is better than fiction, however benevolently intended?",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Should Marijuana Be Legal?,"Listen and subscribe to our podcast from your mobile device: Apple Podcasts | RadioPublic | Stitcher | Spotify | Google Play This week on “The Argument” podcast, the columnists talk pot. First, Michelle Goldberg presses former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson on his forthcoming book about the dangers of marijuana, “Tell Your Children: The Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness, and Violence.” Then, the columnists debate which marijuana policy the country should pursue. Michelle argues the harms of criminalizing weed outweigh the harms of legalizing it. Ross Douthat worries about the broader social impacts of legalization and the growth of the cannabis industry. And David Leonhardt favors a middle path, one that forgoes harsh penalties for marijuana use without incentivizing more Americans to try it. And finally, merry … Advent? Ross taps into his liturgical side to recommend a solution to the seasonal “Merry Christmas” versus “Happy Holidays” dilemma. Background Reading: Ross on marijuana and social libertarianism David on marijuana’s health effects I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist since 2009, and I write about politics, religion, pop culture, sociology and the places where they all intersect. I’m a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I’m against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the “reasonable” elites. I’ve written books about Harvard, the G.O.P., American Christianity and Pope Francis; I’m working on one about decadence. Benedict XVI was my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows. I have three small children, two girls and a boy, and I live in New Haven with my wife. I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use “liberal” as an epithet, but that’s basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump’s presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I’ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian émigré who helped bring yoga to the West.) I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter. I’ve worked at The Times since 1999 and have been an Op-Ed columnist since 2016. I caught the journalism bug a very long time ago — first as a little kid in the late 1970s who loved reading the Boston Globe sports section and later as a teenager working on my high school and college newspapers. I discovered that when my classmates and I put a complaint in print, for everyone to see, school administrators actually paid attention. I’ve since worked as a metro reporter at The Washington Post and a writer at BusinessWeek magazine. At The Times, I started as a reporter in the business section and have also been a Times Magazine staff writer, the Washington bureau chief and the founding editor of The Upshot. My politics are left of center. But I’m also to the right of many Times readers. I think education reform has accomplished a lot. I think two-parent families are good for society. I think progressives should be realistic about the cultural conservatism that dominates much of this country. Most of all, however, I worry deeply about today’s Republican Party, which has become dangerously extreme. This country faces some huge challenges — inequality, climate change, the rise of China — and they’ll be very hard to solve without having both parties committed to the basic functioning of American democracy.

2018,"Should Radio Stations Stop Playing ‘Baby, It’s Cold Outside’?","Student Opinion What do you think about the song “Baby, It’s Cold Outside”? (If you’ve never heard it, listen to it here or read the lyrics.) How do you feel when you hear the song? Does it bring you holiday cheer? Or does it make you cringe? Do you feel differently listening to the song this year than you have in the past? Why or why not? In “How ‘Baby, It’s Cold Outside’ Went From Parlor Act to Problematic,” Jacey Fortin writes about why the controversy over the song has crescendoed this holiday season: Rock Hudson did it with Mae West. Ray Charles did it with Betty Carter. Lady Gaga and Joseph Gordon-Levitt did it with a modern twist. And somewhere along the line, the 74-year-old song “Baby, It’s Cold Outside” became a holiday standard, in heavy radio rotation, playing overhead in department stores, and covered on Christmas albums. “I’ve got to get home,” the woman sings in the duet. “But baby, it’s cold outside,” the man replies. “The answer is no,” she protests later. By the end they’re singing the chorus together. Now, a long-simmering debate over the lyrics has reached a boil. The annual holiday culture wars and the reckoning over #MeToo have swirled together into a potent mix. Say — what’s in this drink? Several radio stations have pulled “Baby” from the air. Arguments have erupted on social media, and multiple panels on Fox News and CNN have latched on to the debate. William Shatner has emerged as a vocal champion of the song. “You must clutch your pearls over rap music,” he told one critic, urging him to listen to a 1949 classic version on YouTube. To some modern ears, the lyrics sound like a prelude to date rape. The woman keeps protesting. “I ought to say no, no, no, sir,” she sings, and he asks to move in closer. “My sister will be suspicious,” she sings. “Gosh, your lips look delicious,” he answers. She wonders aloud what is in her drink. “I think the song has always been creepy, but we didn’t have the words to explain why,” said Lydia Liza, 24, a singer-songwriter. But some believe this to be a case of political correctness run amok. “Do we get to a point where human worth, warmth and romance are illegal?” the conservative commentator Tucker Carlson argued on Fox News. Faced with protests, radio stations are doing their best to walk the line. “I gotta be honest, I didn’t understand why the lyrics were so bad,” Glenn Anderson, a radio host for Star 102 in Cleveland, wrote in a blog post last month after the station pulled the song from rotation. “Until I read them.” Students, read the entire article, then tell us: — When you listen to the song now, what do you hear? Flirtatious banter between two consenting adults? A woman who is genuinely resisting a man’s advances and a man who refuses to take “no” for an answer? A feminist protest against societal norms that constrain female sexuality? Or something else? Explain why you think the way you do. — Susan Loesser, the daughter of the song’s creators, said, “You have to look at things in cultural and historical context.” To what extent do you agree with this statement? Does understanding the cultural and historical context in which “Baby, It’s Cold Outside” was written change your opinion about it? Is it appropriate to re-examine the lyrics in today’s context, especially in light of the #MeToo movement? Why or why not? — How much do gender roles matter in this song? For instance, do your feelings change when the male and female parts are switched, as in the version performed by Lady Gaga and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, or when it’s sung by people of the same gender, as in the version sung by Chris Colfer and Darren Criss on “Glee”? Are these adaptations less offensive? Why or why not? — How does the song compare with others that are played on the radio? Is it more or less offensive than others with vulgar language or sexually explicit lyrics you hear? — Taking all of the above into consideration, do you think radio stations should stop playing “Baby, It’s Cold Outside”? In your opinion, is the song problematic? Or is this a case of political correctness run amok? Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

2018,Should Reporters Ever Help the People They Are Covering?,"Student Opinion Note: The article linked below contains photos from the current war in Yemen. These photos — especially those of extreme starvation — may be disturbing for some students to look at. Teachers should review the article and the photos in advance before assigning this Student Opinion. Imagine you are a journalist. You are writing a story about the homeless. After you interview a man living on the streets, he asks if you can give him some food. Do you give him food? Would that compromise your role as an objective journalist? A bomb goes off in a crowded street and you see dozens of badly injured people lying on the ground. Do you drop your camera to help the victims? What if that means sacrificing the story you were going to write? Should journalists ever provide help or assistance in the lives of the people they are reporting on? Why or why not? In “In Yemen, Lavish Meals for Few, Starvation for Many and a Dilemma for Reporters,” Declan Walsh, The Times’s Cairo bureau chief, writes about the moral challenges of being a journalist in a war-torn country: SANA, Yemen — At a restaurant in the Yemeni capital, Sana, a waiter brought bowls of slow-cooked lamb served with mounds of rice. For dessert there was kunafa, the classic Arab dish of golden brown pastry filled with cheese. An hour later I was back at work, in a hushed hospital ward filled with malnourished children with skeletal faces, hanging between life and death for want of money and a good meal. If that juxtaposition strikes you as jarring, even distasteful, it felt that way to me, too. Crisis zones are often places of stark contrast, but in Yemen the gulf is particularly uncomfortable. The problem isn’t a lack of food; it’s that few people can afford to buy what food is available. Years of blockades, bombs and soaring inflation have crushed the economy. A crushed state means there is no safety net. As a result, beggars congregate outside supermarkets filled with goods; markets are filled with produce in towns where the hungry eat boiled leaves; and restaurants selling rich food are a few hundred yards from hunger wards filled with desperation, pain and death. For a reporter, that brings a dilemma. Journalists travel with bundles of hard currency, usually dollars, to pay for hotels, transport and translation. A small fraction of that cash might go a long way for a starving family. Should I pause, put down my notebook and offer to help? It’s a question some readers asked after we published a recent article on Yemen’s looming famine. Many were touched by a powerful photograph by Tyler Hicks of Amal Hussain, an emaciated 7-year-old girl whose haunting stare brought the war’s human cost into shocking focus. And many were devastated to learn that, soon after we left, Amal’s mother brought her back to the shabby refugee camp they call home, where she died a few days later. Some, in their anguish, turned the focus back on us. Why didn’t we do something to save Amal’s life, they wanted to know. Did we just take the photo, conduct the interview and move on? Couldn’t we have somehow ensured that her family would get help? “You can take the picture AND provide assistance,” one woman said on Twitter. “One doesn’t rule out the other.” The questions resonated. Reporters are trained to bear witness; aid workers and doctors have the job of helping people. Donating money, or other forms of assistance, can be fraught with ethical, moral and practical complications. Is it fair to single out one person or family for help? What if they embellish their story for the next foreigner who comes along, thinking they could get more money? Plus, we have a job to do. Doctors show us around, and sometimes we end up acting like them — examining stick-like limbs and flaccid skin with clinical detachment; tabulating figures about weight and age; listening as families recount their tragedies with amazing calm. The prospect of death is discussed. We nod sagely, make a note, move on. But while we may try to mimic a stone, we are not stones, and every day in Yemen someone told me something that made a lump rise in my throat. Students, read the entire article, then tell us: — Should journalists ever help the people they are reporting on? — How is wartime journalism valuable? In what ways do you think photos like the one of Amal Hussain, the 7-year old girl who later died from starvation, make an impact? — Should Times reporters have helped Amal Hussain? What might be the negative consequences if they had? — Would you want to be a journalist? Would you want to be a war reporter? If you were faced with scenarios like the one in Yemen, how would you decide whether to provide assistance during your reporting or not? Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

2018,Should You Buy Someone a Phone for the Holidays?,"The answer is yes, if you can make sure you get them something they like, and you’re not saddling your loved one with a monthly bill. Here’s how to do it right. Every store and phone carrier offers holiday deals on their smartphones. It’s a good time to buy yourself a phone, but should you buy one for someone else? Like buying someone a puppy, that’s a complicated question. Big ticket electronics are popular holiday gifts because stores tend to drop prices by a lot for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and prices stay low through the holiday season. If someone on your list is in the market for a game console, laptop, tablet, or e-reader, this is the perfect time of year to save on them. Smartphones, however, are a different story. Stores love to advertise phones as a great gift idea, and offer buy-one-get-one-free deals or discounts when you sign up a new line. However, our phones are deeply personal devices. Someone might dislike a particular phone because it doesn’t fit in their pocket, because it doesn’t work on the right carrier, or even because it’s not the right color. Buying the right phone for someone else can become complicated very fast. Here are some of the big stumbling blocks to watch out for when phone shopping for a loved one, if you want to do it at all. A new phone without a cellular network to support it is just a tiny Wi-Fi tablet. Before you buy a phone for your friend or family member, you need to know what carrier they use, then find out whether or not the phone you’re buying works on that carrier. Cameron Summerson, news editor for tech website How-To Geek, has covered and reviewed smartphones for years and he said that getting the carrier right should be your top concern. “Depending on what carrier the recipient is on, you’ll need to make sure that the phone is compatible with that particular network,” he explained in an email. “This is most true for Verizon and Sprint, which tend to be more strict with bring-your-own-device policies. While most phones these days are quad-band” — meaning they should work on all major carriers — “there are definitely still some outliers that don’t offer the compatible bands for all networks. This is most true for new iPhones, which should be purchased for the specific network they will be used on.” This can be easier said than done. As Mr. Summerson points out, the iPhone faces a unique problem. If you buy one from Apple directly, or buy a phone from Verizon or Sprint, it will include both the radios required to work on Verizon and Sprint as well as the radio most of the rest of the world uses. Once unlocked, that phone will work on just about any carrier. However, if you buy an iPhone from AT&T or T-Mobile, it will only include the radio that those carriers support, which means you won’t be able to take it to Verizon or Sprint. See the problem? You can use a site like FrequencyCheck.com to look up specific phones by model number to make sure they work on the carrier your recipient uses. However, the most surefire way to make sure you’re getting a phone that works on a certain carrier is to buy it from that carrier (or an authorized reseller like Best Buy). If you’re stepping out into used phones or buying directly from the phone manufacturer, that’s when you need to be careful. It’s also worth checking with your gift recipient about their upgrade status. Most carriers have switched to a phone financing model, where you add a monthly fee to your plan until you’ve paid off your phone. However, some customers may still have the old two-year contract model, where you get a discount on a new phone in exchange for committing to another two-year contract. It might ruin the surprise a little, but if your recipient has an upgrade available and doesn’t plan to change carriers, paying for an upgrade to a phone of their choosing might be cheaper (and better for them) than buying a new phone outright. Picking a phone for someone else is like buying them clothes. If you know what they like and have a good feel for their tastes, you can find a great present. If you’re taking a wild guess without much information, you’ll probably get something they’ll want to exchange for something better. When in doubt, Mr. Summerson recommends making as few changes to what they have now as possible. “Pay attention to what they currently have and any complaints they have about that specific handset,” he said. “Unless you specifically know that the person wants to change platforms, it’s usually easiest (and best) to stick with what’s familiar — so, a new iPhone for an iPhone user, and a new Android phone for an Android user.” Even then, you can run into too many options, Mr. Summerson said. “There are a lot of choices in the Android space, however, so that can be a bit more challenging,” he said. “At that point, a bit of tact and dropping phone talk into general conversation may be necessary to get a better feel for what they like and don’t like about their current handset.” If your recipient has a large phone, stick with something big. If it has a fingerprint sensor on the back, try to find a new phone with those same features. Some features that seem minor to you might require bigger changes for them. For example, if they have a headphone jack on their current phone, but you buy a new phone without it, then they might have to buy wireless headphones or adapters just to use their phone the same way they used to. An exception to this rule is if you know that your gift recipient has a complaint about their phone. Are they complaining that their phone is too big? That’s a good time to look for a smaller phone. Does their camera suck? Picking a phone that takes fantastic pictures can be a big improvement in their life. This might require you to talk to your loved one before buying, but it’s safer than buying blind. Gift-givers often have an understandable reticence to just ask what their recipients want. Buying the right gift blindly shows you really understand your recipient. However, this is one area where you might want to ask anyway. “Some people love a good surprise, while others are incredibly picky about something as personal as their smartphone,” Mr. Summerson said. Unless you know for sure that the person you’re buying for wants a new phone, likes the phone you’ve picked out, and likes surprises, it’s a safe idea to talk it out with them. If you decide to take the chance on buying a phone without asking the recipient first, be sure to check with the carrier or retailer that you’re buying about their return policy. “Many places offer extended return policies over the holidays too, which is a nice fail-safe if you end up in a situation that may require a quick handset swap,” Mr. Summerson noted. If you buy a phone that your recipient doesn’t like, a generous return window can be a lifesaver. The only surefire way to make sure that your loved one likes the phone you’re buying, though, is to ask them. You can even turn it into a shared experience. Tell them that you’ll go phone shopping with them and buy the phone they like most. That way you don’t just buy a present for them, but you get to spend some quality time together.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Should a College Diploma Be a Goal for All?,"letters Readers discuss issues of equity, college-readiness and politics. To the Editor: Re “College Isn’t for Everyone,” by Oren Cass (Op-Ed, Dec. 12): I was somewhat saddened to read this Op-Ed, which seems to be saying that college is valuable only as it relates to earning power. Of course, having employment and making a decent living wage are important for everyone. But there’s more to college than that. Being exposed to somewhat higher levels of learning — a little literature, slightly advanced sciences, a dash of humanities — are equally important to earning power. I believe that every high school graduate should have free community college, at least. Some of them will go on to four-year colleges, some will go on to a job, some will probably drop out, but a lot of them will gain something they never experienced before. Looking back, I think my first two years of college opened more windows for me to a broader look at the world and my place in it than probably any other two years of my life. Let’s give everyone a chance to have at least a little of the brain-opening experience that college can be. Carol S. FrielCincinnati To the Editor: Oren Cass is absolutely correct that college is not for everyone. Over my 42 years of teaching undergraduates I estimate that at least a third of my students should not have been in college. Either they were not prepared academically, were too immature or were simply not suited for it. Mr. Cass’s idea of providing better options supported by vastly increased public funding would do these students far more good than failing or dropping out of college heavily burdened by debt. Colleges should award certificates for each year successfully completed so that students who leave after their first, second or third year have something to show for it. As it is now, they are viewed as failures and would have been better off never to have attended. Mr. Cass suggests a better option for them that deserves consideration. Martin RossBostonThe writer is professor emeritus of geology at Northeastern University. To the Editor: If we want to offer a genuine alternative-to-college plan, as Oren Cass argues for, we first need to know why so many students don’t make it to college or fail to graduate. I have found in my research that they are not college-ready because they have been failed by our tiered public education system, in which rich suburban districts fare much better than poorer urban and rural districts. Fix this pernicious structural system that reinforces inequalities and invest instead in college bridge programs like Upward Bound, which succeeds in giving underprivileged students a chance to learn the habits of mind, organizational skills and reading strategies necessary to make it in college. Do this right and more young people will thrive in college, regardless of the ZIP code they were born in. Pamela HollanderGrafton, Mass.The writer is an associate professor at Worcester State University and author of “Readiness Realities: Struggles and Successes During the Transition to College.” To the Editor: As a college professor who has struggled for 30 years to hold the interest of a great many students who didn’t really want to be in my class, I understand very well Oren Cass’s argument that young students not inclined to academic achievement should be offered a meaningful alternative to higher education. But as an American who has seen our political system dominated by a demagogue who loves the poorly educated, I think it is essential to teach all students the importance and the habits of critical thinking. It is a disaster for our country to be driven by the most poorly informed and easily led members of the electorate, and it testifies to serious failures of our educational system. Eric L. BittmanAmherst, Mass. To the Editor: Few, if any, parents who send their children to elite private schools do so with the expectation that they will not go on to college. These parents fully understand the economic advantages that a college degree confers and the social capital that the college experience helps to build. Why should this be any different for students from less privileged backgrounds? We have an obligation to ensure that every one of our children has the very same opportunities. And our expectation should be that all students, regardless of background or circumstance, graduate from high school prepared for success in college and with at least one acceptance letter in hand so that college is a genuine option for them. This is an equity issue, even more than an economic or social one. Richard StopolLong Island City, QueensThe writer is president of NYC Outward Bound Schools.",The New York Times
2018,Should a Nonprofit Splurge on Management?,"The Ethicist I work at a nonprofit that advocates for consumer rights and financial literacy, a mission I have been proud to serve. We recently suffered a financial crisis of our own. Due to changing federal policies, among other factors, we lost a chunk of our annual budget. Management decided to cut about a quarter of the staff to protect our long-term future. I was of course saddened by what happened, but I understood that there were no good options. Then a staff member who was laid off (and quickly found a new job) told me that senior managers’ salaries made up nearly a quarter of the budget and that we were paying for a “company car” for our president. In addition, a former manager is paid an exorbitant hourly rate for consulting. All of this hurt to hear. Our leaders sacrificed dozens of direct-service jobs that impact our clients’ lives but seemingly not their own relatively large salaries and fringe benefits. I am considering quitting in protest. (I am sure that the board is aware of the pay structure, so I doubt they will be of help.) I have also considered informing the media, but I don’t know what the ethical response is to what I see as an injustice to our fired colleagues and a violation of our mission. Name Withheld Our economy is warmly solicitous toward people at the top of the income hierarchy, icily indifferent toward those in the middle and at the bottom. The Economic Policy Institute says that last year the C.E.O.s of the largest 350 companies in the United States were paid on average 300 times as much as their average employee. And the nonprofit sector, given that it competes for talent with the for-profit sector, isn’t going to be entirely exempt from the trend. Your organization is obliged to serve its mission as well as it can with the resources it can muster. To do so, it needs good staff and good management — which requires it to be mindful of what the market rate is for people with the skills it needs. (Nonprofits typically do comparative analyses of salaries in their sector when considering raises for top management.) At the same time, income is just one factor that draws employees; often staff members will work for less when they find the work genuinely rewarding. Especially given the particular mission of your nonprofit, the situation sounds worrisome, and it might indeed have been a good idea to appeal to those at the top to accept cuts in salary in order to reduce the number of frontline employees who were let go. It might also have been better to end a consulting contract than to fire a permanent employee. Both would be harder than layoffs at the bottom, because board members are likely to be personally closer to senior managers (and former managers) than to other employees. Still, it’s their responsibility to weigh such options. None of these considerations, however, prove that the leadership made the wrong decision. When the budget shrinks, personnel decisions have to take account of the employment market. Suppose cutting your president’s perks or pay would incline her to take a job elsewhere. (Though that car sounds like something most places wouldn’t offer.) The cost to your organization of finding a new one, especially during a rocky period, might mean that it wasn’t worth the risk. A fixed, across-the-board reduction in salary, defined in percentage terms, might simply produce an organization full of disgruntled people waiting for a better opportunity. It’s conceivable, too, that the core competences of the organization lie in the best-paid people and that the less well paid would be easier to replace if and when funds return. You should feel free to talk to the media if you’ve determined that a nonprofit devoted to financial literacy has made bad financial decisions. But to know that, you would have to be privy to the details. Are you? You say that senior managers “seemingly” didn’t cut their own earnings — which makes it sound as if you might not be. The inequality in rewards between top and bottom is ultimately a structural problem that requires structural solutions. Several countries in Europe have chosen to deal with it by having higher taxes and more generous transfers to the less well off than we do, ensuring that their income inequality is much less than ours. Those lower-paid people laid off by your organization would have better unemployment insurance there, too. My point here is that the issues you raise aren’t really local to your organization. If we want to do something about them, resigning in protest from your nonprofit probably isn’t the answer. I was on a three-month study-abroad program for about a month before I changed my ticket to leave within a week. My partner’s mother was diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer a few weeks before I left for my trip. The treatment did not appear to be working, and the cancer continued to spread. My partner and I have been together for three years, and before I left, I promised that if things got worse, I would come home. I made good on that promise, but I feel incredibly guilty. I feel guilty for leaving my program early because my parents paid for it, and I am unlikely to get a refund. My partner’s mother was also upset that I came home early, but I felt a responsibility to support my partner and make her my priority. I feel like I let my professors and parents down, that I was playing into the stereotype of a young adult making hasty decisions. My father was incredibly supportive, but I still feel anxious. I know I could never have enjoyed myself there with the worry and sadness I was feeling for my significant other. Did I do the right thing? Name Withheld Love is a mode of care, the philosopher Harry Frankfurt has argued, that shapes your preferences and guides your conduct via “a practical concern for what is good for the beloved.” To feel love for someone is to take his or her interests as your own. It doesn’t answer to reasons; rather, in Frankfurt’s formula, “it creates reasons.” The moral nature of love, accordingly, may require sacrifices. Even if — as realism requires me to point out — your partner may not end up permanently in your life, such calculations are going to be alien to who you are as a loving person. Yes, the human and financial costs to you and your family will be substantial, but nothing you are doing involves irreversible loss. Your partner’s mother, who is perhaps feeling guilty for derailing your studies, may second-guess you. But your father hasn’t. And neither will I. Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this column misquoted the philosopher Harry Frankfurt. He wrote that love “creates reasons,” not “generates reasons.”",The New York Times
2018,"Showmanship, and Conflict, as Darts Goes From Smoky Pubs to TV Spectacle","LONDON — By conventional measures, dart players are not the telegenic type. They mutter to themselves onstage. They wear flamboyant polyester polos. They cradle their handful of tiny spears and stare a lot at a fibrous board seven-feet, nine-and-a-quarter inches away. But professional darts has catapulted itself from musty British pubs onto millions of television sets across Europe, an insurgency by a working-class sport that has turned the best of its mostly middle-aged players into stars. The premier darting event, the William Hill World Championship, has grown into a three-week, $3-million-purse affair, replete with cheerleaders and thunderous walk-on music, and the sport’s promoters work tirelessly to ratchet up the show. One area of emphasis in recent years has been to encourage the players to show some emotion for the TV cameras, celebrate some after a big turn or win. Though mild by the standards of other professional sports, the yelps and fist pumps and prancing are setting up a clash with some traditionalists, to whom there is no greater sin than showing up your competitor. The dispute is all part of a makeover of darts engineered by Barry Hearn, the silver-tongued chairman of the Professional Darts Corporation, or P.D.C., and the mastermind behind the sport’s growth on TV. Mr. Hearn said his message to players was unambiguous. “I talk to players: ‘Do not be boring, remember the customer,’” he said. “The guy that’s watching on TV wants to know, are you happy when you walk on stage? If you look bored I’ve got no time for you. It’s not W.W.E., because it’s a real sport without any rehearsal. At the same time, these players are smart enough to know we’ve got to stand out.” For years, professional dart associations have tried to shed the game’s links to the smoky pubs where it blossomed nearly a century ago. Beer has been banished from the stage. So have cigarettes. Players walk to their places through cheering throngs of fans as a handpicked song booms over the loudspeakers and the auditorium becomes bathed in cool, blue light. At the World Championship, being held this month at the Alexandra Palace in north London, it can be difficult at times to reconcile the crowd’s costumed revelry with the intensity of the players slinging needles at tiny sections of dartboard. The effect was that of a 3,000-member fraternity party taking place in the same convention hall as a complicated tooth extraction. With some players wearing earplugs now to block out the pandemonium, the notion of midmatch celebrations has proved contentious. In a sport as simple and rhythmic as darts, even a moment of mugging for the crowd can throw an opponent off. Take, for example, a first-round match at the World Championship, played before fans dressed in all manner of full-body costumes: a Christmas tree, a giraffe, a duck and Woody from “Toy Story,” not to mention a heavy-drinking bunch of (make-believe) priests and nuns. Vincent van der Voort, a veteran Dutch player known for his quick-fire style, was up against Lourence Ilagan, a wiry Filipino with a relatively thin résumé in major events. The two players took turns throwing from behind a line known as the oche (pronounced like “hockey” without the “h”), with each successful shot pulling them closer to the goal of dropping from 501 points to zero. Mr. van der Voort was nonchalant on the stripe, though his face grew redder and sweatier as the match wore on. Mr. Ilagan, on the other hand, strode around the stage, pumping his fist and once pausing, theatrically, to make a mean face, point a forefinger in the air and then jab it toward the ground. Mr. van der Voort eventually prevailed, but his opponent’s showmanship proved a challenge. “Once I was in a rhythm, I thought, ‘I’m going to smash you, really, I’m going to smash you all over,’” he said after the match. “And then he starts walking around and I couldn’t get my rhythm going and I thought, ‘Come on, get going, get going,’ and then all of a sudden I slowed down.” A two-time world champion, Gary Anderson, was involved in an incident last month involving Gerwyn Price, a former rugby player with the physique of a refrigerator. Mr. Price, an intense sort, came chest to chest with the mild-mannered Mr. Anderson as he shrieked in triumph over a particularly good turn. The sport’s regulatory body is now considering disciplinary action. (Over-celebrating, though, is hardly the only offense to have rocked the dart world lately. Mr. Anderson was accused last month of passing gas so pungent it threw his opponent off, an incident soon dubbed Fartgate. Mr. Anderson turned the blame back on his opponent, leaning on the “he who smelt, it dealt it” dictum, and now darting world insiders generally agree everyone should stop talking about the episode.) In any event, the P.D.C., which operates the biggest tournaments, has begun reviewing whether it needs more referees and a system for docking points from players during a match. The only problem is no one seems to know what qualifies as excessive celebration. Several ex-players said, confusingly, that what mattered was not the manner of celebration so much as whether a player had earned one. Mr. Hearn agreed. “If you’ve done something that’s worth celebrating, that’s not a problem,” he said. “If you hit 26 with three darts and celebrate” — a paltry score, even for a rank amateur — “you’ll be in front of the disciplinary panel.” Among the fan favorites is Peter Wright, a.k.a. Snakebite. He learned to play as a child in the 1980s in his family’s freezing cold garage in southeast London, and after climbing the local circuit eventually quit his job as a car mechanic and tire fitter to play professionally full-time. He earned $1,500 his first year, but now makes considerably more. Some of that is surely because of his dedication to his Snakebite persona: For between two and four-and-a-half hours before matches, his wife works on turning his head into a canvas. To the left of his colored mohawk — “the T.V. camera side,” Mr. Wright called it — she paints a snake. On the other side she paints a design matching the flag of the country where he’s competing or his trouser pattern. He said the P.D.C. should give players a long leash when it comes to onstage merrymaking. “Otherwise we’ll all go up doing the same thing, all robots, no celebration, and people won’t watch it anymore,” he said. The boisterous crowd and big TV audience — 1.4 million people in Britain and 2.7 million people in Germany watched the last World Championship final — have not reversed the long-term decline of pub darts, at least in major cities. In October, the number of central London dart pubs dropped below 90 for the first time, said Justin Irwin, an amateur coach who keeps track of the grass-roots game. Most of that has to do with rising rents that have forced dart pubs to become gastro pubs, said Patrick Chaplin, a darts enthusiast who wrote a doctoral dissertation on the sport’s history. Working-class players are also moving farther outside the city. The popularity of darts, like professional golf with Tiger Woods, has tended to rise and fall with the caliber and charisma of the top player. The 1980s, another golden age for the sport, when the BBC and other stations broadcast big tournaments, were dominated by Eric Bristow. Back then, almost all of the fans in attendance were amateur players themselves, said Keith Deller, a former world champion. Currently, the dart world is dominated by Michael van Gerwen, who many consider the best player ever, and who is known to play to the crowd. But even the traditionalists give Mr. Hearn credit as well. “Barry Hearn is the man,” said Mr. van der Voort, “and if he likes it that everybody’s over-celebrating or whatever they do, then everybody’s going to do it.”",The New York Times
2018,Shrewd Short Stories That Merge the Hopeless and the Hopeful,"The Shortlist CATCH, RELEASE By Adrianne Harun 223 pp. Johns Hopkins. Paper, $19.95. In Harun’s new collection, no family is undamaged, and domestic squabbling is the least of it: Adults murder kids, kids murder adults, savage little ones are dumped with far-flung relatives, righteous children abscond and their relieved parents bolt in the opposite direction. In “The Farmhouse Wife,” a man spurns his partner to sleep with a spectral figure, herself an apparent child-killer and husband-poisoner. Police-scanner shorthand for a barbaric discovery gives its title to “Two Girls Off Quarry Road.” Told in poised, often shimmering prose, these tales distress and confound. Harun is alive to the fundamental enigma and mutability of violence. Seldom does she burden herself with articulating either its roots or its evolution. “Lost in the War of the Beautiful Lads” sees a mother attempt to safeguard her daughter by moving to a rustic island, only to realize that “we carry the terrors of civilization within us.” Harun’s resolutions rarely resolve, instead they galvanize into new, uncertain beginnings. “Pink Cloud,” for instance, seems an oversweet depiction of two recovering alcoholics watching the sun descend, until, in the story’s final paragraph, “his eyes flicked toward a kitchen cupboard.” A few stories are insubstantial; one is discordantly political. But the larger, tragic landscape Harun sketches is acutely destabilizing, wonderfully inscrutable and, at moments, ravenously absurd. BETTER TIMES By Sara Batkie 140 pp. University of Nebraska. Paper, $17.95. At first glance, Batkie’s debut collection appears precariously schematic. Women — lonesome, scarred, wobbling — lead each of the nine stories, which are tidily sorted into three sections: past, present and future. Batkie’s writing is equally disciplined, radiating vibrant, if somewhat vacant, charisma like a practiced holiday guest. But that’s before a trio of late stories achieve an alchemical feat, gold-plating the collection’s themes. Metaphors (for alienation, for insatiate desire) are marvelously transformed into the literal; existential fears (of purpose, of worth) mutate devilishly into the corporeal. In “Cleavage,” a spiritually lost woman suffers physical loss from a mastectomy, only to be tormented by her detached breast, “clawing and clinging like a fidgety child.” The 27-year-old in “Lookaftering,” sensing “a strange uncoiling in her stomach, like a snake letting loose from a trick can,” finds she’s laid a clutch of eggs, a manifestation of her insecurities about love and maternity. Batkie’s stories shrewdly commingle the hopeless and the hopeful. Her women, demoralized by the absence of fathers and husbands, by stunted careers and aimless children, are locked in self-doubt and self-flagellation, though rarely do they lose faith in “better times,” even when they’ve had slim experience of them. “I did miss being loved,” one character laments, “if you can miss a feeling you have no proof of ever having.” ITS COLOURS THEY ARE FINE By Alan Spence 258 pp. Canongate. Paper, $16. Through an approach perfected by James Joyce and Sherwood Anderson, Spence’s debut collection, first published in 1977 and newly reissued, surveys a narrow locale to disclose widespread truths. With remarkable precision and emotional weight, these stories depict working-class Glasgow: slummy, rowdy, tribal, drunken, despondent, quixotic and irrepressible. Characters, partitioned into “proddies” and “cathlicks,” are nearly always male, from wily schoolboys who prank their neighbors to desperate teenagers who unleash their discontent at the club. Husbands squander their wages on “the last lingering pint and the chip-shop queue”; old men, clutching flimsy welfare checks, “walk around and fill in the day.” Everything and nothing seems to be shifting. A mother dies, and her son gazes out the window: “It was very ordinary. … The sun shone on the greybrick tenement buildings, on the railings and the tumbledown walls and middens, on the dustbins and the spilled ashes.” Only his imagination locates God in the clouds. Spence achieves his gravelly realism through raw detail (“Listen. The drip and patter of the rain on wet cardboard”) and deft use of the vernacular (“So ah says tae her ah says Margaret ah says”). He trades customary conflicts and epiphanies for documentary snapshots. In the title story, a man goes on a political march, overdrinks, is called a fascist and hurls a bottle into “the terrible darkness.” In “Tinsel,” a boy decorates his tenement for Christmas, and what reflects in his window is a fantasy “he could never enter.” THE DOGS OF DETROIT By Brad Felver 169 pp. University of Pittsburgh. $21.95. Sorrow and confusion have turned the men in Felver’s zero-sum world into animals. Shaken by tragedy and fueled with masculine pride, they aim to heal by inflicting maximum hurt. Felver’s families crack, and those left behind, bereft of compassion, turn diabolical in their pursuit of torture: of others and of themselves. Life is nothing beyond “an untended aggression” concludes the boy in the title story, who, after losing his drug-addled mother, savors envisioning “the worst things possible: toddler coffins, flayed penguins, pipe bombs in convents, napalm in orphanages.” (He settles for executing Detroit’s stray dogs.) Other characters jam screwdrivers underneath fingernails and snap shins in bear traps. According to the narrator of “How to Throw a Punch,” “Once you learn how to do it, you want to do it often.” Felver can be inventive with tone, diction and perspective — and heartbreakingly solemn when he wants to be. Both “The Era of Good Feelings,” in which a high-school history teacher, burying his father, appraises his personal past, and “Hide-and-Seek,” in which estranged brothers collide at an airport bar, coolly dissect woe amid death and regret. But more often “The Dogs of Detroit” proves a shallow riff on an isolated theme. Felver may situate his tales from New York through Ohio up to Montana but their gratuitous savagery homogenizes these settings. Characters are similarly flattened by their penchant for destruction. Lines like “What would we do now, what would we hate now?” become their unthinking refrain.",The New York Times
2018,Shutdown Fight Over Wall Is Likely to Be Delayed Until Just Before Christmas,"WASHINGTON — House lawmakers on Monday filed a two-week stopgap spending bill that would ensure that the government remains fully funded as the nation mourns former President George Bush this week. The measure, which includes funding for the Homeland Security and Interior Departments and other federal agencies, would push a showdown over funding for a wall on the southern border to Dec. 21, just before Christmas. It is expected to be passed by unanimous consent this week, according to people familiar with the talks. President Trump has signaled that he will sign a short-term measure that does not contain wall funding, but has repeatedly threatened to shut down parts of the government if Democrats do not give him the wall money he has demanded. Instead of continuing the debate over money for a wall and border security, Republicans and Democrats spent the weekend negotiating the terms of an agreement that would delay the original Friday deadline. The Senate also postponed votes until late Wednesday while the House canceled all votes until next Monday to accommodate Mr. Bush’s funeral services. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the two Democratic leaders, also asked the president to postpone a scheduled meeting on Tuesday that would have touched upon the spending debate, according to a Democratic aide. The two-week delay means lawmakers have more time to haggle over the presidential push to allocate $5 billion for a border wall. Democrats have steadfastly opposed providing any more than $1.6 billion for border security, and they want no money allocated for a concrete wall on the southern border, which Mr. Trump promised would be financed by Mexico. Republicans have floated the possibility of spreading the $5 billion over two years, an idea that Mr. Schumer rejected. The stopgap measure means that lawmakers — including those who are retiring or being replaced come January — could be forced to remain in Washington at least an extra week while the border wall funding issue is resolved. Negotiations on six of the seven remaining bills are virtually complete and are likely to be packaged together. The seventh funds homeland security. Without an agreement, a shutdown would be limited. Mr. Trump has already signed into law funding measures that cover most of the government, including military, education, health and energy programs. But a partial shutdown would include some high-profile closings for the holiday season, such as national parks. On Monday, the president again attacked Democrats for their aversion to his beloved wall, saying on Twitter that the government “would save Billions of Dollars if the Democrats would give us the votes to build the Wall.”",The New York Times
2018,Shutdown Looms and Priorities Stack Up as Congress Races Toward Session’s End,"WASHINGTON — President Trump and congressional leaders are racing against a deadline next week to avert a partial government shutdown, pushing disputes over the president’s border wall and an array of legislation that touches on everything from Saudi Arabia to farm policy into the waning hours of Republican domination of Congress. The deepest impasse — and the one with the greatest potential to prompt a year-end breakdown — is over Mr. Trump’s demand for $5 billion for a wall on the United States’ southern border. The president has pressed for its inclusion in the final spending package before his party loses its House majority in January, a condition Democratic leaders have refused to accept. Mr. Trump is set to host Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leaders, at the White House on Tuesday for a meeting that will test the new dynamic between a president weakened by midterm election losses and empowered Democrats working to define their party for the era of divided government. Mr. Trump has flirted openly with forcing a government shutdown in a bid to compel Democrats to embrace wall funding. But Democrats have rejected such demands, saying they are willing to consider a much lower sum for border security or pass a measure that would essentially postpone the dispute, extending current spending levels for the Department of Homeland Security for a year. “If President Trump wants to throw a temper tantrum and shut down the government over Christmas over the wall, that’s his decision,” Mr. Schumer said last week. “But there are two sensible options on the table.” Beyond the wall fight and the bare-minimum endeavor of keeping the government fully open, a perennial year-end appetite for legislating has taken hold on Capitol Hill. A Friday deadline to complete business flew by without the faintest public hint of progress, after the death of former President George Bush prompted a rare moment of bipartisanship that had lawmakers push back the deadline to Dec. 21. That only prolonged what appears to be a season of magical thinking in Washington, where members of one of the least productive Congresses in recent memory seem convinced they can accomplish a variety of lofty goals that have eluded them in the previous two years. Among the hopes for the next two weeks are completion of a sweeping farm bill; a vote on a measure to punish Saudi Arabia for the killing of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi; a bill to protect the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III; and a criminal justice bill with bipartisan support. Lawmakers do expect to extend the federal flood insurance program, overhaul the way Congress deals with sexual harassment in its own offices and potentially even pass major tax and pension changes. And as calendar days wane, hopes are rising that major legislation will find a home in the must-pass final spending package and sweep through to the president’s desk. “The majority leader’s strategy is to pack everything in against the Christmas holidays as closely as he can so that there’s minimum fuss, and then try to put together a package that will get the votes to pass, and you just throw everything you can into it and put nothing that you can’t into it,” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island. “The last gasp of Republican monopoly control, I don’t think they want to be a Christmas shutdown. That just sends such an appalling message, so I think that gets solved.” Aides are tossing around metaphors to describe the means by which other bills could find their way into the spending package. The last train leaving the station. Final ornaments on the Christmas tree. “A big slumgullion of legislation,” Mr. Whitehouse offered. Some measures have better chances than others. As momentum appeared to be evaporating last week to pass the criminal justice bill, it received a lift on Friday, when Mr. Trump pressured Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader who has resisted scheduling it for a vote, to “Go for it Mitch!” Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a prominent Republican holdout, also endorsed the measure, bolstering proponents’ argument that the bill has substantial enough support to pass. Senators are also poised this week to take action on a resolution to cut off American support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, a rebuke to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia for the killing of Mr. Khashoggi and to Mr. Trump for failing to hold him responsible for it. While there is substantial bipartisan support for the move in the Senate, it faces a roadblock in the House, and Mr. Trump would likely veto it. And it is not clear whether the measure or other proposals to punish Saudi Arabia — by imposing sanctions or a weapons ban, or condemning the crown prince directly — could be attached to the spending legislation. “The fewer things we put on the approps bills, the better chance of passing,” Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the Republican chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, told reporters last week. “I’d rather deal with appropriations, for the most part, and keep legislation off anywhere I can.” Five out of the 12 annual spending bills have already been passed, leaving seven to complete by Dec. 21, though those are expected to be rolled into one package. Negotiations over the Homeland Security bill, the most contentious of the group, have essentially paused as both chambers wait to see the outcome of the Tuesday meeting between Mr. Trump, Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer. “It’s an important meeting,” Mr. Shelby said. “From my view of the negotiations, they’re holding this up right now, that is, what the president wants and what they want.” Before the Tuesday meeting, lawmakers are left to express “cautious optimism” that every major piece of legislation will get done before the new deadline. “We are very close,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a Democrat who helped write legislation that would overhaul how Congress handles sexual harassment. “We’re working on it every day.” Mr. McConnell had said there was not enough time to complete the criminal justice bill, which would unwind some federal tough-on-crime policies. But time for additional spending negotiations has opened more possibilities. “My goal is to put it on the end-of-year spending bill,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said of the criminal justice measure. “We just added another week,” said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware. “Ta-da! Time for the Mueller bill to get a vote, time for criminal justice reform to pass.” Asked if any of that was likely, Mr. Coons shrugged, ducked into an elevator in the Capitol and said: “It should! No idea if it will.” If not, a partial shutdown could be in the offing. Or lawmakers could decide to trade legislative haggling for family holiday time and punt their disputes for another day, agreeing to temporary funding bills known as continuing resolutions — or C.R.s — to keep the government open into 2019. “It may evaporate,” Mr. Whitehouse said, “down to nothing but C.R.s.”",The New York Times
2018,Shutdown Might Not Have Much Immediate Impact on the Economy,"WASHINGTON — A partial shutdown of the federal government, which began early Saturday, is unlikely to make much of an immediate dent in the growth of the United States economy, but it could make life more difficult for millions of Americans in ways both big and small. The shutdown could also contribute to the growing sense of worry on Wall Street, in part by raising fears about the ability of Congress to manage a more consequential deadline: the need to authorize an increase in government borrowing before the federal debt reaches the current limit, most likely in March. President Trump appeared unfazed by an economic threat his critics contend is of his own making and that he initially said he would “own.” “We are totally prepared for a very long shut down,” Mr. Trump said on Friday, as he continued to insist he would veto any government funding bill that did not include money to build a wall along the border with Mexico. The direct economic consequences of the shutdown are modest in the aggregate. Congress has already approved funding for roughly three-quarters of the federal government, which will not be affected. Standard & Poor’s, the credit rating firm, estimates that shutting down the remainder could shave $1.2 billion off gross domestic product each week the government is closed. That is a very small fraction of the nation’s annual economic output, which will be around $20 trillion this year. But it could inflict pain on as many as 500,000 government employees, who could be temporarily out of work during the holiday season. Those who live paycheck to paycheck or had been waiting to amass more funds before paying large bills could face a difficult choice between spending less and borrowing more. Before the shutdown began, businesses around Washington that cater to government employees were bracing for the worst and tiring of the annual shutdown theatrics that tend to occur around Christmas. “It costs billions of dollars every time they do this, not to mention the impact on consumer confidence every time they threaten to do this,” said Mike Brey, the owner of two Hobby Works shops in Maryland. Mr. Brey, who is also a member of the Small Business Majority, an advocacy group, said that after a bustling Black Friday last month he had sensed that holiday shoppers were feeling anxious about the swooning stock market and the prospect of a shutdown. “There are two things we don’t want or need this time of year,” he said. “Ice storms and consumers worried about whether they’re going to be getting their paychecks.” Past government shutdowns have also caused scattershot disruptions to the broader economy. The most recent prolonged shutdown, in October 2013, lasted 16 days. Some people’s lives were largely unaffected. Others were significantly inconvenienced. The beginning of the Alaskan crab-fishing season was delayed by four days, a significant setback for the region’s fishing fleet. Head Start centers serving 6,300 children closed for up to nine days. Four Nobel Prize-winning scientists were forced to shutter their government research laboratories for the duration. Economic analysts subsequently concluded that the shutdown caused a measurable loss of economic activity in the fourth quarter of 2013. Several analysts estimated the reduction in annual economic growth at around 0.1 percentage points, costing the nation $24 billion. An earlier pair of shutdowns also caused disruptions. From November 1995 to January 1996, parts of the government were closed for a total of 26 days. The government stopped processing requests for tourist visas, costing airlines millions of dollars in lost revenue. The courts suspended work on 3,500 bankruptcy cases, leaving financial lives in limbo. The National Park Service estimated that seven million people were forced to postpone or forgo visits to a national park. Although the government experienced two shutdowns earlier this year, S&P notes that such a closing could be more precarious this time around because the fiscal stimulus of the $1.5 trillion tax cuts that Congress passed last year is starting to fade. The White House is so far portraying a sense of calm. Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview on Friday that the effect of a brief shutdown would most likely represent a “rounding error” on fourth-quarter economic growth, which he projects to be near 3 percent. Mr. Hassett, who spent part of his Friday digging through data about previous shutdowns, said that the longer-term effects on federal workers would be minimal because those workers would almost certainly be repaid. After past shutdowns, Congress has voted to pay federal workers for the hours they did not work, and it could do so again. Mr. Hassett also said he was unconvinced by studies that showed a significant spillover effect of a government shutdown into the private sector. “There have been many negotiations like this in the past, and we’ve looked back at the way they’ve been covered, and it looks like people were much more hysterical about what might happen than what in retrospect would have been logical,” he said. But the shutdown over funding for a border wall could indicate rough times ahead in Washington. Republicans now hold majorities in both chambers of Congress, but the difficulty of passing legislation could increase next year when Democrats take control of the House. Among the most consequential fights will be over the statutory debt limit, which Congress extended to March 2. Emergency measures to reduce the need for borrowing could allow the administration to extend the deadline until the summer, but no longer. Since Republicans used the debt limit to extract concessions from President Barack Obama, some analysts predict that Democrats could try to use it as leverage with Mr. Trump. A standoff over the debt limit has the potential to be more calamitous than the clash over funding the government because of the potentially catastrophic consequences of the United States defaulting on its obligations. A shutdown “portends a difficult set of negotiations going into the debt ceiling, which can be much more problematic than a shutdown for the faith and credit of the United States economy,” Christopher Campbell, a former assistant secretary for financial institutions at the Treasury Department who left this year, said on Friday.",The New York Times
2018,"Shutdown, E.P.A., Syria: Your Friday Evening Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump threatened to close the southern border and cut off aid to countries in Central America if Congress refuses to fund a wall. The president’s threats came on the seventh day of a partial shutdown that has affected up to 800,000 government workers. Congress is not scheduled to take up the debate until after the new year. “We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall,” Mr. Trump tweeted. Above, at the border near Tijuana, Mexico. In another tweet, he reiterated his threat to cut off aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, countries he claimed “are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money.” But Democrats stood firm against Mr. Trump’s demand for $5 billion to pay for a border wall, according to a spokesman for Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California and the incoming House speaker. “Democrats are united against the President’s immoral, ineffective and expensive wall, the wall that he specifically promised that Mexico would pay for,” he said. _____ 2. The E.P.A. proposed new rules for assessing pollution that would make it easier for power plants to release more mercury and other toxic substances. The new rules would roll back limits on coal plant emissions of mercury and other pollutants that have been linked to developmental disorders and respiratory illnesses. Scientists have said mercury pollution from power plants has declined more than 80 percent nationwide since restrictions went into effect in 2011. Above, a power plant in Sydney, Mont. The plan could change the way regulations are written in the future by disregarding the health benefits of reducing pollution. _____ 3. “Broken promises — that’s all you get from the school.” At Wolf Point High School in eastern Montana, and across the U.S., a fragmented education system is failing Native Americans. In a collaboration with ProPublica, Times journalists examined a wealth of rarely tapped data to document their plight. Native students post some of the worst academic outcomes of any demographic group, exacerbated by decades of discrimination, according to federal reports. In public schools, white students are twice as likely as Native students to take at least one advanced placement course, and Native students are more than twice as likely to be suspended, according to our analysis. Above, in Wolf Point. Native students also score lower than nearly all other demographic groups on national tests, and only 72 percent of Native students graduate, the lowest of any demographic group. _____ 4. The withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria could trigger a scramble between Turkey, the Kurds, the Syrian government, Russia and Iran for control of the country’s east, our Middle East correspondent writes. Syria’s Kurdish militia has called on President Bashar al-Assad’s government to send forces to protect it against a possible attack by Turkey. That is the first sign of shifting political alliances in eastern Syria since President Trump announced that he would withdraw American troops. Above, Turkish-backed fighters near Manbij, Syria. At issue is the region in the country’s north and east that the U.S., in partnership with local Kurdish-led militias, took from the Islamic State. That put about one-quarter of Syria’s territory under the control of those militias, supported by about 2,000 American soldiers. _____ 5.

Tesla is scrambling to sell cars before the end of the year. Demand for the company’s electric cars could weaken next month, when a $7,500 federal tax credit is cut in half for buyers of Tesla’s luxury models. The phaseout may not influence current buyers of the company’s vehicles, above, which start at nearly $50,000. But it could hurt Tesla’s ability to reach a broader market.

One economic indicator in China: underwear. By almost any measure, the Chinese economy is slowing. The country’s stock market has lost a quarter of its value this year, and Xi Jinping, its top leader, is navigating a protracted trade war with the U.S. But a tabloid controlled by the Communist Party found encouragement in an uptick in sales of boxers and briefs in Liaoning Province, above, an industrial region that epitomizes many of the country’s economic problems. Cheered by the prospect of a brighter future, the article argued, Liaoning men are upgrading a part of their wardrobe that most of their friends and family will never see. Economists remain skeptical. “The only relevant context here,” one told us, “is that China’s economy is slowing markedly and official media have been ordered to smear the pig with lipstick.” _____ 8. New Yorkers were mostly unruffled after the night sky suddenly turned electric blue. It wasn’t aliens, terrorists or Russian hackers, officials said. The strange effect, above, visible across the city on Thursday night, was due to an electrical transformer explosion in Queens. The bizarre illumination was sparked by an “electric arc flash” tied to faulty equipment at a Con Edison substation, a spokesman said. Electricity outages caused by the incident were resolved by Friday morning. But more than a few “Ghostbusters” references, “Transformers” jokes and mentions of superpowers were circulating about the phenomenon that came to be known as Astoria Borealis. _____ 9. We uncovered the secrets of the Confetti Crew. More than a million revelers are expected in Times Square on New Year’s Eve, and all of them can expect to be covered in bits of the 3,000 pounds of confetti that will begin to flutter 20 seconds before midnight. So who makes it happen? Planning starts a year ahead, we found, when volunteers are named to a Confetti Crew. Sometime after Christmas, they deliver truckloads of confetti in unmarked 45-pound boxes to Times Square buildings. Volunteers undergo rigorous training in confetti dispersal. If they do it correctly, an organizer told us, their arms should be sore by the end of the night: “It’s a very violent act.” Separately, we chatted with the master artisan who maintains the Times Square ball.

2018,"Shutdown, Elizabeth Warren, Happy New Year: Your Monday Evening Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The ninth day of the federal government’s partial shutdown brought us no closer to an end to the impasse that has affected 800,000 federal workers and shuttered parts of nine cabinet-level departments. President Trump has repeatedly called allies to reassure them that he will not back away from the promise of a border wall he’s made in rally after rally — though his outgoing chief of staff, John Kelly, said in an interview published Sunday that the administration had backed away from the idea of a solid concrete wall long ago. Above, the Capitol. Democrats were preparing to pass a bill to fund the parts of the government that are not part of the Department of Homeland Security. The House is expected to vote on the package of six bills on Thursday, after the new Congress convenes with Democrats in control and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California is sworn in as speaker. _____ 2. The 2020 presidential race gets into gear. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is the first major candidate to enter what is likely to be a crowded Democratic primary race. The winner will challenge President Trump in 2020. “The problem we’ve got right now in Washington is that it works great for those who’ve got money to buy influence, and I’m fighting against that,” Ms. Warren said in a statement outside her home, above, where she was joined by her husband and their dog. Our video team compiled a blow-by-blow history of the fractious relationship between Ms. Warren and Mr. Trump. Even though the earliest voting is 13 months away, Julián Castro, the former federal housing secretary and San Antonio mayor, also formed exploratory committees this month. Several more candidates are expected to declare in coming weeks. They’re all roughly on schedule, our politics team says. _____ 3. An American was detained in Moscow on espionage charges, adding to tensions between Moscow and Washington over the issues of election hacking and influence peddling. Just a few weeks ago, a Russian, Maria Butina, above, admitted to being involved in an effort backed by Russian officials to lobby influential Americans in the National Rifle Association and the Republican Party. The American, identified by Russian officials as Paul Nicholas Whelan, was taken into custody “during an act of espionage,” according to a statement. ____ 4. A milestone in space exploration. At 12:33 a.m. Eastern, NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft will pass within about 2,200 miles of a mysterious icy world called Ultima Thule. It’s believed to be a pristine fragment from the earliest days of the solar system, and it will be the most distant object ever visited by a spacecraft. If you’re up, coverage of the flyby will be broadcast on the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics lab’s website and YouTube channel as well as NASA TV. On Twitter, updates will appear on @NewHorizons2015 and @NASANewHorizons. Above, an artist’s rendering of the flyby. Also, our science team put together a list of the coming year’s major meteor showers. _____ 5. Driverless cars are coming under attack. Autonomous vehicles have been attacked nearly two dozen times over the past two years in Chandler, Ariz., a city near Phoenix where one company, Waymo, started testing its vans in 2017. Above, a Waymo van crossing an intersection. People have pelted the vans with rocks and tried to run them off the road. One man waved a gun at a vehicle and the emergency backup driver inside. Some analysts say they expect more such confrontations, given the potential for self-driving cars to eliminate jobs and otherwise change society. “There’s a growing sense that the giant corporations honing driverless technologies do not have our best interests at heart,” one expert told us. _____ 6. It’s tough to be an oyster in the Balkans. Salt from the sea, fresh water from the rivers and rich phytoplankton on the seafloor give local oysters a crisp, balanced flavor, prized since Roman times. But thousands of hydropower plants are being built in the Balkans, and some of Europe’s last wild rivers are being dammed. Some oyster farmers worry that the region’s deep ethnic tensions might cloud decision-making on dam sites that could ruin their ecosystem. Above, shucking the harvest in Croatia. “Oysters know nothing of nationalities or ethnicities,” a Croat who owns seafood restaurants told us. “But politicians?

2018,"Shutdown, Jim Mattis, Winter Solstice: Your Friday Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning, We’re following the aftermath of an extraordinary day in Washington, including an impending government shutdown and the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. We’re also covering the reopening of Gatwick Airport near London this morning. President Trump warned today that a partial government shutdown “will last for a very long time,” seeking to blame Democrats for a potential funding lapse that he said last week he would proudly own. On Thursday, Mr. Trump refused to sign a stopgap measure to avert a shutdown, saying that any spending bill must include $5 billion for a wall on the southwestern border. Without a deal, a partial shutdown would begin at midnight tonight. House Republicans approved a version of the bill on Thursday night that included money for the wall, but it’s almost certain to fail in the Senate today. Why it matters: If funding expires, nine government departments — including Homeland Security and the Justice and State Departments — would close, and more than 420,000 federal employees would have to work without pay. Here’s what else to expect. The Daily: On today’s episode, our deputy Washington editor explains the showdown. A day after President Trump said he would withdraw American troops from Syria, Jim Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, said he would leave the Pentagon in February. In his resignation letter, Mr. Mattis condemned Mr. Trump’s rejection of international alliances and emphasized the importance of challenging Russia and China, which he wrote wanted “a world consistent with their authoritarian model.” Read his letter. International reaction: America’s allies in Europe and Asia indicated today that Mr. Mattis’s resignation and U.S. troop withdrawals would be watershed moments in Washington’s relations with the world. News analysis: The Syria withdrawal is one of several announcements this week that demonstrate Mr. Trump’s “unswerving conviction that his political survival depends on securing his conservative base,” one of our White House correspondents writes. Catch up: Mr. Mattis is the third member of Mr. Trump’s cabinet to resign or be forced out in less than two weeks. Here’s a look at the turnover at the top of the administration. President Trump’s decision to bring home the 2,000 American troops in Syria clears the way for Iran to expand its influence in the region and leaves Israel isolated. President Vladimir Putin of Russia praised Mr. Trump on Thursday, saying, “Donald’s right, and I agree with him.” Moscow and Washington have supported opposite sides in the Syrian war. The reaction: America’s Kurdish allies in Syria were upset by the decision and are said to be discussing the release of 3,200 Islamic State prisoners. Closer look: We examine the winners and losers from an American withdrawal. Notable: At the same time Mr. Trump made the decision about Syria, he also decided to withdraw about half of the 14,000 troops stationed in Afghanistan, two defense officials said. Matthew Whitaker, who was named acting attorney general last month, has cleared himself to supervise the investigation by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, according to a letter the Justice Department sent to Senate leaders. Ethics specialists at the department had recommended that Mr. Whitaker recuse himself from the investigation into Russian election interference, as his predecessor Jeff Sessions had done. The news came soon after the disclosure that President Trump’s nominee for attorney general, William Barr, had written a memo in June criticizing Mr. Mueller for focusing on whether Mr. Trump had committed obstruction of justice. Read: The letter about Mr. Whitaker and Mr. Barr’s memo. Why it matters: The developments raise questions about Mr. Mueller’s ability to complete his work without interference. The country’s leading provider of reproductive services is among several employers that champion women but face accusations of discriminating against their pregnant workers, a Times investigation has found. In interviews and legal documents, women described discrimination that violated federal or state laws, such as managers considering pregnancy in hiring decisions or denying breaks recommended by doctors. Response: “We must do better than we are now,” Dr. Leana Wen, the president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said. “It’s our obligation to do better, for our staff, for their families and for our patients.” Why are opioids so compelling? Overdoses have overtaken car crashes and gun violence to become the leading cause of death for Americans under 55. To understand what goes through the minds and bodies of opioid users, we spent months interviewing users, family members and addiction experts. This is a visual representation of what we learned. London airport reopens: Flights resumed at Gatwick Airport this morning, nearly 36 hours after drones first flew over its runway. At least 800 flights were canceled, disrupting traffic across Europe and affecting 120,000 passengers. Food stamp limits: The Trump administration said it would impose more stringent work requirements for adults who rely on food stamps. Critics said it was circumventing Congress to do so. U.S. systems infiltrated: The Justice Department accused two Chinese citizens of hacking into corporate and government computer systems. Juul deal: The tobacco giant Altria, which makes Marlboro and other top-selling cigarettes, has agreed to pay nearly $13 billion for a 35 percent stake in Juul Labs, the popular vaping company. Uber’s self-driving cars: The company said its autonomous vehicles were back on public roads, nine months after one killed a pedestrian in Arizona.

Jennifer Steinhauer, a Washington correspondent, says it’s “like a greatest hits of 2018 media themes — aggressive fact-checking, rural mythology, the search for the ‘truth’ of the Trump voter, global disinformation — wrapped in an amusing, point-by-point take down of a Der Spiegel chronicle of life in a small American town.

Some of us earthlings may grumble about the darkness. But without it, we might not be alive. Seasons occur because most planets do not spin perfectly upright. The earth’s “axial tilt” is a jaunty 23.5 degrees, for example, while Uranus spins at 98 degrees. The earth’s tilt is good for humans because it helps to moderate our sun exposure. Our four seasons are comparatively mild and, thanks to our proximity to the sun, fairly brief. Much of Uranus, by contrast, spends winters in permanent darkness and summers under constant sunlight. And those seasons last decades in Earth years. “If there were creatures on Uranus — and I don’t think there are — seasonal affective disorder would be a lifetime thing,” the planetary scientist Heidi Hammel told The Times.

2018,"Shutdown, Markets, Facebook: Your Thursday Evening Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The partial shutdown of the federal government will run into the new year. Outgoing House Republicans informed lawmakers there will be no votes Friday or Monday, and no relief for the 800,000 federal workers who are either furloughed or working without pay. House Democrats, who assume control next Thursday, are weighing three approaches to getting federal funds flowing, none of which would include $5 billion for President Trump’s demand for a wall on the southern border. Above, near Santa Teresa, N.M. Here’s how the shutdown affects federal departments. _____ 2. President Trump’s $1.5 trillion in tax cuts went into effect one year ago. What happened? Our reporter covering economic and tax policy takes stock of what companies promised, and what has come to pass. Some workers reaped rewards from the law, he found, as companies followed through on promises to raise wages and pay bonuses. Above, Walmart employees in Houston. But other firms announced layoffs, despite reporting higher profits and billions of dollars in tax savings. _____ 3. There was a shake-up in Saudi Arabia’s government. The nation’s ruler, King Salman, right, named new ministers and security chiefs. But power remains firmly in the hands of his son and designated heir, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, left. Saudi Arabia and the crown prince have been under international scrutiny since October, when Saudi agents killed and dismembered the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi inside the country’s consulate in Istanbul. Western intelligence agencies have concluded that Prince Mohammed knew about and most likely ordered the plot to kill Mr. Khashoggi. And the crown prince has directed the Saudi military campaign in Yemen that has contributed to a humanitarian crisis and drawn growing opposition in the West. Separately, rioters stormed an Ebola triage center in eastern Congo in a new wave of violent protests, aggravated by delays in an election scheduled for Sunday. _____ 4. Wall Street’s roller-coaster ride continued, with stocks staging a late-day recovery after an earlier decline. There were mixed signals about the U.S. economy’s health: Weekly jobless claims were lower, a positive sign, but the monthly consumer confidence index hit a five-month low. Above, outside the New York Stock Exchange. Trading volume was lower than normal as a result of the holiday week, but one expert cautioned against playing down this week’s swings. “This is driven by rising uncertainty about the fundamentals: earnings, the economy and interest rates,” he said. _____ 5. How does Facebook monitor billions of posts per day? The company, which makes about $5 billion in profit per quarter, says it is doing everything it can to get rid of posts that sow social division and even violence. But it must also continue to attract more users from more countries and try to keep them on the site longer to maintain the endless expansion that is core to its business. The company’s solution: a network of low-skilled moderators using a maze of PowerPoint slides spelling out what’s forbidden. Above, in Berlin. Our review of the company’s rule books revealed gaps, biases and outright errors. As Facebook employees search for the right answers, we found, they have allowed extremist language to flourish in some countries while censoring mainstream speech in others. _____ 6. Cosmetology students are tangled up in debt. For-profit cosmetology schools use state governments to keep training requirements high — then benefit from students’ uncompensated work in their salons. In visits to a dozen salons and in conversations with former cosmetology students, we heard a variety of opinions about how much training the profession requires and the financial returns it offers. And we heard again and again how the dream of becoming a professional hairstylist, or someday owning a salon, can be stymied by debt. Above, Tracy Lozano still owes more than $8,000, 13 years after graduating. “I’ll be paying it off for the rest of my life,” said one graduate, whose student debt has ballooned to $29,000. _____ 7. Only one house was left on its block. The devastating Camp Fire last month was the worst wildfire in California’s history and nearly consumed the entire town of Paradise, population 26,000. One resident’s home, above, narrowly escaped the fire, and now it’s one of the few structures left standing as residents return, after weeks of waiting, to assess what remains. In maps and images, our journalists survey the swath of devastation and the daunting task of recovery. “Paradise deserves to be rebuilt and maybe even better than it was before,” one resident told us. _____ 8. “It’s not Mayberry, but there’s a lot of opportunity.” The mayor of Fergus Falls, Minn., was among residents upset by an article in a respected German newsmagazine that portrayed the city as a backward, racist place whose residents blindly supported President Trump. In a damning point-by-point rebuttal, residents proved that the article was a fabrication. And before long the reporter was exposed and fired for fabricating the story — and many others, on multiple continents. Another Der Spiegel reporter visited Minnesota in recent days to set the record straight. He found that residents seemed unwilling to hold a grudge. Fergus Falls, he said, might be “the most forgiving city in the Western Hemisphere.” “We’re taking the high road,” the mayor said. “We’ve moved on.” _____ 9. A celebrity duck. Yanny vs. Laurel. The outsize steer named Knickers. Outrage, arguing, depressing news and other bad things were easy to find on the internet this year. Our writer decided to celebrate some of the exceptions. Here five shining internet moments (and some runners-up) of 2018. _____ 10. Finally, a 71-year-old Frenchman who has crossed the Atlantic four times in a sailboat has found a new way to try to conquer the ocean: in a barrel, above. He describes his venture, which is predicted to take three months, as a “crossing during which man isn’t captain of his ship, but a passenger of the ocean.” Have a buoyant evening.

2018,"Shutdown, Mattis, Markets: Your Friday Evening Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. The Evening Briefing is taking a couple of days off next week. We’ll return on Wednesday. Now, back to the news. Here’s the latest. 1. What’s going on in Washington? Senators and White House officials were scrambling to cut a deal to avert a partial government shutdown as a midnight deadline approached. Last week, President Trump proudly took ownership of a shutdown, saying that any spending bill must include $5 billion for a wall on the southern border. But he reversed his rhetoric today, blaming Democrats and warning that a shutdown “will last for a very long time.” The deadline for lawmakers is imminent: At midnight, funding runs out for several federal agencies, including the Agriculture, Commerce and Homeland Security Departments. Here’s where things stand and how we got here. Above, the Capitol. At the heart of this battle is the wall that Mr. Trump promised during the campaign. Nearly two years into his presidency, there’s no wall — but his supporters still want it, and his re-election could be at stake. If funding does expire tonight, here’s what to expect. We’re following the latest developments and linking to our detailed coverage here. _____ 2. Fallout continues after a national security shake-up. President Trump is dealing with the aftermath of the resignation of Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, who delivered a stinging rebuke of Mr. Trump’s worldview in his resignation letter. The president also faces alarm over his decisions to pull American forces out of Syria and to withdraw roughly 7,000 troops from Afghanistan. Mr. Trump seems intent on assembling a team of advisers who will embrace a vision for the U.S. that includes bolstering the military but leaving international alliances to wither — the unfiltered version of “America First” foreign policy. Above, at a NATO summit in Brussels last summer. _____ 3. On Wall Street, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index closed down more than 20 percent from its August peak, meaning it has officially entered a bear market. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average, both of which also include the biggest tech companies, are not far behind. Bear markets in stocks are rare but have the power to spread gloom through the economy. Above, the New York Stock Exchange. The market’s most recent swoon began on Wednesday after the Fed signaled it planned to keep raising interest rates next year, citing the strength of the economy. _____ 4. The Supreme Court refused to revive a Trump administration effort to bar migrants who enter the country illegally from seeking asylum. Last month, President Trump issued a proclamation requiring asylum requests to be made at legal checkpoints. But lower courts blocked the initiative, ruling that federal law plainly allowed applications from people who had entered the country unlawfully. The president lashed out at the first ruling and the judge who made it, prompting a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts. The administration then urged the Supreme Court to stay the ruling. But Chief Justice Roberts joined the four-member liberal wing of the court in turning down the administration’s request. Separately, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 85, above, underwent surgery to remove two malignant nodules from her left lung, according to a Supreme Court spokeswoman. There was no evidence of any remaining disease, she added, and Justice Ginsburg is expected to remain in the hospital for a few days. _____ 5. Mexico’s new leader, barely three weeks in office, has been racing to upset the status quo. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, above, has championed a new law to cut the highest government salaries and raise the lowest ones. He’s proposed expanding social programs that benefit the poor and marginalized, whom he has declared are his primary concern. And in a move replete with symbolism, he turned the official presidential residence into a cultural center and opened it to the public — on the day of his inauguration. As a candidate, he promised a revolution. So has it begun? _____ 6. “Hand yourself over to human justice, and prepare for divine justice.” In a speech at the Vatican, Pope Francis, above, called on clerics who sexually abuse minors to turn themselves in, saying that the Roman Catholic Church would remove priests who prey on their flock. Priests who misuse their position of authority, he said, discredit the church, which has been “buffeted by strong winds and tempests” this year. The pope has spoken out in increasingly forceful tones against abuse. But victims and their supporters contend that he has taken little concrete action. In commanding child molesters to turn themselves in, said one advocate for victims, the pope is misguided. “He’s pretending that sick men can suddenly see the light.” _____ 7. Earthrise. While scouting landing spots on the moon on Christmas Eve, 1968, the astronauts of NASA’s Apollo 8 mission — Frank Borman, William Anders and James Lovell Jr. — spied our shiny blue planet rising over the ash-colored lunar mountains. Major Anders snapped a photo, above, that went on to capture the imagination of the world. Sent to examine the Moon, he later said, humans instead discovered Earth. _____ 8. The tortilla is in crisis. In Mexico, the classic staple is under pressure from mass production and modernity. Consumption is down as Mexicans eat more bread and fast food. But small producers are pushing back. Above, near Puebla, Mexico. A traditional tortilla is made from scratch, through a process known as nixtamalization. Dried corn is cooked in water with calcium hydroxide and left to soak overnight. This unlocks nutrients, and makes the tortilla a valuable source of vitamins, minerals and protein. Minimally processed corn is more nutritious and makes for a better tasting tortilla, one expert told us. “For the last 50 years,” he said, “people don’t know how corn tastes in the city.” _____ 9. It shines. It shimmers. It frosts store windows and amps up a manicure. It is aluminum metalized polyethylene terephthalate — in a word, glitter. Humans are drawn to shiny things, some researchers say, from an innate need to seek out fresh water. So how did we get from there to Glitterex, the industry leader in glitter-making technology? Above, ready for packaging. Our writer takes a factory tour to learn more, and encounters “neon sparkles so pink you have only seen them in dreams, and rainbow hues that were simultaneously lilac and mint and all the colors of a fire.” Follow her deeper on her strange journey. _____ 10. Finally, this is your periodic reminder that it’s not all bad news out there. A bright green “Christmas comet” will be in the night sky all next week. Pediatricians have officially endorsed traditional toys over digital ones. And Cole Porter’s 111-year-old Steinway piano, above, is getting a tuneup. This is the Week in Good News. Have a merry and bright holiday. See you next Wednesday. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern. And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing.

2018,"Shutdown, McKinsey, Gaza: Your Monday Briefing","Let us help you start your day. Good morning. We’ll be off for the New Year’s holiday. See you on Jan. 3. Now, back to the news. President Trump digs in on the U.S. government shutdown, Macedonia’s former prime minister flees, and the British Foreign Office gets some funny phone calls. Here’s the latest: Entering the second week of a partial government shutdown, President Trump is digging in on his demands over funding for a border wall. The president has repeatedly called allies, reassuring them that he will not yield on his request for $5 billion in funding for the wall. But he has not reached out to Democrats, whose votes he needs for a deal. And the 800,000 federal workers affected by the shutdown are getting nervous. This week: Democrats are preparing to pass a bill to fund the government as soon as they take control of the House on Thursday. Even Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, was optimistic. “At the end of the day, there’s a deal to be had,” he said on Sunday. “We need to start talking again.” Wall details: The outgoing chief of staff, John Kelly, said the idea of a concrete wall was abandoned long ago. Mr. Trump campaigned on his insistence for a fixed wall, not the “steel slat barrier” he has pivoted toward in the past few weeks. McKinsey, the world's most prestigious consulting firm, is caught up in a high-profile extradition case involving a Ukrainian billionaire, the Austrian government and the U.S. Boeing asked McKinsey to evaluate a lucrative proposal to mine titanium in India through a foreign partnership financed by the Ukranian oligarch Dmitry Firtash. Attached to the evaluation was a single PowerPoint slide that described Boeing’s potential partner’s strategy of bribing Indian officials for permits. Now that slide, known as Exhibit A, is the key evidence in Mr. Firtash’s extradition to the U.S., where he has been charged with bribing Indian officials in anticipation of getting titanium for Boeing. What’s at stake: The case exposes what McKinsey and other American consulting firms risk as they conduct business in countries where ethical standards do not meet those at home. A former Macedonian prime minister, Nikola Gruevski, was preparing to enter prison on a corruption conviction when he vanished. Now the far-right Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, is accused of helping him escape. The Hungarian government said it only helped him after he left Macedonian borders. So why did he meet Hungarian diplomats before he left? Interviews with Macedonian state officials suggest a more complex story. Go deeper: Macedonia is trying to join NATO and the European Union — efforts that Russia is trying to block — and Mr. Orban’s alleged interference could send the Balkan’s fragile politics even deeper into limbo. When an Israeli soldier shot into a crowd and killed Rouzan al-Najjar, a volunteer medic, Palestinians called it murder. Israel called it an accident. Our investigation shows the truth is more complicated. How we know: We analyzed over 1,000 photos and videos, froze the fatal moment in a 3-D model of the protest, and interviewed more than 30 witnesses and I.D.F. commanders to reveal how Ms. Najjar was killed. The takeaway: Ms. Najjar’s death was an illustration of the cost of Israel’s use of battlefield weapons to control the protests, and how each side is locked in an unending cycle. European Union: With Brexit looming, the Romanian government has turned to Euroskeptic rhetoric ahead of its turn in the presidency of the bloc. Congo: A long-delayed vote to replace President Joseph Kabila in the Democratic Republic of Congo was deeply flawed, but no widespread violence was reported. Nissan: Carlos Ghosn saved the Japanese car company from ruin, but it was his own downfall that caught everyone off guard. Our reporters look at his rise and fall. Novy God: The Russian New Year has become a way to gauge Israeli acceptance of Russian immigrants, many of whom feel they constantly have to prove their Jewishness. Space: NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft will visit a tiny object, four billion miles from the sun, in the Kuiper Belt to look for clues about the formation of our cosmic neighborhood. Munich: Is the German city steeped in tradition becoming cool? Munich’s growing night life and cultural scene could give Berlin a run for its money. Stalin’s Russia: Muscovites once came to gawk in droves, but most of Moscow’s so-called Stalin high-rises are now in desperate need of renovation. Who will foot the bill is still up in the air. Classics: Works by Marcel Proust, Willa Cather, D.H. Lawrence, Agatha Christie and Robert Frost are entering the public domain on Jan. 1. And there are more on the way. Critic’s Notebook: What’s it like to be a female movie critic in the #MeToo era? For Manohla Dargis, a Times film critic, sexism is much harder to glide over. It “demands moral outrage too,” she writes. Long-Distance Callers: The British Foreign Office released a list of some of the odd phone requests it received in 2018. Like the caller inquiring about vampires in Poland, “because a woman he met online asked what blood type he was before they met for their first date.” Tips for a more fulfilling life. Recipe of the day: Radicchio, Gorgonzola and hazelnuts combine in this hearty vegetarian pasta. Mixing great cocktails at home is easier than you think. Make tech work for you in the new year. The new year will arrive in a wave around the world, beginning on several Pacific islands including Samoa. Three hours later, the new year will begin in Sydney, Australia. Hong Kong and Beijing will enter 2019 after six hours, Moscow after 11, Paris after 13 and London after 14. After 19 hours, 2019 will begin in New York, where hundreds of thousands of revelers will gather in Times Square — one of the world’s brightest outdoor spaces, with a long history of neon lights and signs. The famous ball that drops at midnight is lit by 32,256 L.E.D.s, or light-emitting diodes. L.E.D.s maximize their efficiency by emitting their light in one direction, as opposed to older sources, which push out light and heat everywhere. In the mid-1980s, when redesigning Times Square was a battle against urban blight and crime, minimum levels of brightness became a part of zoning code. With it, a new type of measurement was introduced: the LUTS, for Light Unit Times Square. Tessa Bangs wrote today’s Back Story. Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings.

2018,"Shutdown, New York Sky, ‘Bandersnatch’: Your Friday Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning, We start today with the continuing government shutdown and an inside look at how Facebook monitors its users’ posts. And it’s Friday, so there’s also a new news quiz. The spending impasse over President Trump’s border wall will await Democrats as soon as they assume control of the House next week, after hopes for resolving the partial government shutdown by the new year ended on Thursday. The Democrats and their likely speaker, Representative Nancy Pelosi, are considering three options to end the shutdown, which has affected about a quarter of the federal government. None of those options include the $5 billion that Mr. Trump has demanded for the wall. What’s next: About 800,000 federal workers have been furloughed or are working without pay, and the effects of the shutdown, which have been muted by the holidays, will grow. President Trump’s decision last week to withdraw all U.S. troops from Syria and half of those in Afghanistan has “short-circuited what many say is a much-needed national debate about the future of America’s wars,” one of our White House correspondents writes in a news analysis. Military analysts, former officials and diplomats say there are arguments for withdrawing from both conflicts. But the abrupt announcement “seemed unlikely to provoke a serious debate over difficult questions like how best to combat terrorist threats in distant lands or the proper limits of America’s role as a global guarantor of security.” Another angle: Mr. Trump’s jabs at Democrats during a surprise visit with U.S. troops abroad this week were criticized as politicizing the military. One Fox News contributor said the president used the visit “as a campaign rally.” Yesterday: Iraqi politicians also criticized Mr. Trump’s visit, with some calling for a parliamentary debate on whether American forces should leave. The social network says it’s doing everything it can to get rid of posts that sow division and violence, but it’s also determined to keep growing worldwide. There are billions of posts a day on Facebook, in more than 100 languages. To monitor them, the company has a network of moderators who use PowerPoint slides detailing what’s forbidden. Those rules make Facebook a far more powerful arbiter of speech than has been publicly recognized or acknowledged by the company, a Times investigation has found. The details: Our review of the company’s rule books revealed gaps, biases and outright errors, allowing extremist language to flourish in some countries while censoring mainstream speech in others. Here are five takeaways from our investigation. How we know: The Times received more than 1,400 pages from the rule books from an employee who said he feared the company had too much power, with too little oversight, and was making too many mistakes. Generation Identity is a far-right German youth movement being watched by several European intelligence agencies. The group aims to bring down liberalism and build a “fortress Europe” without non-European immigrants. Better dressed, better educated and less angry than the skinheads of old, the “new right” has sought to distance itself from the “old right,” which in Germany means neo-Nazis. Although the number of committed Generation Identity followers is estimated at only 400 to 500, officials say the number of sympathizers is far greater. There are worries that the group could act as a conduit between conservatism and extremism.

Can we corroborate it? What’s the source’s motivation for telling us?” And the reporter must tell an editor who the source is. “Use of anonymous sourcing in any story must be approved by a high-ranking editor, usually a department head,” Mr. Corbett writes. “When it’s central to the story, it generally must be approved by an even higher-ranking editor.” That’s it for this briefing.

2018,"Shutdown, Syria, Opioids: Your Thursday Evening Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. A deal to avert a U.S. government shutdown was teetering after President Trump, above, told House Republican leaders he would not sign a stopgap spending bill to keep funds flowing past midnight Friday if it did not include border-wall funding. A House Republican leader told reporters that Republicans would try to add $5 billion in funding for the wall to the bill, along with disaster relief money to lure Democratic support. But Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House, said any wall funding would be an automatic “nonstarter.” The chaos in Washington helped send stock prices lower. And here’s what to expect if the government does shut down. Separately, Mr. Trump’s nominee for attorney general, William Barr, criticized the investigation by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, in a memo to top Justice Department officials in June. And a department official said that Matthew Whitaker, the acting attorney general, would not be recusing himself from the Mueller investigation. _____ 2. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned after his last-minute attempt to convince Mr. Trump to keep troops in Syria was rebuffed, officials said Earlier, Mr. Trump defended the withdrawal from bipartisan criticism, not least for leaving Syria open territory for the geopolitical ambitions of Russia and Iran. And President Vladimir Putin welcomed the move, calling it “the right decision.” Above, schoolchildren walking past a U.S. patrol in Hasakah, Syria. America’s Kurdish allies in Syria discussed releasing 3,200 Islamic State prisoners in response. And analysts called the decision an abandonment of key allies and a boon for ISIS. _____ 3. Planned Parenthood is facing accusations of discriminating against pregnant workers. The organization has been accused of sidelining, ousting or otherwise handicapping pregnant employees, according to interviews with more than a dozen current and former employees. A spokeswoman said the organization was investigating the allegations we reported. The accusations are a sign that discrimination against pregnant women and new mothers remains widespread in the workplace — even in organizations that define themselves as champions of women. Above, in Manhattan. In some cases, managers were accused of considering pregnancy in hiring decisions, for example, or denying rest breaks recommended by a doctor. Some women said they were afraid to announce a pregnancy at work, sensing they would be seen as abandoning their colleagues. _____ 4. Why do people misuse opioids? And why can’t many stop? Overdoses have passed car crashes and gun violence to become the leading cause of death for Americans under 55. Some people are more susceptible to addiction than others. But no one is immune. Through interviews with drug users and addiction experts, our journalists created a visual representation, above, of how these powerful drugs can hijack the brain, from temptation and tolerance to relapse and recovery. Separately, a bipartisan criminal justice bill that appears poised to become law could reduce the sentences of some federal inmates. We spoke to a man serving a life sentence for selling crack cocaine that could be reduced to less time than he has already served. _____ 5. Drones shut down Gatwick Airport in London. Flights at Britain’s second-largest airport were halted for nearly 24 hours at the peak of the holiday season after two drones were spotted flying nearby. Passengers were diverted to airports as far away as Paris. Above, the ticketing area. The police used Twitter to ask for the public’s help finding whoever was flying the drones, which they described as “of industrial specification.” One expert said their flight path “very much points to this being planned and not just some rogue hobbyist.” _____ 6. Uber’s driverless cars are back on the road — with two drivers apiece. After one of its cars killed a pedestrian this year in Arizona, the company grounded its autonomous fleet for nine months. As it eases back into testing the vehicles, they will operate on a limited loop in Pittsburgh, above. Each will have two drivers ready to take over, and no passengers will ride in the cars. Tests will be limited to 25 miles an hour and cars will operate only during daylight. “We will continue to prioritize safety,” an Uber spokesman said. _____ 7. Missy Franklin is making a graceful exit. With Olympic gold medals and a world record, she was a swimming superstar. She was also candid about her struggles with anxiety, depression and disordered eating. Franklin, 23, above, announced her retirement in a letter posted on ESPN’s website this week. “I choose to look at this as a new beginning,” she wrote. Tributes poured in, but many of them sounded like eulogies. Our sports reporter, a former swimmer herself, explains why she thinks fans’ sorrow is misguided. _____ 8. Hakuna Matata™? It’s a phrase meaning “no worries” in Swahili, a language spoken across much of Africa. Disney’s “The Lion King” popularized it 20 years ago — and the company then claimed it as intellectual property. (It was the catchphrase of Timon and Pumbaa, shown above with Simba.) Now 100,000 people, angry about cultural appropriation, have signed an online petition asking Disney to drop its trademark. “The term ‘Hakuna Matata’ is not a Disney creation,” the petition notes, “hence not an infringement on intellectual or creative property, but an assault on the Swahili people and Africa as a whole.” Trademark experts said the issue had been blown out of proportion. The trademark does not mean that the company actually owns the phrase or that it can ban anyone from using it. _____ 9. Think of it as Pop 2.0. For the first time in decades, our music critic writes, the playbook for pop success has been updated, profoundly reshaping the sound of America. It used to be that “going pop” implied an artistic compromise. But thanks to digital streaming, formerly niche genres — K-pop, Latin trap, melodic hip-hop and more — have become the center of the conversation. Above, the K-pop giant BTS. The new breakthrough artists often work with a common grammar, even though they emerge from different scenes. They both rap and sing. Their moods are melancholic, rarely ecstatic. Some are casually bilingual, other take in musical ideas from around the globe. And they are, by and large, extremely gifted at self-presentation on social media — they learned to invent themselves online as much as in a studio. _____ 10. Finally, could someone get the lights? Children immersed in the digital world are using PowerPoint presentations to lobby their parents for puppies, Pumas or whatever else is on their wish lists. Two siblings even made the case for splurging on a family vacation home. “With a PowerPoint it was a little bit more impactful because they could see the amount of effort and work I put into it instead of just my usual begging,” said one girl who tried — unsuccessfully — to persuade her parents to buy her a horse.

2018,Opinion | Shutdown? More Like a Breakdown,"Opinion CreditCreditTom Brenner for The New York Times The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. Watching President Trump hold the nation hostage over funding for his border wall has been enough to give a person vertigo. The spectacle began gearing up early last week, when, in an Oval Office tête-à-tête with the Democratic congressional leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, the president boasted that he would be “proud” to bring parts of the government to a halt if Congress did not hand over $5 billion for his border wall. He stuck with this position for basically a week, until, come Tuesday, he executed a tidy flip-flop, sending word via his press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, that he would, in fact, accept a stopgap bill that did not include money for a border wall. Lawmakers promptly slapped together such a plan, zipped it over to the White House and hit the road for Christmas break. Then Twitter came for him. Ann Coulter called him “gutless.” Conservative pundits accused him of caving on his signature campaign promise and denounced him as a squish. Members of the Freedom Caucus took to the floor of the House to plead with him not to betray the cause. Mr. Trump’s wall-worshiping base began abandoning him. Unable to bear the scorn of Ms. Coulter and Rush Limbaugh and his cheerleaders at “Fox & Friends,” Mr. Trump promptly reversed course. On Thursday, he rejected Congress’s temporary funding deal, declaring that either he’d get his $5 billion for a wall (or as he now calls it, “steel slats”) or Americans would get a “Democrat shutdown.” It’s called branding. Never mind that it bears no relation to reality. By Friday, he was in full attack mode. During morning Executive Time, he let loose with a classic Twitter barrage, slamming Democrats and urging the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, to go “nuclear” if necessary — that is, blow up the legislative filibuster to push through an agreement with a simple majority of votes. Disinclined to abandon his institutional prerogatives for even the most magnificent wall, Mr. McConnell immediately made clear this was not an option. At an afternoon bill signing, the president continued trying to shift blame onto Democrats, calling the wall “an issue of crime” and “safety,” claiming that it would “pay for itself on a monthly basis” and asserting that even President Ronald Reagan had failed in his quest for a border wall (which, in fact, Mr. Reagan never sought). Senators trickled back into town to vote on a procedural motion on whether to move forward with the House’s latest proposal, which includes Mr. Trump’s wall money. But Senate leaders made clear that nothing was likely to move until a new bipartisan compromise could be reached. Midafternoon, Ms. Sanders told Roll Call that there might be some lower level of wall funding that would satisfy the president. The talks to resolve the dispute collapsed Friday night. And the shutdown became a certainty. This is what happens when the nation’s chief executive holds a leadership philosophy akin to that of the Petyr Baelish character on “Game of Thrones” — namely, that “chaos is a ladder.” For most people, uncertainty and disorder are scary, unsettling forces to be avoided. But for Mr. Trump, they are cherished friends and strategic assets, in part specifically because other people are so anxious to avoid them. The president clearly believes that throwing everyone else off balance gives him an edge — that is, if he can make the turmoil fierce enough, those around him will give up and give in. Better still, even when he doesn’t get his way, piling on the pandemonium keeps people from focusing on any one piece of it. The normal human mind can cope with only so much drama before it gets overloaded. Mr. Trump grasps better than most that a single scandal is cause for public outrage, while a million scandals is a statistic. There’s no doubt that Mr. Trump was upset about conservatives trashing him for flirting with a wall-free spending bill. This president is driven by an insatiable need for adulation. The less popular he becomes with the bulk of the nation, the more vital it is for him — emotionally and politically — to keep his base happy. But it’s also true that revving up the wall fight allows Mr. Trump to divert attention from so much of the other drama threatening to swallow him up. Even by Trumpian standards, the president has been enduring a bumpy patch. This week alone, Wall Street had its worst stretch in a decade; the Trump Foundation agreed to close up shop following accusations of “a shocking pattern of illegality”; the Supreme Court declined to allow enforcement of Mr. Trump’s planned asylum ban, with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg casting her vote shortly before undergoing surgery for lung cancer; and a backlash erupted over Mr. Trump’s decision to pull troops out of Syria and Afghanistan. This move proved too much for Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who tendered his resignation on Thursday with a letter widely received as a rebuke to the president’s approach to foreign policy and national security. At this rate, the only person left in the administration by Valentine’s Day will be Mick Mulvaney, the incoming acting White House chief of staff. Then again, word around Washington is that the president has been displeased with Mr. Mulvaney’s failure to come up with shutdown solutions, and in 2015, Mr. Mulvaney called Mr. Trump’s ideas about a border wall “absurd and almost childish.” So who knows how long until that relationship sours? And, of course, hovering above it all, the president’s legal troubles keep mounting as the Russia investigation churns on. Faced with all that, who wouldn’t rather throw himself into a fight — maybe even shut down parts of the government — over a border wall? At least with his wall, Mr. Trump gets to pretend that he is still in control, even as his administration sinks further and further into the swamp.

2018,Shutdowns Are ‘All Games of Chicken.’ Here’s How They’ve Evolved.,"With large sections of the federal government shut down, thousands of public employees are bracing to work without pay until Congress and President Trump agree how to spend taxpayers’ money and reconcile ideological differences. Mr. Trump said he’s prepared for a “very long” shutdown over his demand that a spending bill include $5 billion to build a wall along the border with Mexico. “It’s very possible that this shutdown will go beyond the 28th and into the new Congress,” Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said on “Fox News Sunday.” It’s hardly the first time Congress and the president have faced a budget impasse: There have been at least 21 times in the last four decades that the government hasn’t been able to pass some form of a spending bill on time, according to the Congressional Research Service and news reports. Whether these so-called funding gaps set off broad shutdowns of federal operations is unclear. For example, in February, there was a brief, hourslong “shutdown” after Senator Rand Paul, a Republican of Kentucky, delayed votes on a budget deal over spending increases, but there was little if any discernible effect on the public. “If you add in all the near-shutdowns and the almost-shutdowns, you’re talking about 50, 60, 70 shutdowns,” said Linda J. Bilmes, a professor of public policy and public finance at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. “There’s no commonality over how significant the dispute is. It doesn’t have to be over a huge amount of money. It doesn’t have to be an issue of grave import. It just has to be an issue that for whatever political reason can’t be resolved in time.” Shutdowns have changed over time. Before the 1980s, funding disagreements didn’t lead to such stalemates even if budgets weren’t passed on time. The 21-day shutdown during President Clinton’s tenure — the longest one ever — upended the political norm that the federal government should at least try to come to a quick agreement on a budget, said Roy T. Meyers, a political science professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who has written about the history of shutdowns. Still, Professor Meyers said, there’s a common thread: “They’re all games of chicken.” Here’s a look at how shutdowns came about and have evolved over the years. Going back 200 years, the federal government would spend money without prior congressional approval, said Jim Broussard, the director of the Center for Political History at Lebanon Valley College in Annville, Pa. “The executive department, especially the military, would make contracts and then Congress would have to find the money to pay for them or else default on them,” Mr. Broussard said. According to Professor Meyers, the first continuing resolution, essentially a stopgap funding bill when the annual appropriation wasn’t approved, was passed in 1876. The roots of modern-day stalemates can be traced to a 1974 law that reorganized the budgeting process, Professor Bilmes said. It shifted more power to Congress from the executive branch and spread it over several congressional committees. Tense disagreements emerged. In 1977, for example, the House of Representatives and Senate fought over whether Medicaid should be used to pay for abortions, The Washington Post reported. That led to three separate instances in which the government could not provide funding for the departments of labor and health, education and welfare. After 28 days without funding, a compromise was reached. Between the 1962 and 1981 fiscal years, there were 32 funding gaps that totaled 291 days, according to the General Accounting Office, now known as the Government Accountability Office. For years it was common for the government to continue to operate, even if funding bills hadn’t been passed, with the understanding it would eventually get the money approved. But in 1980 and 1981, the United States attorney general, Benjamin R. Civiletti, issued two opinions that emphasized that approach was illegal and the government could not spend money without congressional appropriations. What resulted was a tightening of the budget process, Professor Meyers said. That, in turn, prompted an increased frequency of small shutdowns as politicians struggled with deadlines. In November 1981, President Reagan, in a fight with Congress over $8.5 billion in budget cuts he wanted, ordered the furlough of 241,000 of government employees, the first time a shutdown of that size was ordered, The New York Times reported. Later that day, Congress passed and the president signed a continuing resolution, according to the Congressional Research Service. A congressional subcommittee estimated that the furlough cost taxpayers between $80 million and $90 million, including administrative costs, such as figuring out who could and couldn’t work and paying workers who didn’t end up working. A half-day shutdown in 1986 led to the furlough of 500,000 workers, costing taxpayers more than $62 million in lost work, The Times reported. A three-day shutdown of national parks and museums in October 1990 was estimated to cost nearly $1.7 million, including lost work and administrative costs. The biggest shutdown came in 1995. At issue was a long-term budget backed by Republicans, who swept into office halfway through President Clinton’s first term. Among other things, their plan had limited spending for Medicare and turned Medicaid and most other welfare programs over to the states. House Republicans, in particular, were keen on using a shutdown to get Mr. Clinton to sign their bill, and resisted his preference that the government be reopened during negotiations, The Times reported. The government was closed down for 21 days. The shutdown was preceded by an almost weeklong stalemate in November over similar issues (which is, incidentally, when Mr. Clinton’s sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky began). In January 1996, Congress voted to put 760,000 federal workers back on the payroll and reopened a number of federal departments. The shutdown that began in 1995 and continued into the beginning of 1996 helped pave the way for the 2013 shutdown over President Obama’s health care law. That lasted for 16 days, as Republicans ultimately failed to strip the law of funding or delay its implementation.",The New York Times
2018,"Sidney Horenstein, 82, Geologist Who Wrung Stories From Stone, Dies","Sidney Horenstein, an exuberant geologist whose popular books, guided tours and urban bias brought him fame as a champion of the rock that New York City is built upon (and with), died on Dec. 5 in Manhattan. He was 82. His wife, Marcia, said the cause was respiratory failure. A staff geologist and coordinator of environmental public programs at the American Museum of Natural History and a lecturer at Hunter College in New York, Mr. Horenstein was an expert on the tectonic upheavals that shaped what was left of New York City’s natural landscape. While other earth scientists might prefer prospecting in an unbuilt environment, Mr. Horenstein called New York “one of the great geologic meccas in the world” and a “geological smorgasbord.” “The whole geology of the world is right here in New York City,” he told The New York Times in 1991. “Walk down Fifth Avenue and Sixth Avenue and you can reconstruct the history of the world from rocks that are used for building purposes.” As a self-described “rockconteur,” he delighted in identifying the fossils that freckle the stone facades of skyscrapers and public restroom walls, and even where the stone had been quarried before it was transported to building sites in New York. “Colonial coral fossils!” Mr. Horenstein would exclaim as he perused the paleontological record through a hand magnifier in the doorway of Saks Fifth Avenue, as oblivious shoppers brushed by. No less fervor, on each rediscovery, would greet the Missouri brachiopods at the Brooklyn Municipal Building, or the white blob that turns out to be a fossilized eight-inch snail in the limestone (from Indiana) lobby of the Comcast Building in Rockefeller Center, or the Cretaceous clams in the Western Union Building in Lower Manhattan. “Why do I love fossils?” he mused in 1978. “When you look at them, you’re seeing part of the evolution of life embedded on building stones.” Mr. Horenstein would fascinate his audiences by explaining that rocks can be guideposts for anyone lost in Central Park, especially at night when light pollution obscures the constellations. (His tip: Thanks to the Taconic orogeny, or mountain-building period, the folds or curves in the rocks always plunge in a southerly direction.) He explained why the park’s rocks are smooth enough to form natural slides (millenniums of glacial abrasion). A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018 He would assure people that, urban legend to the contrary, the limestone lining the main concourse of Grand Central Terminal will not expose you to harmful excess radiation. (The average person is bombarded with 360 millirems a year from television sets, smoke detectors and cosmic rays; full-time workers at the terminal get about 120 from the walls.) He comforted alarmists worried that the proliferation of skyscrapers downtown might cause Lower Manhattan to tip. (The stone excavated for their foundations actually weighs more than the hollow buildings themselves.) Sidney Stanley Horenstein was born on Nov. 17, 1936, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. His father, Morris, was a barber; his mother, Mary (Schlanger) Horenstein, was a factory worker. He later lived in Queensbridge Houses, a public project in Long Island City, Queens. As a boy, Mr. Horenstein bought Army surplus binoculars to explore the heavens, then shifted his focus to looking down instead of up. Falling stars were hard to find, but he could fill his pockets with the pebbles that fell onto the sidewalk from the marble contractors’ warehouses on Vernon Boulevard in Queens, not far from his home. After graduating from Long Island City High School, he earned a bachelor’s degree in geology from Hunter College in 1958. For four decades, he lectured and conducted field trips for the natural history museum, where he became environmental educator emeritus in 2004. He also led expeditions around the world for Smithsonian Journeys, under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution. His books include “Concrete Jungle: New York City and Our Last Best Hope for a Sustainable Future” (2007), written with Niles Eldredge, and “A Geologist Looks at Manhattan: A Guide to 100 Fascinating Sites” (2014). Mr. Horenstein married Marcia Lichtenstein in 1967. In addition to her, he is survived by their daughters, Merrill McGarity and Jennifer Tejada, and four grandchildren. The couple lived in the Inwood neighborhood of Upper Manhattan, which, because its terrain is roughly 445 million years old, imbued him with an usually long-term perspective. Four years ago, while touring the excavation for the vast Manhattan West development project over the railroad yards near Pennsylvania Station, he was describing the folded gray Manhattan schist swirled with white pegmatite — a pattern formed when mud on the sea floor was molded as the plates that compose the earth’s crust violently collided. “You don’t think we’re due for another collision do you?” Henry Caso, the Brookfield Office Properties vice president for constructing Manhattan West, asked warily. “Not yet,” Mr. Horenstein reassured him. “Not for another 50 million years.” An earlier version of this obituary misstated the day Mr. Horenstein was born in 1936. It was Nov. 17, not Nov. 11.",The New York Times
2018,"Sigi Schmid, Record-Setting Soccer Coach, Is Dead at 65","Sigi Schmid, the winningest coach in Major League Soccer history, died on Dec. 25 in Los Angeles. He was 65. His death, at Ronald Reagan U.C.L.A. Medical Center, came as he was awaiting a heart transplant. He had been hospitalized three weeks earlier. Schmid had a league-record 266 regular-season and postseason victories in 18 seasons with the Los Angeles Galaxy, the Columbus Crew and the Seattle Sounders. He led his teams to two M.L.S. titles, the first with the Galaxy in 2002 and the second with the Crew in 2008. Schmid was twice named M.L.S. coach of the year and was inducted in the National Soccer Hall of Fame in 2015. His lifetime regular-season record was 240 wins, 183 losses and 125 ties. In Schmid’s first season as coach of the Crew, the team finished last. “Being able to digest losses on a regular basis in that first year and having to come in and rebuild the spirits and the troops was something in my coaching career I hadn’t really faced very often,” he said. Two years later, the Crew won the league championship. Schmid, who had a history of heart problems, was in the midst of his second stint as coach of the Galaxy when he stepped down in September with six games left in the regular season. Schmid was born in West Germany in 1953 and moved to Los Angeles with his family when he was 4. He coached at U.C.L.A., his alma mater, for 19 seasons before moving to the pros. He led the Bruins to 16 consecutive postseason appearances and three N.C.A.A. titles while compiling a record of 322-63-33. He is survived by his wife, Valerie; three sons, Kurt, Kyle and Eric; a daughter, Lacey Nicholl; and several grandchildren. Don Garber, the M.L.S. commissioner, praised Schmid in a statement as “one of the leading figures in the history of our league.”",The New York Times
2018,"Sir Shadow, Maestro of the Last of the Bowery Flophouses","In a derelict hotel, six holdouts resist the gentrification of Skid Row. Soon they will be gone, but the art of one resident may endure. Sir Shadow, the prolific artist of the Whitehouse Hotel, is one of six men remaining in the derelict building on the Bowery.CreditCreditTodd Heisler/The New York Times There’s a ghostly old flophouse on the Bowery. Rowdy brunch crowds stumble past its stained-glass windows and locked double doors. It’s lonesome but not empty. Radiators hiss in its cracked tile floor lobby. Dusty, unused keys hang behind a reception desk. Dark halls are lined with hundreds of boarding rooms empty except for worn mattresses. A few of these cubicles are occupied, stuffed with clothes and belongings. Steam rises from a shower stall. Light flickers behind doors. And a lullaby can be heard through the building when a 70-year-old poet and artist who calls himself Sir Shadow draws at night. Sir Shadow is one of six men who are the final residents of the Whitehouse Hotel. The crumbling four-story building is one of the last of the cheap single-room-occupancy hotels that lined the Bowery a century ago alongside brothels and saloons and defined the area as a symbol of urban despair. While rooms across the street at the Bowery Hotel cost around $400 a night, the men pay no more than $8.50 for their cramped cubicles, though they pretty much have the run of the place. As Sir Shadow hums for inspiration, his slender hand strikes a sketchpad with a silver marker and swirls deliriously, never leaving the page, as though he were signing a signature. The elegant silhouette, formed with one continuous line, depicts a saxophone player. He blurs through more: a jazz ensemble featuring trumpet and upright bass; a drummer in the flurry of a solo. His musicians are faceless abstractions. “I’m a doctor and this is the medication for my patients,” he said one afternoon. “My medicine is positivity. Every line is based on what’s in my heart.” Sir Shadow arrived at the Whitehouse Hotel around 1995, and he has become a kind of Bowery folk hero since then. At 6-foot-4, he sleeps diagonally to fit into his windowless cubicle. Rarely without his fedora, he gets around on a red electric scooter and draws his blues and jazz musicians across the neighborhood. He calls his one-line style Flowetry, which can be found in the calendars he sells. Quincy Jones, Lauryn Hill, and Diana Ross are said to be fans. But his masterpiece might be the Whitehouse Hotel itself. Nearly every hallway and boarding room contains a Sir Shadow mural. Even the keys behind the reception desk are marked with his musical silhouettes. “This building is my canvas,” he said. “These drawings are my warriors. They bring me my peace.” But serenity is a privilege in New York. Sir Shadow’s sanctuary seems destined to meet the fate of every other flophouse. Lodging houses like the Whitehouse Hotel, which sits at 340 Bowery and opened in 1916, were all over New York’s Skid Row. Dozens of these establishments date back nearly to the Civil War. The Alabama Hotel, the Grand Windsor Hotel, the Providence Hotel — their cell-like stalls had chicken wire rather than ceilings, and they cost pennies per night. They became the primitive dwellings of desperate men who gradually saw no benefits to ever checking out. In the 1990s, change came to the Bowery, and most of the old flops were developed into restaurants and hotels. But the men clinging on in the remaining hotels were protected by housing laws that gave them the rights of permanent residents. Eviction became a complicated procedure, and real-estate developers have had to contend with these holdouts ever since. Sir Shadow and his fellow holdouts are in their 60s and 70s: Wayne, Roland, Rob, Bobby, and Charles (there’s also Louis, but he’s in the hospital and I’m told he’s not coming back). They pass by one another with grumbled greetings and take showers in a fluorescent-lit basement bathroom. Chess is played in the lobby. Two men have a bitter grudge and have hardly spoken in years. I met Rob in a dark hallway. Heavyset and missing teeth, he said he had good reasons to withhold his full name. “Shadow is a great artist,” he said. “I’m an artist, too. I’m a shoe shiner. This is an old hotel. I think of myself as a survivor here.” Roland spends hours in a chair overlooking a sparse backyard. In the lobby, a handwritten note reads, “Wayne, your sister called.” One afternoon, Sir Shadow’s philosophical musings were interrupted when a yell rose from another cubicle: “Hey, I’m trying to sleep over here!” “We all live in our own little worlds here,” Sir Shadow said. “I might not even see someone else for days. They’ve tried to get us to take deals. We’ve all wondered: take the money or not? Leave or stay? Now we’re the last men standing.” But Sir Shadow’s artistic life is now entwined with the building. “I might have this little room in the Whitehouse Hotel,” he said, “but this room keeps me free. I can’t be at some job. That would ruin my flow. A man with a million dollars doesn’t have what I have. “All that matters to me is the next poem,” he added. “The next drawing. And I have to be ready to receive it. All the other stuff? That’s someone else’s problem.” One afternoon last summer, Sir Shadow composed his one-line drawings for tourists at his regular spot in Washington Square Park. He hummed his lullaby as he drew in his sketchpad. A tourist complimented his work. “Those who try to be great are cursed,” Sir Shadow said. “They have to worry about failure and perfection. No true artist says, ‘I’m great.’” A young woman said she liked his abstract style. “You must narrow down to your inner peace,” he offered. “Find that time you were in the trees and floating in the breeze.” In fact, the artist deflected nearly every comment about his work into philosophical musings. Especially questions about his life. Did he grow up in New York? “I’m from the universe.” How long has he been an artist? “I started today.” Why does he draw jazz musicians? “I never said they were musicians.” Then there’s Sir Shadow’s least favorite question: What is your real name? Sir Shadow can lose his temper when pressed about his past. His mood darkened when I told him I found clues about his life in old newspaper articles, a student documentary he’d forgotten about, and within a self-published book of his early poetry at a library in Harlem. I knew who he was before he became Sir Shadow. The artist was born Thomas Allen Paxton in 1949, and he grew up in Jamaica, Queens. He was raised in a sprawling housing project, and he was an artistic child who wrote poetry about life in his neighborhood. He dropped out of Jamaica High School. He declined to discuss his family. In the 1970s, he told me, he heard about the countercultural movement in San Francisco, and he boarded a cross-country bus. He instantly embraced the city’s vibrant creative energy and resolved to stay there. He started sleeping on the beach, hanging out with artists, and devoting himself to his poetry. His idyll ended when he heard that his brother died in Queens. “He died for some stupid reason on the street,” he said. “I tried to show him the way but he wanted to be tough and do drugs. Prison changed him. That was hard for me.” The tragedy triggered a spiritual awakening. “I got the calling after that,” he said. “I realized my mission is to spread positivity through my art. I couldn’t help my brother, but maybe I can help others with my energy.” He also retired his birth name, a topic he avoided for weeks until we visited a facility in Harlem where he archives his work, and I noticed a label attached to his unit: “Thomas Paxton.” He was brief when I asked about it. “That’s for legal things,” he said. He visibly winced when a receptionist at the storage space addressed him as “Mr. Paxton.” Reluctantly, he offered: “People always ask me about the name my mother gave me. I say, ‘She gave me a name. Then I picked another name.’ Everything that’s real in life has a shadow. And I’m dealing with the shadow of us all.” He soon returned to New York and he was homeless through the 1980s. He said he lived in subway tunnels and wrote his poetry on underground walls. At the height of the crack epidemic, he served a short sentence in prison for larceny. He insists he was wrongly accused and calls this period his “kidnapping.” Idling in his cell, he kept writing. “One day I read my poetry out loud,” he said. “Then everyone wanted to hear more.” He recounted how his writings inspired inmates, and they started trading cigarette packs for his poems. Guards privately asked him to critique their own artwork. “I was touching people, and they were touching me,” he said. “They had to kick me out of that prison. I had more work to do.” After his release, he shed his past, and sobriety became a theme of his poetry. Some years later, while studying for the GED, he suddenly felt compelled to draw in the margins of his coursework: long, flowing lines. “The gift discovered me,” he said. “The line happens and I start to feed it. People say I draw fast but each line has taken me my whole life.” His metamorphosis complete, Sir Shadow started falling into the city’s black arts scene in the 1990s. His art hung in the homes of Isaac Hayes, Oprah Winfrey and Whitney Houston, according to The New York Amsterdam News, and it was displayed at soul food institutions like Sylvia’s and Londel’s in Harlem. The choreographer Rod Rodgers let him sketch dancers at his company in the East Village, and he designed the art for Gil Scott-Heron’s album “Spirits,” in 1994. “He was my brother,” Sir Shadow said. “We used to talk philosophical.” André De Shields, who played the Wiz in the 1975 Broadway musical “The Wiz,” described a decades-long spiritual kinship with the artist. “Shadow’s true power is that he doesn’t explain what he does,” he said. “I once told him, ‘People are impressed with you because you’ve done something they’ve failed to do their entire lives. You are free.’” But if Sir Shadow’s artistic devotion is all-consuming, it can also be abrasive. Displeased once with a question I asked, he warned: “I created you. I can write you off my stage at any time.” Of a lover, he said: “She wanted me to stay. I said: ‘My work is all that matters. I don’t need anybody.’ I took my shoes and shirt and left.” I later asked if he ever got lonely. “It’s not lonely,” he said. “It’s overwhelming. I have to let the world know this energy exists.” Sir Shadow hasn’t had a job in decades, although he can leave from a session in Washington Square Park with a tidy sum of $20 bills. But he also relies on patronage. One afternoon this fall he took a bus uptown and parked his scooter outside an office building on 42nd street. He approached the security desk with a portfolio of his work. “Tell them it’s Shadow,” he said. The artist was there to visit his friend and patron, Anita Durst. Another surreal accent of Sir Shadow’s life is his connection to the Durst family, one of the oldest and most powerful real estate dynasties in New York, owning properties like One World Trade Center. Ms. Durst is the founder of Chashama, a nonprofit arts organization, and Sir Shadow became her first artist in 1995. She honored him with a gala at 4 Times Square (a Durst-owned property) last year. “She’s very good to me,” he said. “She lets me use her penthouse whenever I need it. If I need to eat or sleep or use the computer or if I need to meditate. She once sent a butler, a masseuse, and a cook to my hospital when I had a bad leg.” In a room on the 32nd Floor, a sea gull flew past the window. He fetched a plate of food in the office kitchen, where a poem of his (“The Inner You”) was taped to a wall, and he spread his drawings across the table. Ms. Durst arrived and they greeted each other with smiles. “His work connects to me on an emotional level,” she said, considering his latest drawings. “It sings to me. His love for life is what comes through in his poems.” She expressed concern that his hundreds of thousands of drawings and poems, heaps of which are stored haphazardly around the Whitehouse Hotel, need to be archived. “We’ve tried some things but they haven’t worked for him,” she said. “I’m leaving it all to her,” said Sir Shadow. “My job was to bring it into the world, and now I’ve done that. Like the birds and the bees, she’s part of my life.” Sir Shadow gave her a copy of the 2019 Flowetry calendar before she returned to work. An assistant slid his kale salad into a takeout box, and he lumbered through the quiet corporate office. By the time Sir Shadow arrived at the Whitehouse Hotel in the mid-90s, the flophouses were grim decaying dwellings filled with stories of men with hollow stares who never left their beds. Housing reformers won a landmark decision that led to many of them being closed, and developers set their sights on the neighborhood. But as the Bowery changed, the Whitehouse Hotel endured, and in 2000, it became a hostel. Thirty holdout tenants remained, and while some despised the young backpackers, Sir Shadow welcomed a new audience for his art. The lobby became his gallery, and he composed hundreds of drawings in rooms across the building. The hostel closed in 2014, and the Whitehouse finally became a phantom building stuck in time. A slow-moving drama regarding its future has been occurring for a decade. In 2007, a hotelier named Sam Chang bought the property for $7.8 million, but shortly after that, 340 Bowery was unexpectedly included in the NoHo Historic District, hampering development. In 2014, the property was sold to the Renatus Group, but development has been hindered by Sir Shadow and his compatriots. A few residents have died, and buyouts have lured away others. The men who remain in the flophouse have refused these deals. The Whitehouse Hotel’s future appears to now hinge on a grim but simple waiting game. Curiously, a few custodians maintain the building, some having worked there since it was an operational flophouse. “They say everyone has their price,” one of the custodians, Will Gens, said during a night shift. “But I don’t know about these guys. I don’t think some of them would take half a million dollars. It comes down to fear. Fear to leave the womb. They are comfortable here. And the outside world is an unknown.” Mr. Gens considered Louis, the holdout in the hospital. “He was offered a good deal just recently,” he said. “But he told me: ‘Not yet. I’ll take it in a few years.’ He got sick a few weeks later.” Worrying about the future is a primitive concept Sir Shadow doesn’t indulge in. But he will readily admit he’s concerned about the legacy of his art. He mentioned his hope that the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture might one day recognize his work. But his diabetes is getting worse, and he receives dialysis several mornings a week. He laments how brunch crowds in the Bowery are more interested in mimosas than supporting a local artist. “Sometimes I think maybe the mission is over,” he said. “But I think I’ve helped the world become a better place. I did what the universe asked me to do.” We were playing chess in the lobby of the Whitehouse Hotel one night when a family entered the building. Somebody must have let them in: a well-dressed man with slicked white hair and his wife and two college-age children. They had eaten dinner nearby and the man wanted to explore the property. His wife cheerily explained that they owned some buildings upstate and claimed that her husband had become obsessed with the Whitehouse Hotel. Apparently it wasn’t his first visit. The man eagerly studied the crumbling lobby in his leather loafers as he thumbed out some $20 bills for Sir Shadow. Soon, he would tour the dark halls upstairs. But Sir Shadow wasn’t interested in the reasons for his visit. He reached for his sketchpad. “So tell me,” he asked. “What’s your favorite instrument?”",The New York Times
2018,"Sister Wendy Beckett, Nun Who Became a BBC Star, Dies at 88","Sister Wendy Beckett, a Roman Catholic nun who interrupted a cloistered life of prayer in England in 1991 and soared to international stardom with lyrical BBC documentaries that made her one of the most improbable art critics in television history, died on Wednesday in the village of East Harling, England. She was 88. Her death was confirmed by the Carmelite Monastery in Quidenham, England, where she had lived in a trailer for decades, though not as a member of the Carmelite order. Bending backward in her black habit in the Vatican’s Sistine Chapel, gazing up through large eyeglasses at Michelangelo’s “The Creation of Adam,” Sister Wendy spoke with a storyteller’s wonder at the solemn, sensuous moment on the ceiling as two fingertips near the touch that begat the creation of life. “Adam’s sprawled there in his naked male glory, but he’s not alive,” she told viewers in 1996. “All he can do is lift up a flaccid finger, and out of the clouds whirls down the God of Power. In his great flying cloak there’s a world. Whether that’s Eve or not, there’s a human face there looking straight at Adam with the eyes daring him to respond to the challenge. And God’s finger touches that of Man.” It was a magical moment of television, too. Sister Wendy was small and stooped, with a plain face, buck teeth and a slight speech impediment that rendered R’s as W’s. But her insightful, unscripted commentaries — a blend of history, criticism and observations on Leonardo da Vinci, van Gogh, Botticelli, Rembrandt, Monet and other Western masters — connected emotionally with millions in Britain and America. By 1997, as she marked 50 years as a nun, the Oxford-educated Sister Wendy had made three television series, the most successful BBC arts programs since “Civilisation,” the art historian Kenneth Clark’s landmark 1969 documentaries. She had also written 15 books on art and religion, and was a celebrity on both sides of the Atlantic, featured in articles and mobbed by fans. She had acquired all the star trappings but a wardrobe adviser — a publicist, an agent to negotiate fees and contracts, promotional interviews with Charlie Rose and Bill Moyers, and visits with dignitaries like Prime Minister John Major at 10 Downing Street and Pope John Paul II, who commended her for broadcasting a positive image of the church. For all her success, she remained a nun with commitments to prayer, solitude (when possible) and vows of poverty. She assigned all her earnings to a Carmelite order that had sheltered her for decades, and she attended Mass daily, even when traveling. Until she was 61, she had been a model of worldly renunciation: a hermit living in a windowless trailer on the grounds of the Carmelite Monastery in East Anglia, subsisting mainly on skim milk and rarely speaking to anyone. She prayed seven hours a day and went out only to morning Mass or to a mobile library van for books. In her passion for self-denial, she had not seen a movie since 1945, visited a museum or even seen a great painting, only reproductions in books. Still, she was spellbound by art: She read about it voraciously, and began writing about it. Her first book, “Contemporary Women Artists,” was published in 1988. In 1991, a BBC producer, Nicholas Rossiter, persuaded her to do a stand-up documentary about Britain’s National Gallery, talking about its paintings. It seemed to her a modest venture. “There was no big ‘Should I give up the caravan to do television?’ or ‘Am I spoiling my hermit life?’ ” she recalled in her book “Sister Wendy on Prayer” (2006). “I really didn’t think it was anything. I thought it was just a weekend here or there.” She was a hit, a natural if eccentric personality with a gift for drama that made art accessible to the general public. Following up in 1992, the BBC produced the six-part “Sister Wendy’s Odyssey,” with a wider focus on museums across England and Scotland. It drew 3.5 million viewers, and it secured her stardom. She was ambivalent about celebrity. She liked “wonderful sweet people” who thanked her for helping them understand paintings, she told The New York Times in 1997. But, she added: “Nothing is more humiliating than being on television. You make such a fool of yourself.” Some art critics agreed, calling her amateurish. But audiences were captivated by her richly human tales, which brought art to life. At the British Museum, standing beside a Greek wine jar painted 2,500 years ago, she embroidered the portrayal of Achilles slaying Penthesilea, the Amazon queen, at the fall of Troy. “As he drove his spear through her throat,” she said, “their eyes met, and he saw how young she was and how lovely and brave. He fell in love — but he killed her.” For a 10-part 1994 BBC series, “Sister Wendy’s Grand Tour,” she crossed Europe and for the first time swooned over Matisse and Cézanne at the Louvre in Paris, Michelangelo’s Pietà in Rome, the canvases of Rembrandt and van Gogh in Amsterdam, and the art treasures of Madrid, Florence, Venice and Berlin. Her most ambitious series, “Sister Wendy’s Story of Painting,” took her 30,000 miles through Europe, the Middle East and the United States, to survey works ranging from prehistoric cave paintings in France to the masterpieces of Picasso and the Pop Art of Andy Warhol. Filmed in 100 days, the series was broadcast in Britain by the BBC in 1996 and in the United States by PBS in 1997. Viewers were astonished and delighted, especially by some of her uninhibited expressions of rapture. Of a postcoital self-portrait by Sir Stanley Spencer with Patricia Preece, Sister Wendy confessed, “I love all those glistening strands of hair, and her pubic hair is so soft and fluffy.” It was a sensation, widely quoted. Frank Bruni, in The Times, said, “The incongruity of such passionate and often sensuous statements coming from a hunched, bespectacled, 67-year-old nun is the secret to much of Sister Wendy’s charm and success.” Wendy Mary Beckett was born in Johannesburg on Feb. 25, 1930, to Aubrey and Dorothy (Sheehan) Beckett. Her father was a physician. She is survived by a brother, Wendell. From an early age she intended to become a nun, and at 16 she joined the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur, a teaching order, as Sister Michael of St. Peter. She became Sister Wendy after Vatican reforms relaxed formalities. She studied literature at Oxford in the early 1950s, living in a convent and observing its strict code of silence for four years. She graduated at the top of her class. Returning to South Africa, she taught for 15 years at a Cape Town convent and later lectured at Johannesburg’s University of Witwatersrand. After suffering three grand mal seizures and learning that she had a form of epilepsy, she received Vatican consent to give up teaching for a life of solitude. In 1970, she returned to England and moved into the trailer at the Carmelite Monastery. Sister Wendy eventually wrote some 25 books, including collections of poetry and meditations, and made a dozen documentaries, many released on DVD. She always returned to the austere seclusion that was her home for nearly a half-century, although her trailer was upgraded in 1994. “The sisters worried about the lack of insulation, so they put up a small mobile home, which has a lavatory, bathroom and light fittings,” she told The Telegraph of London in 2010. “I have an electric kettle, fridge, warming oven and night storage heater, so my life is as comfortable as it needs to be.”",The New York Times
2018,"Sisterhood in the Halls of Congress, and You’re Invited","Gender Letter The Democratic newcomers have a message for you: We’re cool, we’re transparent and we’ve got each others’ backs. “Speak truth, sis!” — Rashida Tlaib to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, both newly elected congresswomen, in a message on Instagram It was not terribly surprising this week when yet another one of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s tweets went viral, this time in response to an article about House Speaker Paul Ryan. Every word Ms. Ocasio-Cortez types on social media, it seems, is ripe for scrutiny. What caught my eye, though, was not the criticism she regularly levels at conservatives, but the validation — a digital fist-bump, almost — she received from her soon-to-be fellow Democratic congresswoman. “Speak truth, sis!” proclaimed Rashida Tlaib, of Michigan, responding to her tweet. Some might say it was “Shine Theory” in action — a term coined by the feminist podcasters Ann Friedman and Aminatou Sow to describe women who make a concerted effort to support one another. (In Ms. Sow’s words: “I don’t shine if you don’t shine.”) In fact, in an exchange of mutual admiration on Twitter on Wednesday, Ayanna Pressley, Massachusetts’s first African-American congresswoman, thanked Ms. Ocasio-Cortez for “living #ShineTheory out loud.” (Ms. Ocasio-Cortez had tweeted that she was “so incredibly proud” of Ms. Pressley, pointing to a Buzzfeed article about her.) It’s a camaraderie that’s been on full display among the Democratic newcomers since November’s election. Their message: We’re cool, we’re transparent and we’ve got each other’s backs. [Sign up here to get future installments of the Gender Letter delivered to your inbox!] In particular, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, of New York — the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, at 29 — has been leading the charge to humanize politics and exposed some of the inner workings of Congress in a way that’s never been done, as my colleague Talya Minsberg recently put it. Throughout the midterm primaries, congressional orientation and beyond, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has posted personal photos and Instagram videos (including live videos, some up to an hour long), effectively bringing her followers along for the ride. And her political cohorts have followed suit, attracting plenty of online attention. A couple of weeks ago, in a lengthy post she titled “Congress Camp,” she outlined, in six steps, how party leadership is formally chosen. She also shared a video of herself with Ilhan Omar, a Minnesotan and one of the first two Muslim women ever elected to Congress. “Ilhan and I showed up in the same outfit today,” she said with Ms. Omar’s arm draped around her, a LOL emoji on the screen. In another instance, Ms. Tlaib, the other Muslim woman elected — standing shoulder to shoulder with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Ms. Pressley and Ms. Omar — declared in a caption: #DreamTeam. The display stands in contrast with the G.O.P.’s Instagram presence, or lack thereof. Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas, who assumed that office in 2013, is a top Instagram user among Republican politicians, but his page consists primarily of posed photo-ops and videos of Fox News appearances. The Democratic freshman class, meanwhile, is seemingly trying to shed all pretense in favor of a personal, unfiltered approach. “What she’s saying is: ‘Hey, develop these skills alongside of me and we will be a community, we’ll be a force,’” said Jennifer Grygiel, an assistant professor at Syracuse University and social media expert, of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's online presence. “She’s not just saying, ‘Hey, support me, support me, support me.’” ______ 24 PERCENT That’s how many congressional seats will be filled by women come January.

2018,Six Decapitated Seal Pups Found on New Zealand Beach,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand — Conservation workers in New Zealand condemned the “cruel and senseless” killings of six fur seal pups, which were found decapitated in a popular bay on the country’s South Island. Andy Thompson, a spokesman for New Zealand’s Department of Conservation, said in a statement that the police were investigating the deaths because of “the disturbing, brutal and violent nature of this crime.” The bodies of the 11-month-old seals were found on Monday by a tourism operator in Scenery Nook, a remote but popular part of Banks Peninsula on the South Island. Conservation workers could not find the seals’ heads, the statement said, and the department believed the animals had been killed elsewhere before being dumped from a boat. Mr. Thompson said in his statement Wednesday that the cause of death was being investigated. “It’s incredibly unlikely sharks would have bitten the heads off six seals but left the bodies untouched,” he added. The department said frustration over low fish stocks in the ocean had led people to hurt or kill seals before. “Regrettably, antagonism toward seals is often due to the misplaced belief that seals are eating large amounts of fish species valued for human consumption. That isn’t the case,” Mr. Thompson said. He added that 90 percent of the Banks Peninsula fur seals’ diet consists of lantern fish, “which are not sought after in fishing.” Fur seals are a protected species in New Zealand, and harassing, disturbing or harming them is illegal. Anyone caught killing or hurting fur seals or other marine mammals faces up to two years in jail or a fine of up to $169,000. In July, four teenagers were accused of fatally shooting a protected leopard seal in Northland, on the North Island. Two seals were shot dead in Kaikoura, on the South Island, in 2013. Also that year, a man was jailed and another sentenced to home detention for clubbing 23 seals to death in Kaikoura in 2010.",The New York Times
2018,Six Michigan Doctors Charged in $464 Million Insurance and Opioid Scheme,"Six Michigan doctors have been charged with insurance fraud and unnecessarily prescribing opioids to patients in a $464 million scheme, according to court documents filed this week by federal prosecutors. The 56-count indictment, filed on Tuesday and made public on Thursday, named Dr. Rajendra Bothra, 77, of Bloomfield Hills, who owned and operated the Pain Center USA in Warren and Eastpointe, Mich., and the Interventional Pain Center in Warren. The other five doctors were employed by the clinics, which catered to patients with joint and spinal injuries. As part of the scheme, Dr. Bothra “sought to bill insurance companies for the maximum number of services and procedures possible with no regard to the patients’ needs,” the United States attorney’s office for the Eastern District of Michigan, which filed the charges, said in a statement on Thursday. Jeffrey Crapko, a lawyer for Dr. Bothra, declined to comment on the case. An after-hours operator at the Pain Center USA said the federal authorities had raided and closed the offices. The doctors have been charged with submitting false claims to Medicare, Medicaid and Blue Cross Blue Shield and diverting the proceeds to themselves, the indictment said. According to the Pain Center USA’s website, Dr. Bothra is a surgeon who has practiced in Warren for 30 years and has specialized in pain management for the past five years. The five other doctors who worked with him and are named in the indictment are Eric Backos, 65; Ganiu Edu, 50; David Lewis, 41; Christopher Russo, 50; and Ronald Kufner, 68. From early 2013 until last month, the doctors issued 13.2 million doses of popular opioids, including OxyContin, Percocet, Vicodin and Dilaudid, according to the indictment. They also performed unnecessary medical services like magnetic resonance imaging on patients. Other charges included billing insurance companies $975 for braces and $2,400 for anesthesia. Prosecutors said the doctors submitted claims of $182.5 million to Medicare, $272.6 million to Medicaid and $9.2 million to Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan. “The damage that opioid distribution has done to our community and to the United States as a whole has been devastating,” Matthew Schneider, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, said in the prosecutors’ statement. “Health care professionals who prey on patients who are addicted to opioids in order to line their pockets is particularly egregious.” The case in Michigan was jointly investigated by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Office of Inspector General and the F.B.I., as well as other agencies. In October 2017, President Trump announced that his administration was declaring the opioid crisis a national public health emergency. According to recent figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 70,237 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2017, a record.",The New York Times
2018,Six to 8 Hours a Night May Be the Sweet Spot for Sleep,"People who slept more had an increased risk for cardiovascular events and premature death. Getting enough sleep is healthful, but getting too much might not be. Researchers gathered health and lifestyle information, including self-reported sleep data, on 116,632 people in 21 countries. Over eight years of follow-up, they recorded 4,381 deaths and 4,365 major cardiovascular events. The study, in the European Heart Journal, found that compared with people who slept six to eight hours a night, those who slept eight to nine hours had a 5 percent increased risk for cardiovascular disease or death. People who slept nine to 10 hours had a 17 percent increased risk, and those who slept more than 10 hours increased their risk by 41 percent. The researchers also found a 9 percent increased risk in people who slept less than six hours, but that difference was not statistically significant. Daytime naps also increased the risk for cardiovascular events, but only in people who slept more than six hours a night. The researchers controlled for age, body mass index, physical activity, diabetes, depression, smoking, alcohol consumption and many other health and behavioral characteristics. “Get enough sleep — that is, six to eight hours a day,” said the lead author, Chuangshi Wang, a doctoral student at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. “But if you sleep more than nine hours a day, you may want to visit a doctor to check your overall health.”",The New York Times
2018,Sixers Guard Markelle Fultz Out Indefinitely With Nerve Disorder,"Markelle Fultz, a guard for the Philadelphia 76ers who has struggled to stay on the court and endured heavy criticism for ongoing shooting woes, has been diagnosed with a nerve disorder. The team announced Tuesday that the injury, which could explain many of his basketball issues, would sideline him indefinitely. Fultz, 20, has battled injuries in the two seasons since he was selected with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 N.B.A. draft, and has not played since Nov. 19. He also missed 68 games last season. In a statement updating Fultz’s status, Dr. Daniel Medina, the Sixers’ vice president of athlete care, said that after a series of consultations with specialists across several disciplines, Fultz had received a diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome. A statement provided to ESPN by Fultz’s agent, Raymond Brothers, went further, saying that the diagnosis was neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome, which Brothers said “affects nerves between the neck and shoulder resulting in abnormal functional movement and range of motion, thus severely limiting Markelle’s ability to shoot a basketball.” The team and agent both said Fultz’s condition would be treated with physical therapy, and ESPN’s report indicated Fultz could be back on the court in three to six weeks. This condition, which the Mayo Clinic says involves a compression of the brachial plexus, “a network of nerves that come from your spinal cord and control muscle movements and sensation in your shoulder, arm and hand,” is typically more associated with baseball players. A host of big-name pitchers, including Matt Harvey, Josh Beckett and Chris Carpenter, have received a similar diagnosis. In perhaps that sport’s most famous case, J.R. Richard, an all-star pitcher for the Houston Astros, had his promising career ended by what was described as vascular thoracic outlet syndrome and a subsequent stroke that was attributed to the condition. In Fultz’s case, a diagnosis of an actual physical ailment, even a serious one like this, could be a step forward for his career, as it could clear up the perception that his struggles were a confidence problem — “the yips” — rather than an injury. At one point, Fultz’s success in the N.B.A. seemed predetermined. In his lone college season he was a star for Washington, averaging 23.2 points, 5.9 assists and 5.7 rebounds a game while shooting 41.3 percent from 3-point range. It was his scoring ability at each level of the court that had teams clamoring for a chance to draft him. The 76ers, who were in the process of building a young core, traded up in the draft to select him, giving the Boston Celtics the No. 3 pick in the 2017 draft, and a future first-round pick in exchange for the No. 1 pick. The problems for Fultz on the professional level were immediately apparent. He showed up to his first training camp with a reworked shooting form that was widely mocked. After just four regular-season games, in which he went 9 for 27 from the field and did not attempt a 3-pointer, he was shut down for five months. His status in that time was highly guarded, with conflicting reports about injury diagnoses and potential mental hangups, many of which focused on the health of his shoulders. Fultz was able to play in the final 10 games of the regular season, and in three playoff games, and while he attempted just one 3-pointer (which he missed), the perception coming into the season was that his struggles could be behind him. Instead, in 19 games, 15 of which he started, Fultz shot 41.9 percent from the field and went just 4 for 14 from 3-point range. The Sixers had started to minimize his role on the team before he was shut down with the mysterious injury.",The New York Times
2018,"Slow Police Response and Chaos Contributed to Parkland Massacre, Report Finds","MIAMI — In the weeks after a deadly school shooting in Parkland, Fla., widespread criticism was focused on Scot Peterson, the armed sheriff’s deputy who heard the exploding gunfire but failed to run in and try to stop the massacre. But a state commission that has been investigating the Feb. 14 attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School for the past 10 months found that the shortfall in the police response went much further: Seven other sheriff’s deputies who raced to the school and heard gunshots also stayed outside the building, the commission found, and officers lost even more time scrambling to retrieve bulletproof vests from their cars. A total of 17 students and staff members lost their lives in an attack that spanned a full six minutes; 17 others were injured. The draft report released Wednesday by no means lifted blame from Mr. Peterson, who the investigation showed had told some of the other officers to stay away from the building where students were being gunned down. But it pointed to a range of other failures on the part of school and law enforcement officials that likely contributed to a shooting so deadly that it set off a national youth movement against gun violence. A campus security monitor saw the gunman enter the building and was suspicious, but did nothing to alert students. Mental health counselors knew the gunman was troubled, but never had a complete picture of just how dangerous he had become. In a separate set of statements released by the authorities on Wednesday, officers described a bloody, chaotic scene as they arrived. “It’s basically like a ‘Apocalypse Now,’ ” Hank Juntunen, a sheriff’s deputy, said of the scene he and other officers encountered on the third floor of the school building where the shooting occurred. The 22 officers interviewed as part of the commission’s investigation described radios that did not work, and problems communicating between law enforcement agencies and medical responders. “I couldn’t key up” on the radio, Deputy Brian Hayes said, describing his attempts to call paramedics to help the injured. “Like, it was just a tone, a tone, a tone.” The Parkland Commission’s 400-page draft report, based on a detailed examination of timelines, emergency response records and testimony from witnesses, police, school officials and others, called for a full internal evaluation of the police response, given the commission’s finding that eight deputies from the Broward County Sheriff’s Office ignored protocol for active shooters that calls for pursuing a gunman to try to disarm him. Other officers who came later did go in as soon as they arrived, the report noted. “None of these BSO deputies immediately responded to the gun shots by entering the campus and seeking out the shooter,” the report said. “Deputy sheriffs who took the time to retrieve vests from containers in their cruisers, removed certain equipment they were wearing so that they could put on their vests, and then replaced the equipment they had removed all while shots were being fired, or had been recently fired, is unacceptable and contrary to accepted protocol.” Sheriff Scott Israel, a Democrat who has been widely criticized for defending his office’s response to the shooting, has already placed two of the deputies on restricted duty. When he testified before the commission last month, he had few answers as to why his officers did not pursue the gunman. “You just can’t measure heart,” Sheriff Israel said. His office will conduct its own investigation after receiving the commission’s final findings on Jan. 1, Sheriff Israel said in a statement on Wednesday. The commission’s report still could be revised, but lists tentative findings and recommendations to local officials and state lawmakers, including a controversial suggestion that the state consider allowing teachers who volunteer for training to carry weapons to school. The commission, led by the Republican sheriff of Pinellas County, Bob Gualtieri, has not made any recommendations related to gun policy. “Classroom teachers cannot and should not be distracted with the responsibility of being armed inside a classroom, even if they think they want to,” Debbie Hixon, a Broward County schoolteacher whose husband, Chris Hixon, was killed in the Stoneman Douglas High attack, told the commission on Wednesday in Tallahassee. “The probability of something going wrong clearly outweighs that one time that there may be a shooting in the classroom.” Florida already tightened gun laws and introduced a number of school safety requirements in the wake of the shooting. But change has proved expensive and slow, frustrating parents of the Parkland victims, including two fathers who sit on the commission. Sheriff Israel and Superintendent Robert W. Runcie of the Broward County public school district have said they are awaiting the final commission findings to make more personnel moves or adopt new policies, if needed. “We are studying the observations to deepen our understanding of what happened, who was responsible, and what might have been done differently,” Kathy Koch, a spokeswoman for the school district, said in a statement on Wednesday. Last month, the school district reassigned three Stoneman Douglas assistant principals and a security specialist as a result of the commission investigation, which identified a number of security failures, beginning with a pedestrian gate left open and unsupervised that allowed the accused gunman, a former student who should not have been on campus, to walk into the school. An unarmed campus security monitor saw the gunman walking toward the freshman building carrying a suspicious bag. “Something inside me told me not to approach him,” the security monitor told the sheriff’s office. But the security monitor did not chase after the gunman or go on his school radio to call a “code red.” The gunman entered the building immediately after three students, who were unaware that someone suspicious was just steps behind them. Two of those students, Martin Duque, 14, and Luke Hoyer, 15, were among the first fatalities. The third student was injured. On Wednesday, Sheriff Gualtieri criticized the security monitor — who has since been fired, along with a second security monitor — for failing to alert the students or anyone else about the gunman’s presence. A code red was called by a third security monitor more than three minutes into the shooting. Two other security monitors, Aaron Feis and Mr. Hixon, ran into the building and were killed. “There could have been a serious mitigation of this if people had been notified and had an opportunity to react,” Sheriff Gualtieri said. Some students were hurt because there was nowhere for them to hide. Only two of 30 classrooms in the freshman building had clearly marked “hard corners” where students would not be seen by an attacker peering in through the glass pane on the classroom door. In several other classrooms, the hard corners were obstructed by furniture, including teachers’ desks, and were too small to fit all the students, leaving some of them exposed. “Cruz only shot people within his line of sight and he never entered any classroom,” the draft report said, referring to the accused gunman, Nikolas Cruz. The report said that Mr. Cruz began searching shootings online months before the rampage. Investigators found that he used his cellphone on Nov. 14, 2017, to search for “shooting people massacre.” Several Instagram accounts linked to Mr. Cruz also included posts about killing people, and Mr. Cruz wrote several notes in his cellphone expressing his desire to hurt others. “Everything and everyone is happy except for me I want to kill people but I don’t know how I can do it,” he wrote in a note on Jan. 21. Beginning in February, in the days leading up to the shooting, Mr. Cruz’s online activity related to violence appeared to increase. He searched for Wikipedia entries, news articles and videos about past shootings, including at Columbine High School in Colorado and at Virginia Tech; viewed videos and forums about shooting with a rifle; and typed in a chilling internet search query: “is killing people easy.” He took a screenshot of the Stoneman Douglas school schedule and of a psychology article regarding “homicidal thoughts or urges.” On Feb. 8, he recorded a video of himself saying he would go upstairs at a Stoneman Douglas building and shoot into the main school courtyard. Investigators found that Mr. Cruz, who had a legally purchased AR-15 assault rifle, tried to shoot from the third floor of the freshman building into crowds of students outside, but his bullets could not penetrate the windows’ hurricane-resistant glass. Mr. Cruz, now 20, was arrested in a residential neighborhood near the school on the day of the shooting. He confessed to the police and was charged with capital murder. He is in jail awaiting trial, though his public defenders have said he would plead guilty in exchange for a sentence of life in prison. Perhaps the most troubling of the commission’s findings was that the shooting’s grim death toll could have been even higher. About 800 students, teachers and staff were in the freshman building that day, according to the report. On the third floor, people could not immediately hear the shooting on the two floors below. More than 100 students filed out of their classrooms there and into the hallway after hearing the fire alarm set off by the gunman’s shots. Only when a teacher standing by the stairwell realized what was going on did most of those children return to the relative safety of their classrooms — before the gunman made it to the third floor. Six minutes into his rampage, the gunman dropped his weapon and left the building, blending in with hundreds of other students who were evacuating. The report noted one other detail from its findings: He left behind 180 rounds of ammunition.",The New York Times
2018,Small Acts of Kindness,"Race/Related is a weekly newsletter focused on identity and culture, with provocative stories from around The Times. Please sign up here to have the Race/Related newsletter delivered weekly to your inbox. Every year I send Christmas cards. A little bell goes off in my head reminding me to write greetings to friends, family and colleagues, wishing them well for the holidays and the new year. Often my messages are rather dull and unoriginal, I’ll admit. But I always spend a little more time when writing the card to my older brother. I actually send him two cards. One goes to the prison that he is in. The other, which includes a cashier’s check, goes to a lockbox in a different state for his commissary. It never gets any easier to write to my brother at this time of year, or to fully take in how such a small act of kindness can mean so much to someone who feels so forgotten and alone. I thought about my brother while reading the news this week about the First Step Act, a criminal justice reform bill that, after months of stalling, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, finally agreed to put up for a vote before Christmas. It has bipartisan support and, as the name suggests, is by no means comprehensive. The bill offers more incentives for early release, reduces mandatory sentencing for nonviolent crimes and expands programs that aim to prevent inmates from reoffending. One of its major boosters is the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, whose father, Charles Kushner, spent time in prison for tax evasion, among other crimes. Others who lobbied for the bill included former prisoners and those who have relatives behind bars. Of course, when we think about criminals in prison, we don’t often see the faces of people like Charles Kushner. We see people like my brother, a black man who made a series of bad choices with untold consequences. Mass incarceration in the United States can seem abstract to many of us, but if you are black it often feels embedded in our society, and as the documentary “13th” by Ava Duvernay suggests, it can be linked to slavery. In my letters to my brother, I usually urge him to keep his head up, and remind him that there is a life waiting for him on the outside. Not too long ago, politicians seemed to compete with each other on who would lock people up the longest, but that seems to be changing — just a little. “We made some decisions 25 years ago here that were wrong,” said Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois and one of the authors of the bill. “We imprisoned thousands of people, mainly African-Americans, for sentences that made no sense in light of their crimes. What we have tried to do is repair that damage and be smarter in the way we sentence.” Some of that damage can never be repaired. But what a shame it would be if that stopped any of us from trying.

2018,Opinion | Small-Town America Is Dying. How Can We Save It? ,"Aging populations, unemployment, addiction: Readers talk about the obstacles to saving rural communities. Ms. Harris and Ms. Tarchak are senior editorial assistants. Can America’s languishing rural communities reinvigorate themselves and bring jobs, infrastructure and people back to their increasingly austere landscapes? Or is it time to cut and run? In “The Hard Truths of Trying to ‘Save’ the Rural Economy,” Eduardo Porter writes about their grim prospects. Among more than 1,000 comments from readers, rural Americans talked about the harsh reality of living in, and sometimes having to leave, a small town with few job prospects or a failing family farm. Geographic and cultural stasis concerned Sil Tuppins, a reader from Tennessee: “We are leaders in opiate deaths and abuse. We continue to be historically low educated. And our rural folk stay in their communities for a lifetime. That is a prescription for failure in a technology driven world.” “Accepting that some of these communities will die also requires acknowledging the suffering that goes along with their ending,” wrote Betsy S, a reader in Otsego County, N.Y. “I don’t know the answer, but I am absolutely certain demanding individual responsibility isn’t going to make anything better.” More comments from readers are below. They have been edited for length and clarity. I’m from Appalachia, where getting into the working class was an aspiration. I was raised “up the holler” and know the culture intimately. You have no idea of the amount of anger, self-righteousness, bigotry and willful ignorance you’re dealing with. I have seen a blighted small town use a corrupt sheriff and judge to run off a business owned by a black man. I have been present when an entire community looked the other way when a gay couple was burned out of their home. They support Trump and the reason is simple: He acts just like they would if they had money. There is no saving this culture, nor should you want to save it. The people who could have revitalized it have either left for better opportunities or been run off. It’s a breeding ground for hatred and despair, dying with a Bible in one arm and a heroin needle in the other. Let it die. — Peregrinus, Erehwon I guess it took the total disaster of Donald Trump for the rest of America to finally see us out here. I completely object to the defeatist tone of this article. Don’t tell me that the thinkers and innovators of this great country can’t devise workable solutions for our rural areas. Moving to an urban area isn’t an option for everyone. It’s risky for people older than 40 to move without an offer already in hand. Many would be competing for low-paid jobs in a new place where they can’t afford to live because of skyrocketing housing costs. People are already fleeing cities for that very reason. Please give these people some credit for seeing the obvious. It’s not just that they don’t want to live in the city. — Madeline Conant, Midwest I grew up on a 60-acre farm and my recollections of it are idyllic, though money was always in short supply. Eventually, my father realized that he had to sell. He could no longer maintain it. Leaving the only lifestyle my parents ever knew was excruciating for them and for me and my siblings. This issue is much more complex than big city folk can truly appreciate. How does one compensate for the areas of the heart and soul which will be lost forever when that last box of memories have been packed up and placed in the pickup truck? — Marge Keller, Midwest I was born in a tiny central Illinois town. When I was in third grade, my parents made the decision to move to Champaign-Urbana, Ill., so that my brother and I would have the opportunity for a much better education. It’s ironic that small-town and rural folk take so much pride in self-sufficiency yet won’t move to improve their prospects. Immigrants make huge and often dangerous journeys to improve their chances and those of their children. You don’t have to move to the biggest cities. There are many small and midsize cities that offer much better education and job opportunities. It’s scary, but you owe it to your kids to be brave and do it. — BA, Milwaukee Sioux County, Nebraska, may never be a tech hub, but why not make an effort in Columbus, Ohio? Tech companies claim H1-B visas are critical to their success. So make the visas geographically dependent. If 43,500 visas are to be given out, grant 100 to each Congressional District rather than giving them all to the firms in Silicon Valley or New York. Give tech a reason to set up facilities in places other than the usual. — Jim S., Cleveland In the 1930s the government began implementing economic policies intended to move people off farms and into manufacturing, such as mines and timber mills. Small-town factories kept rural areas afloat for a while but were among the first to close in the ’70s and ’80s. At the same time, the farms kept getting bigger. We are seeing the culmination of all that now. How to fix it? Change economic policy to favor small and midsize farms and factories, and invest in rural infrastructure, especially high-speed internet. Plenty of folk would happily trade in the expensive, crowded cities. — RB, Rhode Island The author fails to understand the power of lots of little. I come from farm country and we were able to support the growth of IBM just fine. Why? We were resilient and hardworking. We are a community of people, each with many skills. Don’t be jerks. Spread the peanut butter already. — cleverclue, Yellow Springs, Ohio I live in Winthrop, Me., a small town of 6,000. Maine has suffered the way other rural areas have, with the same results: opioid addiction, an aging population, low-wage jobs. Statewide, affordable high-speed broadband internet connection would be a huge help, allowing people to telecommute or start up their own small businesses. What has not worked is luring big businesses in with tax breaks. Been there, done that, and most of them left. — Laurie Graves, Maine Tech industries and manufacturers now look at the quality of life, not just tax breaks, when scouting locations. If you were trying to recruit computer geniuses, would you pick a town with no recreation, movies, stores (beyond Dollar General), restaurants (except McDonald’s), outdoor recreation, and where alcoholism and drugs are the major source of entertainment? Is this the kind of place you’d want to live, work and raise kids? — Linda, Oklahoma I was able to return to my small-town roots once the internet became reliable. I am able to fly to major clients in big cities when needed, but live on a working crop farm. Telecommuting is on the rise. I work for large banks where we thrive on conference calls, even when we’re in the same city or buildings. People do not have to be in the same room to work together. — Waino, Mich. This article came out during the same week that the Natural Resources Defense Council posted its latest analysis of rural job growth in the wind and solar sectors. While there are no easy answers in the hard-hit rural areas, the growth of clean-energy jobs is a rare new opportunity and I’m excited to see solar job training opportunities expanding across our region. — Andre Delattre, Chicago A bison commons would not be a stretch. Ecological restoration is an urgent need across vast stretches of rural America that have suffered from poor land use, extraction industries, invasive species, loss of native biodiversity and a blighting of the rural landscape. There are huge opportunities for employment in restoration: native plant and seed nurseries, stewardship of nature preserves, creation of native pollinator habitats, hunting properties, sustainable farming and outdoor recreation facilities are just some. All it takes is a vision to ‘Make America Beautiful Again.’ And, of course, a reassessment of our values as a nation. How to pay? Consider where all the wealth extracted from rural America has gone. Your mutual fund index portfolios would not be a bad place to start searching. — Lou Nelms, Mason City, Ill. I live in a very small town (population 3,300) in a very rural county (population 7,000) in extremely eastern Idaho. You want to help communities like mine? Come talk to us. We know the answer to economic development for each of our communities and it is not one size fits all.

2018,Smithsonian Adds Gallery Honoring Latino-American Culture,"The Smithsonian Institution announced on Thursday that it will add a gallery dedicated to honoring Latino-American experiences to the National Museum of American History. The addition was made possible by a $10 million lead gift from five members of the Molina family, who made the donation in memory of their father, Dr. C. David Molina, the founder of Molina Healthcare Inc. The 4,500 square foot Molina Family Latino Gallery is scheduled to open in 2021 and will focus on sharing the stories of Latino communities through multimedia activities, artifacts and first-person narratives. The inaugural exhibition, “Making Home: Latino Stories of Community and Belonging,” will explore the history of various Latino cultures in North America and their influence in the United States and elsewhere. “Latino history is American history, and we have a responsibility to reflect the stories and experiences of Latinas and Latinos in the U.S. today,” Eduardo Díaz, the director of the Smithsonian Latino Center, said in a statement. “We’ll continue to do that not only through this future gallery, but also through our diverse programmatic, educational and professional development programs.” This is just the latest step the Smithsonian has taken to increase its Latino representation. Since 2010, the organization has hired 10 Latino curators and added 8 Latino curatorial assistants. It has also made a concerted effort to devise exhibitions that highlight the contributions of Latino artists and political and social issues that affect Latino-Americans. The Smithsonian Latino Center has existed since 1997, but the Molina Family Latino Gallery will be its first dedicated gallery space. In the past, the Center has been responsible for spearheading programming throughout the Smithsonian’s many museums and exhibition sites. Recently, it collaborated with the National Museum of the American Indian on the exhibition, “Taíno: Native Heritage and Identity in the Caribbean,” which is on view in New York until October 2019. Though the gallery is intended for all audiences, Mr. Díaz emphasized his commitment to connecting with members of the Latino community. “At the end of the day, it’s about creating exhibitions and public programs and publications and web content that relate to a community, the diverse Latino community, who have not seen themselves represented adequately historically in museums,” he said in an interview on Friday.",The New York Times

Ms. Hartig begins her new role in Washington, overseeing 262 employees and a budget of nearly $50 million, on Feb. 18. She will be the first woman to be director since the museum opened in 1964, the Smithsonian said. In her new role, in 2019 and 2020, she will open three exhibitions that are part of the Smithsonian American Women’s History Initiative, #BecauseOfHerStory. She will also complete the revitalization of the museum’s 120,000-square-foot west wing. “Anthea’s record as a leader and coalition builder, as well as a student and champion of history, combine to make her an ideal choice to lead one of our most revered museums,” David Skorton, secretary of the Smithsonian, said. “As we turn the page on a new chapter of the National Museum of American History, we are fortunate to welcome a director whose bold leadership is perfectly suited for the time in which we live and the museum’s increasingly inclusive and innovative programming,” he said. Ms. Hartig, described by the Smithsonian as a public historian, professor, author and city planner, led the California Historical Society for seven years. Before that, she was director of the Western Region, National Trust for Historic Preservation. She also currently serves as the cultural resources specialist on the California State Park and Recreation Commission. She succeeds John Gray, who retired as museum director in May after six years.

2018,"Smoke a Joint, Save the Subway?","[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] As the list of states that have legalized marijuana continues to grow, New York could have a new reason to embrace cannabis: It could help save the subway. Some state and city leaders have started to discuss the idea of making recreational marijuana legal and using the revenue to pay for badly-needed and expensive subway upgrades. The proposal could face improved odds in Albany now that Democrats have taken full control of the State Legislature for the first time in a decade. “The biggest issue we hear about as elected officials is the state of the subway system,” Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, said in an interview. “To be able to tie these things together is something that could be highly impactful and potentially transformative.” The idea is still very much theoretical, but it has some prominent supporters and is being considered by a high-profile panel tasked with coming up with ways to pay for a subway overhaul. Any push to legalize marijuana in New York would have to be approved by state lawmakers and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. Mr. Cuomo once took a hard stance against the drug, calling it a “gateway drug,” but he has softened his tone as neighbors like New Jersey move toward legalization. Mr. Cuomo said recently that a legalization bill was being drafted and that it would likely be introduced during the next legislative session, which begins in January. New York City’s subway crisis could add new urgency to the debate. Subway officials say they need more than $40 billion to modernize the system — a price tag so large that they will need other revenue sources in addition to congestion pricing, a proposal Mr. Cuomo supports to toll cars entering the busiest parts of Manhattan. Another benefit of legal pot: Some subway riders who have been irate over terrible service might become a little more relaxed. “Maybe you don’t get so grumpy when the subway doesn’t come,” said Mitchell L. Moss, a transportation expert at New York University who is releasing a new report supporting the idea. From California to Maine, 10 states have legalized recreational marijuana. Michigan just joined the list. In Colorado, marijuana shops made $1.5 billion last year and generated $247 million in taxes and fees, according to the state. States have spent the new tax revenue on a host of initiatives, from schools to transportation. In New York, the illegal market for marijuana could be as high as $3.5 billion annually, according to a state health department report in June, which recommended legalization. Legalizing pot could generate up to $670 million in annual tax revenue, the report said. Public support for marijuana legalization is growing and more than 62 percent of Americans now support it, according to the report by Mr. Moss. Pot sales offer a rare opportunity, his report says, as a revenue source for public transit “with the potential for growth in future decades — one that does not divert funds from other public services.” State lawmakers have created a panel to recommend new revenue sources for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the city’s subway and buses. The group is considering marijuana legalization as one of roughly a dozen money-generating ideas, said Michael Gianaris, a powerful Democratic leader in the State Senate who was appointed to the panel by Mayor Bill de Blasio. Mr. Gianaris supports marijuana legalization and said the subway could be a good way to spend the revenue. “There are a lot of needs that we have that new revenues need to be considered for,” he said in an interview. “The M.T.A. is near the top of my list.” The panel, known as the Metropolitan Transportation Sustainability Advisory Workgroup, has 10 members. It includes Kathryn S. Wylde, the president of the Partnership for New York City, a powerful business group, and Melissa Mark-Viverito, the former City Council speaker. Ms. Wylde was appointed to the panel by Mr. Cuomo, and Ms. Mark-Viverito by Mr. de Blasio. Ms. Mark-Viverito, who is running to be the city’s public advocate, plans to announce her support for the idea on Thursday — a proposal she calls “Weed for Rails.” She wants half of the revenue from marijuana to go toward public transit. Mr. Cuomo’s office declined to say whether he would support using revenue from marijuana legalization for the subway. Peter Ajemian, a spokesman for the governor, said in a statement that a separate work group drafting marijuana legislation was “considering a variety of issues related to regulations and revenues.” New York’s subway, which carries nearly six million people each day, descended into crisis last year and continues to struggle with frequent delays. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who controls the subway, had opposed marijuana legalization. But after state health officials recommended legalizing pot this year, Mr. Cuomo appeared open to the idea. Noting that two border states — Massachusetts in addition to New Jersey — were moving forward with legalizing the drug, the governor said “the situation on marijuana is changing.” New York City has also moved to end most arrests for public marijuana use. An informal poll of subway riders on a recent evening found broad support for the idea of tapping marijuana as the subway’s saving grace. “That would be phenomenal,” Enrique Cruz of Harlem said as he rode an A train. “It’s going to happen anyway. It’s a matter of time. So they might as well utilize the money on things that they have unfortunately neglected.” John Ottavino, who lives in Brooklyn, agreed, especially as another fare increase is planned for March. “They have to find another source of money,” he said. “They can’t keep tapping out the consumer.” Rebecca Tunis said she was frustrated by unreliable subway service, especially on the weekends when stations are often closed for construction work to repair the system. “I think subway riders would probably be willing to do anything for a better subway,” said Ms. Tunis, who lives on the Upper West Side. “People are so mad all the time — I think they’d be willing to legalize anything.” The subway’s leader, Andy Byford, has proposed a sweeping plan to modernize the subway that could cost $40 billion over ten years. Then the transit agency recently announced that it was facing a budget crisis and would need additional financing to avoid major fare increases and service cuts. Mr. Byford declined to comment on the idea of using marijuana revenue to pay for his plan. Shams Tarek, a spokesman for the authority, said in an a statement that Mr. Byford was focused on improving service and upgrading the system. In the past, he has said that he was “agnostic” about funding sources. The combination of a cannabis tax and congestion pricing would go a long way toward helping fund the agency’s operating and capital budgets, Mr. Moss said. He urged New York to move quickly to legalize marijuana. “New York State is not a leader,” his report said, “but it need not be a laggard.” Mr. Johnson, a Democrat and a potential candidate for mayor in 2021, has become increasingly involved in the debate over the future of the subway, pressing for half-price MetroCards for low income New Yorkers and advocating for congestion pricing. Mr. Johnson said he supported marijuana legalization and wanted to see some of the revenue go to the subway and another portion to help communities that have been hurt by discriminatory law enforcement. “Now that the Democrats are going to be in control of the Senate with a large majority, I’m going to look with my colleagues in the Senate to have this conversation,” Mr. Johnson said. Alessandra Biaggi, one of the new Democratic state senators who was recently elected, said she supported both congestion pricing and marijuana legalization as funding streams for the subway. “One source of funding is not going to be enough,” said Ms. Biaggi, who will represent parts of the Bronx and Westchester County. “Why would we not try to include as many funding streams as possible without having to raise taxes, which a lot of people quite frankly are afraid of doing.”",The New York Times

So far this year, customs officials say, nearly 200 of the tiny songbirds have made the arduous journey from South America, stuffed into plastic hair rollers or cardboard toilet paper rolls and hidden in the luggage of smugglers who bring them illegally into the United States. Sometimes, they are given a little rum before the trip to calm their nerves. On Saturday, 70 live finches were discovered in the black duffel bag of a Guyanese citizen who, like the other smugglers, was believed to be bringing them to the United States to participate in underground singing contests. Gamblers set the birds against each other and place bets on their chirping skills. A winning male finch with a good pedigree and track record can sell for up to $10,000, according to a United States Fish and Wildlife Service investigation nicknamed Operation G-Bird. “They bet on how many times the finches will chirp in a minute, which finch chirps the most,” Anthony Bucci, a spokesman for United States Customs and Border Protection in New York, said on Wednesday. “The most common animal we see trying to be smuggled through the passenger environment are these birds, the finches.” Finding the tiny birds rolled up in pantyhose or stuffed into socks and zipped into suitcases and carry-ons arriving at J.F.K. has become unremarkable, he said. “It goes in cycles, like everything else,” Mr. Bucci said. “It’s not an everyday occurrence or an every month occurrence, but it does happen.” The most recent smuggler, whose name was not publicly released, was sent back to Guyana. But his finches were admitted to the United States. The birds were freed from the plastic hair curlers that kept them immobilized during the flight and were turned over to the Fish and Wildlife Service, which placed them in quarantine, Mr. Bucci said. The agency did not respond to a message asking what would happen to them next. Customs officers at Kennedy Airport have intercepted finch smugglers on at least seven occasions this year, seizing at least 184 birds, the agency said. As happened last week, the birds are given to the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the smugglers — usually not American citizens — are sent back to Guyana. But not always. One smuggler, a Guyanese citizen intercepted in July with eight live finches hidden in his computer bag, was admitted to the United States and fined $300. And in April, two men, Victor Benjamin and Insaf Ali, were arrested at J.F.K. and charged with smuggling 26 of the birds between them in hair curlers rolled into their socks, court records show. Mr. Ali pleaded guilty to one count of smuggling in August, and Mr. Benjamin is due back in court in January. Finches and their rapid singsong chirps are prized in parts of South America and the Caribbean, including Guyana, Trinidad, Suriname and Brazil, where finch handlers compete for prizes and prestige at tournaments and informal competitions. That pastime has been transported to New York, where finch smuggling has become a big business. Not only do gamblers place bets on the winning chirper, but there is also big money to be made in the bird trade. But finches are not all fun and games and lucrative song contests. Troy Miller, the director of field operations for the New York office of Customs and Border Protection, said in a statement that bird smuggling could pose a threat to American agriculture and the broader economy through the possible introduction of animal diseases like bird flu. A bird flu outbreak in 2015 caused $850 million in damages and required the culling of 50 million commercial turkeys and chickens, he said.",The New York Times

2018,"Opinion | So, I Asked People in Saudi Arabia About Their Mad, Murderous Crown Prince","The U.S. has leverage over Riyadh. Let’s use it. Opinion Columnist RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — It’s awkward to find yourself in a police state interviewing people about their leader’s penchant for starving children, torturing women or dismembering critics. The result is nervous smiles. And long pauses in the conversation. It’s sad because on this visit, I found Saudi Arabia truly is changing under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. You feel a dynamism on the ground in Riyadh, and young Saudis are thrilled that the country finally has a bold leader trying to modernize the economy. One businesswoman, Naha Said Kattan, told me that she’s grateful to Prince Mohammed that she could drive herself to our interview. I told her that I was delighted for her, but that it was difficult to celebrate while the prince also imprisons women’s rights leaders and reportedly has had four flogged, tortured and sexually harassed, with one attempting suicide as a result. Another awkward silence. I’ve been fiercely critical of the “mad prince,” so I was a bit surprised to receive a Saudi visa — apparently because I was traveling with a United Nations delegation returning from Yemen. In a reflection of the mood today, American friends seemed less concerned about my safety in rebel-held Yemen than in Riyadh. In fact, I’ve felt reasonably safe in Saudi Arabia. Officials were respectful and courteous even when I was painfully frank. But people also seemed more afraid to speak to a journalist than before, and mingled with the oppressiveness, there was an aggrieved nationalism in the air. Public opinion is difficult to judge in any police state in which journalists are closely watched. But my best guess is that the support here for the prince is real, with people welcoming his youthful leadership as a breath of fresh air; even in Arabic he is sometimes referred to affectionately by his English initials, M.B.S. But I refer to “M.B.S.,” following the dismemberment of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as “Mr. Bone Saw.” Ah, more awkwardness. Bravo to the U.S. Senate for its historic votes to hold M.B.S. accountable for Khashoggi’s murder and to end support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Saudi officials are paying very close attention. Senior Saudis privately accept that M.B.S. ordered Khashoggi’s death but insist that the Saudi-U.S. relationship is more important than one man’s life. For the sake of stability in the region, they say, America should stand by Saudi Arabia. To which my answer is: The problem is not only that M.B.S. is a murderer, but also that he has destabilized the region, starved Yemeni children and undermined the interests of Saudi Arabia and the United States alike. Everything he touches, he breaks. President Trump and Jared Kushner have placed their bets on the prince, and in a narrow sense they may be right. King Faisal managed to oust his incompetent predecessor, King Saud, in 1964, but I saw no sign that M.B.S. is in jeopardy of losing power. My most interesting interaction was with a group of young professionals who believe that I am getting it all wrong. “I don’t know why the media focuses on the bad side,” protested Tariq Buhilaigah, a consultant in Riyadh. Sure there have been missteps, he said, but the most important things going on are the modernization of the country and the diversification of the economy away from oil. Felwa AlBazie, who is preparing to get her driver’s license, said she doesn’t know why the women’s rights activists are detained but added, “The big picture I’m seeing is that every woman in life benefits from driving, and women and men benefit from social progress.” But modernity isn’t just about cappuccinos and iPhone apps; it’s also about human dignity and the rule of law. While M.B.S. is bringing social progress, he’s also reckless, oppressive and brutal, and I am skeptical of his economic competence. He hasn’t even been able to organize an initial public offering for Aramco. Trump’s bizarre defense of the prince reflects what has been wrong with the U.S.-Saudi relationship. It has become all transactional. The Saudis have treated us like body guards, and we have treated them like gas station attendants. I suspect the real reason Trump and Kushner embrace M.B.S., aside from the hope that he will back their Middle East peace plan, is business: the belief that Saudis will invest in their personal real estate projects for decades to come. The truth is that as Saudi Arabia’s significance as an oil producer diminishes, we need Saudi Arabia less. In 25 years, if we’re freed from the tyranny of imported oil, we may not need it at all. Some Saudis kept trying to suggest to me that if we block weapons sales to Riyadh, the kingdom will turn to Moscow. That’s absurd. It needs our spare parts and, more important, it buys our weapons because they come with an implicit guarantee that we will bail the Saudis out militarily if they get in trouble with Iran. Saudi Arabia’s armed forces can’t even defeat a militia in Yemen, so how could they stand up to Iran? That’s why we have leverage over Saudi Arabia, not the other way around. Let’s use that leverage. The next step should be a suspension of arms sales until Saudi Arabia ends its war on Yemen, for that war has made us complicit in mass starvation.",The New York Times
2018,Soccer Match Set for Saudi Arabia Puts Its Organizers on the Defensive,"LONDON — The Italian Super Cup final has been played on foreign soil nine times, including once in Tripoli at the invitation of the former Libyan dictator Muammar el-Qaddafi. But the site for this season’s match is drawing a whole new level of criticism. At issue is the decision of Italian soccer authorities to forge ahead and stage the showpiece game — a matchup of the winners of the previous season’s domestic league and cup competitions — in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, next month. The match would be played just months after the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul and while the kingdom continues to host the largest sports piracy operation in broadcasting history. The Italian league, Serie A, has been lobbied by human rights groups, a local journalists’ union and the Qatar-based beIN Media Group — perhaps the biggest buyer of Italian soccer television rights — to remove the Jan. 16 game between Juventus and A.C. Milan from Saudi Arabia. (Juventus won both the league and the domestic cup last season, so Milan is the Super Cup opponent because it reached the cup final.) Saudi Arabia, which acquired the hosting rights in June as part of a three-match deal worth 21 million euros (about $24 million), has become one of the biggest buyers of sports properties in recent years, with investments including auto races, tennis matches and, more recently, international soccer events. It also is supporting an offer worth as much as $25 billion to acquire the rights to FIFA’s Club World Cup and to create a separate competition for national teams. The proposal has split the leaders of major governing bodies in soccer, some of whom have protested Saudi support for the piracy of multimillion-dollar rights contracts owned by Qatar’s beIN Sports. The journalists’ union for the Italian state broadcaster RAI, which will air the Super Cup in Italy, said last month that it was “absurd and unacceptable” that the game would go ahead in light of the October killing of Mr. Khashoggi, which United States intelligence officials have concluded took place on the orders of Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Sports leaders have been walking a diplomatic tightrope since the killing. In October, for example, Avram Glazer, the American co-owner of the English Premier League soccer club Manchester United, was one of the many business and political leaders to pull out of a high-profile investment conference in Riyadh — though Mr. Glazer did attend another event in the country, for Prince Mohammed’s foundation, a few weeks later. Manchester United has earned millions from its relationship with Saudi Arabia through sponsorships and other agreements. Last month, the world’s top-ranked men’s tennis player, Novak Djokovic, confirmed that a scheduled exhibition match against Rafael Nadal later this month in Jidda had been postponed. Mr. Djokovic cited Mr. Nadal’s ankle injury as the reason for the cancellation, but both players had come under growing pressure to withdraw after Mr. Khashoggi’s murder. And on Dec. 8, beIN’s chief executive, Yousef Al-Obaidly, wrote a two-page letter, which was seen by The New York Times, to Serie A’s general director, Marco Brunelli, also protesting the fact that the Super Cup game would be played in Saudi Arabia. Mr. Al-Obaidly’s frustration lies with beoutQ, a piracy operation that is seemingly based in the kingdom and that was set up in the aftermath of a blockade of Qatar led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. BeoutQ continues to broadcast premium sports content — including Serie A matches — illegally, and beIN noted that it has committed about $500 million to broadcast the Italian league games. “We do not understand why Serie A has chosen to publicly reward the Saudi Arabian authorities by staging the prestigious Super Cup match in the country, and we would strongly ask you to reconsider,” Mr. Al-Obaidly wrote. Many of the league’s other rights partners have not commented on the matter, including the United States-based sports management company IMG, which last year committed €1 billion to buy Serie A’s overseas broadcasting rights for three seasons. IMG has other relationships and deals in Saudi Arabia, including as part of a partnership to organize a European Tour golf event there early next year. A spokesman for Serie A, citing confidentiality, declined to discuss what the league’s response to beIN would be or to comment on the specific issues raised by human rights groups and the journalists’ union. The auto racing series Formula E also is pressing ahead with plans to host its season-opening event in Saudi Arabia later this month. The series is partly owned by Liberty Global and Discovery Communications, which has seen a number of its Discovery channels made available in the Middle East and in parts of Europe through illegal beoutQ devices. Discovery declined to comment. “Formula E is a catalyst for change, not only with the wider automotive industry and the uptake of electric vehicles on a global scale, but also in playing a positive role in changing perceptions,” a Formula E spokesman said in an email message. “The event in Ad Diriyah is an important opportunity to showcase the power and potential of clean technologies of the future — to a country moving away from dependency on oil and demonstrating a diverse economy.” The spokesman declined to answer questions related to Saudi Arabia’s human rights record or the death of Mr. Khashoggi.",The New York Times
2018,"Soccer Player’s Plea: ‘I Am Afraid if I Go to Bahrain, I Will Be Tortured Again’","BANGKOK — The trip to Thailand was meant to be a belated honeymoon for a young soccer player and his wife. But upon landing at a Bangkok airport last week, Hakeem al-Araibi, a political refugee from Bahrain playing for a soccer team in Melbourne, Australia, was detained by Thai immigration authorities, who have been asked to extradite him to Bahrain, where he said he had been tortured. “Please, I am afraid if I go to Bahrain, I will be tortured again,” Mr. Araibi said by phone from an immigration detention center in Bangkok. At a court hearing on Friday, Mr. Araibi was served with a formal arrest warrant that paves the way for a possible extradition next week. He has the right to appeal Bahrain’s extradition request. “We want to go to beaches and beautiful places,” Mr. Araibi said of his Thailand visit. “I have only seen this immigration prison.” His case is not only a window into how vulnerable foreigners are treated in Thailand, a country with a history of deporting asylum seekers. It also is seen as a bellwether for how well FIFA, the scandal-plagued body governing international soccer, is playing by new rules intended to protect its athletes. “This one player sitting in detention is a very important indication of whether it’s a new day for human rights for FIFA or will it go back to an old system where human rights abusers got away with their crimes and the victims were punished,” said Minky Worden, the director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch. Mr. Araibi’s detention at the airport on Nov. 27 was a response to an Interpol request based on an arrest warrant from Bahrain, Thai officials said. But this week, the Interpol request, a so-called red notice, was lifted, according to Thai immigration authorities. Precisely why it was lifted remains unclear. But such requests are not meant to be used by repressive governments to nab political opponents overseas. They also are not meant to apply to refugees. Mr. Araibi has refugee status in Australia. Nonetheless, Busadee Santipitaks, a spokeswoman for the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said the case against Mr. Araibi was continuing. “We have received a provisional arrest request from Bahrain and are in the process of considering the matter in accordance with our domestic laws and regulations,” she said. “Even though Interpol seems to have lifted the red notice, the arrest warrant against him from Bahrain still stands,” said Maj. Gen. Surachate Hakparn, the immigration chief of Thailand. Mr. Araibi’s case will need to make its way through the Thai legal system within 12 days, or by Dec. 14, because Thailand does not have an extradition treaty with Bahrain, General Surachate said. “The Thai court will be the one that makes the decision whether to send him to refuge in Australia or send him back to Bahrain,” he said. “There’s no big worry about this story because we only follow the law.” But human-rights groups worry that a political refugee is on the brink of being forced back to Bahrain, a country with a record of persecuting opponents to the ruling family. The United Nations “remains very concerned” about Mr. Araibi’s case, said Cynthia Veliko, the regional representative for Southeast Asia for the United Nations Human Rights Office. Once a star defender on the Bahrain national soccer squad, Mr. Araibi, 25, was swept up in the Arab Spring protests in 2011 when hundreds of thousands of Bahrainis marched against the ruling family of the small Gulf kingdom that is home to the United States Navy’s Fifth Fleet. The crackdown by the Sunni Muslim monarchy was especially tough. Thousands of Shiites, who make up the country’s religious majority, were imprisoned and tortured, human rights groups say. Last month, three Shiite leaders of Bahrain’s opposition were sentenced to life imprisonment for spying, in what Amnesty International called a “travesty of justice.” In 2014, Mr. Araibi was sentenced in absentia to 10 years’ imprisonment on charges of having burned a police station during the thwarted protest movement. Mr. Araibi said he had been playing in a televised soccer match when the crime supposedly occurred. Mr. Araibi later accused Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa, a member of the ruling family and the head of the Asian Football Confederation, of doing nothing to stop the persecution of Shiite athletes who were thought to have joined the protests. “They tortured me,” Mr. Araibi said of his treatment by Bahraini security forces. “They wanted to hurt me so I could not play football again.” In 2016, Sheikh Salman vied for the presidency of FIFA. Once considered a favorite for the top job, he lost the race to Swiss-born Gianni Infantino, amid a blitz of negative press about Bahrain’s human-rights record. “Not only did Sheikh Salman lose the vote narrowly but in the course of the contest Bahrain’s appalling record of torture and abuse of detainees was front and back page news,” said Nicholas McGeehan, an independent researcher on human rights in the Gulf. “They will have considerable thirst to take revenge.” Sheikh Salman, who did not respond to requests for comment, remains at the head of the Asian soccer body and is a vice president of FIFA. A FIFA spokesman said in an emailed statement that it had become aware of Mr. Araibi’s “urgent situation.” “FIFA supports the calls for the Thai authorities to allow Mr. al-Araibi to return to Australia where he currently enjoys refugee status at the earliest possible moment,” the statement said. The international soccer body has been troubled by crises in recent years, most notably a corruption scandal that thinned its leadership ranks in 2015. This month, members of the Afghan women’s soccer team claimed a chronic pattern of sexual abuse by male coaches and officials. FIFA says it is investigating. As a result of human-rights controversies surrounding Russia’s hosting of the World Cup this year and Qatar’s planned hosting in 2022, FIFA unveiled new rules intended to better protect players and whistle-blowers. Sponsors had urged the changes. Brendan Schwab, executive director of the World Players Association, which represents the interests of 85,000 professional athletes globally, described FIFA’s reforms as nascent. “These structures, while groundbreaking, are in their infancy,” said Mr. Schwab, who is an Australian labor and human rights lawyer. “We are still finding that too often enforcement is coming down to the political will of the leadership of football.” As a registered soccer player, Mr. Araibi should be protected by FIFA’s strengthened human rights policy, Mr. Schwab said. “It is not relevant that Mr. Hakeem al-Araibi may have made comments critical of a FIFA official,” he said. “What is relevant is that he is a refugee in need of protection by the game’s leaders who wield enormous power.” Australian diplomats have met with Mr. Araibi and are calling for his return to Australia but declined to comment further on his case, citing privacy considerations. Thailand does not recognize refugees but it is party to two other international conventions that the United Nations says apply to Mr. Araibi’s case: one against torture and the other protecting civil and political rights. Under military junta rule for four years, Thailand has extradited members of the Uighur Muslim minority to China, where rights groups say they are at risk of torture. Chinese dissidents seeking refuge in Thailand have also been forcibly repatriated. In October, a Thai court ordered the deportation of about 70 Pakistani Christians and other religious minorities who had overstayed their visas. The Pakistanis said they feared persecution if they returned home. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha of Thailand, who led a 2014 military coup, visited Bahrain last year. His counterpart in Bahrain, Prince Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, was quoted in a Thai newspaper saying he considered Thailand his second home. On Wednesday, Prince Khalifa attended a function at the Thai Embassy in Manama, the capital of Bahrain. In 2014, Thailand, acting on an Interpol request, handed Ali Ahmed Ibrahim Haroon, a Bahraini who had taken part in the 2011 Arab Spring protests, into the custody of Bahraini officials. United Nations officials said Mr. Haroon endured such harsh treatment on the journey back to Bahrain that he had to be transferred to a hospital upon arrival. He is still in prison. “We know what will happen to Hakeem if he is sent back,” said Sayed Ahmed al-Wadaei, director of advocacy for the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy in London. “He made a lot of powerful people very upset.” Mr. Araibi said some of his former teammates from the Bahrain national team remained in jail. “I don’t want to go back to Bahrain,” he said from detention in Bangkok, his voice shaking. “I want to play football in Australia.”",The New York Times
2018,Social Media’s Forever War,"The Shift A year ago, in his annual New Year’s resolution post, Mark Zuckerberg pledged to spend 2018 fixing Facebook by addressing foreign manipulation, election interference and other threats. He and other tech leaders should probably renew that vow for 2019, and 2020, and possibly every year after that. On Monday, the Senate Intelligence Committee released a pair of sweeping reports illuminating how effectively Russian influence operations weaponized social media during the 2016 presidential election, targeting groups like African-Americans, evangelical Christians and pro-gun activists to sow division, confuse voters and support the candidacy of Donald J. Trump. These reports showed conclusively that Russia’s Internet Research Agency used every digital attack surface available — whether it was Facebook or Instagram, where their posts got millions of interactions, or smaller social media networks like Vine and LiveJournal, or even networked video games like Pokémon Go. One takeaway from these reports might be that the Russian influence campaign of 2016 was a freak occurrence enabled by a perfect storm of vulnerabilities: growth-obsessed social media companies, unsuspecting intelligence agencies and an election featuring two hyper-polarizing candidates, one of which had a Russian blind spot and an army of supporters willing to believe convenient lies and half-truths. The other way to look at these reports, and probably a more accurate one, is that the 2016 election was the Pearl Harbor of the social media age: a singular act of aggression that ushered in an era of extended conflict. In an essay last month, Renee DiResta — one of the researchers involved in analyzing the social media data for the Senate committee — used the term “Information World War” to describe the battles being waged by nations and ideological factions on social media platforms. Ms. DiResta wrote: The theatre opportunistically shifts as geopolitical events and cultural moments present themselves, but there is no sign of abatement — only tactical evolution as the digital platforms that serve as the battlespaces introduce small amounts of friction via new security checks and feature tweaks. Indeed, in the pair of reports prepared for the Senate committee, we see that Russia’s attacks did not stop after Mr. Trump’s election, but they have continued to evolve and adapt. Russians appear to have shifted their focus away from Facebook, where a team of trained specialists now prowls for influence operations, and toward Instagram, another Facebook-owned app that has flown under the radar. The Internet Research Agency appears to have largely sat out the 2018 midterm elections, but it is likely already trying to influence the 2020 presidential election, in ways social media companies may not yet understand or be prepared for. And Russia is just the beginning. Other countries, including Iran and China, have already demonstrated advanced capabilities for cyberwarfare, including influence operations waged over social media platforms. Since 2016, tech companies have tried to demonstrate that they are up to the challenge, by bulking up their security teams and rolling out new transparency features. Some of their efforts have paid off, but others have seemed mostly cosmetic — like the “war room” set up at Facebook headquarters ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, a glorified conference room that was nevertheless heralded as the second coming of Stratcom. In the pair of independent reports presented to the Senate Intelligence Committee, researchers criticized these companies for providing incomplete or poorly formatted data sets for examination and for appearing to mislead Congress while answering questions about the extent of Russia’s operations. There is also something uncomfortably America-centric about all of this investigation. Social media companies have, reluctantly and belatedly, disclosed details about the extent of their platforms’ misuse during the 2016 election in the United States. But they have not made similar disclosures in Italy, France, Brazil or any number of other countries where social media disinformation has played a major role in tectonic political shifts. The researchers who analyzed data from the 2016 election have framed the continuing battle over disinformation and social media manipulation as a “high-stakes information war.” But if this is indeed a war, it isn’t a simple, bilateral one — with tech firms and American intelligence agencies on one side, and state-sponsored hackers and trolls on the other. Social networks, after all, are not extensions of the United States government. They are owned by corporations seeking to maximize their growth and profitability, and many of them operate mostly outside the United States. (It’s useful to periodically recall that fewer than 10 percent of Facebook’s users are American.) The social media apparatus that Russia exploited in 2016 — feeds engineered to show users emotionally engaging content, paired with viral sharing mechanisms and self-service advertising platforms — has been enormously profitable for these companies, and remains largely intact. To the extent that social media giants’ incentives align with America’s national security interests, it is because they fear the wrath of lawmakers and regulators, and because the reputational damage associated with Russia’s 2016 exploitation has dragged down their stock prices and made it harder to recruit. We shouldn’t hold our breath for these companies to voluntarily self-regulate. Instead, to contain this amorphous threat, we’ll almost certainly have to look elsewhere for help. First, while pressuring social media companies to take information warfare seriously, the public and the media will need to take steps to make ourselves less vulnerable to influence campaigns, by increasing our fluency with disinformation and media manipulation tactics. As long as tools for targeted digital mass persuasion exist, Russian-style influence operations will be with us. And any new social network competing with Facebook, Instagram and Twitter will need to consider, from Day 1, how propaganda can be kept at bay. It is no longer enough to build a platform, attract millions or billions of users, and then deal with the consequences. Second, Congress will need to act. Since the 2016 election, we have learned about Russia’s disinformation campaigns in incredible detail, but lawmakers have done virtually nothing to prevent future influence operations. Conventional economic sanctions have not deterred Russia, and efforts to address the threat through legislation — like the Honest Ads Act, a bipartisan bill introduced in the Senate last year that would require additional transparency from online political advertisers — have gone nowhere. Two years after the 2016 election, there is still no single federal agency charged with securing American elections from cyberattacks and foreign influence campaigns. Mr. Trump and many other top Republicans have not formally acknowledged the extent of Russia’s 2016 campaign. And although relationships between Silicon Valley tech companies and American intelligence agencies have reportedly improved, there is still more work to be done. If anything has changed since 2016, it’s that social media is no longer seen as just a useful tool for influencing elections. It’s the terrain on which our entire political culture rests, whose peaks and valleys shape our everyday discourse, and whose possibilities for exploitation are nearly endless. And until we either secure that ground or replace it entirely, we should expect many more attacks, each one in a slightly different form, and each leaving us with even more doubt that what we see online reflects reality, or something close to it.",The New York Times
2018,Solar Mini-Grids Give Nigeria a Power Boost,"GBAMU GBAMU, Nigeria — Music blasts from King Royal Guesthouse, a small restaurant in the village of Gbamu Gbamu, a three-hour drive from Lagos. It’s early afternoon, but purple and green disco lights flash above a television. A powerful fan blows the hot air as patrons sit on plastic chairs, drink cold beers and sodas, and check their cellphones. The owner, Olamide Olasunkanmi, previously used a generator to power appliances. He had to buy heavy jugs of gasoline and carry them on a motorbike from the nearest town, about 30 minutes down a dirt road that becomes a muddy mess when it rains. But Mr. Olasunkanmi doesn’t use the generator much since he connected to a new solar mini-grid in the village in February. Now, steady solar electricity is available 24 hours a day. When he relied on the generator, he had to unplug the freezer and turn off the television and fan if he wanted to use his water pump. Now, he can run all the appliances at the same time. He pays about 20,000 naira ($55) each month for solar power — about what he paid for gasoline. But he uses more appliances and electricity, and he says his “stress is reduced” because he no longer hauls fuel from town. “We enjoy the power more,” he said. In Gbamu Gbamu (pronounced BOMB-ou BOMB-ou), in Nigeria’s Ogun State, more than 2,500 people like Mr. Olasunkanmi no longer rely on expensive, polluting generators to light homes and run small businesses such as grain mills, cocoa drying and welding operations, carpentry workshops, and small restaurants and hotels. Six pilot solar mini-grids operating since January and February in five Nigerian states give 15,000 people access to reliable electricity. The mini-grids were partly funded with 1.7 million euros (about $1.9 million) from the European Union and the German government in collaboration with Nigeria’s state governments. The Nigerian energy companies Rubitec, GoSolar, GVE and Nayo Tropical Technologies planned and built and run the mini-grids. By 2020, Nigeria wants to have plans laid for more solar mini-grids that would eventually reach more than 100,000 people. Solar mini-grids are not a new concept worldwide, but they are an increasingly popular way to provide low-cost reliable electricity to rural areas. In Nigeria, they have the potential to give 26 million residents access to electricity, according to GIZ, the German aid agency that supports the initiative. Rubitec built the Gbamu Gbamu mini-grid, composed of more than 300 large solar panels on a compact plot of land. A small powerhouse is lined with imported inverters and batteries that can store enough energy for electricity, even during the rainy season. Wires on wooden poles run from the mini-grid to homes and businesses that have paid for a connection. Solar mini-grids are part of new efforts in Nigeria to increase electricity and bolster energy security in Africa’s most populous country. Nigeria is one of the world’s largest producers of oil and gas and the largest producer of hydropower in West Africa. But about 60 percent of the country’s 190 million inhabitants lack access to reliable electricity, according to the government’s Nigeria Power Baseline Report, and 75 percent of rural dwellers don’t have power. Droughts have stalled hydroelectric plants. And rebel attacks on critical gas pipelines in the volatile south have crippled power plants; gas generates 85 percent of Nigeria’s electricity. In 2016, the Niger Delta Avengers destroyed gas pipelines to pressure the government to help the poor and clean up environmental pollution in the resource-rich but neglected area. Nigeria’s power plants can generate about 13,000 megawatts of electricity, but they produce only about 4,000 megawatts because of gas shortages, as well as grid constraints, poor maintenance and technical problems. The scarcity of electricity will only deepen as the rapidly growing country demands more energy. Nigeria’s population is expected to double to 400 million by 2050 and could reach one billion by the end of the century, according to the United Nations. In 2015, Nigeria adopted a national renewable energy policy and moved to sign the Paris accord to combat global climate change. Nigeria’s creation of a renewable energy department is “really a major shift,” said Ina Hommers, head of GIZ’s Nigerian Energy Support Program. “It’s going to make Nigeria more independent from other costly energy resources. And it creates additional jobs because it’s a new sector.” Nigeria aims to increase electricity capacity to 30,000 megawatts by 2030 with a third of that from renewable energy sources such as hydropower and solar. It’s an ambitious target because proposed incentives such as tax breaks on imported solar panels, batteries and equipment have yet to be put into effect. Energy security — the uninterrupted availability of energy sources at an affordable price — is an urgent issue not only because of gas and power shortages. Oil accounts for more than 80 percent of Nigeria’s export revenues, making it dangerously dependent on a single industry already mired in corruption. In 2016, a drop in global oil prices pushed Nigeria into a painful recession that made diversifying energy resources and the economy a priority. However, to stimulate other industries such as agriculture, food processing, construction and technology, Nigeria needs electricity. Increasing renewable energy and moving away from generators would also reduce greenhouse gas emissions and hazardous particulate matter known as black carbon, Ms. Hommers said. Yet solar mini-grids are no silver bullet. To be sustainable, companies must have enough paying customers, preferably commercial users who demand more power. “We need to stimulate more demand,” Bolade Soremekun, chief executive of Rubitec, said of the Gbamu Gbamu mini-grid. “It’s not just about having lights and charging phones. If people use electricity for productive use, it can earn more money.” Electricity from the mini-grid costs about 150 to 200 naira per kilowatt-hour compared with 25 to 30 naira from the national grid. However, mini-grid power is still cheaper than fuel for generators and more convenient and reliable. As equipment costs come down and companies add customers, electricity prices could come down. And solar can be more reliable than the national grid. If all goes smoothly, actual mini-grid construction can take less than one month — far less time than building a hydropower plant. In Gbamu Gbamu, Rukayat Lawal works at Kadet Agro, a small business that dries cocoa beans in a large metal machine. Over its roar, she explained that the company used to spend at least 7,000 naira for a 30-liter jug of gasoline to dry 100 large sacks of cocoa. Now, Kadet Agro spends about 5,000 naira to do the same work. Ms. Lawal is relieved that she no longer has to spend two hours to go to town and fetch gasoline jugs on a motorbike. And at home, “we use fans, watch TV, we charge our phones,” she added. In the village, people often sleep outside to escape the stifling heat indoors. With solar-electricity fans, “now we can sleep inside,” she said. “We enjoy the solar very well.” An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the establishment in which Olorunwa Eleshin was retrieving drinks from a refrigerator powered by a solar mini-grid. It was the God Dey Hotel bar, not the King Royal Guesthouse.",The New York Times
2018,Some Hershey’s Kisses Are Missing Tips and Bakers Want to Know Why,"Ugly. Inferior. Cocoa confection catastrophe. Bakers had sharp words for the Hershey Company this month after buying bags of Hershey’s Kisses, a popular adornment on holiday cookies, only to discover a flaw that was small in size but a giant eyesore: The tip was missing on each piece of chocolate. Instead of sloping into a rounded conical peak, these chocolates were topped with an unsightly jagged edge. A spokesman for Hershey said in a statement this week that the company was “taking this very seriously.” It was not clear how many Kisses were affected. “We make more than 70 million Kisses a day here in Hershey, Pa., and we want each of them looking as great as they taste,” Jeff Beckman, the spokesman, said. An operations team at the company was “working to improve the appearance because it’s as important to us as it is to our fans,” he added. The problem was noted by Debbie Sheetz of Greensburg, Pa., in a Dec. 3 post in The Wedding Cookie Table Community Facebook group. Ms. Sheetz shared a picture of her peanut butter blossoms, each featuring a tipless Hershey’s Kiss in the middle. “They baked ok but not with the nice pointy tip that I’m used to or expect from Hershey,” she wrote, later adding, “I’m still steaming!!” Other bakers began to respond. They, too, had bought bags of Kisses with missing tips. What in the name of sweet confection was going on? On Facebook, Hershey responded to individual complaints from bakers in several states, saying that the company was looking into it. On Wednesday, Hershey used the broken tips to deliver a message about diversity. The social media post showed Kisses of different varieties alongside ones with missing tips: “Warm hearts this holiday season and take the time to celebrate our differences,” it said. This did not satisfy the buyers of the tipless Kisses. “American bakers want to have REAL answers: What happened, why it happened, what *exactly* they are going to do about it, and when we may expect a resolution to the problem,” Tamsen DiBlasio, a home baker in Baltimore, wrote in a Facebook post on Thursday. She was making peanut butter blossoms this month for a holiday gathering when she noticed all of the tips of the Hershey’s Kisses were gone — the remnants nowhere to be found. “What in the world?” she recalled thinking. In an interview on Saturday, Ms. DiBlasio said she and other bakers would like an apology “for being sold defective products at top dollar.” Hershey receives about 8,000 customer inquiries each month, and in December approximately 2 percent were about the broken tips, Mr. Beckman said on Saturday. Only solid chocolate Kisses were affected, not the filled kisses, which are made by a different production process, he said. All of the solid Kisses distributed in the United States are made in Hershey, Pa., he added. Hershey’s Kisses were introduced in the early 1900s and have become synonymous with its billion-dollar brand. By 2014 an image of a Kiss had been incorporated into the company’s logo. Mr. Beckman did not indicate what might have caused the problem except to say that “there are many variables” in the production process. Ms. DiBlasio, 56, who has been baking with Hershey’s Kisses for more than 30 years and toured the Hershey plant as a child, said it’s a candy that has always been close to her heart. That’s why seeing the broken tips on her peanut butter blossoms made her sad. “Some people might say, ‘My goodness, just eat the cookie, there are bigger things to worry about in life,’” Ms. DiBlasio said. “At the same time, it’s Christmas and you’re putting your best foot forward.”",The New York Times
2018,Some Kotex Tampons Recalled After Coming Apart and Leaving Parts Inside the Body,"The maker of Kotex tampons has voluntarily recalled several lots of its product because of a defect that caused them to unravel upon removal, leaving pieces inside consumers’ bodies, the company said. The company, Kimberly-Clark, said in a statement that the defect has caused an unknown number of consumers to seek medical attention to remove pieces left inside their bodies. There have also been a “small number” of reports of infections, vaginal irritation and injury, the statement said. The recall was limited to specific lots of U by Kotex Sleek Tampons, regular absorbency, which were manufactured between Oct. 7, 2016, and Oct. 16, 2018, and distributed between Oct. 17, 2016, and Oct. 23, 2018, the company said. Consumers can report problems to the Food and Drug Administration. Whether consumers could get a refund, the total number of tampons covered in the recall and the exact nature of the defect were not immediately clear. A company representative could not be reached on Sunday. Dr. Jill Maura Rabin, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, said most people who use tampons do not have an issue with them. “You need to know your body,” she said. “This isn’t a call to stop using tampons. It’s a call to know your body. Tampons have been around for a very long time and are fairly safe.” In her 33 years of practicing obstetrics and gynecology, Dr. Rabin said she had never heard of a tampon unraveling. “The potential is that something has fallen apart and there are many different sizes and pieces and it is going to be really hard for someone to remove it,” she said. “You do not know how the tampons are put together,” she said, noting that it could have chemicals or glues that may harm the vagina. Menstrual equality, which promotes the idea that people who menstruate should have free access to feminine hygiene products and deal with their menstruation with dignity, has taken center stage and given a rise to more choices. Companies such as Lola and Cora, which make tampons from organic cotton, some of which are free of the customary plastic applicators, and Thinx, which makes underwear with built-in menstruation protection, highlight modernized ways to handle menstruation. Still, Dr. Rabin urged people not to desert tampons because of the recall. “Companies that have been manufacturing tampons are reputable,” she said. “You don’t want to completely abandon something that for the most part is fairly safe.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Some Old Acquaintances Are Being Forgot,"The conversation It’s the end of an era on Capitol Hill. What about in the White House? Ms. Collins and Mr. Stephens are opinion columnists. They converse every other week. Gail Collins: Bret, I feel sort of obliged to ask you about the looming government shutdown. But I will totally forgive you if your eyes glaze over. Bret Stephens: I think it’s safe to say that nobody ever tried “How do you feel about the looming government shutdown?” as a pickup line. Gail: I dunno. In this administration it probably beats “Have you been subpoenaed yet?” Bret: Ha. And the presidential adviser Stephen Miller does seem to imagine a government shutdown is some sort of aphrodisiac. It really takes someone with his special brand of charm to suppose that throwing hundreds of thousands of government employees out of work days before Christmas is going to be a political winner. And all for the sake of a border wall that Americans oppose 57 percent to 38 percent, according to one recent poll. But I guess this tells us how Donald Trump intends to spend the next two years of his presidency, in full “Animal House” mode: that a “really futile and stupid gesture be done on somebody’s part.” Gail: Hey, this will probably be our last conversation until the new year. New Congress! How do you feel about the Dems taking over? I know anything that makes Trump unhappy tends to cheer you up, but this gang is also going to be raring to do something big on health care, more government support for college education, more environmental regulations and — you know, all my stuff. You can’t be totally thrilled, can you? Bret: The conservative in me is usually happy with divided government. To (over)generalize: A government that gets as little done as possible is what allows everyone else to get as much done as possible. Plus, I’m happy that the House Democrats will have subpoena powers to investigate Trump and make it much more difficult for him to quash whatever report Robert Mueller is preparing. As for legislation, you know as well as I do that nothing House Democrats propose is going to make it past Mitch McConnell’s Senate. It works the other way around, too, obviously, if that’s any consolation. In the meantime, all they have to do is keep the government funded more or less while we start assessing the candidates. Speaking of which, how do you feel about Joe Biden? He already seems to be the front-runner, at least in Iowa. Gail: Everybody talks about his age, which isn’t an overwhelming concern if you presume he’ll pick a very capable running mate. But the big worry, as our colleague Frank Bruni has pointed out, is that this is a guy who’s run for president before. A lot. And pretty much disastrously. But everybody does like Biden, so that would certainly be a great change of pace. Do you have a Democratic favorite? Bret: Er, Biden. I thought Frank made a terrific case against Biden’s candidacy, with one quibble: Who else? Every other contender would need at least a year of on-the-job training, which is something the country and the world will scarcely be able to afford after four years of Trumpism. Gail: Well, from my side there’s the memory of Barack Obama’s candidacy, coming out of just two years in the Senate. Bret: Well, Obama was one of a kind. But his missteps also helped galvanize the Tea Party in 2009, a Republican House in 2010, a G.O.P. Senate in 2014, the collapse of the Democratic Party at the state level, and Trump after that. I see Biden as the Democratic answer to George H.W. Bush — a statesmanlike presence who could work with the opposition without rancor and leave the office and country better than he found it. It would be even better if Biden ran with a younger person, like Mitch Landrieu or Amy Klobuchar, with a promise to serve only four years and then make way. Then again, I’m sure nothing endears me less to our liberal readers than me telling them who to nominate. Handicap the field for us. Warren? Harris? Booker? Beto? Gail: No, no. It’s too early for picking favorites. The great thing is that you have a ton of people — almost all with at least Obama-level experience — who are going to have more than a year to run around the country and make their pitch. I want to relax and watch the show. Speaking of relaxing, a lot of Republicans are retiring from the field, probably from Trump exhaustion. Biggest name is Paul Ryan, the House speaker, former vice-presidential nominee and in my experience the one lawmaker who smart, responsible conservatives always used to get gooey-eyed over. He’s only 48 but just has “loser” written all over him. What ever happened to the guy who was going to pare down the deficit, enact compassionate conservative poverty programs and make government smart again? Bret: History will remember Paul Ryan as the mouse that squealed. You might say that Ryan was born a generation too late. He should have joined the House at the start of the Reagan era, when his brand of genial, wonky conservatism had an ally in the president. Instead, he made it to the summit of the Republican Party when the rank-and-file turned on everything he claimed to stand for. That was his political tragedy. His political disgrace is that, when it happened, he hedged his bets. If he ever writes a memoir, it would be interesting to hear his rationalizations. It’s a dirty job but someone has to do it? If not me, the other guys are worse? Hey, Trump might be a raging jerk and textbook racist, but why let something like that get in the way of historic corporate tax reform? I don’t know: Homo sapiens is usually at his most inventive when making excuses for himself. Gail: I know you aren’t surprised that I was never a Ryan fan. But there is something attractive about the idea of a really committed fiscal conservative who’s willing to risk his or her popularity for the principle of balanced budgets. Instead you’ve got all these guys who howl about giving food stamps to the working poor and then happily ax a couple of trillion dollars from the national revenue. Is there anybody out there you see replacing the imaginary principled-Paul Ryan shoes? Bret: You’re asking the question as I’ve been reading a terrific new biography of Winston Churchill by the British historian Andrew Roberts. One of his most incisive points is that Churchill was able to lead Britain in the dark days of 1940 because he had been such a consistent critic of appeasement in the 1930s, when it made him so unpopular. He had credibility when the crisis came. Today, I don’t think there’s a single elected Republican who can say that. I’ll admit I’ve got a soft spot for Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, because he’s smart and sane and clearly detests Trump. And Nikki Haley, the only person to inhabit, and leave, the Trump administration with honor and reputation intact. I’ve also always liked Mitch Daniels, the former Indiana governor who now leads Purdue. Otherwise, I’m increasingly of the view that, like the proverbial village in Vietnam, the Republican Party needs to be destroyed in order to be saved. Gail: In the spirit of the holiday season let me be fair and admit I don’t see a whole lot of Winston-Churchill-caliber Democrats at the moment, either. But hope springs eternal. Bret: Speaking of the holidays, you got a gift: Ryan Zinke resigned! What with Scott Pruitt gone and Jeff Sessions gone and Tom Price gone and Rex Tillerson gone and John Kelly going, it’s beginning to feel like, oh, a season of “The Apprentice.” Now there’s an idea bubbling that Trump himself might choose not to run in 2020, pre-empting defeat by claiming Mission Accomplished. Knowing what you do about the president’s character, do you think this is at all likely? Gail: I might if he didn’t have to worry about being greeted on the way out of the White House door by 20 people bearing subpoenas. Bret, we’re going to have so much action over the next year — the Mueller report, hearings by the House Democrats, and what to me is the real biggie, the investigation by the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York into Trump’s business practices. Plus, of course, the inevitable resignation of another dozen or so cabinet members. Can’t wait to converse about it all. Meanwhile, have a happy new year. If you’re holding any parties, don’t invite Paul Ryan. Bret: I won’t be inviting Ted Cruz, either. Happy sledding.

2018,Some Words Defy Translation. Angela Merkel Showed Why.,"BERLIN — Some words can’t be translated easily. But they can cross national borders, lose their original context along the journey, assume different meanings and crop up in unlikely places. This week, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany proved that point — memorably. Speaking at a technology conference on Tuesday, Ms. Merkel, known as a staid, no-drama politician, told a self-deprecating anecdote about being widely mocked online five years ago after she described the internet as some mysterious expanse of “uncharted territory.” She chuckled at the memory of the digital blowback. “It generated quite a shitstorm,” she said, using the English term — because Germans, it turns out, do not have one of their own. That, as you might imagine, stirred yet another online reaction, at least among many English speakers in Britain and the United States. “I can die happy now that Merkel has used the word,” Anne McElvoy, a senior editor with The Economist, wrote on Twitter. The writer David Simon wondered why the Germans had not devised their own term. “These guys have a word for everything,” he said on Twitter. Ms. Merkel is in the twilight of her political career, with her successor as leader of the German conservatives expected to be named on Friday. It would be tempting to interpret her word choice as a devil-may-care gesture from a politician suddenly unconcerned with appearances. But, no. Ms. Merkel has actually used the word a number of other times in public. As do many other Germans. It was adopted into the country’s standard dictionary, Duden, in 2013. The listing defining the word, which is capitalized in the German, noted that it originated from the English. But its meaning in German is a little more specific: It denotes a “storm of outrage” on the internet, such as blowback generated over social media. Ms. Merkel is cited as having first used the word in 2012 in a town-hall meeting in Heidelberg, and some credit that for contributing to its acceptance among German speakers. Most Germans remain unaware that in English, the word is considered a vulgarity, and its use is not limited to internet outrage. Michael Steen, the head of media relations for the European Central Bank, wrote on Twitter that he had been trying to explain to his German colleagues “for at least five years” that it “isn’t really O.K. in English” to use the term. The word’s casual use in German is interesting to linguists, given its somewhat taboo nature in English, said Anatol Stefanowitsch, a professor of English linguistics at the Free University in Berlin. But taking such a word out of its original context shifts — and softens — its meaning, he said, making its use acceptable in the new language. “I’m sure she wouldn’t use a direct German translation,” Mr. Stefanowitsch said of the chancellor. “But she can use a word like this in English, because it does not have the associations that have grown over time in the original language.” Exactly how the term came to find a home in Germany remains a matter of debate. Some credit the author John Irving for its introduction. He used the word in 2006 to describe the outcry in the German news media after the Nobel laureate Günter Grass revealed that he had been a member of the Waffen-SS during World War II. Linguists see a more likely scenario. German speakers, they suggest, saw it being deployed online in English in the context of social media outcry and simply adopted it. A few Germans tried to coin phrases to explain the internet phenomenon, but none caught on. “This one stuck around,” Mr. Stefanowitsch said. Modern English has benefited greatly from countless German words that have made their way into daily use, including “angst,” “zeitgeist” and “über,” each with slight variations on their original meaning. As one English speaker noted on Twitter, the imported word could be seen as a thank you to the German language. “A sign of gratitude,” he wrote, “for ‘schadenfreude.’”",The New York Times
2018,Some of the Popular Images and Themes the Russians Posted on Social Media,"Using an array of accounts on multiple platforms and targeting a variety of demographics, the Russians have generated millions of interactions with their posts. When Russia targets Americans on social media, it has political goals: in 2016, to damage Hillary Clinton and help elect Donald J. Trump; since then, to press Russian views on issues like the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine; and in the future — who knows? To wield influence, Russian online operators must first build an audience. Posing as Americans, they have to persuade Americans to pay attention and give them at least a modicum of trust. Two reports prepared for the Senate Intelligence Committee and released on Monday shed some light on how Russia does it. The reports identify some of the most popular of the images and themes created by the Internet Research Agency, which is based in St. Petersburg, Russia, and owned by a businessman with close ties to President Vladimir V. Putin. [Read more about the reports here.] Here are a few of the Russians’ greatest hits. “At least 50,000 homeless veterans are starving dying in the streets, but liberals want to invite 620,000 refugees and settle them among us. We have to take care of our own citizens, and it must be the primary goal for our politicians!” 640,390 ‘Shares’ Using a weathered veteran’s face, this post contrasted the desperate condition of many American veterans with the supposedly more fortunate fate of refugees, using a number that Mr. Trump had cited in an attack on Mrs. Clinton. (The number was judged by PolitiFact to be false). Like a huge number of posts, it appealed to conservatives, used dubious statistics and tapped into the presidential election two months away. Despite its somewhat awkward name — the Russian meme makers were not native speakers of English, after all — the Facebook page called “Being Patriotic” garnered 6.3 million “likes,” presumably from Americans who believed they were supporting fellow patriots. 87,750 Likes The Internet Research Agency trolls sought to tap into powerful currents of emotion and opinion in the American electorate. Not surprisingly, one of those currents was faith. This simple image, like the veteran post above, presents a standoff between opposing forces — not veterans vs. refugees this time, but Christians vs. nonbelievers. By offering Instagram users the choices of liking the image or scrolling on, the Russian operators set up a gentle test of allegiance: Surely they would want to join the Army of Jesus! “PLEASE HELP THIS VIDEO GO VIRAL. THESE COPS CAN BEAT UP INNOCENT MAN, GET AWAY WITH MURDER EVEN WHEN IT`S CAUGHT ON CAMERA JUST BECAUSE THEY WEAR A ‘MAGICAL’ BADGE AND GUN.” 539,012 Shares In this authentic video footage, which circulated widely on the web, three white police officers hold down a black man and one officer punches him repeatedly in the head while trying to put handcuffs on him. Blacktivist was one of 30 Facebook pages created by the Internet Research Agency and devoted to African-American themes. The Russians were exploiting a powerful, legitimate grievance then getting extensive coverage: brutal treatment, or shootings, of unarmed black men at the hands of the police. Such posts build an audience and cement a connection to that audience. Then the same page would have an interested audience ready when the Internet Research Agency posted political messages like those it had used in the 2016 campaign: that Mrs. Clinton was hostile to African-American interests, or that black voters should boycott the election. “What is your color? @expressiontees @kahmune #blackexcellence #blackpride #blackandproud #blackpower #africanamerican#melanin #ebony #panafrican #blackcommunity #problack #brownskin #unapologeticallyblack #blackgirl #blackgirls #blackwomen #blackwoman.” 254,179 Likes After the 2016 election, the Russian trolls did not stop their work — and on Instagram they actually stepped it up. Many of the posts aimed at African-Americans, like this one, were essentially apolitical and carried heartwarming messages. As in many of the Internet Research Agency memes, the image and message were not created in Russia but taken from elsewhere: in this case, an advertisement for a black-owned footwear company named Kahmune. Experts who have studied the Internet Research Agency say such posts build a loyal audience, essentially preparing the ground for whatever future political message the Russian government may want to spread. The Black Matters theme was first created on a Facebook page in June 2015. But in the months that followed, Internet Research Agency operators spread the same brand across many platforms: Google+, Twitter and Instagram, where @blackmattersus drew 28,466 followers and 1,929,855 engagements — likes and shares. A YouTube channel with the same name posted 95 videos. There were Facebook and Google ads. A podcast ran on SoundCloud linked to a blog on Tumblr. Like any commercial enterprise, the Russian troll factory built an image and brand name using every possible online tool — all of them provided by American companies.",The New York Times
2018,Sometimes the Road Less Taken Also Leads to the N.B.A.,"At the Knicks’ practice facility in Tarrytown, N.Y., earlier this week, there were good fouls, bad fouls and push-ups. It all had to do with the rookie center Mitchell Robinson, whose defense in the first two months of his N.B.A. career has ranged from dazzling, as in nine blocks against Orlando, to disastrous, as in six fouls in nine minutes against New Orleans. So Knicks Coach David Fizdale made a deal with Robinson. “If he doesn’t do the foul where his hands are down, I got to do push-ups,” Fizdale said. “And if he does, then he has to do push-ups. So you might see my body change here. I’m about to get in shape, man. I hope I’m doing push-ups. Trust me, I hope.” The Knicks took a gamble on the 7-foot-1 Robinson when they selected him in the second round of the June draft with the 36th pick over all. He was the only player in this year’s draft who did not play in college, overseas or in the N.B.A.’s developmental G League. Instead, Robinson took a year off from organized basketball after high school to get ready for the draft. Considered a top recruit coming out of Chalmette High School in Louisiana, Robinson committed to Western Kentucky, left campus before the season started, considered other colleges and then returned briefly to the Hilltoppers before finally deciding to skip college altogether. By that point, playing overseas or in the G League wasn’t an option. His muddled path led to him falling into the draft’s second round. “I probably would have been a different draft pick if I went to Western Kentucky,” Robinson said. “But I think I ended up in a good spot with the New York Knicks. I fell into good hands.” The N.B.A.’s one-and-done rule continues to draw a lot of criticism and could be repealed in the next few years, but until it is, players have to be 19 years old and a year out of high school before being eligible for the N.B.A. That yearlong gap has led to unconventional paths to the N.B.A., including Robinson’s improvised sabbatical and a decision by Darius Bazley to sign with a prominent agent and secure an internship and shoe deal at New Balance while he waits to become eligible for the league. But do these less traditional paths to the N.B.A. ultimately matter if the end result — a spot on an N.B.A. roster — is the same? “Yeah, it matters,” Fizdale said. “Absolutely it matters. There’s no other way to substitute playing for a year, especially at that age. That’s a big development year, especially for a young kid. Same with Emmanuel. He didn’t play a lot of games over in China, so he basically missed a year of competition learning basketball and the ins and outs of five-on-five competition.” Fizdale was referring to Knicks guard Emmanuel Mudiay, who was also a top prospect coming out of high school, in Texas. After committing to play for Larry Brown at Southern Methodist, however, he decided to instead accept a one-year, $1.2 million deal to play for the Guangdong Southern Tigers, one of the premier teams in the Chinese Basketball Association. “When I made that decision, our lives changed,” Mudiay said in explaining his decision. “My mom was working a few jobs at a time. We were on food stamps. I barely got to see her at times. Everyone was doing everything they could to get by.” Playing in China was another stop on an arduous journey. Mudiay was born in the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire). After his father died when he was young, the family emigrated to Dallas, where his mother raised her three sons. But Mudiay’s time in China was challenging, too, in part because he was sidelined for three months after an ankle injury. Still, he said he wouldn’t change a thing. “That decision was strictly for her,” he said in reference to his mother. “I didn’t even need that money. I’d rather give that all to her.” In the 2015 draft, Denver selected Mudiay with the seventh overall pick. But after failing to meet the team’s expectations, he was traded to the Knicks in a three-way deal last February. Now a regular in Fizdale’s revolving lineup, Mudiay is averaging 12.9 points and 3.3 assists a game after a career-high 34 points and 8 assists on Friday night in a 126-124 overtime win at Charlotte. “He’s really coming along,” Fizdale said. “He’s really taken some long strides from where he was until now.’’ It’s also easy to forget that Mudiay is only 22, given his circuitous route to the Knicks. “People think I’m 28 or 29,” he said. “Even guys on the team.” Those teammates, including Robinson, have had a challenging time this season. The Knicks are 9-21 heading into Sunday’s game in Indiana against the Pacers, and their only star, Kristaps Porzingis, is still recovering from the serious knee injury he sustained last February. But what the Knicks do have, at least, is potential, since so many players are still so young. Like Mudiay, Allonzo Trier, a 6-5 guard who has been one of the bigger surprises in the league this season, is just 22. The undrafted rookie, who played three seasons at Arizona, signed a two-year deal with the Knicks on Thursday that is worth $7 million. In June’s draft, the Knicks opted for Robinson over Trier with their second-round pick given their need for a big man. And in light of his time away from competitive basketball, Robinson, who is just 20, has been the team’s most ambitious work in progress the last few months. Against Charlotte on Friday, he sprained his ankle and had to leave the game. X-rays were negative, but for now he will do his learning on the sideline, still trying to make up lost time. “We probably coach him the hardest because he’s the most raw out of all of them, but he’s a joy to work with,” Fizdale said. “Can you imagine that? You come out of high school and you sit out for a whole year and now you’re standing in the middle of Madison Square Garden.” Or else doing push-ups. Though the push-up agreement between Fizdale and Robinson has been limited to practices, the coach isn’t ruling out a game-time “give me five” if the reach-in fouls continue. “I might make him do it if he gets a couple in a row,” Fizdale said. “In front of the whole arena.”",The New York Times
2018,Son of Yemeni Mother Dies Soon After She Won Visa Battle With U.S. to See Him,"A Yemeni mother who fought to obtain a visa waiver to travel to California to see her terminally ill 2-year-old son was finally reunited with her only child just over a week ago. On Friday night her son, Abdullah, died at the U.C.S.F. Benioff Children’s Hospital in Oakland, where he was being treated for hypomyelination, a genetic degenerative brain condition, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim advocacy group known as CAIR, said on Saturday. “We are heartbroken. We had to say goodbye to our baby, the light of our lives,” Abdullah’s father, Ali Hassan, said in a statement. “We want to thank everyone for your love and support at this difficult time.” The family’s plight received widespread attention in the news media and drew support from three members of Congress who wrote a letter to the State Department asking for an expedited decision on the visa waiver. In October, the boy and his father journeyed from Cairo to Stockton, Calif., in search of better care. Mr. Hassan is an American citizen and a resident of Stockton. Abdullah’s mother, Shaima Swileh, a Yemeni citizen, could not go to California because people from Yemen were barred from entering the United States under President Trump’s travel ban. Seven countries are included in the ban, most of them predominantly Muslim. Obtaining a visa to visit the United States can be a long and arduous process. The couple were married in Yemen in February 2016, and the next year they traveled to Cairo to apply for an I-130 visa, or a visa for a relative who is not American. Ms. Swileh had her first interview at the United States Embassy in Cairo in November 2017. Ms. Swileh went to the embassy for her second interview in January, and was told that because of the travel ban, her application could not proceed unless she qualified for a waiver, according to Mr. Hassan’s lawyer. In August, she had a third interview and was told that the State Department was reviewing her eligibility. During this time Abdullah’s condition worsened, so Mr. Hassan brought his son to the United States without his wife. In December, the Sacramento Valley office of CAIR and a law firm specializing in immigration filed a lawsuit in federal court stating that the embassy in Cairo had purposely delayed a decision on Ms. Swileh’s application before the travel ban went into effect. “This case is a perfect example of how the waiver process is a sham,” Jennifer Nimer, one of the family’s lawyers, said in a statement this month, adding that the embassy had “callously ignored over 28 desperate pleas for help from the family over the past year and even the expedite requests filed by the prior attorney, which contained medical documentation showing that the child was on the verge of death.” The State Department granted her a visa waiver on Dec. 18. On Dec. 19, Ms. Swileh arrived in California and traveled to the hospital to visit her dying son, who was on life support. “Dearest Abdullah, you will never be forgotten,” CAIR Sacramento Valley wrote on Friday on Facebook. “We belong to God and to Him we shall return.”",The New York Times
2018,"Sondra Locke, 74, Is Dead; Oscar-Nominated Actress","Sondra Locke, an actress who received an Oscar nomination for her first film and starred in a series of movies with Clint Eastwood, with whom she had a turbulent relationship, died on Nov. 3 at her home in Los Angeles. She was 74. Her death, which was not widely reported at the time, was caused by cardiac arrest related to brain and bone cancer, The Associated Press reported on Thursday, citing a death certificate. Ms. Locke’s Academy Award nomination, for best supporting actress, was for her performance in “The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter,” a 1968 drama, with Alan Arkin, based on a novel by Carson McCullers. She went on to star in several movies with Mr. Eastwood in the 1970s and ′80s, including their first film together, “The Outlaw Josey Wales,” and “Sudden Impact,” part of the Dirty Harry thriller series. Ms. Locke and Mr. Eastwood’s romance began on the set of their first film, and they lived together for more than a decade. After the couple separated, Ms. Locke sued Mr. Eastwood twice, turning their breakup into a high-profile court battle in the 1990s. In an autobiography, “The Good, the Bad & the Very Ugly,” published in 1997, Ms. Locke wrote that her involvement with Mr. Eastwood ended up essentially derailing her career. “He’s like the emperor,” Ms. Locke told The Washington Post in 1997. “He always had his own company store. If you were in Clint Eastwood movies, you were in the Clint Eastwood movie business. You weren’t in the movie business. You weren’t part of Hollywood. This became clear early on; people stopped calling. They automatically assumed I was working exclusively with Clint.” Around the time of the lawsuits she learned she had breast cancer and underwent a double mastectomy. Ms. Locke received her big break in the 1960s when Warner Bros. took notice of her during a talent search for an actor to play the adolescent protagonist of “The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter.” Ms. Locke said her entrance into Hollywood had been based on luck. “In Los Angeles, I learned quickly that it really doesn’t make much difference whether you’re the best for the part, or whether you have talent,” she said in an interview with The New York Times in 1983. “It’s a matter of some fluky thing that can’t be described.” She dreamed of developing and directing films herself, but said her professional entanglement with Mr. Eastwood made that goal difficult to attain. “You get into a rut being associated with Clint,” she told The Times. Ms. Locke made her directorial debut in 1986 with “Ratboy,” a somewhat satirical tale of an alien boy with ratlike features. “In sociological terms, he exists somewhere between E. T. and the Elephant Man, as an innocent alien adrift in an unsympathetic world,” Janet Maslin wrote in a largely unfavorable review in The Times. Ms. Locke also starred in the movie. After many years off screen, she re-emerged this year in “Ray Meets Helen,” a romantic drama, directed by Alan Rudolph, about two lonely late-middle-aged strangers (Ms. Locke and Keith Carradine) who meet after separately coming into money. “Filled with imaginative visuals populated by the ghosts of the gone and hopes for the future, the movie is wonderfully, magically humane,” Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in The Times. Ms. Locke was born Sandra Louise Smith on May 28, 1944, in Madison County, Ala., to Raymond Smith and Pauline Bayne, according to a biographical sketch in the Internet Movie Database. Her father was stationed at an Army facility and left before Sandra was born. Sandra took the name Locke from a subsequent husband of her mother’s and grew up in Shelbyville, Tenn. She attended Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro but did not graduate. Early on she worked for a Nashville television station, did modeling and voice-over work, acted in community theater and was married for a time to a former high school and college classmate, Gordon Anderson, an actor who accompanied her to Los Angeles and was later the voice of the title character in “Ratboy.” There was no immediate information on Ms. Locke’s survivors. An earlier version of this obituary misstated the name of a film website on which a biographical sketch of Ms. Locke appears. It is the Internet Movie Database, not the International Movie Database.",The New York Times
2018,"Sono Osato, Japanese-American Ballet Star, Is Dead at 99","Sono Osato, a Japanese-American dancer who toured the world with the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo, performed with the Ballet Theater in New York and then gained acclaim on Broadway in the World War II-era musicals “One Touch of Venus” and “On the Town,” was found dead early Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 99. Her death was confirmed by her sons, Niko and Antonio Elmaleh. In the 1930s, Ms. Osato was a groundbreaking presence in Col. Wassily de Basil’s Ballets Russes, the world’s most widely known ballet company. She was the company’s youngest dancer when she joined, at 14; she was also its first performer of Japanese descent. She danced in the early 1940s with the Ballet Theater (now American Ballet Theater), where her dramatic projection left an impact on Antony Tudor’s ballets. She was Rosaline in his “Romeo and Juliet” and a woman of easy virtue in his “Pillar of Fire.” Ms. Osato received a Donaldson Award for best female dancer for her performance in the 1943 show “One Touch of Venus,” choreographed by Agnes de Mille, which starred Mary Martin as the statue of a Greek goddess that comes to life in modern Manhattan. She was the original Miss Turnstiles — a takeoff on Miss Subways, a real beauty-contest promotion that the New York transit system once ran — in “On the Town,” choreographed by Jerome Robbins, in which three sailors on a 24-hour pass in Manhattan experience the fleeting romances of wartime. But the war years proved a wrenching time for her, notwithstanding her professional success. Her father had been confined under military guard in Chicago as an enemy alien. Her brother, Tim, had been enlisted to fight in Italy with the Japanese-American 442nd Regimental Combat Team. Ms. Osato had just finished dancing as the Lilac Fairy in the Ballet Theater’s “Princess Aurora” on the afternoon of Dec. 7, 1941, when she learned of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. She feared returning for the evening performance. “My heritage had never been hidden,” Ms. Osato recalled in a 2009 interview. “I thought, ‘Oh, my God, people in the audience who had a child in Hawaii. What if someone throws something at me? What’s going to happen if they hiss at me?’ ” The ballet’s management and her boyfriend and future husband, Victor Elmaleh, persuaded her to go on again that night. She danced in a daze — but, as she remembered it, “nothing did happen.” Although she was born and raised in the Midwest, Ms. Osato seemed an incongruous choice to play Ivy Smith, billed as the “all-American girl,” in “On the Town.” Her father, Shoji, was a native of Japan, and her mother, Frances, was of French-Irish background. But Ms. Osato received outstanding reviews when the show, the first Broadway collaboration of Jerome Robbins and Leonard Bernstein, opened in December 1944. She was especially gratified by the reception in light of her ethnic background. As she wrote in a memoir, “Distant Dances” (1980), “It was amazing to me that at the height of a world war fought over the vital political, moral and racial issues, a Broadway musical should feature, and have audiences unquestionably accept, a half-Japanese as an all-American girl.” Lewis Nichols, reviewing “On the Town” for The New York Times, wrote, “Miss Osato brought down the highest rafters when she appeared a year ago in ‘One Touch of Venus,’ and there is no reason to replace any of those rafters now.” He added, “Her dancing is easy and her face expressive.” Sono Osato was born on Aug. 29, 1919, in Omaha, where her father worked as a photographer. She moved with her family to Chicago and became enthralled by ballet at age 8 when her mother took her to see Serge Diaghilev’s company perform “Cléopâtre” in Monte Carlo. On returning home, Ms. Osato attended ballet classes. In 1934 she was taken on by Colonel de Basil’s company at an audition in Chicago. In November 1940 she danced with that company in Manhattan as the Siren in David Lichine’s newly choreographed version of “The Prodigal Son.” “Her exotic beauty and her grasp of the mood and manner of the choreographer make her completely and delightfully right,” John Martin wrote in The Times. Ms. Osato joined the Ballet Theater soon afterward. Although she enjoyed success in New York, the military and the federal government barred her from going with the troupe on its tours to Mexico and California because of her Japanese background. She left “On the Town” in the fall of 1945 and was replaced by Allyn Ann McLerie. She made only sporadic appearances after that, having decided to devote her time to her family. In her later years, Ms. Osato, who lived in Manhattan, was a major benefactor of Career Transition for Dancers, which helps professional dancers train for new careers when their performing days end. In the fall of 2014, she attended a performance of the Broadway revival of “On the Town,” in which her role was played by Megan Fairchild. In addition to her sons, she is survived by three grandchildren. Her husband, Mr. Elmaleh, whom she married in 1943 and who became a real estate developer with many properties in New York, died in 2014. Later in life she split her time between her homes in Manhattan and in Bridgehampton, on Long Island. After the emotional turmoil of wartime, Ms. Osato was exhilarated when Germany surrendered; her father had been freed and her brother had survived the fighting in Italy. On May 8, 1945 — V-E Day — she was looking out the windows of the Martin Beck Theater, where the Navy boys of “On the Town” were still romping through New York in the precious hours before their ship headed off to war. “We saw crowds of men and women, in uniform and out, hugging, dancing and shouting,” Ms. Osato wrote in her memoir. “That day the reality outside in the streets blended gloriously with our glimpse onstage of the preciousness of our todays in the face of our unknown tomorrows. Joy and tearful relief engulfed the theater and the city.”",The New York Times
2018,Sophie Ciszek and Her Exhausting Job on the Bow,"Sophie Ciszek first set foot on the bow of a sailboat in the open ocean at age 2. Her parents, who had met in South Africa during extended cruises, had decided to leave Melbourne, Australia, and take Sophie and her older brother on an extended cruise of their own through the South Pacific. “I was brought up on a boat until I was 5 years old,” Ciszek said. “It’s bred into me.” Now 33, Ciszek has grown up to become one of the premier bowmen in offshore racing after taking part in the last two Volvo Ocean Races and other major regattas. She is competing in her sixth Rolex Sydney Hobart Yacht Race, which begins Wednesday, this time as part of the elite all-female crew of Ocean Respect Racing. “You don’t find many bowmen better than her, gender aside,” said Stacey Jackson, skipper of Ocean Respect. “She’s very good, very strong, very tough as well.” Jackson, a fellow Australian, saw that during the second leg of the 2014-15 edition of the Volvo Race when Ciszek ruptured a disk during a sail change in the Indian Ocean while racing with Jackson on Team SCA, also composed of women. “To watch someone so fit be in that situation was hard for everyone,” Jackson said. Despite receiving painkillers, Ciszek had intense discomfort, including sciatica in her left leg and foot that left her occasionally in tears and disrupted her sleep for nearly two weeks before the crew completed the leg and arrived in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. “That was pretty major,” said Ciszek, who returned to the race after back surgery. “But other than that, touch wood, I’ve been pretty good. I haven’t chopped any fingers off or gone over the side, which is one of our biggest fears. A lot of close calls, but I haven’t gone over, so that’s all good.” Close calls are part of the life of a bowman, one of the most demanding and exposed positions in sailing. “Whether you are male or female, it doesn’t matter, bowpeople are a different and strange breed,” said Ken Read, the former America’s Cup helmsman who won line honors in the Sydney Hobart as skipper of Comanche. “First of all, they are the pure athletes on the boat. The things that are imperative are balance, loving to be soaking wet and being fearless. You’re on the bow with the biggest waves you’ve ever seen in the Bass Strait. “You’re climbing the rig or getting pulled up the rig in the middle of the night if you’ve got a problem. If you have any fear on the water, you’re not going to be a high-end bowperson.” Ciszek enjoys an adrenaline rush and clearly does not mind getting wet: She is also an avid surfer. But hers is not just a job for thrill seekers; it is about thinking ahead, constantly. “Anticipation for sure is the most difficult skill to acquire,” Read said. “But the bigger the boat and the windier it is, if the step-by-step process does not get followed, then you are, most importantly, potentially putting people at risk or putting the boat and sails and equipment at risk. So you have to see the problem before it happens. You have to have like infrared eyes.” Ciszek, who is six feet tall and has a lean and powerful build, gravitated to the bow because of her athletic skills: She played a number of sports growing up in the United States (her father, Joel, is American) and in Australia (her mother, Liz, is Australian). Ciszek trains for her position, which requires plenty of heavy lifting, by doing body-weight exercises like pull-ups and push-ups, but also by doing squats and dead lifts with free weights. “I don’t have to be a bodybuilder, but training the muscles with a bit of weight is definitely helpful just to get that little bit stronger,” she said. “This boat, thankfully, is not a 100-foot Maxi, so I’m able to pull the sails around pretty much by myself. But often sailing with the girls, it takes two girls to do lifting that would normally take one guy, so often it entails a bit more teamwork.” Cardio training is also important. “What you are doing on the bow specifically is very short bursts of energy,” she said. “So you might be sitting down on the back and then all of a sudden you have to run up to the bow for half an hour and work yourself really hard.” Off shore, Ciszek will take shifts at the helm on Wild Oats X, a 66-foot Mini Maxi with a canting keel. “She’s one of the best downwind, heavy-weather helmsmen you’ll find,” Jackson said. But the bow is her primary work space, and in close quarters, like the start of the Hobart race in crowded Sydney Harbor, Ciszek’s role is also to relay information about the boat’s position back to the helmsman and other decision makers. This will be done with hand signals, although there are less subtle means of communication on board. “The most physically demanding part of the job is definitely a sail change,” Ciszek said. “You’ve got to hook on the sheets, the halyard and hook on the sail on every point, and then it will get hoisted. And then you have to get the other sail down. The idea is to do it as fast as you possibly can and as efficiently so the boat does not lose speed. I am often getting yelled at from the back of the boat to hurry up.” On shore, she is drawn to a slower pace, which is why she recently moved to a new home in rural Tasmania, the scenic and bucolic Australian island where the Hobart race finishes. Forty acres of the property are protected land, part of Tasmania’s land conservation efforts. She and her partner live off the grid on the other 10 acres. “Fully solar powered,” she said. “I live on the rainwater, heat my water with a wood-fired heater, get all my wood from my property, grow my own veggies, have some chickens. I’ve always been into the environment and the ocean. It’s always been in my blood. I’ve been sailing since I was 2 years old. So I guess it kind of has stemmed from that, but it’s been really nice the last two years I’ve had this property to try to put words into action and try and live sustainably the best I can.” That is part of her team’s message. Ocean Respect is sponsored by 11th Hour Racing, a group focused on ocean health. Ciszek recognizes that her own sport, despite being wind-powered, is not yet the ideal role model in sustainability, with racing boats made of carbon fiber that are difficult to recycle. “There are a lot of sustainable aspects in sailing, but also a lot that are not,” she said. “But it’s a professional, high-level sport, so it’s a very good platform for spreading the word.”",The New York Times
2018,"South Africa Killings Should Be Investigated, Anti-Corruption Agency Says","JOHANNESBURG — A South African anti-corruption agency has called for a police investigation into the killings of three political figures who had accused their rivals of corruptly diverting money intended for the renovation of a community hall. The public protector’s office said in a report released Thursday that the police should investigate “the root causes” and “motivations” behind the gangland-style killings of the politicians from the governing African National Congress, who had denounced the project as a vehicle to funnel money to local officials and business allies. The public protector also called for an investigation into leaders of the rural town of Umzimkhulu who were involved in the project, which contractors have failed to complete despite spending millions of dollars. The town improperly awarded the contract to renovate the hall, even failing to obtain the proper permits to work on a heritage building, according to the public protector, the government agency responsible for investigating official misconduct and corruption. The killings, which were the focus of an article in The New York Times in September, gained national attention because one of the victims was Sindiso Magaqa, a nationally known political figure. In recent years political assassinations have skyrocketed as corruption became endemic in the A.N.C., by far the dominant political party in post-apartheid South Africa. Anti-corruption whistle-blowers inside the A.N.C. have been assassinated by hit men hired by party rivals, and members of opposing factions have been killed in fights over positions that give access to lucrative government contracts. In the Times article, local officials said that Mr. Magaqa and his allies were locked in a battle with the dominant A.N.C. faction in Umzimkhulu. Mr. Magaqa had accused the town leaders of failing to follow proper procedures in awarding the contract and failing to obtain the proper permits from heritage officials. He also leaked official documents that showed that the municipality had continued to pay a contractor and its subcontractor even though the project was far behind schedule and was making little progress. Town leaders denied any impropriety. After the release of the public protector’s report, Zweliphansi Skhosana, the municipal manager and a rival of Mr. Magaqa, reiterated that he had not benefited directly from the project. He said he welcomed the investigation into political killings because of “perceptions” that they were linked to the project. A.N.C. leaders have shown little appetite to investigate political killings — they are fearful, critics say, that fresh revelations would harm the party’s image with national elections approaching next year. President Cyril Ramaphosa’s police minister rejected an earlier recommendation by the public protector’s office to provide police protection for two A.N.C. whistle-blowers who came forward with information about the killings in Umzimkhulu. Oupa Segalwe, a spokesman for the public protector, said his office lacks the resources to legally challenge the police. The current head of the public protector’s office, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, is considered weak, especially compared to her immediate predecessor, Thulisile Madonsela, who led efforts to expose corruption inside the governing party under the previous president, Jacob Zuma. “She’s being very careful,” Mary de Haas, an expert on political killings said of the current public protector, adding that the whistle-blowers have made “life too embarrassing for the A.N.C.” One of the two whistle-blowers, Thabiso Zulu, an A.N.C. anti-corruption activist, has faced death threats and has been living in hiding for months. Mr. Zulu said he wanted to sue the police to get protection but lacked the resources. “I’m cornered, running out of cash, running out of support,” Mr. Zulu said. “I’m at a level where I say, ‘Come what may.’”",The New York Times

2018,"Southwest Key, Leading Migrant Shelter Provider, Orders Internal Inquiry","Southwest Key Programs, the nation’s largest provider of shelters for migrant children, will hire outside legal counsel and forensic accountants to review its management practices and finances. The decision comes in response to a New York Times article on Sunday that raised new questions about potential financial improprieties at the Texas charity. In a statement provided to The Times Monday night, Juan Sanchez, who founded the nonprofit more than 30 years ago, said the comprehensive internal review would identify potential conflicts of interest and areas for improvement in the charity’s rules of governance. Over the past decade, Southwest Key has collected $1.7 billion in federal grants, including $626 million in the past year. The Times showed how the charity had lent millions to developers to buy shelters and had enriched investors who rented facilities to Southwest Key — including Mr. Sanchez and the charity’s chief financial officer, part-owners of one shelter site. The charity has also stockpiled more than $61 million in cash. [Read The Times’s examination of Mr. Sanchez’s nonprofit empire.] The federal government capped executive salaries paid out from the shelter grants last year at $187,000, but Mr. Sanchez earned $1.5 million as chief executive. His wife, a vice president, was paid $500,000; the chief financial officer, Melody Chung, $1 million. In all, eight people at Southwest Key earned more than the salary cap. Mr. Sanchez said in the statement that he was “disappointed that the article failed to show the number of lives we’ve changed with the significant number of reunifications, and it failed to highlight the good work we do within our schools and our juvenile justice programs.” But he added that the article “brought forth a number of issues that are of concern to me.” In a memo to staff on Monday, he said that anyone asked to participate in the review, including himself and Ms. Chung, would cooperate fully or “face immediate consequences.” But the independence and thoroughness of the investigation will depend on the person leading it, said Lloyd Mayer, a professor at Notre Dame Law School specializing in nonprofit law. “It can be difficult as the outside investigator to write a hard-hitting report to slam the very person who seems to be driving the process,” Professor Mayer said. “Everyone knows who is paying the bills and what the desired response is.” The inquiry comes as the federal government steps up scrutiny of shelter providers, hiring an accounting firm to review their finances. That review is underway, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services said. The F.B.I. is also investigating a former competitor of Southwest Key, the Texas-based International Educational Services, for potential misuse of federal money, according to two people informed of the inquiry. Mr. Sanchez, 71, founded Southwest Key in 1987 in his hometown, Brownsville, Tex., with a focus on juvenile justice issues, helping reform youth offenders in their communities rather than sending them away. As the number of unaccompanied migrant children grew in the following years and a lawsuit forced the federal government to detain them separately from adults, Southwest Key moved into the business of housing minors. It has become the largest shelter operator nationwide, with 24 facilities capable of housing 5,000 children. The children’s shelter system is full, with a record 14,000 minors spread across roughly 100 sites. The Trump administration’s family-separation policy focused intense scrutiny on the system this past summer. Casa Padre, Southwest Key’s mega-shelter in a converted Walmart superstore in Brownsville, became a symbol for the outcry over the separation policy. Children’s advocates decried the shelter as effectively a warehouse for children. But in addition to the questions raised about humane care for minors, the financial transactions behind Casa Padre revealed some of Southwest Key’s unusual business practices. Instead of buying the empty store, Southwest Key lent $6 million to a company run by a pair of Brownsville developers to purchase and renovate it, then began paying $5 million a year to rent it. Mr. Sanchez defended Southwest Key’s practice of renting shelter sites, saying the charity did not want to be stuck with the buildings if fewer children crossed the border. In his memo to employees, whom he called the “Southwest Key Familia,” he affirmed, “We will continue to seek to fulfill our mission to improve the lives of the children and families we serve.”",The New York Times
2018,"Soyuz Rocket Launches Flawlessly, Weeks After Malfunction","MOSCOW — An American, a Canadian and a Russian blasted into orbit on Monday in the first launch of a piloted Russian Soyuz rocket since a dramatic failure in October, when a booster failed to separate smoothly and the crew plummeted to Earth in an emergency return. As Soyuz rockets are now the only means for astronauts to reach the International Space Station, Monday’s launch was closely watched. Had the rocket not reached orbit, the station might have been left unoccupied for a time. But the rocket lifted off from the Baikonur spaceport in Kazakhstan on a tongue of flame and flew into space without a hitch, live video of the launch showed. Never miss an eclipse, a meteor shower, a rocket launch or any other astronomical and space event that's out of this world. “Everything is fine on board,” the Russian commander, Oleg Kononenko, radioed back at one point. About two minutes into the fight, the boosters separated as planned, passing the point where the rocket had failed during the launch on Oct. 11. Russian cosmonauts call this stage of flight the “Korolev Cross,” after the Soviet rocket designer Sergei Korolev and the cross-shaped trails of smoke formed if the four boosters separate cleanly and spiral away, as happened Monday. After October’s mishap, in which an American and a Russian made a harrowing emergency return, the Russian space agency concluded that a single small part — a pin — had been improperly installed and caused the failure. In addition to Mr. Kononenko, a veteran cosmonaut making his fourth trip to space, the Soyuz carried Anne McClain from the United States and David Saint-Jacques from Canada, both first-time space travelers. The crew plans to dock with the International Space Station about six hours after the launch and to live in orbit for six months. The three current inhabitants — Alexander Gerst of Germany, Serena Auñón-Chancellor of the United States, and Sergey Prokopyev of Russia — plan to return on Dec. 20 aboard a Soyuz module that has been docked to the station since June. The two Russians plan a spacewalk to examine the exterior of that capsule, after an incident in August when a hole was discovered in its hull. The Russian space agency has said the hole was deliberately drilled in an act of sabotage, though it is unclear whether this happened before launch or in orbit. The capsule launched in June, but the air began leaking only in August; if the hole were drilled on Earth, it must have been filled with a sealant that later broke down and was sucked into the vacuum of space. During their spacewalk, planned for Dec. 11, Mr. Kononenko and Mr. Prokopyev plan to remove an exterior panel and examine it for traces of sealant in what Russians have called a mid-orbit investigation. The shield will be brought into the station and later returned to Earth, Russian space officials said. The examination has to be conducted in space, as the portion of the Soyuz ship with the hole is designed to separate and burn during re-entry, meaning it cannot be examined on the ground. Russian news outlets have speculated wildly about NASA astronauts sabotaging the Russian capsule. The United States commander of the International Space Station at the time denied the accusations.",The New York Times
2018,SpaceX May Be New Barrier for Trump’s Border Wall,"WASHINGTON — Four years ago, Elon Musk, the brash, outspoken Silicon Valley entrepreneur, strolled into South Texas for the groundbreaking of a site for SpaceX, his private rocket company. Joining Mr. Musk were Representative Filemon Vela, Democrat of Texas, and Rick Perry, who was governor of Texas at the time and is now President Trump’s energy secretary. On that windy September day, the trio smiled and dug shovels into a mound of dirt in front of a large sign: “Future home of SpaceX’s South Texas launchpad.” The rural tract of land that was supposed to be home to a commercial spaceport now stands in the path of Mr. Trump’s border wall. Mr. Musk is just one of the potentially hundreds of private landowners in Texas who would be disrupted by the president’s desire to build a “big, beautiful” wall. The border wall was a signature campaign promise for Mr. Trump, but Democrats oppose it. Congress has said it would provide up to $1.6 billion for border security this year, but Mr. Trump wants $5 billion for his wall alone — and is now threatening to shut down the government without it. Here is where things stand on Mr. Trump’s proposed wall. A year ago, the Trump administration unveiled wall prototypes at the border in San Diego in a $20 million showcase of imposing barriers stretching up to 30 feet high and made of steel bars, concrete slabs and metal spikes. But construction still has not begun on a new wall — despite Mr. Trump’s repeated promises to build it along the nearly 2,000-mile border with Mexico, at an estimated cost of $25 billion. In the 2018 fiscal year, Congress provided $1.6 billion for border security, much of it to repair existing barriers. The Department of Homeland Security has already spent millions of dollars to replace fences in California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. Additionally, last year’s funding was to pay for 33 miles of a new wall in the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas, where 41 percent of all migrants apprehended on the southwestern border are stopped. In November, Customs and Border Protection awarded two contracts for border wall construction there: $145 million for a six-mile levee system in the Border Patrol’s McAllen Station area, and $167 million for an eight-mile levee in the Rio Grande Valley sector. Together, the two projects will mark the first brand-new section of wall to be built under the Trump administration. Construction is expected to begin in February. The new wall in the Rio Grande Valley could potentially encroach on hundreds of landowners, farmers and companies near the border. For example, the six miles of wall near the Texas border city of McAllen is slated to cut through a 100-acre butterfly refuge, blocking access to the wildlife sanctuary and, effectively, shutting it down. And then there’s SpaceX. Its launch site is still under construction in Boca Chica Village, a small community wedged between the border town of Brownsville and the Gulf Coast. In an email, James Gleeson, a SpaceX spokesman said Customs and Border Protection and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, recently asked to conduct a survey on the property. “At this time, SpaceX is evaluating the request and is in communication with D.H.S. to further understand their plans,” Mr. Gleeson said. First, Congress must approve the funding — and Mr. Trump faces an uphill battle in getting it. Most Democrats have questioned whether a wall will, in fact, stop migrants from illegally entering the United States. Even some Republicans doubt its utility. Representative Will Hurd, Republican of Texas, has called the wall the “most expensive and least effective way to secure the border.” But even if Congress approves the amount Mr. Trump wants, construction most likely will stall — perhaps indefinitely. That’s because seizing property from landowners is a legally tricky process that can take years. Most of the land along the border where Mr. Trump wants to build the wall is in Texas, and is privately owned — as Kevin K. McAleenan, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, confirmed to senators on Tuesday. And landowners who oppose the wall, and may not take kindly to seeing their property appropriated, are likely to try to block it in court. Legal challenges by landowners who objected when the administration of President George W. Bush tried to build a border wall in South Texas in 2008 have dragged on for over a decade. There are still 82 cases pending from that time, according to Efrén Olivares, a lawyer with the Texas Civil Rights Project in Alamo, Tex., who is representing several landowners.",The New York Times
2018,Spices. Soil. Worn Photos. These Are the Objects Unidentified Migrants Left Behind.,"lens Rocco Rorandelli captures the lives of the refugees and migrants who died crossing a river between Turkey and Greece through the things they carried Calm on the surface, the Evros River between Turkey and Greece runs wild underneath, roiling with currents that tear apart boats and swallow up swimmers. Yet more and more refugees and migrants are crossing it — or losing their lives trying. Greek authorities say they have been confronting an increase in migrants across the river. According to Doctors Without Borders, more than 10,000 migrants and refugees from Syria, Turkey, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere, including countries in Asia and Africa, crossed the river in the half of 2018. A Greek forensic pathologist told Rocco Rorandelli, a Rome-based photographer, that the Evros has churned up 33 bodies so far this year. When Mr. Rorandelli decided to document the journey of some of these migrants, or, more specifically, what they’ve left behind, he discovered that many of the people who perish crossing the Evros die in limbo and are never identified. They drown or freeze to death — the river is ice-cold in the winter — and their bodies decompose quickly in the fresh water. Or they make it to land only to be killed by trains that run along the riverbanks, or land mines left over from the 1974 conflict over Cyprus between Greece and Turkey. Their clothes are shredded and their belongings are lost to the river. Whatever proof they once walked the earth can fit in your hand, with room to spare: a bracelet, a cigarette lighter, a chewing gum wrapper. In “Traces of Identity,” Mr. Rorandelli, who specializes in global social and environmental issues, documented approximately 150 items people who perished in the Evros left behind. The project recognizes those who paid the ultimate price for a shot at a better life and reminds an indifferent world of the profound risks fellow human beings take every day to escape crushing violence, oppression and poverty. As he photographed objects stored in plastic sandwich bags at a hospital morgue, Mr. Rorandelli was struck by the significance of what the migrants and refugees had left behind. “Unraveling those material memories of dead ones was a ceremonious moment,” he recalled. “There are a few objects that I felt were particularly ‘alive’ in their immobility. A rubber bracelet with the text “I BELIEVE” was one of them. It was the only object found on the body of the victim. Nothing else but this pledge to life. Or a white lighter coated with rust, giving it a sort of vitality. Or dental prostheses, which made me think of the dedication of those who try to give a name to these people.” A few objects especially moved him. One was a carefully wrapped bag of spices. Another was a small plastic wrap inside a leather pouch sewn to the inside of the pants of a body. It contained two bits of soil. “They were found on a woman of African origin,” Mr. Rorandelli recalled. “Those spices, that soil represents the home the migrants left, and cry for restitution.” He also photographed many small scraps of papers — lists of names and numbers, probably of friends and family left behind or of those to contact once in Europe — he said. “The writing is often faded, washed away by the water of the river,” he added. “To me, these represented the dwindling remains of those who died hoping for a better life across the river.” The Evros story is timely — crackdowns on border areas across the Aegean Sea and internal struggles in Syria, Turkey and Afghanistan may have helped spark the latest wave of illegal migration. But after 10 years of documenting the migration flow toward and within Europe, Mr. Rorandelli, a member of the TerraProject photography collective, says he didn’t set out to chase a live story. Migration, he said, is fundamental to the human condition. “Notwithstanding the differences in numbers or geographical location, migrants move constantly between countries and continents,” Mr. Rorandelli said. He added that in a 2018 report by the International Organization for Migration that cited 2015 data, “there were 244 million international migrants globally.” If anything, the Evros story is part of a broader, international narrative — about migration driven by desperation and the world’s continuous hostility to those seeking a better life for themselves and their families. Europe is not alone in its inability to handle migration, as the United States has militarized the southern border, tear-gassed families seeking asylum and deflected responsibility for the death of a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl, Jakelin Caal Maquin, who died recently in United States custody. “The more I get involved with the issue,” Mr. Rorandelli said, “the more I realize that the narrative has to be thorough and not skimming the surface. Mainstream media mostly depicts migration as a series of ‘crises’ — for example, the arrival of a vessel full of Syrians or the expulsion of a group of Tunisians — thus making the audience feel that the scattered presence in the news reflects its sporadic nature.” Follow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

2018,"Splitting With Trump Over Syria, American Leading ISIS Fight Steps Down","Brett McGurk, the special presidential envoy to the coalition fighting the Islamic State, has accelerated his resignation, telling colleagues this weekend that he could not in good conscience carry out President Trump’s newly declared policy of withdrawing American troops from Syria. Mr. McGurk, a seasoned diplomat who was considered by many to be the glue holding together the sprawling international coalition fighting the terrorist group, was supposed to retire in February. But according to an email he sent his staff, he decided to move his departure forward to Dec. 31 after Mr. Trump did not heed his own commanders and blindsided America’s allies in the region by abruptly ordering the withdrawal of the 2,000 troops. His decision comes right after the departure of Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, whose own resignation letter was seen as a rebuke of the president’s actions in the region. “The recent decision by the president came as a shock and was a complete reversal of policy that was articulated to us,” Mr. McGurk said in the email to his colleagues. “It left our coalition partners confused and our fighting partners bewildered,” he added. “I worked this week to help manage some of the fallout but — as many of you heard in my meetings and phone calls — I ultimately concluded that I could not carry out these new instructions and maintain my integrity,” he said. With more than a decade of experience in Iraq spanning three administrations, Mr. McGurk helped stitch together the 79-member coalition led by the United States, which oversaw the battle to take back cities from the terrorist group. He became special envoy in late 2015, during the Obama administration. In a shift from the way the insurgency had been fought during the Bush administration, one of the Obama administration’s core doctrines was that America’s allies in the region needed to take the lead in recapturing territory, with American forces providing only air support and limited logistical assistance. This meant that the ground war to take back key cities captured by the Islamic State, like Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria, took years to mount. And it came down to the 45-year-old McGurk to negotiate alliances and broker military aid to the mosaic of armed groups and governments vying for control of the region. “To my mind, Brett had one of the hardest jobs in government,” said Nicholas Rasmussen, the former director of the National Counterterrorism Center. “His role demanded that he navigate the complexities of Iraqi politics and stitch together a diplomatic and military coalition of states with very divergent interests.” At its height, the Islamic State controlled an area the size of Britain with a population estimated at 12 million people. Under Mr. McGurk’s guidance, the coalition succeeded in taking roughly half of the territory in the group’s self-declared caliphate by the time Mr. Trump took office in early 2017. By the end of 2018, the Islamic State had lost all but 1 percent of the land it once held in Iraq and Syria, leading the White House to proclaim that the group had been defeated even though it is still estimated to have some 20,000 to 30,000 fighters in the region. On Saturday evening, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that anyone else “would be the most popular hero in America” for announcing the withdrawal of troops from Syria after “decimating ISIS.” He added that he did not know Mr. McGurk, and questioned the timing of his resignation. “Grandstander?” the president wrote. “The Fake News is making such a big deal about this nothing event!” One of Mr. McGurk’s biggest challenges in confronting the Islamic State was securing the cooperation of Turkey. Early on, it became clear that the only group in northern Syria capable of fighting the terrorist organization was a Kurdish militia. But brokering that alliance was tricky because of pushback from Turkey, which considers the Kurds in northern Syria to be an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, an outlawed separatist group that has been fighting a decades-long insurgency on Turkish soil. After numerous meetings with senior Turkish officials who wanted to block any American involvement with the Syrian Kurds, Mr. McGurk’s team succeeded in negotiating an agreement. Only once that agreement was in full force did the coalition begin making strides against the militants. That alliance saved American lives, coalition officials say. Four American soldiers died in the multiyear deployment to Syria, though the coalition estimates that the Kurds lost upward of 10,000 troops. Mr. Trump had declared the defeat of the Islamic State in a tweet earlier this past week. Only days before, Mr. McGurk stood in front of reporters at a State Department briefing and promised that America was in the fight for the long haul. “Nobody is declaring a mission accomplished. Defeating a physical caliphate is one phase of a much longer-term campaign,” he said. “I think it’s fair to say that Americans will remain on the ground after the physical defeat of the caliphate, until we have the pieces in place to ensure that that defeat is enduring.” The president’s order to begin drawing down troops placed the envoy in the uncomfortable position of having to tell America’s Kurdish allies that the United States was reneging on its earlier commitment. “Brett is one of our longest serving and most effective officials dealing with the region,” said Gen. John Allen, Mr. McGurk’s predecessor. “His departure, following that of Jim Mattis and others, will leave us less safe at a moment when this president seems unwilling to take, or unable to understand, the ‘best advice’ of his leaders.” Because of his prominent role, Mr. McGurk faced repeated threats from the Islamic State. This summer, he was the target of a wave of assassination threats from Iranian-backed militias and demonstrators, who marched through the streets of Iraq holding banners showing photographs of Mr. McGurk with an X across his face. At the time, he had been working to encourage the formation of a pro-Western government following a presidential election in Iraq, where Iran has exerted growing influence.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Spread the Digital Wealth,"There are plenty of ways to deliver tech jobs to rural communities. Mr. Khanna, a Democrat, represents Silicon Valley in the U.S. House. One key question for the United States in the 21st century is whether noncoastal towns and rural communities, including many communities of color, will be able to participate in the digital revolution. We know that almost all Americans are avid consumers of technology, but many lack the opportunity to do the creative work that fuels our digital economy. At stake is the dignity of millions of people. Within the next 10 years, nearly 60 percent of jobs could have a third of their tasks automated by artificial intelligence. Many traditional industries are becoming digital. Recently, a senior hotel executive described his business to me as essentially a digital one, explaining that his profit margins were contingent on the effectiveness of his software architects. Today’s hospitality vendors, precision farmers and electricians spend significant time on digital work. Economists keep telling those left out of our digital future to move to the tech hubs. Sometimes I wonder if they have ever been to places like Jefferson, Iowa, or Beckley, W.Va. If they visit, they will realize that many people there are not looking to move. They are proud of their small-town values and enjoy being close to family. They brag that their town doesn’t need many traffic lights. And they worry about a brain drain. These places also are not looking to become the next Silicon Valley. They are self-aware enough to recognize that there are benefits for the world’s top engineers and computer scientists to flock to Palo Alto, Calif., or Austin, Tex. They understand why venture capitalists betting millions of dollars would want to be close to the start-ups they fund to have some control and accountability. But the choice facing small towns should not be binary — it should not be “adopt the Silicon moniker or miss out on the tech future.” Although the most advanced software innovation may take place in big cities with research universities, there is a lot of work concerning the application of software to business processes and the administration and maintenance of software systems that can be done remotely. Shame on us for shipping over 211,000 of these jobs offshore to countries like Malaysia and Brazil. Americans have an advantage in doing them because of a cultural understanding of what businesses need and a more convenient time zone. Small towns can also sustain entrepreneurial activity that is tailored to their needs. Consider the fifth-generation internet service provider in Jefferson, Iowa, that was willing to make a bet on investing in fiber to serve a 4,200-person town. Jefferson is not chasing brand-name venture capitalists on Sand Hill Road but is seeking more modest investments in local businesses that will solve local problems. So, what more can we do to make sure rural America has its share of middle-class jobs and businesses that will be the backbone of the digital economy? We need to provide additional funds to existing community colleges and land-grant universities to create tech institutes in places left behind. West Virginia University’s new tech institute in Beckley provides a model, equipping students with practical degrees or credentials that lead to jobs. The federal government also should invest $80 billion to have affordable high-speed internet — preferably fiber — in every corner of this nation. We need to pay special attention to the racial gap in the affordability and adoption of broadband. Our infrastructure should not be a barrier to remote work. Finally, the federal government can change incentives. When awarding federal software contracts, agencies should give favorable consideration if at least 10 percent of the work force is rural. We should, moreover, adopt stronger Equal Employment Opportunity reporting requirements for companies on the number of programmers they hire by country and location. When I was in Beckley to visit the new tech campus, I was reminded of the story of John F. Kennedy’s visit to West Virginia during his 1960 campaign, when coal miners enthusiastically supported his vision for going to the moon. Our nation has always had a love affair with innovation. I saw that spark in the Beckley students, many from coal mining families, who were eager to show off their tech projects. One of the most popular teachers was a Pakistani-American woman, with a thick accent, who was teaching software design. When some of the Beckley students asked me what more they should do to bring tech, I joked that they would be wise to open up a few more Pakistani or Indian restaurants. There was awkward silence and then laughter. If we can figure out how to give more Americans a shot in tech, a shot at the ordinary jobs that don’t necessarily afford rock star status or come with generous stock options but that can sustain middle-class life, then we might just take a step toward stitching our nation back together.

2018,"Springsteen on Netflix, Where Everyone Can Get a Ticket","Critic’s Notebook With Netflix’s faithful film version of “Springsteen on Broadway,” there’s no need to re-review the show itself. What my colleague Jesse Green wrote when it opened in October 2017 still stands: “As portraits of artists go, there may never have been anything as real — and beautiful — on Broadway.” Bruce Springsteen’s solo monologue-plus-concert was sold out far in advance during its entire run, with an average face-value ticket price of around $500. For the last performance (on Saturday, the day before Netflix is releasing the film), resale tickets are currently running from $3,000 to well over $40,000 each. Making the show available for the cost of a streaming subscription is an unqualified boon, a greater contribution to the public good than our civic institutions seem capable of at the moment. Admittedly, the feeling of being in the audience at the Walter Kerr Theater, sharing the distinct but equally electric currents of an unplugged rock show, a cadenced sermon and a shrewdly theatrical entertainment, can’t be replicated. The live experience is inimitable, and the post-show emotional high as you walk out of the theater probably can’t be duplicated, either. But the film, directed by Thom Zimny and shot by Joe DeSalvo at two private performances this year, has its own compensations. “Springsteen on Broadway” has sold out on the strength of its star’s connection with his huge fan base, and the opportunity to see him do a clutch of his best-known songs in a relatively small setting. But the show’s revelation — and the reason it actually worked so well — was his ability to take the stagecraft he’d honed in rock clubs and arenas and transfer it so effortlessly to the theater. It’s a master class in pacing, dynamics, modulation of volume and tone, and the film brings you right up onstage with Springsteen, giving you a more intimate view of his technique — understated, seemingly casual but absolutely controlled — than you could get in the theater. Each expression, gesture, artful hesitation and sly punch line is zeroed in on, framed for our appreciation. Zimny, who served as his own editor, presents the show unadorned, almost entirely without directorial intervention — it’s just Springsteen onstage, joined for two songs by his wife and fellow E Street Band member, Patti Scialfa. The one noticeable strategy Zimny employs has to do with the audience, which is unseen during the first half of the film, when Springsteen delivers a series of vignettes about his childhood and his beginnings as a musician. Zimny films these highly personal anecdotes, and their accompanying songs, in close-ups and medium shots that don’t stray beyond the stage. In the show’s second half, as Springsteen’s text opens up (and loses some of its poetic intensity) to encompass themes like fatherhood, relationships and the current political moment, Zimny gradually opens up, too, showing us hints of the audience members. They finally appear in full during the rousing closing performance of “Born to Run,” and the film ends on a note of community, with the Boss reaching across the lights to shake hands with his fans. There’s a caveat that has to be presented here. Netflix showed “Springsteen on Broadway” to critics in screening rooms before making it available to us online. And the film’s strength — the way it immerses you in a captivating performance — is less apparent on a laptop, or even on a flat-screen television. You’re one step (maybe several steps) further removed from the live experience. That makes it particularly unfortunate that Netflix isn’t offering any public theatrical engagements of “Springsteen on Broadway” — in its own way, it profits from the big screen as much as any film by the Coen brothers or Alfonso Cuarón.",The New York Times
2018,"Sprint, T-Mobile Deal Gets Green Light From U.S. Regulators","A federal government committee and other top regulators in the United States have approved the proposed merger between T-Mobile and Sprint, paving the way for a union between the country’s third- and fourth-largest wireless operators. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States — a body that reviews foreign investments in the United States for national security threats — the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense all agreed to the $26.5 billion deal, T-Mobile said in a statement on Monday. Some investors, consumer advocates and government officials opposed the merger, claiming that the new telecommunications giant would limit customer choices and result in high prices for consumers. Proponents of the deal said it would make the combined company, with about 100 million customers, a competitor that would be able to go toe-to-toe with AT&T and Verizon in the battle to dominate the next frontiers of wireless technology in the United States. John Legere, T-Mobile’s chief executive, has argued that he would “lower prices to attract new customers.” The combination would still need to secure approval from the Federal Communications Commission, which has scrutinized a possible T-Mobile-Sprint merger before. In 2014, regulators at the F.C.C. rejected a proposed merger, concluding that effectively reducing the American wireless market to three major carriers from four would not be good for consumers. The deal remains subject to other regulatory approvals as well. If the two companies receive those approvals, the deal is expected to close during the first half of 2019, according to T-Mobile. In the past, American regulators rejected attempted mergers in the telecommunications industry, such as AT&T’s $39 billion proposal to buy T-Mobile in 2011, on the grounds that more competitors are better for consumers because they result in lower prices and superior services. The T-Mobile-Sprint deal has also raised national security concerns from some lawmakers. They cite a company not involved with the deal: Huawei, the Chinese maker of telecommunications gear. American officials have long labeled Huawei a national security threat. The major telecommunications companies in the United States, including Sprint and T-Mobile, have avoided using the company’s equipment to run its networks. Still, the two companies’ corporate parents are Huawei customers. Sprint is controlled by SoftBank of Japan, while T-Mobile is controlled by its German parent, Deutsche Telekom. Their ties to Huawei may be changing, however. The timing of the approval comes as Deutsche Telekom is weighing a re-evaluation of its purchasing strategy following the ongoing controversy around Huawei. Deutsche Telekom said it was taking seriously the “global discussion about the security of network elements from Chinese manufacturers.” In Japan, government officials have said they are developing procedures for procurement in areas like communications networks and information technology with an eye on cybersecurity. Government officials have denied that the guidelines would single out Chinese companies like Huawei. “This doesn’t mean to exclude particular companies,” Yoshihide Suga, Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, said last week. “It’s extremely important not to procure equipment that are embedded with malicious functions.” Takatoshi Mori, a spokesman for SoftBank, said reports that SoftBank was also reconsidering its relationship with Huawei “are based on speculation.” But he added, “we will consider our future policies while abiding by the government’s policy,” and said it gets most of its networking equipment from European vendors. Western governments, including the United States, are worried that Huawei’s systems could be susceptible to spying by the Chinese government. Australia and New Zealand have both banned Huawei equipment from planned 5G networks in those countries. A top executive from Huawei, Meng Wanzhou, is awaiting extradition to the United States from Canada, in a case that has inflamed tensions between China and the United States.",The New York Times
2018,"Spying Apps, Brexit, Markets: Your Monday Evening Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Wanted: A new White House chief of staff. The hunt is on after President Trump announced over the weekend that John Kelly, above, would leave at the end of the year — and Nick Ayers, the president’s first choice to replace him, declined the job. Mr. Ayers, the chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, said on Sunday that he, too, was leaving the administration. That leaves the White House in another chaotic staffing scramble. According to one study, turnover among senior staff is at 62 percent, far higher than at the same point in the administrations of President Obama (24 percent) and George W. Bush (33 percent). Among the possible successors in the role are Representative Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican; the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin; Mr. Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney; and the U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer. __________ 2. Economic and trade tensions drove global markets lower, with U.S. stocks swinging from gains to losses and back again. The S&P 500 ended 0.18 percent higher, after having dropped more than 1.5 percent. Markets in Europe and Asia ended their trading sessions lower. Investors could face more stock swings in the days ahead, after the S&P 500-stock index fell more than 4.6 percent last week, its worst weekly drop since March. But it’s a good idea to put slides like that in context. The index is still up more than 16 percent since President Trump took office and more than 23 percent higher since Election Day 2016. We take a step-back look at the charts. _____ 3. Facing the prospect of a humiliating defeat, Prime Minister Theresa May said she would seek to delay a parliamentary vote, scheduled to take place Tuesday, on her proposal to leave the E.U. After weeks of bitter criticism and days of debate in Parliament, it was clear her plan would be rejected by “a significant margin,” Ms. May said in an unscheduled address to Parliament, where she was heckled by lawmakers. Above, a protest outside Parliament. Although she appears to have the authority to unilaterally postpone the vote, there was opposition to such a move — adding yet more uncertainty to the process. So what comes next? We examine some possibilities, including a second Brexit referendum, a snap general election or a leadership challenge. Separately, after a fourth weekend of violent protests over economic inequality in France, President Emmanuel Macron promised tax cuts and income increases for the struggling middle class and working poor. _____ 4. American dollars are guiding the fight to contain gang violence in El Salvador. Over the last two years, the U.S. has dedicated hundreds of millions of dollars and dozens of law enforcement and military personnel to fighting gangs like MS-13 that send so many Salvadorans fleeing to the U.S. border. Above, a gang tattoo. The goal is to create a self-sufficient Salvadoran justice system. But the consequences of the effort are difficult to assess. And President Trump’s fiery rhetoric and threats to walk away — including claims that most Salvadoran immigrants are gang members in disguise — have at times endangered his administration’s diplomacy in a region where American involvement has long been viewed with suspicion. Here’s our deep report on America’s conflicted involvement in El Salvador. _____ 5. At the international climate talks in Poland, U.S. representatives defended fossil fuel use, arguing that a rapid retreat from coal, oil and gas was unrealistic. At a panel discussion, President Trump’s energy and climate adviser said it was in the world’s interest to find more efficient ways to develop and burn those fuels. The panel was interrupted by protesters chanting “Shame on you” and “Keep it in the ground!” Above, a protester outside the meeting. But there are signs that the administration has gained some powerful allies. On the panel, Australia’s representative expressed agreement. And the U.S. was joined by Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in withholding support for a report on cutting global fossil-fuel emissions. _____ 6. The world’s coral reefs are being ravaged by warmer oceans caused by global warming. That’s significant because reefs support as much as a quarter of ocean life. But scientists studying the Great Barrier Reef off Australia are finding a reason for optimism. Above, a reef near Lizard Island, Australia. Ocean temperatures surged in 2016 around the Great Barrier Reef, causing severe damage. But researchers found that the corals that survived were more heat-tolerant, and were able to survive a period of extreme warmth the following year. “It’s one enormous natural selection event,” said one researcher. _____ 7. Apps know where you’ve been sleeping. They know where you’re awake. In a fascinating and eerie report, our journalists show how your smartphone apps track your movements and snoop on your daily habits. The practice is increasingly intrusive, they found, as data is sold to advertisers, who spent $21 billion this year on location-targeted advertising. Dozens of companies say the information they collect and sell is anonymous, and that they are interested only in patterns. But we reviewed a database with information from more than a million phones in the New York area, above, that revealed individuals’ travels in startling — and identifiable — detail. Read more about our reporters’ methodology here. Here’s how to tell if apps are sharing your location — and how to stop them. _____ 8. Our ancestors’ suffering may be inheritable, some researchers say. The idea of that field of study, known as epigenetics, is that trauma can leave a chemical mark on a person’s genes, which then is passed along to subsequent generations. One recent study showed that male children of abused Civil War prisoners were more likely to die than their peers were in any given year after middle age. Another showed a link between famine in one generation and body mass in the next. Above, doctors in Annapolis, Md., examining a Civil War prisoner of war. But many scientists aren’t so sure. “These are, in fact, extraordinary claims, and they are being advanced on less than ordinary evidence,” one said. _____ 9. Is too much screen time bad for kids’ brains? A study on children’s use of electronic devices, featured on “60 Minutes” over the weekend, is sure to alarm parents. Early results from research financed by the National Institutes of Health seem to show that heavy screen use is associated with lower scores on some aptitude tests, and with accelerated “cortical thinning” — a natural process — in some children. Above, a child at a trade fair in Cologne, Germany. But the data is preliminary, our science reporter cautions, and it’s unclear whether the effects are lasting — or even meaningful. He answers common questions about what researchers know about kids and screen time. _____ 10. Finally, say “pleas.” The Supreme Court justices lined up in seniority order last month to sit for a class picture, a longstanding tradition when a new justice joins the bench. It can be an awkward and illuminating moment, our Supreme Court reporter observes in a retrospective of judicial group shots, which have been taken since 1867. Photographers have to work fast, and the justices may or may not cooperate. Above, the latest portrait. “It’s a tradition that all the photographers in town look forward to getting a crack at,” our photographer said, “because it’s a historical picture no matter what.” Have an appealing evening.

2018,Spying on the Dog (or Cat) ,"The Fix Do you really want to know what your pets are doing while you’re away? Ever since our labradoodle, Rocket, arrived on the scene earlier this year, our furniture has taken a beating. Sofa corners have been gnawed, throw pillows have been destroyed and sisal baskets have become chew toys. And this all happened while someone was at home to supervise him. Contemplating the prospect of leaving Rocket alone, outside his dog crate, was nerve-racking. So like other pet owners before me, I turned to technology for peace of mind. Surely a pet cam was the answer. Among the latest gadgets vying for a slice of the estimated $72 billion pet industry, these Wi-Fi-enabled cameras come loaded with features to entertain animals and assuage their absentee owners’ guilt, including treat-dispensers, laser-pointing games, and two-way audio that lets you hear and talk to your pet remotely. One device even offers two-way video, so your pet can see you. And it’s all controlled by a smartphone. What could be easier? To find out if pet cams are really all they’re cracked up to be — and to see what our dog would do when left on his own — I installed a few in the living room. One thing I discovered immediately is that they’re highly addictive; it was hard to resist constantly spying on the dog, though he spent most of the time sleeping on the sofa. Here’s what else I learned. This sleek, cube-shaped camera was the most compact and attractive of the bunch. And setup was easy: Just plug it in, download the app and follow a few prompts. When Rocket barked or moved around, a push alert popped up on my iPhone screen. Opening the app allowed me to see what he was up to: usually nothing more interesting than looking out the window or sleeping. But the images from the wide-angle, high-definition (1080p) video camera were always sharp, and could have been recorded, were I so inclined. The device also offers digital zoom and two-way audio — so I could listen to Rocket and reprimand him, if necessary — with very little lag time. But if you want a multiday video history or more advanced alerts, including 30-second video clips, you have to pay a monthly fee that starts at $3. Petcube Play comes with a laser-pointer game that seemed promising, although we were initially concerned about the long list of warnings that accompanied it, cautioning us to avoid “prolonged direct eye contact with the laser beam,” among other things. That didn’t turn out to be the problem, though. The game is supposed to be controlled remotely via the app, by dragging your finger across the phone screen. Rocket was unimpressed; he either didn’t see the laser dot or ignored it. But when we were home and could point at the dot darting back and forth across the rug, Rocket obsessively chased it. We were also able to link the device to our Amazon Echo Dot and ask Alexa, the digital assistant, to play with him. Her version of fun, however, involved encouraging the dog to chase the laser across the sofa and over the kitchen counter. (Not a chance, Alexa.) Petcube also allows you to give your friends remote access to your pets; they just need to download the app. We weren’t that keen on the idea of sharing Rocket (or an inside view of our home), but we did enjoy scrolling through the photos and videos posted by others on the app. The device was fairly glitch-free. I did lose the connection a couple of times while trying to connect to the camera remotely, but refreshing the app resolved the issue. For good measure, I also had David Templeton, an analyst on The New York Times’s information security team, check out the camera to see if it could be easily hacked, and he reported no red flags. Your dog comes when you call him, but are you ready to come when he calls you? In addition to live video-streaming, motion-detection alerts, two-way audio and a built-in treat dispenser, PetChatz has an LCD screen so your pet can see you. For an additional $99, you can buy a PawCall button, which allows your pet to get in touch with you. A light on the paw-shaped button tells the animal when you’re available, and he or she can then press the button to dispense a treat and send you a text message to initiate a call. Don’t expect the dog to be able to do this on the first — or even the fifth — try. Rocket and I went through PawCall’s training routine several times, which involved repeatedly taking his paw and touching it to the button, then allowing him to eat a treat. According to the directions, there is “no verbal affirmation required” because “the treat dispense sound” — a little noise the PetChatz device emits whenever it releases a treat — “is the pet’s audible affirmation.” That may be sufficient for some dogs, but after repeating these steps 10 times and then taking a break and doing it all over again a couple of hours later, Rocket still hadn’t gotten the hang of it. He had eaten a lot of treats, though. In fact, he seemed more interested in the treats than in my face, which popped up on the PetChatz LCD screen anytime I wanted to talk to him remotely. And I couldn’t see his face very well, either. The device, which is a fairly bulky 11 inches tall, is affixed to the wall with screws on top of an electrical outlet, so no cords are exposed. (Alternatively, you could pay $60 for a portable mounting stand or get some zip ties and attach it to a dog crate.) But because the camera was positioned at the electrical-outlet level, I had a hard time seeing the dog’s face remotely whenever he came up close to get a treat. Instead, I caught glimpses of random body parts. Lisa Lavin, PetChatz’s founder, said she had the same issue with her standard poodle, Hattie, and dealt with it by training the dog to lie down before the treat was released, a trick Rocket and I haven’t mastered. PetChatz also offers the option of streaming DogTV through the video screen, for an extra charge of about $10 a month. (With all this, who needs a laser pointer?) When I asked Mr. Templeton, of The Times’s information security team, to test PetChatz for hacking vulnerabilities, one potential weakness emerged: “Customers are vulnerable to someone nearby sniffing their Wi-Fi password during the initial device setup,” he said. In an email response, the PetChatz security team acknowledged this, but pointed out that the window is narrow and the potential hacker would have to be close by: “While it is possible that the password would be susceptible during the time in which it’s entered (say 60 seconds),” they wrote in an email sent through a publicist, “the individual or system aiming to access the information during this time would also need to be inside the same residence/home or yard of the Wi-Fi being accessed.” Like the other devices, Furbo has a wide-angle, high-definition video camera with night vision, two-way audio, and recording capabilities, and the setup is easy. Unlike the others, it has no laser games or video screens. But if your dog is like mine, the treat-tossing feature more than makes up for that. Before flinging the treat into the air, the device makes a clicking sound to elicit a Pavlovian response, so I was able to get Rocket’s attention and reward him remotely. It also connected with Alexa, allowing me to schedule treats ahead of time by saying, for instance, “Alexa, ask Furbo to toss a treat every hour between 3 and 5 p.m.” Rocket became so obsessed with the treats, however, that he nearly knocked the device off our TV console. And while double-sided tape is included to allow you to stick the device to a tabletop, I wasn’t willing to risk damaging the veneer. I also wasn’t sure the tape would be any match for our energetic dog. Moving the device to a higher shelf solved the problem, although the view was slightly obscured. Furbo, like its competitors, will send push notifications to your smartphone when it detects barking. But you can only record videos if you are watching the live stream. That means you might miss the chance to record your pet begging for treats (or destroying the sofa) if you happen to be in a meeting when you get the motion alert. Victor Chang, who founded Furbo’s manufacturer, Tomofun, with his wife, Maggie Cheung, said the company is testing a “dog nanny” service that it hopes will provide a workaround. For a paid subscription, the service will automatically record and save short snippets of video; it will also snap photos whenever the animal faces the camera and will create a highlight video of the animal’s daily activities, among other things. Of more concern, though, was our hacking test, which uncovered several vulnerabilities. “The iOS and Android apps both do not verify HTTPS certificates during account login,” Mr. Templeton told me. That means a remote attacker (or whoever runs your Wi-Fi service) could break your secure connection, and identify and extract your user name and password. In other words, he said, “I would be able to log into your account and watch your live video, and feed your dog treats.” The company said it is currently investigating the issue. “Any vulnerabilities will be addressed immediately via firmware and/or app updates, and we will continue doing so for all devices in perpetuity,” Ms. Cheung said. “The security and privacy of Furbo users’ data is a first-order priority for Tomofun.” To protect users’ privacy, the company releases monthly app and firmware updates and performs regular security audits, she said, adding that there have been “no known breaches to date.” To deter potential hackers, Mr. Templeton recommended plugging the Furbo into a smart outlet, like the WeMo Mini from Belkin (this works for any other smart camera, as well). “If someone wanted to access your camera, they’d have to hack both the outlet to turn it on, and then the camera to see the video,” he said. “This double-hack requirement is an insurance policy against a single insecure smart device.” But “this only works if the outlet and camera are from different development teams,” he cautioned, “and you normally keep the outlet off.” For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

2018,Sri Lanka Court Temporarily Blocks Mahinda Rajapaksa From Prime Minister’s Job,"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — A Sri Lankan court issued an order on Monday temporarily preventing the disputed prime minister from holding office, the latest twist in a political crisis that has paralyzed the island nation. The Court of Appeal ordered Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and his cabinet to appear on Dec. 12 and to explain on what authority they hold office after Parliament voted against them twice last month. The order prohibits them from conducting government business in the meantime. Mr. Rajapaksa said in a statement that he did not agree with the ruling and would appeal the decision at the Supreme Court on Tuesday morning. Sri Lanka has been thrown into political disarray since late October, when President Maithripala Sirisena ousted his prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, and replaced him with Mr. Rajapaksa, a decision that was deemed unconstitutional. Mr. Wickremesinghe and Mr. Rajapaksa both claim to be the legitimate holder of the office. Mr. Rajapaksa is a popular former leader who served as president and prime minister for 10 years and who ended the country’s decades-long civil war in 2009. He has been accused, however, of human rights abuses, nepotism and excessively close ties to China. He lost the presidency to Mr. Sirisena, a former political ally, in 2015. By contrast, Mr. Sirisena and Mr. Wickremesinghe had been foes until they united their parties to defeat Mr. Rajapaksa. Tensions between the two men had been building for the past year, with Mr. Sirisena accusing Mr. Wickremesinghe of being weak and corrupt. With his appointment as prime minister, Mr. Rajapaksa appeared to secure his re-ascendance ahead of presidential elections next year. But lawmakers objected, leading Mr. Sirisena to dissolve Parliament until the Supreme Court blocked him. While Mr. Wickremesinghe holed up in the prime minister’s residence, guarded by hundreds of supporters, Mr. Rajapaksa tried to win over lawmakers amid open brawls in Parliament. Thousands of supporters of each side have protested in the streets of Colombo, the capital, resulting in at least one death. The court ruled on Monday that the damage caused to Sri Lanka by allowing Mr. Rajapaksa to hold office unlawfully would “be irreparable or irredeemable.” The order reinforces two parliamentary votes to oust Mr. Rajapaksa and reinstall Mr. Wickremesinghe, who holds a majority in Parliament. “The triumph of democratic institutions over the whims of individuals is the legacy of the good governance agenda. We will continue to defend the sovereignty of our citizens,” Mr. Wickremesinghe wrote on Twitter in response to the court ruling. Ethnic Tamil lawmakers met with Mr. Sirisena shortly after the court ruling on Monday. In a readout of the meeting, one lawmaker said that the president recognized the court’s decision to strip Mr. Rajapaksa of power and would “take necessary action within 24 hours,” without providing specifics. Mr. Sirisena could not be reached for comment.",The New York Times
2018,Sri Lanka’s Disputed Prime Minister Will Step Down,"NEW DELHI — Sri Lanka’s political crisis appeared to edge toward a resolution Friday when one of the two men claiming to be the country’s rightful prime minister agreed to step down. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa planned to relinquish his claim to be prime minister in an address to the nation on Saturday, according to officials in his party. The current president, Maithripala Sirisena, appointed him as prime minister in late October, but the pair failed to clinch the majority in Parliament needed to secure their power. Mr. Sirisena then dissolved Parliament in November. On Thursday, Sri Lanka’s Supreme Court ruled that the dissolution of Parliament had been unconstitutional, striking the final blow to Mr. Sirisena’s and Mr. Rajapaksa’s plans to take over the government. The legally recognized prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, is expected to be sworn in again as premier on Sunday, members of his and Mr. Sirisena’s inner circles said Friday night. The political upheaval has weakened both the president and Mr. Rajapaksa ahead of a presidential election next year and a general election in 2020. The Rajapaksa family was expected to return to power through both elections, but the turmoil has angered many Sri Lankans and hurt the already fragile economy as the important Christmas tourism season approached. Many tourists canceled their reservations as the political malaise deepened and the national currency shed its value. Mr. Rajapaksa led the country for 10 years until he lost elections in 2015. During his tenure, Mr. Rajapaksa filled his cabinet with family members, including his three brothers, many of whom are now under investigation on charges of corruption and abuse of power. Mr. Rajapaksa’s rule also brought an end to Sri Lanka’s 26-year civil war, although the government was accused of committing major war crimes to end the conflict, an accusation supported by United Nations inquiries. “To ensure stability of the nation, Former President @PresRajapaksa has decided to resign from the Premiership tomorrow after an address to the nation,” Namal Rajapaksa, his son and a member of Parliament, wrote on Twitter on Friday evening. Namal Rajapaksa said his family’s political party would work with Mr. Sirisena’s party to form a broader coalition in Parliament. While Mr. Rajapaksa is expected to renew his demands for an early election in his address on Saturday, the family will probably enter any race with considerably less popular support than it had just seven weeks ago, seen as the chief architects of the recent turmoil. Members of the Rajapaksa family have admitted privately that the crisis has hurt their electoral chances in urban areas and that they were surprised when they were unable to secure enough votes in Parliament to form a government. An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name and surname of Sri Lanka’s current president. He is Maithripala Sirisena, not Mathirpala Sirsena.",The New York Times
2018,"Stabbed by Her Husband, She Tries to Keep the Lights On for Her Children","The Neediest Cases Fund Ana Helfer replays the day over and over in her mind. In the winter of 1997, she had just loaded her car with groceries when she discovered that she needed a jump-start. She called everyone she knew, but no one picked up. So she walked back to her Staten Island apartment to see if someone could help. “No one was around, not one person,” Ms. Helfer, 55, recalled. “But I did see his car in the driveway, so I went and asked him if he could help me out.” The car belonged to her landlord, Brian Helfer. After helping with her car, he asked Ms. Helfer on a date. They married the next fall. Afterward, she said, he quickly became emotionally and physically abusive. “I always think, ‘Why?’ Why didn’t I just call one of the tow companies to give me a jump?” Ms. Helfer said recently in her Staten Island home, shaking her head. “Why didn’t I just sit and wait for someone to come. The hell with the groceries. You go with the woulda, coulda, shouldas, and it eats you away. It does nothing, because it doesn’t change anything.” Ms. Helfer described looking back on that day as “going into a spider web.” “I remember his look — he was smiling, he was happy,” she said, “but lo and behold, you look back, and there’s more to a smile.” Ms. Helfer grew up in Harlem. Her father was a veteran and a custodian; her mother stayed home to raise Ms. Helfer and her sister. She eventually moved to Staten Island and commuted from there to Manhattan, where she was an executive assistant at Bear Stearns. Once the Helfers had their first child, Justin, in 1999, they agreed that Ms. Helfer would stop working. Looking back, she remembers that her husband wanted to marry quickly and have children right away. In addition to Justin, a sophomore at the State University of New York, Oswego, they had Kayla, 13, and Joshua, 18, who has high-functioning autism. Ms. Helfer thought about leaving her husband once when she was pregnant with Kayla, and she told her father that the marriage was troubled. “He says, ‘Come home. Come home. Don’t worry. We have room. You know you can always come home,’” Ms. Helfer recalled. “I started crying because I was like ‘You know something, I can do it, I know I can, I’ll take my boys and I’ll go.’” Ms. Helfer found a mover who could help get her out within 24 hours. But her father died the day after her call with him, and Ms. Helfer felt she and her children would be too much burden on her mother at the time, so she stayed with her husband. Mr. Helfer, a bus driver for the city, controlled the finances, and he would criticize his wife for buying too many groceries and not cleaning the house well enough. If he became angry at the children, she said, she would step in. “He was brutal. He was cruel the way he spoke to them sometimes,” she said. “You don’t talk to children to destroy something in them so young. So if I saw it happening, I refocused him to come back at me.” When he was physical with her, she said, he made sure “you couldn’t get up.” “I would try to fight back,” Ms. Helfer said. “But he made sure he’d hit you and kick you long enough to keep you on that floor.” The police were called once when Mr. Helfer became jealous of Ms. Helfer’s new cellphone. “He picked me up, I mean lifted me up, like a wrestler, and threw me down on the floor,” she recalled. “I tried to keep my wits about me. He kept on hitting, he wouldn’t let me get up. All I wanted to do was not even touch him. I was just scared to stay on that floor. He kept kicking me and hitting me, and finally I got up and I ran.” When she reached a neighbor and called the police, she discovered that a call had already been made. Mr. Helfer had called the police first and accused her of hitting him, making scratch marks on his face to make it appear as if Ms. Helfer had attacked him. “I’m sitting in the front. He’s out by the mailbox, laughing and talking with the police, accusing me,” said Ms. Helfer, who said she then lost hope of pursuing charges against him. On July 13, 2014, her tumultuous marriage hit its breaking point. Ms. Helfer woke up with a burning pain in her neck. “I thought he punched me,” Ms. Helfer said. “I didn’t realize that was the first stab wound.” Mr. Helfer stabbed Ms. Helfer more than a dozen times. “The look he gave was a look that you only see in horror movies,” Ms. Helfer said. Justin, then 15, got a bat and tried to break down the bedroom door. “I heard this scream from upstairs, that kind of scream you’d never heard before,” Justin, now 19, said in an interview. “I started hitting the door hard, really hard with the bat. Those seem to have stopped my father from doing whatever he was doing. He went to the door, opened it, and we were all standing there.” Justin said his father walked right past them. “It was like he was staring through us, like we weren’t there,” he said. When Ms. Helfer woke up in a hospital three days later, she learned that her husband was dead. After the attack, he had driven to the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge and jumped. Today, memories from the past still sneak up on Ms. Helfer regularly. “You could be washing dishes and all of the sudden, boom, you’re in the moment,” she said. “All the sudden you’re reliving that moment, and it’s so surreal.” Since the attack four years ago, Ms. Helfer has received physical and occupational therapy and counseling. In the immediate aftermath, though, her concern was for her children. “I took care of them instead of helping myself also, so what happened was, I ended up losing myself in the process, and I fell into a deep depression,” she said. In addition to the emotional hardship, Ms. Helfer is in financial distress. She is behind on payments for her mortgage and lost part of her Social Security survivors benefits once Justin turned 18. Her other son will also lose his benefits at the end of the school year. Currently, the benefits total $3,570 a month. In October, Ms. Helfer visited the Jewish Community Center of Staten Island to use the food pantry. The center is a beneficiary agency of UJA-Federation of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. There, she was referred to a social worker at Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty, also a beneficiary agency of UJA, to speak about her needs. She received $500 in Neediest Cases funds to help pay her Con Edison bill. This month, the council allocated an additional $800 in Neediest Cases funds for Ms. Helfer’s Con Ed bill arrears to keep her service going. The family still lives in the house where the attack happened because the children told Ms. Helfer they wanted to return home. Ms. Helfer encourages other victims of domestic violence to reach out to someone for help. “Try, as hard as it is,” she said. “You’re scared, but if you can just reach out to someone, and maybe that person can get you all the information to help you out. That person might be the source of you escaping a nightmare.” Ms. Helfer said she hoped sharing her story would help others bring their abuse out of the dark. “It might be the hardest thing they’ll ever do,” she said, “but it’ll be the best thing.” If you or someone you know is being abused, support and help are available.

2018,Staging Reality Winner: An F.B.I. Transcript Becomes an Offbeat Thriller,"Last December, the theater director Tina Satter was stuck at a desk, temping as a receptionist, when she fell down an internet rabbit hole. After reading the New York magazine profile of Reality Winner — the 20-something military contractor charged with leaking a single top-secret document about Russian election hacking — Ms. Satter clicked a link to a blog post about Ms. Winner’s pantyhose, and then another link to a grainy PDF of an official F.B.I. transcript. It recorded the moment in June 2017 when a fleet of federal agents entered Ms. Winner’s Georgia home, interrogated her and extracted a confession. Ms. Satter read the transcript online, but when she recalls it now, she makes the gesture of dramatically flipping pages in the air. “Immediately I thought, This is a play,” she said. “This is a thriller.” Reading the government document through the lens of a director, Ms. Satter saw a title printed across the top — “VERBATIM TRANSCRIPTION” — followed by a list of “participants,” or characters: Reality Winner, whose name alone feels theatrical; the two special agents who interrogated her that day; and a mysterious figure listed only as “Unknown Male.” The transcript was intriguing in its precision. Every stutter, sigh, and stray sound was noted. It was also jumping with subtext: Even as they circled Ms. Winner with an espionage charge, the F.B.I. agents made small talk about the weather, CrossFit and her cat. Everyone there was struggling to act casual in the least casual of circumstances. And then there was Ms. Winner herself, with whom Ms. Satter quickly grew fascinated. Ms. Winner is an Air Force veteran fluent in several Afghan languages. In 2017, she was 25 and working at a Georgia contractor complex, translating communications related to Iranian aerospace. She taught yoga for fun and scribbled on “pretty paper” at work. She tweeted insults about President Trump. She owned guns — pink guns. In the transcript, she toggles seamlessly between high-level intelligence language and jokes about her “resting bitch face.” Ms. Winner seemed to represent a new kind of figure. “I could totally relate to her dismay at living through America over the past two years, and her sort of pop response to it,” Ms. Satter said. “This is such a patriot of right now.” She immediately sent the transcript to a collaborator, the actress Emily Davis, with the note: “You could play her.” Beginning January 4, Ms. Satter will direct Ms. Davis in “Is This a Room: Reality Winner Verbatim Transcription” at The Kitchen. Ms. Satter’s experimental theater company, Half Straddle, has never before taken on a real-life subject. The troupe rarely deals in realism. “Our plays,” Ms. Satter explained, “are usually these wholly made up worlds,” drawn from feminist, queer and adolescent subcultures. But Ms. Winner’s status as a young woman navigating an unfamiliar world connected it to other Half Straddle shows. Ms. Winner opens a window into a new kind of subculture: the banal office grind at the heart of the American security state, which has expanded so relentlessly that thousands of otherwise ordinary Americans have insight into classified material. Thanks to websites that surface the day’s “trending” classified “articles,” which Ms. Winner browsed while bored at work, even top-secret material begins to seem almost public. And while “Is This a Room” is on its face a re-enactment, there are elements of the transcript that pitch it into the surreal, and allow for interpretive space. Lines attributed to “Unknown Male” — dreamlike fragments of loose F.B.I. chatter picked up by the interrogators’ recorder — are all played on stage by Half Straddle company member Becca Blackwell. (The play’s title, “Is This a Room,” is one of them.) Swaths of the transcript are redacted in black, and in the weeks leading up to the premiere, Ms. Satter was still puzzling out how to dramatize them. On stage, the surreality will be punctuated by the disorienting sounds of Sanae Yamada, a musician who has written a synth-based score as well as a pop song about Ms. Winner called “Pretty Paper.” At a recent rehearsal at the Kitchen, Ms. Satter stalked around the bare set in a Mickey Mouse T-shirt, blocking the strange moment when the F.B.I. agents (played by Pete Simpson and T.L. Thompson) drum what sounds like a confession out of Ms. Winner, and then seamlessly return to discussing her cat, who is on a diet. (“Oh, she’s a big girl,” Unknown Male tells Ms. Winner.) Here the actors slowed their speech and tipped their bodies, giving the impression of a mind spinning, as the synth music closed in. And yet the play is grounded in the fact that this all really happened to a real person: a person who is in prison. (After pleading guilty to one felony count, Ms. Winner was sentenced to more than five years in August, the longest sentence ever imposed in federal court for such a leak.) The transcript itself was a crucial artifact in the legal proceedings. Her defense argued that the transcript, and its apparent confession, ought to be barred from court, as the F.B.I. never read Ms. Winner her Miranda rights or told her she was free to leave her home. But the government argued that the transcript proved that the agents had been so “exceedingly friendly” to Ms. Winner that she could not have been forced into talking. Staging the transcript felt like a way to reveal its hidden power dynamics. “There was so much happening right underneath the surface of the language,” said Ms. Davis. The actress shares both a physical resemblance to Ms. Winner and a South Texas background. She sees Ms. Winner as a “vibrant and sparkly person” who became isolated by her work for her country and ended up in a “lonely, vulnerable place.” And she is sensitive to the fact that in the play, she is moving about the world as Ms. Winner while Ms. Winner herself is locked away. Those sensitivities were heightened when Billie Winner-Davis, Reality’s mother, heard about the production and reached out. Ms. Satter and Ms. Davis have since been in close contact with her, and have exchanged letters with Reality herself. Both sides have approach the contents of the play gingerly; Ms. Satter has not asked Ms. Davis-Winner for insights into her daughter, and Ms. Davis-Winner has not inquired about the theatermakers’ process. (She will attend the first performance, with some trepidation: While she is eager for others to learn of her daughter’s story, “I don’t know whether I’ll be able to sit through it all,” she said.) She did assist in one way: She sent a photograph the F.B.I. took of Reality outside her home on the day she was arrested, which inspired Ms. Davis’s costume. In the photo, she’s leaning against a brick wall in jean shorts and canary-yellow Converse. Her hands are clasped politely in front of her and her eyes are turned down. It’s an image of Ms. Winner on the precipice between regular young woman and accused felon. She is outside in the Georgia sun, but the F.B.I. has her in its sights.",The New York Times
2018,Stalin’s Soaring Moscow Towers Sorely Need Body Work,"Moscow Dispatch MOSCOW — Mikhail Posokhin still remembers the lip-smacking displays in Grocery Store No. 5 from his boyhood, when in 1955 his family moved into one of Moscow’s seven new, gothic skyscrapers. More cathedral than marketplace, the grocery boasted marble floors and pillars, high ceilings with elaborate chandeliers and stained glass windows. Fish circled inside a large aquarium, while brightly lit display cases presented rarities like caviar heaped in crystal bowls. Unlike other Moscow stores, milk, sausage and chocolate bars were never scarce. Muscovites came to gawk in droves, even if it was mostly the privileged elite — handed the high-rise apartments for free — who could afford to shop. “These complexes presented a new life never seen by people before,” said Mr. Posokhin, a prominent Moscow architect whose father designed the building. “They were supposed to express the victorious spirit and the grandeur of the era.” That was then. Grocery Store No. 5, in the Kudrinskaya Square tower, now sits dusty and abandoned, some of its broken windows replaced with plywood. Screens erected above the building’s entrance shield pedestrians from tumbling masonry. Up close, statues of muscular men and Madonna-like mothers look mottled. Most of the city’s so-called “Stalin high-rises” — both residential and government buildings — desperately need renovating. They are stuck in limbo, however, over who will foot the substantial bill. Since the residential apartments were privatized in the 1990s, the government considers the owners responsible. The residents, particularly the impoverished elderly who inherited apartments from the now deposed Soviet elite, believe that City Hall or the Kremlin should restore structures considered historical monuments. “In Russia, there is still no culture of owning real estate,” said Elizabeth Lihacheva, director of the Schusev State Museum of Architecture, noting that even people who spend $1 million for an apartment often don’t want to pay one kopeck toward cleaning its courtyard. Ideology inspired the construction of the Stalin high-rises, rechristened for tourists with the more palatable name of the Seven Sisters. When World War II ended, large swaths of Moscow lay in ruins. Stalin thought the city, marking its 800th anniversary, lacked the grandeur required of a triumphant capital. “Stalin was basically building a Soviet Empire,” Mrs. Lihacheva said. “It needed to be expressed in architectural terms.” Prewar plans for a monstrosity called the Palace of the Soviets, topped by a statue of Lenin twice the height of the Statue of Liberty, were abandoned because the swampy ground would not support it. The idea was reconceived as eight buildings, a kind of expansive crown encircling the capital’s strategic points and echoing the Kremlin walls. Then, as now, the Kremlin’s denizens measured themselves in comparison to the United States. Stalin thought people would find Communism deficient if Moscow lacked skyscrapers. Yet simply aping American style would not do, either. “They go to America and they say ‘Ah, the buildings are so huge’,” the Soviet dictator said, according to a 2011 history of the buildings. “Let them come to Moscow and see that type of building. Let them say, ‘Ah!’” The government decree issued in 1947 to start construction ordered that the buildings look uniquely Russian. So the décor is Russian baroque, even if various American landmarks heavily influenced the architects, including the Wrigley Building and the Tribune Tower in Chicago, as well as the Woolworth and Municipal buildings in Lower Manhattan. Some people find the resulting confection magnificent, others eerie and intimidating. The heavy stone cladding and crenelations of their fortresslike exteriors would fit right into Gotham City. On a dark snowy night, with exterior lights casting deep shadows across their imposing facades, one almost expects the Batmobile to come roaring out of any one of them. In a city previously dominated by church bell towers, the buildings’ spectacular scale reshaped the skyline. They became symbols of Moscow and defined the modern face of the Soviet Union. Clones were constructed in various outposts of the empire, including Warsaw, Riga and Bucharest. After Stalin died in 1953, the new leader, Nikita Khrushchev, found the entire project ostentatious, so construction of the 8th building, just off Red Square, was canceled. The rest, costing what was at the time a staggering $500 million overall, were completed by 1957. Each tower comes draped in its own lore. The Moscow State University building, for example, was the biggest of the lot and at nearly 800 feet, was Europe’s tallest building until 1990. Besides various academic departments, its 6,000 rooms housed all students until the 1970s, with beds, desks and bookcases meticulously designed for small spaces. Students describe an unfortunate side effect of decades without renovation — a sharp, chemical smell clings to the dorm and its residents — although this could not be verified as the university did not permit an American reporter to enter the building. “I could always tell by the smell if a student sitting next to me in an exam lived in the dormitory,” said Roman Yankovskiy, a young lawyer who nonetheless loved the building and spent the last three years compiling a book about it. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs tower originally had a flat top, and legend has it that Stalin, passing in his car, found that too American and ordered a Kremlin-like spire installed. Mrs. Lihacheva of the Architecture Museum said that the true story was Stalin only inquired about the flat top. It was the head of construction, fearing the ruthless dictator, who ordered a metal spire jammed onto the completed building. The federal government is paying for a gradual renovation of this building, due to be completed by 2026, with the massive hammer and sickle on the front to be preserved as a historical detail. The government buildings have fared better than the residential blocks. In the 1990s, for example, when factories bought scrap metal by the kilogram, thieves hacked the original bronze Art Deco handles off many apartments in the Krasnaya Vorota tower. The Kudrinskaya Square tower, known as the House of Aviators, housed numerous air defense officers and scientists. Irina V. Pozdeeva, 84, and her late husband inherited an apartment there 14 years ago from her father-in-law, a lieutenant general who had helped develop missiles. The 13-foot ceilings accommodate shelves for about 20,000 books. But the collective spirit of the place has ebbed, she said, with rich, often absentee owners buying up the 450 apartments. This is the building that Mr. Posokhin moved into as a boy. The architect recently designed a giant Art Deco building with a flat top as a tribute to the original vision of the Stalin high-rises.

Built near the Kremlin, the Kotelnicheskaya Embankment building is the only residential high-rise to have been renovated. The city called it “emergency” repair, but residents of other buildings grouse that it got special treatment because important functionaries still live in some of its 700 apartments, including a senior Kremlin apparatchik who reportedly bought almost an entire floor. The KGB, which supervised construction of the Embankment and University buildings, used prison laborers. Some left boards inside the walls painted with the names of their Gulags.

2018,Star Economist at Harvard Faces Sexual Harassment Complaints,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — Before he turned 40, Roland G. Fryer Jr. had earned tenure at Harvard, received a MacArthur “genius” grant and won the most prestigious award for young American economists. He stoked a national debate by concluding that police officers show no bias in the shootings of black men. But his rapid ascent has taken a troubling turn as Harvard officials review a university investigator’s conclusion that Dr. Fryer fostered a work environment hostile to women, one filled with sexual talk and bullying. The findings, reviewed by The New York Times, found that Dr. Fryer had engaged in “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature” toward four women who worked in the Harvard-affiliated research lab he created. In one case, his “persistent and pervasive” conduct contributed to stress that resulted in the accuser’s taking disability leave, the investigator found. The investigator could not substantiate some allegations, including one asserting retaliation by Dr. Fryer. Harvard is still investigating a similar complaint from a woman who worked in the lab a decade ago. That woman says Dr. Fryer made what she considered sexual overtures, then retaliated against her after she rebuffed him. Harvard is not expected to take action until officials have finished investigating all of the complaints against him, according to people familiar with the process. Possible outcomes include a reprimand, suspension or dismissal. As an African-American, Dr. Fryer has been a trailblazer in rising to the top tier of a field dominated by white men. He was, at 30, the youngest black professor to be granted tenure at Harvard. Now 41, he is one of Harvard’s best-paid faculty members, earning more than $600,000, the university’s 2016 tax filing shows. He has brought at least $33.6 million in grants to the university, according to a résumé on his Harvard web page. The sexual-harassment accusations have unsettled the economics profession, which is struggling with a history of bias against women. Dr. Fryer was recently elected to the executive board of the American Economic Association, the most prestigious body in academic economics, and the group says it will consider the Harvard inquiry’s conclusions when they are released. Dr. Fryer told a Harvard investigator that any sexual banter in his office was related to his research and “in the spirit of academic freedom.” He wrote in his response to the complaint that “certainly no one ever brought to my attention that I ever said anything that made any employee uncomfortable.” But in interviews with The New York Times and for Harvard’s investigation, former employees described Dr. Fryer as a bully and the lab as a place where sexual jokes and comments were routine, and where employees were expected to laugh along with the group or risk being isolated. Documents and interviews suggest that Dr. Fryer was told repeatedly over the course of 10 years — by employees and by at least one university official — that his conduct was out of line. A former assistant reported to a Harvard human resources office in late 2008 that Dr. Fryer was sending her unwelcome and sexually suggestive nighttime text messages. Dr. Fryer agreed to change his behavior, apparently on the advice of a university official. But he directed another employee to compile examples of poor performance by the accuser. He refused to write recommendations for economics graduate programs she was applying to, according to her complaint, and all rejected her. The woman’s pending complaint, a copy of which was reviewed by The Times, is one of at least three brought against Dr. Fryer under Title IX, the federal statute prohibiting sex-based discrimination by educational institutions that receive federal funding. One of the cases was brought by Harvard’s Title IX office on behalf of several women. The filing of some of the complaints was first reported by The Harvard Crimson. Separately, Harvard is investigating Dr. Fryer’s spending and the lab’s finances, according to several former employees who have been asked about the issue by university officials. In a statement for this article, Dr. Fryer said he “hired a first-rate finance team to insure both transparency and full compliance with Harvard policy.” Last spring, Harvard imposed “interim measures” while conducting its investigations, including barring Dr. Fryer from entering the Education Innovation Laboratory, the off-campus space known as EdLabs where he has presided over a group of employees and research assistants. This account draws on documents related to the allegations against Dr. Fryer and interviews with more than a dozen current and former employees of his laboratory, as well as other colleagues and associates, many of whom supplied copies of electronic communications with him. Nearly all insisted on confidentiality, fearing retaliation. Dr. Fryer, in a statement, portrayed the EdLabs workplace in a different light. “The lab has always been an extraordinarily collegial place,” he said. “Many people commented on each others’ lives outside of work including their dating and other relationships. Jokes and comments by both female and male lab workers of a sexual nature were occasionally part of such discussions. Not one person has ever complained to me or to any other manager or employee that I am aware of suggesting they felt uncomfortable about any of these interactions. That said, if any comments made in the past were found to be offensive or made anyone uncomfortable, that was certainly never my intent and I am deeply sorry.” Dr. Fryer also said that “I have never and would not retaliate against any employee.” Rachael Dane, a Harvard spokeswoman, said the university was “aware of and take seriously concerns raised about the treatment of staff” but would not discuss or confirm any unresolved case. Academic economics has struggled to advance women to doctorates and professorships. The approval of a small group of prominent researchers, mostly men, can make or break careers. June Daniel, a lawyer who as executive director oversaw the lab’s administration for more than five years, recalled that Dr. Fryer complained when Harvard administrators pushed the Economics Department to find qualified female candidates for professorships. “Roland said that no such candidates exist,” Ms. Daniel wrote in response to questions from The New York Times. She left the lab last year. Asked to comment, Dr. Fryer said, “I have been a tremendous champion for women and other underrepresented groups in economics,” and noted that he had started a departmental committee to “increase diversity and inclusion.” Former employees said Dr. Fryer often reminded junior researchers that his recommendations could vault them to top graduate programs — or ground their careers. Several women said Dr. Fryer had written negative recommendations after they angered him in some way, or refused to write a recommendation at all. Ms. Daniel said Dr. Fryer’s reputation for vindictiveness made it hard for researchers to speak out against what she called his routine “inappropriate comments about women or their body parts, men’s body parts, homosexuals, minorities or other groups.” Some current and former employees defended Dr. Fryer as a demanding but fair boss who frequently hired and promoted women into senior roles. “I don’t feel like I was ever judged on anything other than the quality of my work,” said Rucha Vankudre, the lab’s current research director. “He takes me and my ideas seriously.” Dr. Fryer’s rise in the field was swift and celebrated. In 2011, he won the MacArthur grant, and in 2015 he received the John Bates Clark Medal, which honors an American under 40 for “a significant contribution to economic thought and knowledge.” He has been profiled by The New York Times Magazine, The Financial Times and other publications, in articles that often stress his rise from a rough childhood in Florida and Texas. He won a scholarship to the University of Texas, Arlington, and graduated in two and a half years, before earning an economics doctorate from Penn State. Much of his research has focused on racial gaps in educational achievement, and how to close them. In 2007-8, he served as chief equality officer for New York City’s Department of Education, where he experimented with paying students for scoring well on standardized tests. More recently, Dr. Fryer has studied police violence; in a working paper released in 2016, he found no evidence of racial bias in police shootings, which he said was “the most surprising result of my career.” Some of those who have worked in his lab say they hoped the job would lead to a career in economics, but a few say Dr. Fryer instead drove them out of the field. “I write papers that I think will help the world,” Dr. Fryer wrote to one research assistant in a chat message, after she complained about his treatment of employees. “I’m far less interested in people’s feelings. They can quit if they don’t like it.” The earliest incidents to figure in the formal complaints involve a woman who landed a job with Dr. Fryer as an assistant a decade ago, at 23, barely a year after graduating from college. Dr. Fryer began sending her text messages that “quickly veered into flirtatious and sexual overtures,” according to her complaint, which has been reviewed by The Times, along with text messages that the two exchanged. He invited her to see him socially, and she initially agreed, but became uncomfortable as he pushed her to spend more time with him away from the lab. In her first month, she made visits to his apartment at night to play video games, and he sometimes complained that she left too early or did not drink enough while there. He invited her to weekend activities that he said needed to stay a secret from others in the lab, to avoid rumors. And he sent after-hours BlackBerry messages, including one telling her: “Ur lucky ur not here. I would either tackle, bite u or both.” The woman told friends she was upset by the messages and his conduct, according to documents in her complaint, and she stopped visiting his apartment. After that, Dr. Fryer began to criticize her work. She informed human resources, but was told that the university could not transfer her to a different researcher. Dr. Fryer apologized to the woman and said she had misinterpreted his “friendly nature,” according to notes taken at the time by two managers in the lab. The apology, along with a pledge never to contact the woman outside of work hours, appears to have been suggested by a university official, the notes show. The woman’s formal complaint, filed this year, includes an email sent by Dr. Fryer to a deputy soon after her visit to human resources. “I will be sending you every complaint I have about her performance on a regular basis,” Dr. Fryer told the deputy, Richard Hagey, who has since died. Seven months later, after what she described in her complaint as “tirades” by Dr. Fryer about her job performance, the woman resigned. She pursued a career in a different academic field. Another case was brought by a woman who began working for Dr. Fryer in 2015. Over the course of two years, she told the investigator, Dr. Fryer repeatedly engaged her in conversations of a sexual nature. She cited 32 examples of such behavior; the investigator substantiated six. In others, the investigator found insufficient evidence to confirm that an incident occurred or that the conduct was unwelcome. Some of the woman’s allegations were supported by text messages, chat logs or other documents. On one occasion, Dr. Fryer texted the woman while she was out with friends that she was “gonna get a … roofy,” a reference to a date-rape drug. Later he texted her, while she was still out, “Be safe tonight. Wear gloves if ur gonna have hand action.” Dr. Fryer told the investigator that the comments were an “ill-attempted joke.” The investigator found they were sexual in nature and “objectively unwelcome” for the woman. In early 2017, Dr. Fryer suffered a heart attack and subsequently began to spend more time in the lab and less time traveling. After that, the tone of his comments changed and “became more public and derogatory,” the woman told the investigator. According to the investigator’s report, Dr. Fryer began commenting on the woman’s sex life and suggesting that the woman was in a sexual relationship with a former manager in the lab. In June, she texted her roommate complaining that Dr. Fryer had spent 20 minutes talking about how she and the former manager were probably having sex, using a vulgarity. “Like in detail,” she wrote. “Body parts.” A few days later, the woman went to a human resources official to complain about Dr. Fryer’s behavior. Later that month, her doctor called human resources to say her patient was in “a crisis situation,” and the woman began a disability leave. She never returned to work at the lab. The accuser has also filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination. Other employees told similar stories about Dr. Fryer, both in interviews with The Times and in discussions with Harvard’s investigator. One incident was raised in the complaint filed by the Title IX office: an episode in which a woman in the lab told a story about bending down to help an older faculty member tie his shoe. According to several witnesses cited in the investigator’s report, Dr. Fryer launched into an extended monologue implying that the woman had performed fellatio. By at least two accounts, Dr. Fryer put his foot on her desk so that his crotch was in front of her face, in view of several employees, including two other women who told the investigator they were upset by the behavior. The investigator concluded that Dr. Fryer’s “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature was sufficiently severe” that it interfered with the three women’s ability to work. Dr. Fryer told the Harvard investigator that “that riff” was simply a joke and that the employee it involved was “laughing hysterically.” He questioned whether he was being singled out for scrutiny because of his race. “Why am I the only one who violated policy when many others participated?” he asked, according to the investigator’s report. “Is it because I am the only professor or because of my skin color?” The report responds directly to that point. The investigator, it said, was troubled that Dr. Fryer “appeared to discount the significance of his roles as a senior faculty member at the university and faculty director of EdLabs.”",The New York Times
2018,Stars and Stripes (and Trocks) Forever,"“You can’t force Lucille Ball to be Gracie Allen” and other lessons from the artistic director of Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo, which returns to the Joyce Theater this week. Every two years, December gets a little brighter when the dancers of the all-male Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo fasten their tutus, lace up their point shoes and leap into the Joyce Theater with all the grandiose absurdity they can muster. But this company, revered for injecting humor into classical ballet, amounts to more than a stream of jokes: Its dancers have technical chops. Led by the artistic director Tory Dobrin, the group, at the Joyce through Dec. 30, has a robust repertory that slyly skews classics like “Swan Lake” and “The Little Humpbacked Horse.” This season, after a 15-year break, the Trocks, as the troupe is known, revive Robert La Fosse’s sparkling “Stars and Stripes Forever” (inspired by George Balanchine’s 1958 ballet) and present two new pas de deux: “Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux,” a stand-alone work — again, after Balanchine — and “Harlequinade.” The Trocks had a rough year. In January, Chase Johnsey, a leading dancer, accused the company of harassment and discrimination, saying that he had been criticized for appearing too feminine offstage and that his job would be in jeopardy if he chose to undergo a gender transition. An outside investigation did not substantiate his claims. Mr. Dobrin declined to talk specifically about the matter in an interview, but in a statement said that the company “has been at the forefront of pushing the boundaries of L.G.B.T. and gender issues since its founding in 1974” and that it “has long championed diversity.” [Read our critics on the best dance moments of 2018.] With gender issues so front and center these days, the Trocks — both imaginative and playful — are as relevant as ever. For them, femininity and masculinity are facets of characterization. Each dancer has a female and male persona and individual comic flair. As Mr. Dobrin put it, “You can’t force Lucille Ball to be Gracie Allen.” Recently, Mr. Dobrin spoke about “Stars and Stripes,” how not to lose your face and how dancing in drag has gone from career wrecker to career choice. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. What made you decide to bring back “Stars and Stripes Forever”? We were going to do “Stars” the last time we were at the Joyce but I canceled it. Trump won. Now I think it’s appropriate. We did it yesterday in rehearsal and it looked really good. It’s really hard for us. Why? It’s fast. There’s a ton of vocabulary, they’re on point the entire time and there are only 12 people in it. New York City Ballet has hundreds. [Laughs] Not every ballerina’s in every act, but our guys are. You joined Trockadero as a dancer in 1980. What was the culture like? Dancing in drag was not considered something that respectable people did. Everyone told me not to do it — it was considered a career wrecker. Now it’s completely a career choice. It was really disorganized. We were basically told to shut up and get out there. When I became the director, I thought I’m going to do two things: get organized and be nice. You can say the same thing in a harsh tone or a positive tone, and I’ve gotten good at saying things very nicely. It’s very exhausting. How do you get through it? I go home, and I kick my dog. I’m kidding. I don’t have a dog. How did the company cope during the AIDS crisis? Being a company made up exclusively of gay men, except for some of the management, it was horrifying. We almost closed around 1990. But it also did kind of free us up. How? In the ’80s, it was all about playing a game for the presenter and for the audience and not going too far. After the AIDS crisis, we started being more open and free and creative about what we wanted to do. Simultaneously we were going to Japan a lot. The whole culture of Trockadero is very Japanese. In what way? Have you ever been to Kabuki? The lighting is bright. You go to things now and I want to scream, “Turn on the lights!” So we have the brightest possible light. The important thing is not necessarily to see the dancing or the body. One of the things we say is, “You’ve lost your face.” You need to engage the cheekbones and then it will be an alive position even if you’re just standing there. How have gender issues affected the company over time? For a gay man or a lesbian of my age — I’m 64 — the main bullying technique was to call a gay man a girl, or a lesbian a boy. It was my generation who wanted to prove to the world that we weren’t trying to be the other sex. Now we’re having a different kind of sensibility. What is it? We do really concentrate on our technical aspect. We’re not trying to impersonate women, so that has not changed. What we’re really trying to be more clear about is that the relationships are real, the reactions are real — when you’re talking to the prince, and the prince is aggravating, you have to be aggravated. It’s about acting. Good acting. Has there been a dancer in Trockadero who transitioned from female to male? Yes. He’s not in the company anymore, but he was born a woman. I didn’t even know when he auditioned. And nor did I care. He auditioned, he could do the job, and I hired him. The issue is that you have to be able to do the dancing. What would happen with in the case of a dancer transitioning from male to female? Transitioning isn’t getting on the subway and getting off the subway. It’s a very long process. I can’t imagine someone transitioning while they were busy with a career in the physical sense. And if someone does want to transition, I have always said to them — and there have been a couple of instances — “Your job is not in jeopardy.” How do you feel about contemporary ballet? Would you ever parody a work by, say, Wayne McGregor — with swirling movement and thrashing legs — or would that be boring? It would be funny for five minutes. Or three. I think our audience really wants to see the old-world style: tutu, point shoes, wig, eyelashes, lurid red lips, over-the-top expressions. I asked Mark Morris a million years ago if he would do a “Carmen” or something, but it’s too expensive. And no choreographer in their right mind would want us to play around with it when they weren’t around.",The New York Times
2018,Starting Fresh in a Familiar Place,"ON LOCATION As one woman in Portland, Ore., discovered, if you hire the right designer, you might not need to buy a new home. 14 Photos View Slide Show › Pam Williams didn’t love her loft in the Pearl District of Portland, Ore. Its orangy bamboo floors and cabinets didn’t speak to her, nor did the imposing steel ductwork from a previous renovation. To create a place that felt like her own, she figured she would have to move. Then she saw another apartment in the building. “It just blew me away,” said Ms. Williams, 74, a retired public library director and widow who volunteers with the Portland Art Museum and the Armory performing arts center. Although her neighbor’s space was similar to hers, it looked like a different world, with a crisp black-and-white color scheme, concrete floors and a pared-down collection of modern yet comfortable furniture. “I had saved money to buy a new place, and was looking,” Ms. Williams said. “But I started to think maybe it would be wiser to just stay here and have it redone by somebody who could turn it into a real gem.” The most obvious way forward? Call the interior designer who had overhauled her neighbor’s place: Jessica Helgerson. After meeting Ms. Williams, Ms. Helgerson was not only up for the job, but eager to take on a client who seemed to have endless creative energy and enthusiasm. “She’s a human ray of sunshine,” said Ms. Helgerson, recalling that Ms. Williams often arrived at her office with bundles of fresh flowers she had grown in a community garden, and would send drawings and handwritten notes after meetings. “Everyone in our office had a massive crush on her.” It helped that Ms. Williams was also a very trusting client. She shared some broad thoughts about what she wanted, but otherwise let Ms. Helgerson and her team follow their instincts. “I gave them a bunch of adjectives to describe the elements I was looking for: serene, minimalist, flexible, spacious, inventive,” Ms. Williams said of the home she envisioned. “I asked for a nice, clean palette, not fussy.” She also gave all of her furniture away to family — “It was all really nice, but I was ready for a change,” she said — so Ms. Helgerson could begin with a clean slate. “I realized from when I helped with building libraries that when you’re paying people all this money because of their expertise, you should give them as free of a rein as possible, so they can be very inventive,” Ms. Williams said. “That paid off for me.” Ms. Helgerson’s plan for the 1,075-square-foot, one-bedroom, one-bathroom loft, which Ms. Williams bought in late 2009 for about $400,000, was to strip everything back to the original brick, concrete and wood shell, which dated to about 1910, and start fresh. “We wanted to create something soft, calm and cozy, with a modern and youthful feeling,” Ms. Helgerson said. “A welcoming cocoon for her to live in.” At the same time, she wanted to add extensive storage that would make it easy for Ms. Williams to keep the apartment clutter-free. The design she arrived at involved extensive built-in furniture and an edited palette of warm, subdued colors, including off-whites, light grays and peachy pinks. The living room has a built-in sectional sofa with large storage drawers in the base. It also has a wall with open and closed storage that Ms. Williams likens to a painting by Piet Mondrian. “It tolerates and even encourages real flights of whimsy, fun and change,” said Ms. Williams, who likes switching out the objects on display. The kitchen has bleached red-oak base cabinets with brass pulls, but no upper cabinets, which makes the space feel larger. Instead, the wall is covered in one-inch-square tiles from Design and Direct Source, which also line storage niches and the range hood. In the bathroom, the same tile wraps around walls and inside the shower, and covers the vanity. “There’s no Sheetrock anywhere in the apartment,” Ms. Helgerson said. “Everything is either brick, concrete, cabinetry or tile.” The snuggest area is a raised study with a built-in desk, shelves and cabinetry, where she lowered the floor and eliminated stairs for accessibility, but also dropped the ceiling so that the space cradles anyone who steps inside. Ms. Williams calls it her “rainy-day room.” When Paul Hegarty Construction began work in May 2017, Ms. Williams temporarily moved to Wisconsin, where she has family. She returned that September and, when construction took a few days longer than expected, stayed at Ms. Helgerson’s weekend house until the reimagined loft was ready. The total cost was about $350,000. “It turned out to be a wonderful experience,” said Ms. Williams, who was as impressed with her contractors as she was with her interior designer. “Not only did I get a home, but I also got people whom I consider to be friends and mentors.” The feeling is mutual, Ms. Helgerson said: “We really poured a lot of love into this project. She deserves it.” For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here. Follow us on Twitter: @nytrealestate.",The New York Times
2018,Starting Over by Learning the Language of Dogs,"The Neediest Cases Fund Royah Nuñez used to sit on the floor of a Barnes & Noble bookstore for hours, reading about dog training. “I always did my own research,” she said. Ms. Nuñez, 27, loved animals from a young age and wanted to be a veterinarian. After she graduated from high school, though, she earned an associate degree in audio engineering and went to work as a dispatcher, continuing to live with her parents in Corona, Queens. In her free time, she turned to one thing that she knew would make her happy: volunteering at animal rescue centers in Manhattan. “I was already working 12-to-13-hour shifts, but I would make time to go and volunteer,” she said during a recent interview in Brooklyn. While keeping her dream of working with animals on the side, Ms. Nuñez was also guarding a secret. “I was hiding in the closet forever. I never met anyone that wanted me to come out,” she said. “It wasn’t something that was in the front of my head.” A year ago, via a surveillance camera at their home, Ms. Nuñez’s father saw her girlfriend jump into her arms and give her a kiss. When her father asked her if she was gay, Ms. Nuñez froze. “There was no way I was going to say yes,” she said. “I stayed quiet. He took my silence for a yes, and that was it.” Ms. Nuñez left home, sleeping at hotels, friends’ houses or outside if she had to. In the meantime, she lost her job as a dispatcher. Despite the turmoil, she remained focused on her dream of working with animals. “I thought, ‘I’m already at rock bottom, I might as well try to go for it now, there’s nothing I can lose,’” she said. She updated her job profile on Indeed and got a hit from a dog obedience company. The job came with training and access to a car. “I was like, this was a scam,” she said, laughing. “There was no way.” Ms. Nuñez now trains dogs for a Connecticut-based company, and for the past year, she has traveled across the region to work with dogs and their owners. Someday soon she will have her own place, she hopes, but for now, the other women at the homeless shelter where she has been living since April call her by the nickname “Canine.” Ms. Nuñez works with dogs and their owners on basic obedience training, including how to deal with newborn babies and house training, for starters. She is excited to take classes to learn about defensive dog training and how to work with service dogs. A year into working with the company, Ms. Nuñez said, she likes seeing how a dog can change. “With dogs who have behavioral problems, it’s not necessarily their fault. They just don’t know,” she said. “I feel like a translator between the human and the dog. I like that language.” She works nearly every day and dreams of starting her own business someday. Through Brooklyn Community Services, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, Ms. Nuñez received $150 to enroll in a business planning course and $250 to file for a limited liability corporation. The class, held at Local Development Corporation of East New York, teaches students about budgeting, client needs, salary standards, branding and marketing. Ms. Nuñez knows she has chosen the right path. “I have the personality of working with people,” she said. “It’s not just dog training. I’m good at making people feel comfortable.” When she’s not working for the dog training company, Ms. Nuñez is picking up clients of her own and starting to build her business, one dog at a time. After she finds her own home, she hopes to have a dog of her own, as well. “Doberman,” she said, smiling. “I love Dobermans.”",The New York Times
2018,Starting School Later Really Does Help Teens Get Sleep,"Before Seattle made a change, students got an average of six hours and 50 minutes of sleep a night. Afterward, they got seven hours and 24 minutes. Delaying school start times has helped Seattle teenagers get a better night’s sleep. During puberty, circadian rhythm is altered, and sleeping and waking are typically delayed to a later time. This creates a problem: Adolescent wake-sleep patterns do not coincide with those of conventional social life, and teenagers rarely get the recommended eight to 10 hours of sleep each night. In 2016 the Seattle School District changed high schools’ opening time to 8:45 a.m., 55 minutes later than it had been. Using wrist monitors, researchers tracked sleep onset and duration for two weeks in 10th-graders before and after the change in two schools, one economically disadvantaged. Before the change, students got an average of six hours and 50 minutes of sleep a night. Afterward, they got seven hours and 24 minutes. Bedtimes before and after were unchanged. The study, in Science Advances, also found that the change was associated with a 4.5 percent increase in grades, although the researchers could not prove it was causal. They also found an increase in punctuality and attendance, but only in the economically disadvantaged school. “Many adults have the idea that teenagers are lazy,” said the senior author, Horacio O. de la Iglesia, a professor of biology at the University of Washington. “They’re not. Kids need nine hours of sleep, and we can help them get to that goal by delaying school start times.”",The New York Times
2018,State Courts Become Battleground Over Trump’s Sanctuary Cities Policy,"The battles between so-called sanctuary cities and the Trump administration are increasingly moving to state courts, where lawyers for immigrants have started to convince judges that state laws prohibit local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration agents. The lawyers said they were turning to more liberal state courts to challenge the Trump administration’s policies in part because they believed that they would be less likely to succeed in a federal judiciary that is growing more conservative — and might ultimately lose in a Supreme Court with two appointees of President Trump. Lawyers have also been encouraged by a series of recent successes in state law cases, which they say represent a long overdue reconciling between a deportation system that relies on local law enforcement and the state laws that determine the authority of local law enforcement. Last month, New York became the second state in which an appellate state court ruled that local law enforcement officers could not detain immigrants for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which then typically puts them into the deportation system. The ruling follows a similar decision in the highest court of Massachusetts and lower courts in Colorado and Minnesota, all of which have prohibited local law enforcement officers from complying with so-called detainers, the requests from ICE for those officers to hold immigrants. The immigration agency typically asks local jails and local police forces to detain noncitizens who have been arrested, often on less serious charges, and will eventually be released. The four state courts ruled that if law enforcement officers detained immigrants on behalf of ICE, that was considered a new arrest, which they did not have the authority to make under their respective state laws. But unlike the courts in previous decisions, New York’s three-judge appellate court was the first to meticulously review and reject of each of the federal government’s claims in its final opinion. As a result, lawyers across the country now view the opinion itself like a blueprint for crafting litigation in their own states and consider the lawyers who brought the case battle-tested veterans whose legal strategies they can employ. Though a handful of states like Texas, Mississippi, North Carolina and Alabama have passed laws banning sanctuary jurisdictions, where state legislators have not specifically targeted sanctuaries, advocates believe state laws and constitutions will generally favor the authority of the state to determine how its local law enforcement interacts with federal immigration authorities. “I expect that attorneys will be relying more and more on state law and asking state courts to step up and assume a role as the first-line defenders of civil liberties,” said Mark Silverstein, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer in Colorado who litigated a state law case against detainers. Despite President Trump’s conservative imprint across the federal judiciary, state courts retain the independence to protect civil liberties under their state constitutions, Mr. Silverstein added. Sanctuary jurisdictions restrict cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities by denying ICE access to jails or not complying with ICE’s detainer requests. Lawyers for immigrants have successfully defended these sanctuary cities’ and states’ sovereignty in federal courts since the early years of the Obama administration, and there are now hundreds of such jurisdictions across the country. For the Trump administration, these jurisdictions’ ability to sever the ties between local law enforcement and federal immigration enforcement will determine whether or not Mr. Trump can achieve his immigration agenda within the United States. Though Mr. Trump has sharply widened the pool of immigrants that ICE can deport, to actually locate them ICE relies on both information from local law enforcement about when they happen to arrest such immigrants and their cooperation in detaining those immigrants for ICE. And because ICE cannot easily locate immigrants it deems deportable otherwise, when the police in sanctuary jurisdictions do not cooperate, it not only makes ICE’s work harder — it substantially affects the number of immigrants deported. “Our immigration machinery is almost completely intertwined with the criminal justice system,” which is a state and local phenomenon, said Muzaffar Chisti, the director of the Migration Policy Institute’s office at New York University School of Law. “That’s why the Trump administration has been so offended by sanctuary jurisdictions,” Mr. Chisti said. “But that’s the reality of federalism.” Since assuming office, Mr. Trump has retaliated against sanctuary jurisdictions, publicly shaming them for restricting cooperation between local law enforcement and ICE, and threatening their federal funding in an executive order. That order was followed by the Department of Justice’s creation of new conditions on federal funding grants that support local law enforcement. But numerous federal court decisions in recent months have ruled that the Trump administration cannot withhold millions in funding from those jurisdictions without violating federal law. For conservative opponents of sanctuary jurisdictions, the sanctuary decisions from state courts are seen as further fragmenting how immigration enforcement is carried out across the country even though immigration is a matter of national policy. “What we will end up with is a patchwork of state rulings,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of Policy Studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based think tank that favors significant reductions in immigration. “But immigration law is federal law where federal courts and Congress have jurisdiction,” she said, suggesting that because immigration enforcement is a federal matter, cases related to it should be tried strictly in federal courts. The New York case involved Susai Francis, an Indian national living on Long Island, who overstayed his visa in the 1990s. In June 2017, he was arrested in Nassau County, accused of driving under the influence. After being transferred to Suffolk County to complete a different proceeding involving a criminal charge, he pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and was sentenced to time served. But the Suffolk County police did not allow Mr. Francis to leave court. Instead, they rearrested him at the request of ICE and held him for nearly two days before ICE picked him up. He is in ICE detention in New Jersey. Mr. Francis’ story became just another in a litany of cautionary tales shared in America’s immigrant communities under the Trump administration. All start with minor interactions with the police: the farmworker driving without a license, the teenager who jumped a turnstile, or the wife who called the cops when she was the victim of domestic abuse. All end the same way, too: Those people are arrested by the local police, handed over to ICE and, ultimately, deported. But even where law enforcement officers do not cooperate with ICE, the tools left at ICE’s disposal to locate unauthorized immigrants have negative consequences of their own. Rachael Yong Yow, a public affairs officer for ICE, wrote in a statement that when cities do not comply with detainer requests, “ICE has no choice” but to conduct “at-large arrests in local neighborhoods and at work sites, which will inevitably result in additional collateral arrests” when ICE officers encounter unauthorized immigrants with no criminal histories. In immigrant communities, the fear of such raids deeply affects peoples’ everyday lives. Basic activities — leaving your home to do errands, going to work to earn money for your family or opening the door if a stranger knocks — can put you at risk of being deported. Where the widespread use of detainers erodes immigrants’ trust in local law enforcement, without detainers, ICE raids erode immigrant communities’ sense of security. The environments created by both extremes “weakens public safety for everyone in the U.S.,” said John Sandweg, an acting director of ICE in the Obama administration. There needs to be “some level of cooperation that works between sanctuary cities and ICE, otherwise nobody wins.”",The New York Times
2018,State Police Investigating Abuse at Celebrated Louisiana School,"WASHINGTON — The Louisiana State Police have begun an investigation of T.M. Landry College Preparatory School, leading a coordinated law-enforcement response to allegations of physical abuse at a school that gained national attention for vaulting working-class black students to the nation’s most elite colleges and universities. The State Police investigation comes two weeks after The New York Times published a report detailing physical violence, emotional abuse, and transcript fraud at T.M. Landry, a small private school in Breaux Bridge, La., which has been featured on national television, showered with donor dollars and hailed as a model for preparing African-American children for college. [Read the investigation here.] Viral videos of students getting into Harvard, Yale, Wesleyan and other elite institutions attracted the attention of the “Today” show, “Ellen” and other news media and entertainment outlets, but many of those students’ transcripts were filled with courses not taken and grades not earned, while personal essays and recommendations were embellished with hardscrabble stories that bore little resemblance to the students’ real lives. But the abuse allegations may prove to be the downfall of the school’s founders and chief administrators, Michael and Tracey Landry. [Watch the series premiere trailer of The Times’s new TV show, “The Weekly,” which features our investigation of T.M. Landry.] “The Louisiana State Police Bureau of Investigations was contacted by the Breaux Bridge Police Department regarding allegations of physical abuse concerning T.M. Landry College Preparatory,” said Trooper Thomas C. Gossen, a spokesman for the Louisiana State Police. “The investigation is active and ongoing with no further information available at this time.” Since The Times published its article, more than a dozen people have reported additional incidents of what they called abuse to authorities, according to a law enforcement official who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about the cases. Those statements include allegations that Mr. Landry placed a developmentally disabled boy in a closet, lifted another student by his collar and shoved him to the ground on his knees, and hit elementary school students with a belt. The local sheriff’s office also released graphic details of a battery charge in 2012 that The Times reported last month. While it was previously known that Mr. Landry pleaded guilty in that case to whipping the student, the report detailed additional allegations of choking, slapping and forcing a child to eat rat feces. The report included a witness statement from a 13-year-old student who said that he, too, had been whipped, choked and lifted off the ground by the neck. The student accused Mr. Landry of stepping on his face and kicking him in the stomach. The Breaux Bridge Police Department also reopened a criminal investigation into whether Mr. Landry battered a student named Nyjal Mitchell, who had spoken with The Times. “These families feel that the current law enforcement response is long overdue,” said Ashlee McFarlane, a lawyer at Gerger Khalil & Hennessy in Houston, who is helping dozens of parents, students and former staff members work with investigators. The Landrys have denied abusing children but refused to discuss the Mitchell case. They did not respond to requests by email, text and telephone for comment on the State Police investigation and the new allegations of abuse. After being inundated with calls and reports last week, the local police met with representatives from the St. Martin Parish District Attorney’s Office, the parish sheriff’s office and the State Police to discuss how to proceed. Because the school has had four locations over the past 13 years, the abuse of some of the children may have taken place in different jurisdictions. The law enforcement agencies decided that the State Police should lead the investigations. Ms. McFarlane called the involvement of the State Police encouraging and said the families she worked with “hope to see a thorough yet urgent investigation into their complaints.” But the halting response of local law enforcement has left some families skeptical that Mr. Landry will be held accountable. Mr. Mitchell’s family filed complaints with the Breaux Bridge police in February 2017, alleging multiple instances of choking, dragging and hitting. But a case summary obtained by The Times showed that the police believed the incidents occurred outside the city limits, and sent the file to the sheriff’s department in St. Martin Parish, Louisiana’s equivalent of a county. The sheriff’s department interviewed the Mitchell family but did not indicate whether it was moving forward. “I feel like the local police departments failed us,” said Mr. Mitchell’s mother, Mary Mitchell. “What message are we sending if we tell them to speak up if someone is hurting you, and then say, ‘You should’ve said it sooner,’ or ‘Not enough people saw it’?” Students said Mr. Landry coerced them into saying they did not witness what happened to Mr. Mitchell. One graduate, who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation, said she and her peers kept Mr. Mitchell’s assault a secret because they wanted to get into college. After The Times’s story, the Breaux Bridge police determined that at least one incident occurred within town limits and reopened the investigation. In response to a request for comment on the Mitchell case, the St. Martin Parish sheriff’s department said that it could share information about only the 2012 incident, and that other cases pertained to “potential criminal litigation” and could not be discussed. The details of that 2012 case were strikingly similar to the allegations later made by Mr. Mitchell. In that case, Mr. Landry was accused of choking, slapping and slamming a 12-year-old boy onto the floor, then putting his foot on the child’s head. He is said to have dragged the student, made him kneel and forced him to eat rat feces. Mr. Landry admitted to investigators that he had whipped the boy with his belt. The investigators took photos of the child’s bruises and welts, and captured text messages from Mr. Landry to the parent admitting that he had whipped her child. Mr. Landry told investigators that the boy’s mother had given him permission to physically discipline her child, but she said that was a lie. Mr. Landry pleaded guilty and served a year of probation, according to court documents. The 2012 episode was reported to the Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services, but the sheriff’s report noted that the agency declined to investigate “because the report did not meet the legal and policy definition of child abuse and neglect” and because the student no longer attended T.M. Landry. In a statement this week, a spokeswoman for the agency, Heidi Rogers Kinchen, said the department did not have the authority to investigate or respond to the recent abuse allegations at T.M. Landry. The agency only investigates abuse perpetrated by a “caretaker,” Ms. Kinchen said, defined in state law as “any person legally obligated to provide or secure adequate care for a child.” That includes parents, guardians or employees of a public or private day care center. The Times story also prompted Daphne Hall to report what she said was abuse of her son, who is developmentally delayed, with the Breaux Bridge police. Two students told Ms. Hall that Mr. Landry had put her son in a closet. Her son, now 6, told her last week that Mr. Landry also placed him in a trash can. Ms. Hall said that while attending kindergarten at T.M. Landry, her son would say, “I belong in the trash.” She said Mr. Landry had told her that the boy had gotten into the trash can by himself. “I can’t believe I actually paid for someone to harass and torture my child,” Ms. Hall said. Bryce Cormier, the father of a former T.M. Landry student, said he filed a police report last year accusing Mr. Landry of throwing his son to the ground and forcing him to kneel. He placed his children in a new school but could not get official transcripts from T.M. Landry. His wife, Tanya Cormier, asked the police to help her get her children’s transcripts, according to the police report. The police told the Landrys that withholding the records was “pointless,” and they eventually produced a “report card type document,” according to the report. “In that envelope were grades and courses that he didn’t even take,” Mr. Cormier said. “I took it to the new school and the principal said, ‘I can’t do anything with this.’” Cameron Gray, who attended T.M. Landry in the 2016-17 school year, said he witnessed Mr. Landry run into the building, grab a classmate by the throat and throw him into a closet. He said Mr. Landry berated him for his low A.C.T. scores and dim Ivy League prospects, and encouraged his peers to tease him. “Mike never put his hands on me, but mentally he did,” Mr. Gray said. “The more you get teased, the more you want to get better, and the more you don’t do better, the deeper you fall into sadness.” His parents pulled him out of the school last summer after his mother discovered him on the balcony of his summer vacation rental, contemplating suicide. “Mental abuse leaves a different type of scar,” Mr. Gray said.",The New York Times
2018,States Ask Judge to Declare Health Law Still in Effect While Ruling Is Appealed,"WASHINGTON — California and 15 other states asked a federal judge on Monday to protect current health care coverage for millions of Americans while courts sort out the implications of his ruling that the Affordable Care Act was invalid in its entirety. The states, which support the health care law, said the ruling on Friday, by Judge Reed O’Connor of the Federal District Court in Fort Worth, had caused immense confusion about whether the law was still in effect, and whether consumers were still entitled to its benefits and protections. The states asked Judge O’Connor to clarify whether he meant his decision to have “any immediate legal effect.” In his sweeping decision, Judge O’Connor held that a provision at the heart of the Affordable Care Act — a requirement for most Americans to have health insurance known as the individual mandate — was unconstitutional and that other provisions of the law could not survive because they were inextricably linked to the coverage mandate. The sprawling law includes not only health insurance exchanges and an expansion of Medicaid, but also protections for people with pre-existing conditions, requirements for what insurance must cover and much more. But Judge O’Connor did not issue an injunction barring enforcement of the law. “In light of this ambiguity,” California and the other states asked Judge O’Connor on Monday to affirm that the Affordable Care Act was still the law and should be enforced while supporters and opponents of the measure continue their battle in court. “The district court’s ruling poses a dangerous threat to the health care of millions of Americans,” said the California attorney general, Xavier Becerra. “Today’s filing makes clear that California and its partner states will do everything possible to challenge this reckless ruling.” Caitlin Oakley, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said Monday that because Judge O’Connor had not issued a final judgment or an injunction, the department “will continue administering and enforcing all aspects of the A.C.A. as it had before the court issued its decision.” The lawsuit was filed by Texas and 19 other states. The individual mandate was enforced by a tax penalty on people who go without insurance, and the Supreme Court upheld it in 2012 as an exercise of Congress’s taxing power. But as part of the tax overhaul that President Trump signed last December, Congress reduced the penalty to zero dollars, starting in 2019. Texas and the other plaintiffs contend that the mandate will then lose its constitutional justification. On Friday, Mr. Trump hailed the judge’s decision as “great news for America!” But the coalition of states led by California told the judge on Monday that their citizens would face “devastating harm from the invalidation” of the Affordable Care Act. “The law’s provisions are so interwoven in virtually every aspect of the public and private health care system that the elimination of the A.C.A. will cause grievous immediate and long-term harm to Americans’ health and financial security, to the health care system, and to federal and state budgets,” the coalition said in a legal brief. “If the A.C.A. is invalidated, nearly 12 million Americans who gained coverage through the Medicaid expansion would become uninsured,” the coalition said. “An additional eight million low-income residents will lose access to billions of dollars in tax credits” that help them pay premiums for private insurance. Judge O’Connor’s decision left several issues unresolved, but California and its allies said he should allow an immediate appeal on an important legal question: “whether the A.C.A. remains in force, wholly or in substantial part, after the passage” of the tax cut law. Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican, said on Monday that his state would try to devise a replacement for the Affordable Care Act. “If Obamacare remains struck down on appeal Texas will be ready with replacement health care insurance that includes coverage for preexisting conditions,” Mr. Abbott said in a Twitter post.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Staying Catholic at Christmas,"A Gospel reading for the scandal in the church. Opinion Columnist At Mass this Christmas Eve, many Catholics who have spent a year reading headlines about abusive priests, indifferent bishops, predatory cardinals and Vatican corruption will sit and hear the long roll of Jesus’s ancestors with which the Gospel of Matthew begins. “Unless you like stats / just skip the begats,” wrote Jeanne and William Steig in their “Old Testament Made Easy.” But before he gets to the angels and the wise men Matthew gives us 39 of them, from the famous names (“Abraham begat Isaac … David begat Solomon”) to the rather more esoteric, like Jechoniah, the father of Shealtiel. If you only know the Bible vaguely, this litany of names probably sounds a bit pompous, an attempt to elevate the infant Jesus by linking him to great patriarchs and noble kings. But the truth is roughly the opposite: The more you know about Genesis or Chronicles or Kings, the more remarkable it is that Matthew announced the birth of the son of God by linking him to a pack of egregious sinners. [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] I’m stealing this point from an essay by a 20th-century Dominican priest, the late Rev. Herbert McCabe, which was recently excerpted by the important Catholic Twitter account known as Woke Space Jesuit. Matthew’s genealogy, McCabe writes, link Jesus explicitly to “the squalid realities of human life and sex and politics.” Then he offers examples of just how squalid things got among those long-dead Israelites. Take a line like “Judah begat Perez and Zerah of Tamar.” Just a typical nuclear family, right? Here’s McCabe with the real story: “Judah slept … by mistake, with his daughter-in-law Tamar: She had cheated him by disguising herself and dressing up as a prostitute … [When] Judah heard that his daughter-in-law had prostituted herself and become pregnant, he ordered her to be burnt alive. He was disconcerted when he discovered that he himself had been the client and that the child, Perez, was his.” Or again: “David begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Uriah.” That “her,” of course, is Bathsheba, upon whom David spied while she bathed and then contrived to marry by murdering her husband; the result of this wickedness was the future King Solomon, “the next in the line of succession,” McCabe notes dryly, “toward Christ our savior.” And David was Israel’s greatest king; the line that follows him in Matthew includes a few decent men but also a collection of tyrants, child-murderers and worse, none of them remotely pious and many actively at war with the prophets sent by God. Crucially, in claiming the divine is entering the world through this line of “murderers, cheats, cowards, adulterers and liars,” Matthew isn’t offering some particularly Christian innovation within the larger biblical story. He’s simply picking up what his own people, the Jewish people, already said about themselves: We’re the chosen people of the one true God, and to prove it to you here’s a long story about how awful and promiscuous and murderous and fallible we are, how terrible our leaders often turned out to be, and how we deserved every exile and punishment we received. If you don’t find that message credible, well, I understand. But if you find it strangely compelling, then you’re close to the case for remaining Catholic at a time when the corruption of the church is driving a number of very public defections from the faith. I promised to make a version of that case-for-staying-Catholic a few weeks ago, but there isn’t much I could say that isn’t right there in the Christmas-season bridge between the Old Testament and the New, in the history of the Jewish people that Christians claim as their own. The idea that biblical religion has always proposed is emphatically not that you can tell whether a people is chosen by the virtue of their leaders. It’s that the divine chooses to act constantly amid not just ordinary fallibility but real depravity — that strong temptations as well as great sanctity are concentrated where God wants to work — and that the graces that define a chosen people are improbable resilience and unlooked-for renewal, with saints and prophets and reformers carrying things forward despite corruptions that seem like they should extinguish the whole thing. The case for remaining Catholic in this moment, then, is basically that all this has happened before and will happen again — in what G.K. Chesterton once called the “five deaths of the faith,” the moments across two thousand years when every human probability pointed to the church of Rome passing into history, becoming one with Nineveh and Tyre. For American Catholics at least, this era feels understandably like another death — in which the saints seem hidden, the would-be prophets don’t agree with one another, the reformers keep losing. And it is all-too-understandable that people would choose to leave a dying church. But it is the season’s promise, and in the long run its testable hypothesis, that those who stay and pray and fight will see it improbably reborn.

2018,"Steady Amid Another Anfield Storm, Liverpool Advances in Champions League","On Soccer LIVERPOOL, England — Liverpool, Jürgen Klopp had said, needed Anfield. It needed to find fuel in the floodlit memories that swirl around this stadium. It needed its fans to turn the visit of Napoli into another of those nights that burnishes this place’s legend: another St.-Étienne, another Borussia Dortmund and, most of all, another Olympiakos. The parallel, after all, was clear, obvious. The situation was exactly as it had been when the Greek champions traveled here in 2004: Liverpool had to beat Napoli by 1-0, or otherwise by two goals or more, to qualify, to avoid the indignity of elimination at the Champions League’s group stage. For Liverpool, the past is comfort, and it is inspiration. Anfield feels a compulsion to live up to its own lore on occasions like this, each successive generation determined to meet the standards set by its predecessors, to create its own version of the stories that have been passed down to them and into myth. On these nights, Anfield regards itself as an active participant in the drama: deafening, crackling, pulsing with energy, possessed of a power to alter the result. Those games — St.-Étienne and Dortmund and Olympiakos — are remembered as much for the atmosphere they generated as the action they produced. They are recalled almost as much as Anfield’s triumphs as Liverpool’s. Staring at elimination, Klopp wanted to harness that. He wanted a night in which Anfield is as Anfield sees itself. He wanted the noise and the fervor and the frenzy. He wanted, most of all, the chaos. “If something special is possible, it’s here,” he had said the day before the game. Ever since he arrived in England, Klopp has made a point of spending a little time during games coaching his crowd. The sight of him turning away from the field to encourage the fans at his back to raise the volume has become a frequent — and occasionally a slightly grating — feature of match days at Anfield. In part, that is because of his own background: His previous job, of course, was at Dortmund, where the noise washes down the Yellow Wall, arguably the most intimidating grandstand in European soccer, and the whole place seems to shake. One of the key factors in Klopp’s taking the Liverpool role was his sons’ experience of Anfield as tourists, their testimony that he would find here what he had there. He discovered, soon after arriving, that it did not always meet his expectations, and he decided to do something about it. But it is also, partly, because for some time Anfield’s reputation has been one of the most potent weapons at Liverpool’s disposal. This is a team that has needed its fans to make up for its shortcomings, to level the playing field, to fire its players and to burn its opponents. It has needed the noise and the fervor and the frenzy. That it has been involved in so many dramatic, last-minute scrapes, victories snatched from the jaws of defeat, is because it is only in chaos — when the natural order of things has broken down — that Liverpool, against more illustrious, more accomplished opponents, has been able to thrive. To some extent, Klopp got what he wanted on Tuesday. Anfield delivered the noise he had demanded. Liverpool won, 1-0, and took its place in the knockout rounds of the Champions League, once again ensuring that the Premier League has a full complement of four teams in the last 16 of Europe’s most exclusive club competition. But this was not a night in Anfield’s grand old tradition. This was not the visit of Dortmund in 2016, when Liverpool needed three goals in half an hour to survive. It was not Olympiakos in 2005, when Steven Gerrard had to intervene in the dying minutes to send Liverpool through and mayhem swept through the Kop. This was not a victory for Anfield, and chaos. It was a victory for Liverpool, and control. By any measure, Klopp’s team has made a remarkable start to the season. Its European form has been patchy — “not good enough,” as Virgil van Dijk, the defender, said on Monday — but it has been almost flawless in the Premier League. It has not been beaten in 16 games. It has dropped points only away to Chelsea and Arsenal, and at home to Manchester City. Only four teams in English history — the history that starts in 1888, not the history that starts in 1992 — have had better records at the same stage. It sits top of the Premier League, ahead of City by a point. And yet it has done so with as little fanfare as a team as widely supported, as keenly scrutinized and as intensely followed as Liverpool can manage. City helped, of course: Until its defeat at Chelsea on Saturday, its record had been even more impressive. But Liverpool’s performances have contributed, too. This has not been the swashbuckling team that made it to the Champions League final last year, scoring bunches of goals in breathtaking surges. It has not asphyxiated its opponents with Klopp’s signature high press. It has not blown teams away. It is only a slight exaggeration to say it has managed to stay unbeaten for 16 games without actually appearing to play especially well. Only, though, when judged against what it was, rather than what it is. This Liverpool is not that Liverpool. It is not swarming opponents because it is not trying to swarm opponents. It is not sweeping teams away in 10-minute spells because it is designed to pick them apart over 90. And it is not scoring great barrages of goals because it no longer needs to. Klopp, for all that his public image is of a coach with one distinct, nonnegotiable style, has retuned his team, and his thinking. Liverpool is now a team built as much for obduracy as explosiveness, one that boasts the most expensive defender in the world in van Dijk and, in Alisson Becker, the second-most expensive goalkeeper. It is a team that has discovered the virtue of patience, and of precision, characteristics that Klopp believes stand it in better stead of thriving over an entire season, rather than in patches. It is a team that seeks to control, not one that intends to turn all around it to chaos. It is a team that needed to beat Napoli either by a single goal to none, or by at least two goals. Last year, there would have been no choice: Liverpool would have had to welcome the mayhem and hope to come out on top. This time around, it is different: more flexible, more mature. A single goal, a brilliant one from Mohamed Salah, was all it could muster, but it was all it needed. That is not to say Klopp’s team is sterile, or dull, or lacking in ambition. Nor is it to say this was an evening of eerie calm. Liverpool still had chances — Sadio Mané, in particular, might have scored three or four — and still, in those tense final minutes, allowed two. Only the poor finishing of José Callejón, and a wonderful save from Alisson, kept Liverpool on course. Still, that is why you spend $84 million on a goalkeeper. By Anfield’s standards, it was almost a letdown. There was no stirring finale. There was only a little nail-biting, nerve-shredding drama. There was a team doing what it had to do; a team, for the most part, in control; a team that wanted all the noise and fervor and frenzy, of course, a team that benefited from it, a team that would not have it any other way. But a team that needed it? Not any more.",The New York Times
2018,"Steelers Come Out of Their Fog, Holding On to Beat Patriots","On Pro Football PITTSBURGH — The first month of the Pittsburgh Steelers’ season was messier than a food fight. Their next six weeks positioned them as Super Bowl contenders. Their previous three games entering this week, each worse than the one before, ushered them to the brink of a righteous collapse. With their playoff chances hanging by an icicle if they lost Sunday, the Steelers instead created a fascinating conundrum — not for themselves, but for the rest of the A.F.C., which must now wonder whether the team that stifled Tom Brady and the New England Patriots must be reckoned with in the postseason or if the middling version of Pittsburgh will resurface. The standings show that the Steelers have the fifth-best record in the A.F.C., but whether they are the fifth-best team will not be decided until January, when they expect to still be playing. Their 17-10 victory over New England, secured only when Brady’s fourth-down pass at the Pittsburgh 21 was knocked to the ground, kept them atop their division and prevented the Patriots from clinching theirs. In a matchup of division leaders reeling after dizzying defeats — Pittsburgh flopped at Oakland, the Patriots yielded a 69-yard touchdown at Miami on a lateral as time expired — the Steelers (8-5-1) defeated New England (9-5) for the first time since 2011 because they did things that they don’t normally do. With run after punishing run by Jaylen Samuels, they rushed for 158 yards — nearly as many as they had in losing their last three games. By drilling a 48-yard field goal with 2 minutes 30 seconds left, Chris Boswell — who had missed seven attempts this season, including a 32-yarder in the third quarter Sunday and a potential game-tying kick against the Raiders that sent Pittsburgh searching for possible replacements last week — supplied the final margin of victory. Facing a quarterback that had scorched them for 23 touchdowns with only one interception across their last eight meetings, the Steelers held, halting a promising fourth-quarter drive with Joe Haden’s leaping interceptionof Brady at the Pittsburgh 4. An interactive calculator that lets you explore every team’s path to the N.F.L. playoffs. “If he doesn’t have that framed,” defensive tackle Cameron Heyward said of Haden’s interception, “I’m going to get that framed for him.” That snapshot will sustain the Steelers another week. The Patriots will review the film and lament all the deficiencies — 14 penalties, five consecutive punts, 30 percent efficiency on third down — that conspired to send them careening into unfamiliar territory. Instead of coalescing in December as they often do, the Patriots are hurting themselves. Instead of clinching the A.F.C. East, they dropped to the conference’s No. 3 seed, a game behind Houston, and are in serious jeopardy of failing to earn their ninth consecutive first-round bye. “Obviously, we aren’t playing well enough to win, and it comes in a lot of different ways,” Brady said. “Turnovers and just missed opportunities.” The most egregious example came with a little less than eight minutes remaining. After Duron Harmon intercepted Ben Roethlisberger for the second time in the game, New England, trailing 14-10, zipped down the field to the Pittsburgh 5 before a penalty and a loss pushed the Patriots back to the 16. On second down, Brady felt pressure from his left and lofted a pass toward the far sideline. He said afterward that he had been trying to throw it out of bounds to avoid being sacked, but the ball never got there. Both of his receivers nearby, Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski, converged. But so did Haden, who skied above them to grab it and skillfully landed both feet in bounds as Gronkowski crushed him in the ribs. “As soon as I caught it,” Haden said, “I felt like my legs went numb.” After the play that saved their season, the Steelers’ defense sprinted to the back of the end zone and assembled as if for a class photograph. Amid the din at Heinz Field, some players flexed, and others just stood there beaming, nodding, bouncing, celebrating the way they did here back in November, when they throttled Carolina by 31 points on national television. At one point, the Steelers were 7-2-1, thriving without the star running back Le’Veon Bell, who was holding out for a new contract, and with James Conner, the second-year backup who ranks among the N.F.L. leaders in rushing yards and touchdowns. Then came the late meltdown in Denver, which preceded the late meltdown against the Los Angeles Chargers, which preceded the late meltdown at Oakland, which preceded a week of — what’s the word here? — unease. The Steelers, after all, have not missed the playoffs since 2013. “I wouldn’t say we were at a crossroad, but there was sink or swim, whatever you want to call it,” said Roethlisberger, who threw for 235 yards and two touchdowns with two interceptions. “Some decisions needed to be made. Are we going to step up and play and come together as a team? Are we going to kind of divide each other? What’s going to happen? Nobody knows.” By kickoff, the Steelers did know that it needed to win not only to remain ahead of its A.F.C. North rival Baltimore, which defeated Tampa Bay for its fourth victory in five games, but also to stay in the playoff picture altogether. A Steelers loss would have elevated the Ravens into first place and the surging Colts to the No. 6 seed. “Anyone’s beatable every week,” said Heyward, when asked to assess the state of a conference where the top two teams entering the week, Kansas City and New England, lost. “You just have to be ready to play. We haven’t finished some games in the past, and today we did. It goes from week to week.” Indeed it does. Last week, the Raiders’ tight ends shredded Pittsburgh for 148 yards and two touchdowns. This week, the Steelers limited Gronkowski, who seems to embarrass them every year, to two catches for 21 yards. Last week, Derek Carr foiled the Steelers with a late scoring pass. This week, they thwarted their chief tormentor, Brady, denying him another fourth-quarter comeback. Next week, the Steelers visit New Orleans, possibly with Conner returning from a two-week injury absence. The Saints are one of the N.F.L.’s best teams. They have proved as much all season. The Steelers have not. But here they are, anyway. Underestimate — or overrate — them at your peril.",The New York Times

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has become the second four-star general this month to quit the Trump administration. With his unexpected decision on Thursday to step down in protest of the president’s policies, Mattis added to the turmoil in Washington, where the government may be headed toward a shutdown and the White House chief of staff, the retired Marine general John F. Kelly, is about to leave. Stephen Colbert, referring to Mattis by his nickname, suggested that he wouldn’t normally be upset to see him go, but that these are strange times. “Kind of scary when everyone says, ‘Oh, there goes the voice of reason, Mad Dog.’” — STEPHEN COLBERT In his resignation letter, Mattis patently rejected core elements of Trump’s worldview. “Mattis took a shot at Trump on his way out, saying in his resignation letter to the president, ‘You have the right to have a secretary of defense whose views are better aligned with yours.’ Yes — perhaps a feral child, snarling at those who dare approach his pile of rotting food scraps?” — STEPHEN COLBERT Jimmy Kimmel decried the president’s stance on the potential government shutdown. He said that in a season that’s about giving, Trump was threatening to take away people’s paychecks. “Hundreds of thousands of workers won’t get paid. Basically, Trump is taking paychecks from federal employees at Christmastime to punish Congress for not paying for a wall he swore 500 times Mexico would be paying for. So, Feliz Navidad, everyone.” — JIMMY KIMMEL “President Trump will travel tomorrow to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida to begin his 16-day vacation, where he will spend the holiday season in the company of Loved One.” — SETH MEYERS, showing a picture of Trump standing in front of a mirror “I saw that Google has a Santa tracker where you can watch Santa’s journey around the world.

You know those? They’re pretty cool. You send in your sample, and then after a few weeks you get a letter back that says, ‘Sir, that cup was for saliva.’” — JIMMY FALLON Before he headed off for the holiday break, Stephen Colbert teamed up with Showtime’s “Our Cartoon President” to create a fairly nonsensical animated short — about a Trump-supporting faux Santa Claus who conspires with the president to win “the war on Christmas.” Jimmy Kimmel had a similar idea: He read from a Dr. Seuss-parodying book, “How the Trump Saved Christmas.” The monoculture is dead.

Michael Cohen, President Trump’s onetime personal lawyer, was sentenced to three years in prison on Wednesday after entering a guilty plea that seemed to turn the heat up on the president. Late-night hosts all had reactions to the news. “Today was the big sentencing hearing for Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen. He got 36 months in prison — or as Trump put it, ‘That’s, like, 20 years!’” — JIMMY FALLON “Three years is a lot, but remember — Trump’s closest associate got life.” — SETH MEYERS, showing a photo of Melania Trump “At least 16 members of Team Trump had contact with the Russians during the campaign or transition. Sixteen! If Donald Trump was a rapper, his name would be Colludicrous.” — JIMMY KIMMEL Stephen Colbert focused on Cohen’s statement to the court, in which he denounced Trump and expressed regret for defending the president’s actions. Colbert didn’t have a lot of sympathy to offer Cohen. “Before Cohen climbed up onto the prison bus he made sure to throw Trump under it, telling the court, ‘Recently the president tweeted a statement calling me ‘weak,’ and it was correct, but for a much different reason than he was implying. It was because time and time again, I felt it was my duty to cover up his dirty deeds.’ And evidently, you suck at it.” — STEPHEN COLBERT “He went on rather poetically, ‘The irony is today is the day I am getting my freedom back.’ Actually, the irony is that while you’re in prison for your crimes, the guy who ordered you to do the crimes will be at Mar-a-Lago sharing chocolate cake with Xi Jinping and Kid Rock.” — STEPHEN COLBERT Trump thinks “the people” have his back. James Corden isn’t convinced. “During a recent interview, Donald Trump was asked if he’s concerned about being impeached, and he had this to say: He said, ‘I’m not concerned, no. I think the people would revolt if that happened.’ Honestly, I think the people are pretty revolted right now.” — JAMES CORDEN “According to a new report, the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food is looking to hire a cannabis program manager to oversee marijuana regulations. A cannabis program manager — or as it’s more commonly known, an R.A.” — SETH MEYERS “Trump met with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer about the border wall yesterday, and they made him so angry that he threw a folder full of papers across the room.

2018,Stephen Colbert Enjoys Michael Flynn’s Pain,"Best of Late Night Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night’s highlights that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. A sentencing hearing for Michael Flynn, the president’s former national security adviser, went south on Tuesday after a judge berated him and suggested that Flynn’s efforts to mislead federal investigators warranted prison. The judge, Emmet G. Sullivan, encouraged Flynn to accept his offer to postpone the sentencing, so that he could have extra time to prove the value of his cooperation with prosecutors. Sullivan held Flynn’s feet to the fire, even floating the question of whether his crimes amounted to treason (although prosecutors never charged him with that). On “The Late Show,” Stephen Colbert was happy to review some of the hearing’s most squirm-inducing moments. “Even though Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. last week, Flynn’s lawyer submitted a sentencing memo explaining it wasn’t Flynn’s fault — because ‘agents hadn’t warned Flynn it was a crime to lie to the F.B.I.’ Of course, good point! How is he supposed to know? They gotta tell him! Just like how hospitals all have to post signs that say, ‘Do not steal cough medicine and then burn down this building.’” — STEPHEN COLBERT “Flynn’s lawyers seemed ready to argue that their client had been tricked into lying. Yes, the F.B.I. has a clever way to trick anyone who works for Trump into lying: They ask them a question. It’s called entrapment.” — STEPHEN COLBERT James Corden responded to the news that the Trump Foundation would dissolve, after New York’s attorney general filed a scathing lawsuit accusing it of violating campaign finance laws. “I just think it’s beautiful that even though he’s busy with the presidency, Trump still makes time for his lifelong passion: driving organizations into the ground.” — JAMES CORDEN “To be clear, the Trump Foundation is different from the Trump administration, which, thanks to the Russia investigation, is also dissolving under court supervision.” — JAMES CORDEN Trevor Noah confessed that he was surprised Trump had ever founded a charity organization in the first place. “I’m going to be honest with you guys — I’m even shocked that Trump had a charity. I always thought the only Trump charity was the women who agree to have sex with him.” — TREVOR NOAH “President Trump’s re-election campaign has established a special hotline that supporters can use to call and leave a message thanking Trump for his service. Or, just as likely, he’ll pick up. [impersonating Trump] ‘No, I’m not busy — tell me I’m great!’” — SETH MEYERS “Keith Richards turns 75 today, and hey, I hope I look that good — when I’m 91.” — SETH MEYERS “A perfume company in Portland recently launched the first-ever perfume made with marijuana. The perfume is made from essential oils found in cannabis, but contains no THC. I’m pretty sure marijuana perfume already exists — it’s called marijuana. I think Reg has been wearing this perfume for the last four years.” — JAMES CORDEN, referring to his sidekick and “Late Late Show” bandleader Reggie Watts Can you handle 22 musicals in 12 minutes?

Another day, another high-profile witness in the Russia investigation. On Thursday, Stephen Colbert unpacked the news that David Pecker — the publisher of The National Enquirer and a close ally of President Trump — had admitted to prosecutors that he made hush-money payments to a Playboy model to shield Trump’s presidential campaign. Colbert found plenty of angles of attack. “Yes, Trump’s friend is named David Pecker. Go ahead and laugh — I know it’s funny — the idea of Donald Trump having a friend.” — STEPHEN COLBERT “Trump may have paid off Stormy Daniels, but yesterday, court papers revealed that The Enquirer paid Karen McDougal for exclusive rights to her story about her affair with Trump, then they buried the story. It’s a practice in tabloid news known as catch and kill. Which is also what Eric and Don Jr. call a day at the zoo.” — STEPHEN COLBERT The White House announced on Thursday that it would cancel this year’s holiday party for members of the press. Some commentators have interpreted it as a swipe at the news media from the White House. But James Corden joked that maybe Team Trump just couldn’t find enough journalists interested in partying with them. “Now, does it technically count as canceling if nobody R.S.V.P.’d?” — JAMES CORDEN “Trump actually had a good excuse. He was like, ‘Why would I host a bunch of people who can’t stand me and want me out of office? If I wanted to do that, I’d spend the evening with Melania.’” — JAMES CORDEN “To me it makes sense for the president to cancel this party. I mean, what kind of party would this be? What would his toast be? ‘Welcome, enemies of the people?’” — JIMMY KIMMEL “Not only did he cancel the press party, he’s also very close to canceling the Republican Party as a whole.” — JIMMY KIMMEL With Trump in hot water legally, Trevor Noah ran back tape of Trump and his allies proclaiming their commitment to the rule of law, from various moments throughout the campaign and his presidency. In one clip from 2016, Trump tells a crowd: “I am the law and order candidate!” Noah mocked Trump with an impersonation: “That’s right folks. I am the law and order candidate. As in: I will break the law, in order to become president.” — TREVOR NOAH “Apple just announced that it will be building a brand-new, $1 billion campus in Austin, Tex. The project is part of Apple’s plan to create 20,000 new jobs.

If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. Stephen Colbert wants to know why Michael Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer, is such an open book all of a sudden. Cohen has owned up to a number of serious crimes in his testimony to Robert Mueller, the special counsel — despite never having received a guarantee that he’d get clemency when he is sentenced. It’s a move that has left some analysts scratching their heads. “Cohen, in fact, pleaded guilty ‘without first obtaining a traditional, ironclad deal under which the government would commit to seeking leniency.’ Well played, player! ‘O.K., I’m putting my cards on the table. As you can see, I got nothing, and I’m betting it all!’” — STEPHEN COLBERT, quoting from a report in The New York Times “Reportedly, Cohen wanted to speed up the legal process in part because he ‘has concluded that his life has been utterly destroyed by his relationship with Mr. Trump.’ To which Melania replied, ‘Get in line.’” — STEPHEN COLBERT Seth Meyers joked that, as a late-night TV host forced to cover the continuing saga of Trump’s presidency, he feels a kind of solidarity with Cohen. “Sources told The New York Times that President Trump’s ex-lawyer Michael Cohen feels his life has been destroyed by his relationship with President Trump. Oh, man, I feel the same way. When we started ‘Late Night,’ it was supposed to be a cooking show.” — SETH MEYERS You probably don’t want to know how filthy your cellphone is. James Corden certainly wasn’t happy to find out. “According to a recent study, the average cellphone is nearly seven times dirtier than — brace yourselves — a toilet. Yeah, it’s true. Although there’s an easy solution: Just rinse off your phone in the toilet.” — JAMES CORDEN “What exactly am I supposed to do with this information? What do you want me to do — stop using my phone or stop cleaning my toilet?” — JAMES CORDEN “Amtrak is looking for people to ride their trains and post about it on social media with the hashtag #takemethere. It’s better than Greyhound’s hashtag, #astrangerissleepingonmeandthedriverisgone.” — JIMMY FALLON “A new poll found that the top three Democratic contenders for president in 2020 are Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Beto O’Rourke. Biden’s got the best experience, Bernie’s got the best fund-raising, and Beto’s got the best chance of being alive in 2020.” — JIMMY FALLON “Will they or won’t they? This is the Ross and Rachel of me finding out what happens to Ross and Rachel.” — STEPHEN COLBERT, frustrated by Netflix’s waffling on whether “Friends” will continue to be available on the streaming platform (it will — for now) A wholesome holiday tradition, gone wrong. Amber Ruffin is not mad at the guy secretly eating dog treats on national TV. Andy Cohen, host of “Watch What Happens Live” on Bravo, and CNN’s Anderson Cooper are two great interviewers with very different styles.

2018,Stephen Curry Doubts Moon Landings. NASA Offers to Show Him the Rocks.,"The space agency invited the Golden State star to visit the Johnson Space Center, “perhaps the next time the Warriors are in town to play the Rockets.” It has been a big 24 hours for Stephen Curry. His team was named Sports Illustrated’s “Sportsperson of the Year,” he was named the Western Conference’s player of the week, and his comments denying the moon landing happened made him the enemy of science teachers everywhere. Curry, who recently returned from injury and rejoined the Golden State Warriors in their quest for a third consecutive championship, was a guest on a podcast called “Winging It,” which is hosted by the N.B.A. players Vince Carter and Kent Bazemore as well as Annie Finberg, a digital content coordinator for the Atlanta Hawks. During a wide-ranging talk among Carter, Bazemore, Curry and Curry’s teammate Andre Iguodala, the topic of the sounds dinosaurs made was being discussed before Curry abruptly shifted gears, asking the others if they believed the United States had put a person on the moon. “We ever been to the moon?” he asked. The others, in unison, agreed that the answer was no. “They’re going to come get us,” Curry replied. “Sorry, I don’t want to start conspiracies.” Finberg expressed some skepticism, asking Curry to clarify, and he said he did not believe the United States had landed on the moon, leading to a short discussion of some of the more popular conspiracy theories, including one asserting that the film director Stanley Kubrick had staged the entire thing. In fact, NASA landed humans on the moon six times from 1969 to 1972, putting a total of 12 astronauts on the lunar surface. It was the only space agency to pull off a piloted mission to the moon, and, after a request from President Trump, NASA is working on plans for another piloted mission in the future. “We’d love for Mr. Curry to tour the lunar lab at our Johnson Space Center in Houston, perhaps the next time the Warriors are in town to play the Rockets,” said Allard Beutel, a NASA spokesman. “We have hundreds of pounds of moon rocks stored there, and the Apollo mission control. During his visit, he can see firsthand what we did 50 years ago, as well as what we’re doing now to go back to the moon in the coming years, but this time to stay.” Curry’s comments were reminiscent of the Celtics star Kyrie Irving’s oft-repeated skepticism that Earth is round. Irving drew a great deal of criticism for his comments but did not back down for some time. In October, more than a year after his first comments about the globe, Irving reversed course and explained that he had simply been “huge into conspiracies.” Curry is far from being alone in expressing skepticism that the moon landing actually occurred, but NASA has worked hard to show through scientific evidence that it accomplished a feat that no other country could. And it is that competitive spirit among countries that the agency says should help confirm that it could not have faked the endeavor. “There are answers to all the questions raised by the nonbelievers,” the agency says on its website, “but one of the strongest arguments is that all the Apollo missions were independently tracked by England and Russia (our allies and enemies), both of whom sent letters of congratulations after the moon landings. In the midst of a heated space race, the Russians would have called our bluff if the landings had not actually happened.” Curry has yet to comment since his podcast comments were made public, but the astronauts of Apollo 17 provided an image that can serve as evidence both of a trip to the moon and of Earth being round — thus quashing the doubts voiced by Curry and Irving: The famous “Blue Marble” photograph of the planet, which was taken on the flight to the moon in 1972.",The New York Times
2018,Steve Bannon and a Fugitive Billionaire Target a Common Enemy: China,"Just months after being pushed out of the White House, Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump’s former chief strategist, met with a fugitive Chinese billionaire at a suite in the luxurious Hays-Adams Hotel in Washington. The billionaire, Guo Wengui, who is also known as Miles Kwok, was living in New York City and had landed on China’s most-wanted list, accused of bribery, fraud and money laundering. He was also a dissident and fierce critic of Beijing, seeking political asylum in the United States. And Mr. Bannon — increasingly obsessed with the emerging China threat — was eager to talk about the Communist Party, corruption and American naval operations in the South China Sea. Since their first discussion in October 2017, they have met dozens of times — in Dallas, on Mr. Guo’s yacht and, more often, at the billionaire’s $67.5 million apartment in the Sherry-Netherland Hotel, overlooking New York’s Central Park. The two shared a stage two weeks ago in Manhattan, at a news conference they organized to announce plans to set up a $100 million fund to investigate corruption and aid people they deem victims of Chinese government persecution. “We both naturally despise the Chinese Communist Party,” Mr. Guo said in an interview last week, referring to Mr. Bannon. “That’s why we’ve become partners.” It’s an unusual partnership between two political gadflies with a common, if overly grand, objective: bringing about the demise of the Chinese Communist Party. One is an exiled businessman who claims to have evidence of corruption at the highest levels of government in China. The other is a former Goldman Sachs banker who delights in lobbing political grenades at what he calls the “party of Davos,” a band of global elites that he says has undermined America’s interests at home and abroad. As tensions between the United States and China grow, the two men are hoping to stoke them even further, by effectively calling for the overthrow of Beijing’s leadership. Mr. Guo is dipping into his fortune, while Mr. Bannon has agreed to provide a strategy. Mr. Bannon is, in effect, reprising the role of political provocateur he played before joining the Trump campaign in the summer of 2016. Back then, he was running the conservative news site Breitbart, and helping promote conspiracy theories through the publication of books like “Clinton Cash,” which aimed to destroy Hillary Clinton’s White House bid. In an interview in his hotel room two weeks ago, Mr. Bannon, 65, said the new China-related fund he will head, without pay, will gather evidence, share it with authorities — in the United States and elsewhere — and publish it in the media. The fund also targets Wall Street banks and law firms, which he says are complicit in China’s misdeeds. The project, he says, is consistent with his populist and nationalist agenda. China’s reckless behavior, he contended, is endangering the global economy, and sapping America’s strength. “As a populist, this is outrageous,” Mr. Bannon said, noting that American financial institutions have helped back the worrisome global buying sprees of Chinese companies, with cash raised from ordinary people, including government pension funds. “The elites in this country have to be held accountable. We have to get the facts on the table.” Mr. Guo, 50, insists that the fund offers a way to strike back at Beijing. China has pressed the Trump administration to extradite him so that he can face a raft of charges in China — allegations he strongly denies. Billions of dollars in assets he controlled have been frozen by Beijing. And Interpol, the global police organization, has issued a warrant seeking his arrest. He now travels with a phalanx of security guards, saying he fears for his life. The Chinese Embassy could not be reached for comment. But the Guo-Bannon alliance has alarmed some analysts, who view the two men as purveyors of conspiracy theories fueling anti-China sentiment. “The problem with these types of reckless, loose-cannon accusations is that they undermine the ability of responsible analysts and policymakers to identify the genuine cases of Chinese wrongdoing and fashion realistic and effective policy responses,” said Michael D. Swaine, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. For Mr. Bannon, the new effort plays to a longstanding and complicated interest in China. As a young naval officer in the 1970s, he patrolled the South China Sea. He also lived for a time in Shanghai, where he ran a small online gaming company. In recent years, he has come to view China as a military threat to the United States, and a fierce economic rival that refuses to play by the rules. In helping elect Donald J. Trump, Mr. Bannon counseled him to take a tough line on China and step up trade pressure on Beijing. Mr. Trump obliged by tapping the Harvard-trained economist Peter Navarro, a longtime China critic known for his book “Death by China,” and Michael Pillsbury, a China hawk at the Hudson Institute, as top trade advisers. It was during his time at the White House, Mr. Bannon says, that he first heard about Mr. Guo. The Chinese billionaire was living in New York, broadcasting allegations of high-level government corruption in China on Twitter and YouTube — some credible, some outlandish and still unproved. By then, he had also applied for political asylum. Alarmed by his social media campaign and his public denunciations of the Communist Party, Beijing began pressing the Trump administration to extradite Mr. Guo. Chinese investigators said he has ties to Ma Jian, a former spy chief now imprisoned in China on charges of bribery and abuse of power. Inside the White House, there were disagreements over how to deal with Mr. Guo. Several Western businessmen, apparently eager to cozy up to Beijing, lobbied President Trump to accede to China’s demands, according to people familiar with the talks. Mr. Bannon said he sided with those in the administration who opposed any handover, viewing Mr. Guo as a potentially valuable “intelligence asset.” They met only after Mr. Bannon was forced out of the White House. Mr. Bannon says he received a call from Bill Gertz, a Washington journalist who has long been critical of China. Mr. Gertz told him that Mr. Guo was scheduled to give a talk in Washington at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank. The talk was canceled at the last minute. Over lunch, Mr. Guo and Mr. Bannon discussed China’s military capabilities, as well as the financial implications of Beijing’s rule, including what impact the country’s mounting corporate debt might have on its economy. A friendship emerged. “It was fantastic. He really impressed me,” Mr. Bannon said of his first meeting with Mr. Guo. “We talked about President Trump’s approach to China, and he went into corruption in the Chinese Communist Party.” Mr. Bannon later introduced Mr. Guo to people in the hedge fund community, including J. Kyle Bass, who has soured on China and sought to profit by short-selling the Chinese currency. As Mr. Bannon sharpened his critique of China’s rise, he also began meeting privately with some of America’s leading experts on China, to seek their counsel and outline his agenda. Few welcomed his strident remarks, according to people who attended some of the sessions. But more recently, analysts say, his positions have gotten a warmer reception. “The tectonic plates are shifting,” says Orville H. Schell, the director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society. “Many analysts would have totally rejected him two years ago. But people are more sympathetic now that engagement with China has been defrocked.” Mr. Schell adds, “On the China question, he’s no longer the skunk at the party.” But Mr. Bannon is getting blowback from some of Beijing’s friends. On a trip abroad this year to drum up support for nationalist and populist leaders in Eastern and Central Europe, Mr. Bannon says, he was scolded for his positions on China by Milos Zeman, president of the Czech Republic and one of Beijing’s closest allies in the region. “He threw down on me hard,” Mr. Bannon says. “He said: ‘Tell Trump you didn’t learn from Hitler. You can’t fight on two fronts. You can’t take on radical Islam and China. You will end up in the bunker, like Hitler.” A spokesman for President Zeman said that he had challenged Mr. Bannon on American tariffs against China, and that the two men had parted ways in a very “cold atmosphere.” Mr. Bannon is unbowed. He has agreed to serve as chairman of the so-called Rule of Law Fund, the $100 million effort that Mr. Guo is financing. The fund plans to publicize its findings and offer financial support to businessmen, government officials and others who run afoul of the Chinese authorities — including those who flee overseas, like Mr. Guo himself. Mr. Bannon has also joined Mr. Guo in targeting the HNA Group, the huge Chinese conglomerate that borrowed heavily and spent billions around the world, before debt and regulatory pressures forced the company to curb its global ambitions. Until Twitter suspended his account late last year, Mr. Guo was waging an online war against HNA and its top executives. He claimed, without proof, that the company was engaged in bribing top officials and their relatives, and has even spun conspiracy theories about the death of the company’s co-chairman Wang Jian in an accident in France last summer. HNA declined to comment. At their joint news conference last week, Mr. Bannon took the stage at the Pierre Hotel on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan to say, “Literally hundreds, if not thousands, of the best and brightest” in China have disappeared, been imprisoned or committed suicide under unusual circumstances and without due process. “Today is about recklessness and accountability,” he added, noting that American financial institutions have close ties to political elites in Beijing. “Who profited off this? Who looked the other way?”",The New York Times
2018,Steven Spielberg on Storytelling’s Power to Fight Hate,"The director is reissuing “Schindler’s List,” as he expands the mission of the Shoah Foundation through video testimonies of genocide survivors. LOS ANGELES — “Pinchas, how old are you?” Steven Spielberg asked the wall screen, a life-size video image of an elderly man in a cardigan, who blinked and answered without missing a beat. “I was born in 1932, so you can make your own arithmetic,” responded Pinchas, in a Polish accent. “He asked me to do the math!” Mr. Spielberg laughed. “How did you survive when so many did not?” “How did I survive?” the screen responded. “I survived, I believe, because providence watched over me.” The chat went on for five minutes, and while the artificial intelligence looked eerily reminiscent of Mr. Spielberg’s earlier films, the goal wasn’t entertainment — it was education. On the sound-sensitive screen was an interactive biography of Pinchas Gutter, a Polish Jew who survived the Holocaust and whose story was part of a tour the director was leading through the redesigned headquarters for the U.S.C. Shoah Foundation, the organization he founded in 1994 to collect testimony from Holocaust survivors. Now Mr. Spielberg has expanded the foundation’s footprint on the University of Southern California campus, along with its mission and public focus: to fight hate, which he says has become commonplace globally. “The presence of hate has become taken for granted,” Mr. Spielberg said. “We are not doing enough to counter it.” The prerecorded video conversation is part of a series using playback technology that invites visitors to converse with 16 survivors of genocide, based on specific word patterns and more than 2,000 questions that vary from views on God to personal history. Earlier this month, the testimony of Pinchas was displayed at the United Nations on the 70th anniversary of the adoption of genocide laws, a storytelling tool to raise awareness. While the foundation continues to archive stories from victims of anti-Semitism, and advocate on their behalf, it is also collecting what Mr. Spielberg calls “living testimony” from modern genocide victims. “The Holocaust cannot stand alone,” he said with conviction. “We decided to send our videographers into Rwanda to get testimony. From there we went to Cambodia, Armenia — we’re doing a critical study in the Central African Republic, Guatemala, the Nanjing massacre. Most recently, we’re doing testimony on the anti-Rohingya violence in Myanmar and the current anti-Semitic violence in Europe. We’re expanding our scope to counter many forms of hate.” The 10,000-square-foot space — which opened to the public last month — is a far cry from the organization’s beginnings following “Schindler’s List,” in 1993. Mr. Spielberg sent an army of videographers around the globe to record Holocaust survivors’ stories. Betamax tapes of the interviews were stored at his Amblin Entertainment offices on the Universal Studios lot, and then at a storage company before the foundation’s move to U.S.C.’s Leavey Library in 2006. (There are a little over 51,000 recordings of Holocaust survivors in the visual history archive, a staggering 115,000 hours.) Today the group has 82 employees and an annual budget of about $15 million, which includes $3 million from the university. It also has received millions in donations. Its new home — part office, part media lab — is packed with video testimonies from 65 countries in 43 languages, along with survivor-inspired artwork (a hanging steel sculpture by the British artist Nicola Anthony incorporates phrases from filmed testimony.) Visitors can tour the offices Monday through Friday, between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. “Everyone thinks the Shoah Foundation is about archiving the past but it’s about understanding empathy and using testimony to shine a light,” Stephen D. Smith, its executive director, said. Reflecting its founder’s legacy, the organization has produced multiple films, including the recent documentary “The Girl and the Picture,” about 88-year-old Xia Shuqin, who witnessed the murder of her family in the Nanjing Massacre in 1937. It was directed by Vanessa Roth, whose mother was an interviewer for the foundation in the early 1990s. “The Last Goodbye,” a virtual reality memorial screening at Holocaust museums in Florida, New York, Illinois and California, takes audiences into the Majdanek concentration camp in German-occupied Poland, with Pinchas Gutter as guide, using thousands of photos and 3-D video to explore a railway car, gas chamber and barracks. David Korins, the scenic designer of the musical “Hamilton,” is now the foundation’s director of museum experiences, with the goal of getting the collection of archival footage into more museums. Rising anti-Semitism is providing fresh impetus for the foundation’s relaunched efforts. “Not only are people willing to forget about the Holocaust, they’re willing to deny it,” said Aaron Breitbart, a senior researcher at the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the human rights organization that has worked with the foundation since the 1990s. “The Shoah Foundation has made a great contribution in that battle for memory.” The relaunch coincides with the theatrical rerelease of “Schindler’s List.” In her 1993 review of the film for The Times, Janet Maslin wrote: “Rising brilliantly to the challenge of this material and displaying an electrifying creative intelligence, Mr. Spielberg has made sure that neither he nor the Holocaust will ever be thought of in the same way again.” The film ran in about 1,000 theaters in mid-December and was screened free for students nationwide. Although it was digitally remastered in 4K resolution, Mr. Spielberg said, “I didn’t touch a frame.” The original version of the film is currently available on Netflix. A quarter century on, it remains a complex depiction of Nazi horrors. “We were surprised that somebody even attempted to make a film about it,” said Renee Firestone, 94, whose story is told at the foundation. Despite the expansion, some challenges remain, Mr. Smith said. Most testimonies are unavailable online, which means they can only be seen at the foundation or the 146 partner libraries and universities (links are free for families of those interviewed). There are no transcripts of the recordings yet, but the foundation is spending $10 million building a free online platform for researchers, schools and the general public starting in late 2019, Mr. Smith said. Days before Mr. Spielberg’s 72nd birthday, wearing a suede jacket and 1860s-style boots from his 2012 opus, “Lincoln,” the director munched a granola bar at the foundation’s headquarters. The color of his beard is now saltier, he has a few more inches around the middle, but his gray-green eyes still shine boyishly when he’s discussing his foundation and his seminal film. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. Why expand the mission of the Shoah Foundation? I think there’s a measurable uptick in anti-Semitism, and certainly an uptick in xenophobia. The racial divide is bigger than I would ever imagine it could be in this modern era. People are voicing hate more now because there’s so many more outlets that give voice to reasonable and unreasonable opinions and demands. People in the highest places are allowing others who would never express their hatred to publicly express it. And that’s been a big change. There’s all kinds of efforts to take the truth and subvert it to twisted ideology. We saw it happen in Europe first, in France, then Poland again — I never thought it would come back home to us like it has existed over the last two years. Many groups are clamoring that they have it harder than others — how do we overcome that? We can commiserate with each other about suffering and pain, but we should never compete that way. Being marginalized, being discriminated against, having racist and anti-Semitic slurs hurled is something that unites [all people]. Everything against black society is also against the Jewish community. Everything against the gay and lesbian, LGBTQ community is against black and Jewish communities. Hate is hate and the spillover makes us all responsible for watching each others’ backs and standing up for each other. None of us could ever be bystanders again. How can Hollywood combat this? Look how many movies are now telling the stories of women. There’s a huge shift that is gender-centric, and we saw it happen at the beginning of the Harvey Weinstein downfall. Storytelling is fundamentally human. But the art of listening is what I’m hoping the Shoah Foundation is able to inspire. [In 2018, Amblin Television, a division of Amblin Partners, Mr. Spielberg’s production company, was one of three parties to a $9.5 million settlement agreement with an actress on the CBS show “Bull” who was dropped after she confronted its star about inappropriate comments. A representative for Amblin declined to comment, directing inquiries to CBS, “the sole owner of the show.”] You are rereleasing “Schindler’s List” after 25 years. Do you believe it can still make an impact? At the Tribeca Film Festival, I experienced my first audience in 25 years watching “Schindler’s List.” It was a full house, and the reaction — I turned to Kate [Capshaw, his wife] and said “Oh my God, they’re still listening.” With this renewed cycle of hate, and initiatives at the Shoah Foundation, I thought it could open up a conversation that genocide can happen anywhere when an ordinary society goes wrong. Charlottesville and the aftermath made a huge impact on wanting to reissue the film. If you made the film today, what are the things you would have changed? No. There’s nothing I would have changed, absolutely nothing. I stand by the film as it has stood its own test of time. What sticks with you 25 years later about filming in Poland, where the carnage happened? In four months’ filming in Krakow, the hair on the back of my neck never went down. It was really hard every morning to simply get out of the car and walk to the set. I wanted to use the locations where Schindler stayed in Krakow, including the Jewish Ghetto, even shooting very close to the Płaszów forced labor camp. We shot just outside Auschwitz, building a barracks and backing the train into Auschwitz proper, so when the train exits Auschwitz, it appeared in the film as if it’s entering the death camp. That was one of the coldest nights I ever experienced. That mournful silence within the company of actors — you could hear a pin drop. The foundation decided to include modern testimonies about genocide when it already has over 51,000 testimonies on record about anti-Semitism. My grandparents were filmed by the foundation in 1996; is video the best teacher? Look, we’re all storytellers. There’s no one alive who isn’t a storyteller, even if they don’t think they are. Every day is a story. Maya Angelou said: “History, despite its wrenching pain, cannot be unlived, but if faced with courage, need not be lived again.” What are your earliest memories of being different? My grandmother taught English to Hungarian Holocaust survivors in Cincinnati. I was 2 or 3, and I would sit with them around the table. That’s where I learned my numbers — on the arm of an Auschwitz survivor who showed me the numbers of his forearm. That was my “Sesame Street.” That’s how I first learned to count. What more can we do? What do you plan to do? Teachers and parents who need to take responsibility for the acceptance of hatred in the fabric of society. I’m working with the Discovery Channel and the Academy Award-winning filmmaker Alex Gibney on a six-hour study called “Why We Hate.” I’m not planning any more dramatization on the Holocaust itself. I’m putting all my attention on the documentary format.",The New York Times
2018,Steven Stamkos Has 3 Goals and Milestone as Lightning Top Rangers,"N.H.L. Roundup Steven Stamkos had three goals to become the first player from the 2008 N.H.L. draft to reach 700 points, and the league-leading Tampa Bay Lightning won their seventh consecutive game, beating the visiting Rangers, 6-3, on Monday night. Stamkos scored power-play goals that tied the game in the first and second periods. The center completed his ninth hat trick and first since Oct. 13, 2014, from the slot at 10 minutes 41 seconds of the third. “I knew it had been a while,” Stamkos said with a laugh. “I don’t know the exact date. I don’t want to hear it.” He has 701 points in 696 career games, joining Martin St. Louis (953) and Vincent Lecavalier (874) as the only Tampa Bay players to reach 700. Ryan McDonagh had a go-ahead goal, Anthony Cirelli had the other two Tampa Bay goals, and Louis Domingue made 23 saves. Kevin Hayes had two goals and Jesper Fast also scored for the Rangers, who have lost six of eight (2-5-1). Henrik Lundqvist stopped 30 shots. The Lightning went 2 for 6 on the power play. “Take that many penalties, you’re not going to beat Tampa,” Lundqvist said. “That’s just the way it is. We can work really hard and do a lot of good things, but it’s too important in the game.” Rangers defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk left in the second period with an upper-body injury. He took a check around the left shoulder and had a sling on his left arm after the game. He will be evaluated Tuesday. PENGUINS 2, ISLANDERS 1 Jake Guentzel scored the decisive goal in the fifth round of a shootout to give Pittsburgh the victory over the Islanders in their second game back at Nassau Coliseum. Guentzel also assisted on Derick Brassard’s tying goal in the third period, helping Pittsburgh improve to 3-0-1 in its last four games. Casey DeSmith had 25 saves through regulation and overtime. The Islanders controlled the play most of overtime but could not convert on a power play created when Brassard was whistled for tripping Valtteri Filppula deep in the Islanders’ zone with 2:48 left. DeSmith lost his stick while making a save during one sequence, but Pittsburgh was able to clear the puck. Phil Kessel beat Islanders goalie Robin Lehner in the first round of the shootout, but Josh Bailey scored on the Islanders’ third attempt to keep the tiebreaker going. Filppula was denied by DeSmith before Guentzel closed out the win. Anthony Beauvillier scored in the second period for the Islanders, who are 1-2-1 in their past four games. Lehner, making his first start since Nov. 29, finished with 23 saves. Islanders forward Cal Clutterbuck departed after he was crosschecked by Kris Letang. Islanders Coach Barry Trotz had no update on Clutterbuck after the game.",The New York Times
2018,Stewing Black-Eyed Peas for New Year’s Luck,"The chef Mashama Bailey of the Grey in Savannah, Ga., incorporates a vital tradition into her New Year’s Day feast. About 10 years ago, the chef Mashama Bailey asked her maternal grandmother, Geneva West, of Forsyth, Ga., to serve black-eyed peas with ham hocks and collard greens on New Year’s Eve. Ms. Bailey was returning to New York City, where she lived, and wanted to have that symbolic meal before she left that day. A lilt in her grandmother’s voice suggested her reluctance to serve the dish before New Year’s Day. But Ms. West ultimately agreed. “I felt loved when she decided to make that dish early for me,” Ms. Bailey said. “She had a special way of making all her grands and great-grands feel loved by her.” Ms. West is gone, and Ms. Bailey, now the chef at the Grey, in Savannah, Ga., makes the black-eyed peas for New Year’s Day, hosting a feast at the restaurant that is rooted in tradition but also shows her own touch. That first big meal of the new year, with a pot of black-eyed peas at its center, is deeply entwined with African-American culture. “Eating black-eyed peas on New Year’s Day has been done by black Americans to ensure good luck in the incoming year,” said Jessica B. Harris, the food historian, who fondly recalled attending the lively New Year’s Day party Maya Angelou held at her home in Harlem, where the peas were served. “This tradition carries over from the black American community into the general Southern community in many places, and persists in the North as well as a result of the Great Migration.” Black-eyed peas were domesticated in West Africa and carried to the South and the Caribbean in the era of slavery, Dr. Harris said. Dried legumes were looked down on as poor man’s food, but the economic scarcities of the Civil War severely impacted the diets of both enslaved Africans and white Southerners. Black-eyed peas became more common and, it is said, people considered themselves fortunate to eat them during a time rife with food insecurity. Though Ms. Bailey’s family uses ham hocks in its black-eyed peas, she opts for a vegan approach that produces a clean, pure pea flavor. It also allows her version to be enjoyed by those who don’t eat meat. “I strive for inclusivity,” she said. At the Grey, her nationally lauded restaurant housed in a former, once-segregated Greyhound bus station, the New Year’s Day event starts at noon and ends at sunset. Roughly 150 people come for an outdoor, family-style meal in the yard, where the buses had parked. Today the space is set up with picnic tables and handsomely landscaped with Meyer lemon trees. Ms. Bailey serves a simple, straightforward menu that makes strategic use of Southern ingredients: the black-eyed peas, simmered with Vidalia onion, a Georgia native; collard greens that are wood-smoked with a mixture of pecan and oak, also from Georgia; cornbread adapted from a recipe by the Southern cooking authority Edna Lewis; and a sprawling oyster roast that commandeers two large grills. Ms. Bailey hopes to get people thinking and talking about the origins and complexities of a shared heritage. Black-eyed peas are a way to achieve that goal. “For me, there’s more to New Year’s than the tradition,” she said. “I strive to create a broader reach through a broader table.” Recipe: Stewed Black-Eyed Peas Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

2018,Stock Market Rout Has Trump Fixated on Fed Chair Powell,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has unabashedly hitched his political fortunes to a rising stock market. Now, with stock prices in retreat, he has become increasingly fixated on the idea that one man is to blame for the recent rout: Jerome H. Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve. After the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday, the fifth consecutive quarterly increase, Mr. Trump fretted to aides that Mr. Powell would “turn me into Hoover,” a reference to the man who was president in the early years of the Great Depression. Mr. Trump has said choosing Mr. Powell for the Fed job last year was the worst mistake of his presidency, and he has asked aides whether he has the power to fire him. But the volatile stock market, which just posted its worst week since 2008, is falling in part because of Mr. Trump’s own policies, including an escalating trade war with China, a shutdown of the federal government and the fading effects of the $1.5 trillion tax cut Mr. Trump ushered in at the end of 2017. While the Fed’s rate increases have upset investors — who seem to have a darker view of economic growth than the central bank does — some analysts said Mr. Trump’s musings about the Fed would only exacerbate anxieties. “If Powell gets terminated, what we’ve seen happen in the markets in the past few weeks will look like a walk in the park,” David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff, said in an email on Sunday. “The dollar will go into a tailspin, and even confidence in the Treasury market will erode, especially among foreign creditors.” Mr. Trump’s economic advisers scrambled over the weekend to reassure markets that Mr. Trump was not, in fact, planning to fire Mr. Powell. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin tweeted what he said was a quote from Mr. Trump accepting that he did not even have the power to do so. “I totally disagree with Fed policy,” Mr. Mnuchin quoted Mr. Trump as saying. “I think the increasing of interest rates and the shrinking of the Fed portfolio is an absolute terrible thing to do at this time, especially in light of my major trade negotiations which are ongoing, but I never suggested firing Chairman Jay Powell, nor do I believe I have the right to do so.” Mick Mulvaney, the incoming acting White House chief of staff, implied on Sunday that Mr. Trump had, in fact, inquired about removing Mr. Powell, saying on ABC’s “This Week” that the president “now realizes he does not have the authority.” But Mr. Mulvaney added that he had heard this from Mr. Mnuchin, not from Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump has not addressed the issue directly, including on his own Twitter feed, which he has frequently used to criticize the Fed. The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, told reporters on Saturday, “I’m aware of no plans to fire Mr. Powell” — but that brief statement stopped well short of corroborating Mr. Mnuchin’s account of the president’s views. Mr. Mnuchin has worked in recent days to obtain Mr. Trump’s assurance that he would not remove Mr. Powell, according to an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity. But that person cautioned that Mr. Trump could change his mind. The person noted Mr. Trump has a tendency to nurse grudges even when he temporarily sets a subject aside. Mr. Mnuchin has been under pressure from Mr. Trump to stabilize markets, which are on pace for the largest December declines since the 1930s. In a statement Sunday, Mr. Mnuchin said he had contacted the chief executives of six major banks to make sure their operations were running smoothly. Mr. Mnuchin, who made the calls while on vacation in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, said that bank executives confirmed they had sufficient liquidity for lending and market operations — the kind of statement the government usually reserves for moments of genuine uncertainty about the health of the financial system. The statement added that Mr. Mnuchin would convene a meeting of the President’s Working Group on financial markets, which he leads, to coordinate efforts to “assure normal market operations.” The Fed’s unanimous decision to raise its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday reflected the confidence of its officials that the economy remains strong — even as they insisted that future rate increases would depend on continued growth. By raising rates, the Fed is bringing to a close its long campaign of economic stimulus that began during the 2008 financial crisis, which included lowering interest rates to near zero. Still, Mr. Trump is hardly alone in his opposition to the Fed’s move. Some economists argue the Fed should continue its stimulus campaign to drive up employment and wages. They note that the Fed is about to undershoot its 2 percent inflation target for the seventh consecutive year, suggesting there is no need to step on the brakes. Many investors had also wanted a pause, and the decision set off another slide in stock prices. But even investors who disagreed with Wednesday’s decision generally do not want politicians to play a larger role in Fed policymaking, preferring to leave the management of interest rates primarily in the hands of technocrats. Most developed nations have granted their central banks considerable autonomy over policymaking precisely because of concerns that politicians would seek to increase short-term growth at the expense of inflation and instability. In fact, during his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump accused the Fed of getting political, saying that the bank’s chairwoman at the time, Janet L. Yellen, should be “ashamed” for keeping interest rates low — a move he said was meant to help President Barack Obama. “Markets are in the business of looking forward, and looking forward to a world with greatly diminished central bank independence isn’t something that markets should find comforting,” Eric Winograd, senior United States economist at AllianceBernstein, said in an email. Senators from both parties also warned the president against firing Mr. Powell. The president’s deliberations on Mr. Powell’s fate were first reported by Bloomberg News. “I’d be very careful about doing that,” Senator Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican and a former chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, told reporters on Saturday. “The independence of the Fed is the foundation of our banking system.” Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said, “Given the Fed’s consensus on monetary policy, any effort to remove Powell would hit the trifecta: unlawful, ineffective and damaging to the economy.” A key question is whether Mr. Trump has the legal authority to remove Mr. Powell. The Federal Reserve Act, which had its 105th anniversary on Sunday, says the president can remove members of the Fed’s board of governors, including Mr. Powell, only “for cause.” No president has ever tried, but legal scholars say the language is generally interpreted as meaning the president could not remove Mr. Powell over a policy disagreement. The law, however, does not address the president’s authority to remove Mr. Powell from his role as Fed chairman without removing him from the Fed’s board, a move that some of the president’s advisers have urged. But it is far from clear such a decision would serve the president’s purpose. A replacement for Mr. Powell would require Senate confirmation, and this person would join a policymaking committee that voted unanimously for the December rate increase. That committee also might be inclined, on future rate decisions, to demonstrate its independence from the president. While Mr. Trump has turned on his chairman, the Fed’s trajectory should not have been a surprise. When Mr. Trump chose Mr. Powell as Fed chairman in the fall of 2017, he said, “Based on his record, I am confident that Jay has the wisdom and leadership to guide our economy through any challenges that our great economy may face.” Mr. Trump also chose three of the other four members of the Fed’s board, all of whom joined Mr. Powell in voting for all four 2018 rate increases. In conversations with friends and advisers, Mr. Trump has acknowledged responsibility for the selection of Mr. Powell. He told Stephen Moore, an economist at the Heritage Foundation, that it was “one of the worst choices I’ve ever made,” according to Mr. Moore. Some of Mr. Trump’s economic advisers have encouraged him to remove Mr. Powell, arguing that the decision would reverse recent stock declines. Others, including Mr. Mnuchin, have warned that Mr. Trump would harm his own interests. Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University, said presidents had often tried to shape Fed policy, but the current episode stood apart because Mr. Trump appeared to be acting against his own interest in a stable economy. “I think what is the unusual part here is that it seems the president has created the crisis,” she said. “His intervention certainly seems to be making things worse for him and worse for the Fed and worse for the economy. It’s just very shortsighted, and we’re not used to that.”",The New York Times
2018,"Stock Markets Are Wild, but Bond Markets Can Be Dangerous","The sell-off in stocks isn’t the only ominous economic sign emanating from financial markets. The bond markets, much more closely linked to the actual economy, are also flashing a warning. Ask someone how “the Dow” is doing and, even if they don’t know the answer, they’ll know what you’re talking about. Ask them about the bond market and you’ll most likely get a blank stare. When it comes to the economy, however, bonds are far more important than stocks. Bond markets dictate the cost of borrowing money, and that can determine actual economic activity. The decision by a C.E.O. to build a plant or take the plunge on a new product is often decided by how much it will cost to borrow the money to pay for it. When that payment climbs too high, corporate activity slows, and so does the economy. Lately, borrowing costs have been rising quickly. Investors worried about corporate debt loads and the impact of a potential slowdown on profits are demanding companies pay them higher interest rates. And, in a recent troubling sign for the economy, fewer companies have been turning to the bond market to finance their businesses. As with the swooning stock market, weakness in the bond market doesn’t mean the economy is destined for an immediate downturn. But signals being sent by bond investors will almost certainly arise in discussions among policymakers at this week’s Federal Reserve meeting on monetary policy, which will culminate on Wednesday with a decision on interest rates. Here’s what you need to know. Like any borrower, a company raising capital in the bond markets pays interest. What they pay depends on how likely it is that a lender will get repaid. Consumers have credit scores. Companies have debt ratings. The greater the risk that a borrower won’t be able to pay up — known as credit risk — the higher the interest rates. American Treasury bonds almost always have the lowest interest rates. That’s because lending to the United States government — which has a virtually unblemished record of repaying creditors — is considered pretty much the safest investment on earth. Everyone else, even the most powerful, cash-rich corporations, must pay more. For example, Home Depot went to the bond market late last month, raising $1 billion by selling 10-year bonds. At the time, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note — the federal government’s cost to borrow for 10 years — was about 3.06 percent. Home Depot, considered a safe or “investment grade” borrower — paid an interest rate of almost 4 percent to borrow for 10 years. The difference between the low interest rate that the government pays and the higher rate of another borrower is called the credit spread. Riskier borrowers typically have larger spreads. Bankers who arrange bond issues for companies set the interest rate by looking at where the company’s other bonds are trading and assessing the demand for the new bond. A higher credit spread can also reflect investors’ concerns about things like the broader economy and the future ability of any company to pay money back. In recessions, for example, they rise for even the healthiest companies. “As the credit spread goes up, lenders are saying, ‘We’re really worried about making loans, riskier than lending to the government,’” said Philip Bond, a professor of finance at the University of Washington. Since early October, credit spreads have increased fast. Borrowers with investment-grade debt ratings (essentially higher credit scores) are paying more than 1.4 percentage points above Treasurys to borrow, up from less than 1 percentage point at the start of the year. Spreads on junk bonds, issued by companies that are considered significantly less creditworthy, have risen even more, from around 3.2 percentage points at the start of the year to more than 4.5 percentage points now, according to FactSet. The sudden increase — “widening” in the bond market’s lingo — is telling us that investors are suddenly more nervous about handing over their cash to corporations. The same change in sentiment is playing out in the stock market and the reasons are largely the same. A trade war that has no end, signs of a slowing world economy and a widely expected deceleration in growth the United States have all pushed investors to take less risk. At the same time, the Fed is slowly removing the helping hand it has extended to markets and the economy for the last decade, by raising rates and shrinking the stockpile of bonds it owns. Recent drops in oil prices are also making investors less willing to place their money with the smaller energy companies that tend to borrow in junk-bond markets. While the stock market sell-off may eventually affect sentiment among consumers and corporate executives, bond market moves can have an immediate impact on the economy by discouraging borrowing and investment. “As those spreads are widening, definitely there is going to be a reluctance to invest, especially in risky ventures,” said Marti Subrahmanyam, a professor of finance at New York University’s Stern School of Business. There are already signs that the recent jump in borrowing costs is slowing the flow of money to companies. In the junk bond market — where the riskiest borrowers are — there have been no new corporate debt deals this month, according to data from the financial market research firm Dealogic. If none happen, it would be the first such shutout since November 2008, near the peak of the financial crisis. It is true that borrowing costs are still very low by historical standards, because the Fed only just began to step back from its post-crisis programs to keep them that way. But one concern among investors is that this effort to hold down costs encouraged borrowing to a point that could be problematic in a downturn. Netflix has gone from having very little debt in 2010 to having more than $10 billion now. Verizon now has $113 billion of debt, more than double the amount it had six years ago. By one measure, the ratio of corporate debt to G.D.P., the total level of borrowing is at all-time highs. In general, higher debt levels could make it tougher for companies to repay the lenders if there’s a slump in the economy, or a hiccup in sales, or a decline in the value of assets. Back in 2015 we had just such a situation, when a similar surge in corporate bond spreads pushed borrowing costs up sharply. A sharp dive in crude oil prices was at the heart of the rout, making people less willing to lend money to indebted energy companies. A wave of defaults by energy-related companies, like Linn Energy and SandRidge Energy, ensued. That turmoil didn’t lead to a full-blown recession. But it did coincide with what some economists, including those at JPMorgan Chase, now call a “mini recession” between 2015 and 2016, in which industrial spending by companies in the manufacturing sector slowed sharply and dragged on growth. And with the American economy already expected to slow in 2019, the climbing costs of corporate borrowing could determine whether any slowdown turns into something much worse.",The New York Times
2018,"Stock Markets, Tsunami, NFL: Your Monday Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning, We start today with the naming of an acting defense secretary, the possibility of an extended government shutdown and the aftermath of a deadly tsunami in Indonesia. The president said on Sunday that he would remove Defense Secretary Jim Mattis by Jan. 1, two months earlier than planned, after a parade of defense analysts went on TV over the weekend to praise Mr. Mattis and his resignation letter, which criticized Mr. Trump’s foreign policy. Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive who was Mr. Mattis’s deputy, will serve as acting defense secretary. Mr. Trump also suggested that the U.S. military’s withdrawal from Syria, which he announced last week over Mr. Mattis’s objection, would not come as soon as promised. Notable: Brett McGurk, the U.S. special envoy to the coalition fighting the Islamic State, sped up his own departure, telling colleagues that he could not in good conscience carry out Mr. Trump’s new Syria policy. From Opinion: Susan Rice, a former national security adviser, writes that the decision-making process that led to Mr. Mattis’s resignation does more to undermine American national security than any foreign adversary does. Last week was the worst for markets in a decade, and President Trump has become increasingly convinced that one man is to blame: Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. After the central bank raised its benchmark interest rate for the fifth consecutive quarter, Mr. Trump told aides that Mr. Powell would “turn me into Hoover,” referring to the president in the early years of the Great Depression. Mr. Trump’s advisers sought over the weekend to offer reassurances that the president wasn’t planning to fire Mr. Powell. The reaction: Wall Street added to its string of recent losses this morning. Go deeper: At the midpoint of his term, the president has become more sure of his own judgment and more isolated from anyone else’s. “I’m doing great, but it’s a war every day,” he has told aides. The partial government shutdown will continue until at least Thursday — and most likely into the new year — as negotiations have essentially stopped over President Trump’s demand for $5 billion for a border wall. Democrats see little reason to compromise given that they take control of the House on Jan. 3. At that point, Representative Nancy Pelosi, who is expected to be the new speaker, could use her majority to approve a measure to fund the government for a year without additional money for a wall. While about 800,000 federal employees are affected by the shutdown, about three-quarters of the government has been funded, considerably reducing the impact. Looking back: There have been at least 21 lapses in government funding in the past 40 years. Here’s how shutdowns have evolved over time. A search for survivors is underway after an enormous wave struck the country’s two most-populous islands over the weekend, killing hundreds of people, injuring more than 1,450 and destroying hundreds of buildings. It was the second deadly tsunami in Indonesia this year, a time during which the country has also faced earthquakes, floods and an airline crash. Officials suspect the tsunami was caused by volcanic activity on a nearby island. There was no seismic activity in the area, which means there was no warning that could have prompted an evacuation alert and saved lives. Explainer: Tsunamis are created when large amounts of water are quickly displaced. One of our science reporters discussed their mechanics. A Times examination of mass shootings since the Virginia Tech attack in 2007 shows how credit cards have become a crucial part of the planning of these massacres. Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla., in 2016, charged more than $26,000 in the weeks before the shooting, buying guns, magazines and thousands of rounds of ammunition. None of the banks, credit-card network operators or payment processors involved alerted law enforcement officials about any of the purchases, though the gunman himself worried they would seem suspicious. Banks and credit-card networks say it isn’t their responsibility to track gun purchases in such a way as to allow them to report suspicious patterns. How we know: The Times reviewed hundreds of documents including police reports, bank records and investigator notes from a decade of mass shootings. Around the country, nativity scenes are being robbed of their focal figure (and sometimes of Mary, too). The motives aren’t clear. Could it be an erosion of faith? Or mere teenage pranks? In any case, rattled communities are responding with measures as varied as glue and Jesus cams, as well as a sprinkling of forgiveness. Early elections in Israel. The country will dissolve Parliament and hold elections in early April. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces possible graft charges and his coalition has been weakened by a defection. Tent city closing: All 2,500 migrant children being housed at a facility in Tornillo, Tex., are expected to be released to a parent or sponsor in the U.S. by Jan. 15, an official with the shelter operator said. London airport confusion: A couple detained in connection with the illegal use of drones last week at Gatwick Airport were released without charges. The police also said they had recovered a “damaged” drone near the airport, where more than 1,000 flights were disrupted. Women’s March dispute: Accusations of anti-Semitism have overshadowed the movement as it prepares for its third set of rallies next month. Journalism scandal: The German newsmagazine Der Spiegel said it would press charges against a former reporter accused of faking interviews and articles, some of the most notable of which were from the U.S. Snapshot: Above, a Christmas parade in Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital, on Sunday. Hollywood rebound: “Aquaman” earned $67.4 million at the domestic box office, capping a year in which ticket sales increased 6 percent from a dismal 2017.

If you love Christmas carols, thank Oberndorf bei Salzburg, a tiny riverside town in Austria. That’s because “Silent Night, Holy Night” had its first performance there 200 years ago tonight. The local priest wrote the words. The organist provided the melody. But the town’s organ was in such poor condition that they first sang it with a guitar. The carol spread by word of mouth, reaching the U.S. via some Tirolean folk singers in 1839. The original chapel is long gone, but a new one marks the spot, said Hermann Schneider, a retired baker who now gives tours. Polish tourists celebrate Masses, he said, bringing their own priests. American brass bands sometimes appear. This month, a Sri Lankan group told him Buddhists sang the carol back in their home. Why does “Silent Night” have such wide appeal? “Because the melody’s so simple,” Mr. Schneider said. “You sing it once to someone, they’ll know it.” That’s it for this briefing.

2018,Stocks Bounce Back From Edge of Bear Market,"Throughout Wall Street’s December meltdown, analysts have been saying that markets were plunging despite plenty of evidence that the United States economy remains strong and corporate profit growth is healthy. That argument finally found listeners on Wednesday, when early reports of a strong holiday-shopping season helped lift the S&P 500 by nearly 5 percent, its best day since 2009. The Nasdaq added 5.8 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose just under 5 percent. That jump, over 1,086 points, represented the Dow’s best single-session gain ever, although a number of days have eclipsed that in percentage terms. A substantial rise in crude oil prices added to the lighter mood, as did efforts from the White House to ease up on criticism of the Federal Reserve. The rally continued in Asia, led by Japan, where stocks on Thursday opened 3.7 percent higher. The rebound in the United States offered investors a much-needed reprieve from a decline that had picked up speed in December. Stocks had fallen for four consecutive days through Monday, and the drop had pushed the S&P 500 to within just a few points of a bear market — defined as a 20 percent retreat from its high. Still, the S&P 500 is on pace for its worst annual performance since the financial crisis a decade ago and is only back to where it stood on Dec. 20. Plus, the move in prices Wednesday was most likely heightened by lighter-than-average trading volume during a holiday week. But to some traders, the move upward finally made sense. “Fundamentally you’ve got good growth here in the States, you have reasonable growth overseas, you’re going to have record earnings in 2019 and possibly in 2020 as well, you’ve got low inflation,” said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Before Wednesday’s steep rise, the market had fallen too far, Mr. Wren said, and it was ready to climb thanks to the underlying strength of the American economy. The rally was broad-based. Only one stock in the S&P 500, Newmont Mining, fell. Data from Mastercard showed that sales in the United States this holiday season grew at their fastest pace in six years, and investors flocked to the retail sector. Stock in the department store Kohl’s jumped over 10 percent, and shares of Amazon, which called its season “record-breaking” without offering financial details, rose more than 9 percent. Oil prices, too, were on the move after Russia’s energy minister, Alexander Novak, told a Russian newspaper that the country would benefit from continuing to cooperate with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on regulating production. American crude, the benchmark for oil prices, rose almost 9 percent to over $46 a barrel, and shares of large energy producers also climbed. After leading Wall Street’s recent slide, technology stocks rebounded as well. Tech investors have had plenty of causes for concern. A slowing global economy could hurt sales, tensions are rising with China on manufacturing of devices, and privacy concerns are bringing the potential for regulation. Apple shares rose 7 percent, while stock in the semiconductor maker Advanced Micro Devices gained 7.5 percent and Facebook added more than 8 percent. Bank stocks, which have taken the brunt of recent selling as worries grew that the United States economy was weakening, rose significantly. The rally doesn’t mean that this year’s precipitous decline in stock prices is over. Signs of economic health that encouraged the buying are doing little to address one of stock investors’ primary concerns. They’re worried that the Federal Reserve’s decision to continue raising interest rates, even if at a slightly slower pace, will hurt the economy and corporate profits. Higher interest rates on bonds or even savings accounts make stock investments less appealing as an alternative. The Fed announced an interest-rate increase last week and said it would continue to withdraw the support it had offered the economy in the wake of the financial crisis. “The Fed is making a monumental mistake,” said Barry Bannister, the head of institutional equity strategy at the broker Stifel. “They do not realize how long and by how much they’ve tightened already, and until they back off the market’s going to have a very weak floor under it.” Adding to volatility has been the possibility that President Trump would consider firing the central bank’s chairman, Jerome H. Powell, because he disagreed with Fed policy. Mr. Trump, who previously sought to hitch his political success to a rising stock market, has blamed interest-rate increases for the downturn on Wall Street. White House officials insisted again that the president had no plans to fire Mr. Powell, news that reassured investors. Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, told reporters Wednesday morning that Mr. Powell’s job was “100 percent” safe. He echoed remarks by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump’s incoming chief of staff, both of whom spent the weekend trying to persuade investors that the president did not plan to fire Mr. Powell. Those efforts had mostly backfired, in part because Mr. Trump continued to criticize his handpicked Fed chairman. It also helped matters on Wednesday that Mr. Trump refrained from offering new criticism of the Fed, a marked difference from the days leading up to the Christmas holiday, when he railed against the central bank on Twitter and vowed to keep the government shut down for an extended period. In fact, for the first trading session in many days, Mr. Trump posted just one tweet: It was about his trip to Iraq.",The New York Times
2018,Stocks Close in on Bear Market as Trump and Mnuchin Fuel Christmas Eve Drop,"Wall Street extended its losses on Monday as President Trump continued to lash out at the Federal Reserve, and an unusual weekend statement about the health of America’s financial system by Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, unnerved investors rather than calmed them. Stocks are experiencing their worst decline since the financial crisis a decade ago amid worries about, among other things, a slowing of corporate profits and the impact of a trade war on global growth. Mr. Trump has become increasingly focused on the idea that the Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, is to blame for the markets’ slide after the central bank raised interest rates last week and indicated that it might keep doing so next year given signs of strength in America’s economy. “The only problem our economy has is the Fed,” Mr. Trump said in a tweet during Monday’s trading session, a day after his aides scrambled to assure the public Mr. Trump would not try to fire Mr. Powell. [Read more about what Mr. Trump has said to aides about Mr. Powell.] Stocks, already falling before Mr. Trump’s tweet, dropped further right after even as investors were still trying to interpret Mr. Mnuchin’s late Sunday statement. The Treasury secretary said he had contacted the chief executives of six major banks to ensure that their operations were running smoothly, and that they had “ample liquidity available for lending.” Although the assurance came during a rough run for stocks in the United States, analysts and economists have not cited a lack of cash for lending as a significant reason for the downturn. Washington officials typically make such assurances only at times of financial crisis. Instead of soothing investors, Mr. Mnuchin’s comments, along with Mr. Trump’s attacks on the Fed, added to a nervousness already running high as the stock decline continued to accelerate. Asian markets on Tuesday followed Wall Street lower, led by Japan, which missed another market drop on Monday because of a holiday. Japan’s closely watched Nikkei 225 stock index fell 5 percent on Tuesday and entered bear market territory, meaning it has fallen 20 percent from its high. Shares in China fell by a much smaller amount in thin trading around the region, thanks to holiday-related market closures around the world. In the United States, investors were also watching the partial shutdown of the federal government amid an impasse between Mr. Trump and lawmakers over his goal of securing financing for a wall on the border with Mexico. “With everything that’s going on with the administration and all those data points in conjunction with a market that’s already so negative, it’s just pushing everything down,” said Michael Gibbs, director of portfolio and technical strategy at the brokerage firm Raymond James in Memphis. The idea that the Treasury secretary was calling banks to ensure the financial system was functioning properly, Mr. Gibbs said, “just added to the negative feeling and gave investors another excuse to sell. Stock trading ended earlier than usual on Monday, at 1 p.m., and markets were set to be closed Tuesday for the Christmas holiday. On Friday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq entered bear-market territory. It is now down almost 25 percent from its August high after falling 2.2 percent more on Monday. After declining 2.7 percent Monday, the S&P 500 is now down 19.7 percent from its September high; the Dow Jones industrial average is about 18.8 percent off its peak. Energy stocks were among the day’s worst performers, with crude oil futures in the United States falling below $45 a barrel. The meltdown in the markets could hurt the broader economy if it begins to limit spending by companies and consumers or lending by banks. Borrowing in the corporate bond markets has already slowed as nervous investors demand higher interest rates on risky debt. The plunge in stocks could discourage investments, acquisitions or other types of corporate spending by executives unwilling to gamble on uncertainty. But there has been no evidence so far that the financial system is not functioning properly, corporate profits continue to grow at a rapid clip and the economy has remained robust. [Read more about how investors have nowhere to turn as stocks, bonds, and commodities tumble.] Some investors argued that the stock slump in the United States is still mild compared with previous drops. “While stocks, in my opinion, have gone in the past couple of months from very richly valued to merely the high end of fair value, they’re not cheap by any measure — much less insanely cheap like they were a decade ago,” Whitney Tilson, founder of the investment fund Kase Capital Management, said in a note to investors. Markets ended lower in Europe following a mixed day in Asia.",The New York Times
2018,Stocks Fall Back Into Negative Territory for 2018 as Economic Uncertainty Grips Investors,"Stocks on Wall Street dropped again Friday, pushing the S&P 500 into negative territory for the year, as investors continued to fixate on how much the economy and corporate profits could slow next year. Until recently, the American stock market had been something of a standout performer among global markets. The S&P 500 was up 9.6 percent for the year well into September. But over the last few months those gains have disappeared as investors began to assess the potential fallout from a trade war between the United States and China and, rising interest rates. “Essentially there is a scare in the market about the future growth prospects of the global economy,” said Hari Srinivasan, senior research analyst at Neuberger Berman, an asset management firm. On Friday, the S&P 500 fell 2.3 percent as those concerns overshadowed a report that showed the United States economy added another 155,000 jobs in November. Though the number of new jobs was lower than analysts had expected, there was plenty of evidence that the economy remains strong: November was the 98th consecutive month of job creation, employers increased payrolls, and monthly job gains are still averaging above 200,000 this year. While the market initially rose slightly, those gains evaporated as the issue of a trade war resurfaced later Friday morning. Peter Navarro, the director of the White House trade office, said on CNN that the United States would increase tariffs on Chinese imports if the two countries could not reach an agreement on trade by the end of a 90-day negotiating period. President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China had agreed on Saturday to the standstill on new tariffs, but confusion about the nature of the agreement has only added to recent volatility in the stock markets based on widespread expectation that the American economy will likely slow next year. Stocks started the week higher after news of the truce. But after Mr. Trump took to Twitter to threaten China with further tariffs, and then news broke of the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, a top Chinese technology executive, at the behest of the authorities in the United States, markets went into a tailspin. For the week, the S&P 500 is down more than 4 percent. On Friday, Canadian prosecutors said Ms. Meng, the chief financial officer of Huawei and a daughter of the company’s founder, was charged with fraud. They said Ms. Meng may have personally participated in a scheme to trick American financial institutions into making transactions that violated United States sanctions against Iran. The arrest could mark a risky new phase for many big technology firms, which depend on networks of factories and subcontractors in Asia and have bet on strong demand from Chinese consumers to fuel future growth. Shares of these companies fared particularly poorly on Friday. Companies that make networking equipment and cellphones in China were also sharply lower. The semiconductor maker Advanced Micro Devices fell more than 8 percent, while Apple was down more than 3 percent. Microsoft and Amazon both fell more than 4 percent. And the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell more than 3 percent. Industrial stocks also saw significant losses Friday, with the S&P 500 industrial sector dropping 2.6 percent. Large exporters Boeing and Caterpillar, which ship large amounts of goods to China, fell 2.6 percent and 3.8 percent, respectively. “It is a slowdown and it is making investors nervous, and it could possibly slow down further,” said Stephen Gallagher, director of research at Société Générale in New York. “And the risks are pointed to the downside with the trade tensions just continuing to build.” One bright spot for the stock market early Friday was the shares of energy companies. They rose in early trading, along with crude oil prices, after members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed on a production cut at their meeting in Vienna. But softer market sentiment soon touched the oil markets, where crude prices moderated their gains. After gaining more than 5 percent earlier in the day, Brent crude oil rose 2 percent, to $61.57 a barrel. West Texas crude, the American benchmark, rose 1.9 percent, to $52.48. The S&P 500 energy sector declined by 0.6 percent.",The New York Times
2018,Stocks Rise After U.S. and China Agree to Halt Escalation of Trade War,"Stocks rose on Wall Street Monday after President Trump and President Xi Jinping agreed to a temporary truce in the trade war between the United States and China. The S&P 500-stock index climbed 1.1 percent, notching its fifth gain in the last six trading sessions. Major Asian and European equity markets also posted solid increases. Exporting giants like Boeing, Caterpillar and Deere pulled the export-reliant S&P 500 industrial sector higher. Semiconductor makers, which have been hurt by the trade war’s potential to disrupt their widespread production networks in Asia, also rose, as did tech giants such as Apple, which climbed more than 3 percent. Still, market gains were tempered by doubts that the fragile cease-fire — essentially a 90-day postponement of additional American tariffs on Chinese imports — would put the dispute between the world’s two largest economies to rest permanently. “Just because they have a truce for three months doesn’t mean this thing is going away,” said Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at the asset manager Fidelity Investments in Boston. Other markets responded in kind to the trade truce, which was reached Saturday in Buenos Aires. Soybeans rose on commodities markets on the prospect that China could begin to buy American crops again. China’s currency, the renminbi, strengthened against the United States dollar. The détente, forged by Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi over a dinner, merely postpones a larger reckoning over trade. Under the deal, the United States will postpone an increase in tariffs that was set to be imposed Jan. 1, and it sets a March 1 deadline for the countries to reach a more extensive pact. The deal leaves in place American tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese goods and the retaliatory measures enacted by Beijing. It is unclear whether the countries can resolve such thorny questions as the Chinese government’s support for sensitive industries and protections for American-created intellectual property. Still, the relatively good outcome of the meeting between Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump adds to the sense of relief for investors. A range of worries — about the Federal Reserve’s plans to continue raising interest rates, the impact of the midterm elections in the United States, the trade war and signs of slowing global growth — weighed on stocks in October and November. After it peaked on Sept. 20, the stock market’s gains for the year melted away as the S&P 500 slumped more than 10 percent through Nov. 23. In recent weeks, several developments had also helped allay those concerns. Last week, the Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, sparked a market rally when he said interest rates were “just below” a range of estimates for the neutral level, meaning the Fed was nearing the point where it would not be tapping on the brakes or pressing on the gas on the economy. His statements raised investor hopes that the Fed might not lift interest rates as high as previously thought. Meanwhile, the third-quarter earnings season has shown corporate profits remained strong. The midterm elections on Nov. 6 went largely as expected, with Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives and Republicans retaining control of the Senate. “What were the worry points? Earnings and sales, the election, China, interest rates,” said Richard Nackenson, a portfolio manager at the asset management firm Neuberger Berman. “Wow, guess what? It’s all been mitigated.” Mr. Nackenson stressed, however, that the market’s worries had not been resolved. Investors remain aware that the conflict between China and the United States is far from resolved, and stock market enthusiasm may be fleeting. “We see it obviously as a positive that there is a pause in the trade war talk,” said Richard Weiss, chief investment officer for multi-asset strategies at American Century Investments. “But it could reignite at any moment.”",The New York Times
2018,Stocks Rise as Wall St.’s Roller Coaster Stages Late-Day Rally,"Wall Street’s roller-coaster ride extended into Thursday with stocks staging a late-day recovery as investors turned their attention to fresh data about the United States economy. Investors have struggled to find their bearings this month as the S&P 500 hurtled toward bear-market territory, defined as a 20 percent drop from a recent high point. They are trying to assess the prospects for economic growth and corporate profits as interest rates rise and a trade war with China persists, while — most recently — also factoring in internal White House turmoil and President Trump’s antipathy toward Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman. A government shutdown that could deprive investors of economic data from the Commerce Department is only adding to the uncertainty. It’s all coming together in a volatile mix, with financial markets lurching this way and that. After a drop of as much as 2.8 percent, the S&P 500 rallied in the final minutes of trading to end up 0.9 percent. The gains added to a surge Wednesday that was the benchmark’s best day since 2009. The swings are an indication that the recent declines have gone too far, even if there are reasons to be concerned, said David Donabedian, the chief investment officer for CIBC Private Wealth Management in Atlanta. “In the absence of more bad news, a snapback was necessary,” he said. The exuberance was not shared in Asia, where monthly production data from Japan offered investors a reminder that the region’s growth is slowing. Stocks in Japan opened 0.8 percent lower, while shares in China and Hong Kong opened only modestly higher. In the United States, investors had only a few new clues about the economy’s health to consider on Thursday, and the signals were mixed. Weekly jobless claims were lower, a positive sign. Expectations for job growth, as measured by the monthly consumer confidence index, hit a five-month low, however. In China, officials said industrial profits had declined in November for the first time in three years, a reminder that the growth of the world’s second-largest economy continues to slow. Because of the partial shutdown of the federal government, a report on new home sales in the United States was delayed. Trading volume during holiday weeks is usually lower than the rest of the year, and that means each trade can have an outsize effect on stock prices. But huge swings were taking place well before the holiday slowdown. [It’s not just the stock market that’s flashing warnings. The bond market is too.] Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices who tracks and catalogs market performance, said stocks’ swings had been larger and more frequent this year than at any other time since 2011. On 15 days in 2018, the value of the S&P 500 changed more than 3 percent. Such a large change did not occur on a single day in 2017, and happened on only five days in 2016. In 2011, when ratings agencies downgraded United States government debt, roiling the stock market, the days on which the S&P lost or gained 3 percent numbered 24. “It’s higher today than it has been for the last several years, and you can feel it,” Mr. Silverblatt said of the market’s volatility. [Read more about investors’ biggest concerns, and about how technology stocks fell into a bear market last week.] Adding to the recent jitters are concerns about Mr. Trump’s response to the drop in stock prices. Last week, Mr. Trump used Twitter to vent his frustration over the Fed’s decision to keep raising interest rates and sought guidance from aides about whether he could fire Mr. Powell. Despite the president’s frustrations, a number of White House officials have tried to reassure investors that Mr. Powell’s job is safe. Traders have had their own concerns with Mr. Powell as well: At a news conference on Dec. 19 he used a word that is still ringing in market participants’ ears — “autopilot” — to describe the Fed’s likely approach to monetary tightening. This suggested to investors that the Fed might not be willing to change its plans to further raise rates and drain money from the financial system, even if market turmoil persisted. Other Fed officials quickly moved to assuage those worries after the Dec. 19 announcement, but Mr. Donabedian said he expected anxiety about the Fed’s flexibility to persist until at least the end of the next meeting of the Fed board on Jan. 30. Ultimately, he said, deep worries about the future, rather than more superficial factors like low trading volume, were behind the market tumult lately. “There are a lot of people searching for something else, some technical factor,” he said. “I really think this is driven by rising uncertainty about the fundamentals: earnings, the economy and interest rates.”",The New York Times
2018,Stocks Rise as Wall St.’s Terrible December Comes to a Close,"A turbulent year on Wall Street ended with a small gain for stocks on Monday. The trade war, and its potential to erode corporate profits and slow the economy, has ranked high among investors’ concerns this year, and any indication that tension was ratcheting higher or easing served as a catalyst for swings in stock indexes. The latest was a tweet on Saturday from President Trump in which he said “big progress” was being made in talks between the United States and China. Still, the overall gains on Monday were small, with the S&P 500 up 0.85 percent. Mr. Trump has in the past made positive statements about China only to reverse course and issue new threats soon after. For the year, the index dropped more than 6 percent. It isn’t just the trade war that has weighed markets down in 2018. Though the United States economy has remained relatively healthy, China, Japan and Germany have all shown signs of slowing lately. And investors are wary that rising interest rates could erode profits, in particular after companies borrowed heavily because the cost of debt was so low. Reporters at The New York Times have tracked the markets’ changing mood this year, writing about everything from early warnings on the economy to the spikes in turbulence in February and December, and the impact of rising interest rates on investments.

2018,Stocks Tumble After Fed Signals More Rate Rises in 2019,"It wasn’t what stock market bulls were hoping for. Stocks tumbled on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve, citing the strength of the economy, signaled that it planned to keep raising interest rates and shrinking the extraordinary amount of support it has provided to financial markets in the decade since the financial crisis. The S&P 500 stock index finished 1.5 percent lower, bringing its losses for the month so far to 9.2 percent. The benchmark had been higher ahead of the Fed’s 2 p.m. announcement about interest rates and a news conference that followed. The central bank raised its benchmark interest rate another quarter percentage point. That increase had been widely predicted. But in the financial markets, hopes had been high that the Fed would simultaneously signal its growing concern about the outlook for economic growth. Such an outlook is known as “dovish” in financial market jargon. And there had been broad consensus among stock market analysts that the Fed would announce a “dovish hike” — that is, an increase paired with language that indicated it would slow the pace of tightening substantially — on Wednesday. They were disappointed. “There was no give,” said Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist with the brokerage firm Canaccord Genuity in New York. “You were looking for a dovish hike. And it turned out to be just a hike.” The Fed did acknowledge growing expectations that the world economy could be slowing. Chairman Jerome H. Powell emphasized that the bank would tailor its policy in response to economic data. But generally, the central bank highlighted the ongoing strength of the American economy, a reason not to ease off interest rate increases too fast. Unemployment is near 50-year lows, growth in 2018 has been the fastest in years, and even as stock markets have sold off sharply, incoming numbers show little indication that the economy is turning sour. “The Fed message to the markets is, take a breath,” said Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York. “The Fed did its job today.” [Read more about the Fed’s decision and its outlook for the economy.] The market did not make a decisive move lower until Mr. Powell’s post-decision news conference. Close observers of the stock market noted that losses in the S&P 500 accelerated after Mr. Powell answered a reporter’s question about the whether Fed had discussed changing its efforts to shrink the large stockpile of safe government bonds it is holding on its balance sheet. “I think that the runoff of the balance sheet has been smooth and has served its purpose,” Mr. Powell said. “I don’t see us changing that.” In the years after the financial crisis, the Fed’s balance sheet ballooned as the central bank engaged in multiple rounds of so-called quantitative easing. The policy, in which the Fed effectively created new money and used it to purchase Treasury bonds in an effort to push longer-term interest rates lower, was also credited with helping to push a broad range of other asset prices — including stocks, corporate bonds and commodities — up sharply as well. Now, the Fed is shrinking its holdings of bonds on the balance sheet by around $50 billion a month, in a process that some call quantitative tightening. And those efforts have been getting more attention lately, since they were highlighted in a Wall Street Journal op-ed from a former Fed official, Kevin Warsh, and the financier Stanley Druckenmiller earlier this week. President Trump appeared to be referring to the balance sheet reduction when, in a Twitter message earlier this week, he urged the Fed to “Stop with the 50 B’s.” Increasingly, some see the phenomenon as playing a role in the unusually broad headwinds financial markets have faced this year. For the first time in decades, almost every broad asset class has declined or posted minuscule gains this year. And after the sell-off on Wednesday, the S&P 500 is now down 6.2 percent for the year. “If interest rates are going to be normalized higher, that means stock prices need to be normalized lower,” said Matt Maley, equity strategist with institutional brokerage firm Miller Tabak in Boston. “That’s what’s been going on.” Of course, this year’s losses have to be put in perspective. Since the market bottomed in March 2009, the S&P is up 270 percent. That rally is, by some measures, the longest bull market on record, though its survival is looking increasingly precarious. The drop of the stock market on Wednesday puts the S&P 500 down 14.5 percent from its recent peak — a drop of 20 percent would put stocks in a new bear market. “The plan for the Fed has been, as the economy heals and approaches something that looks more like a healthy state, they should gradually back away from their support of financial markets and kind of let them fend for themselves,” said Julia Coronado, a former Federal Reserve economist and president of the economic consulting firm MacroPolicy Perspectives. “They have to sort of stand on their own now.”",The New York Times
2018,Stocks Wobble as a Bumpy Week on Wall St. Comes to a Close,"A raucous week on Wall Street ended quietly on Friday, as stocks drifted between gains and losses before closing slightly lower. The S&P 500 index fell 0.12 percent, to 2485.74, and the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.33 percent, to 23,062.40. The Nasdaq composite fared better, rising slightly. The muted session contrasted sharply with trading during the rest of the holiday week, when stocks rose or fell sharply — sometimes doing both the same day. On Monday, in a shortened Christmas Eve session, shares experienced their steepest drop in several weeks as investors worried over President Trump’s attacks on the Federal Reserve. On Wednesday, the S&P 500 surged nearly 5 percent and posted its biggest one-day gain since March 2009. On Thursday, stocks fell almost 3 percent before rebounding and ending the day in positive territory. Although the S&P 500 ended the week higher than it began, investors may face more declines soon, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at the independent research firm CFRA. “You often don’t just have a straight ‘V” recovery,” he said. “You usually have a retest.” Lighter trading volume than usual — typical for a holiday week — was responsible for some of the seesawing, but volatility has become a hallmark of trading lately as financial markets slid off their highs. Since October began, the S&P 500 has gained or lost 2 percent or more 12 times. In the six months before that, there were only two moves of that size. Investors have been grappling with a slowing of global growth, corporate profits being squeezed by rising interest rates, a trade war with China and turmoil in the White House. A partial government shutdown that looks certain to continue into 2019, has complicated matters. Oil prices, which are close to their lowest levels in more than a year, rose 1.6 percent on Friday, with the American benchmark ending the day at $45.33 a barrel. European markets ended the day up across the board. The Euro Stoxx 50 blue-chip index gained 1.6 percent, the FTSE 100 in London rose about 2.3 percent and the CAC 40 in Paris was up around 1.7 percent. The Dax in Germany closed about 1.7 percent higher. Stocks in Japan fell after officials there released soft economic data for the month of November. In particular, investors focused on a drop in industrial output that economists blamed partly on weaker demand from China, a major buyer of Japanese machinery used in factories. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng rose 0.1 percent. The Shanghai composite index rose 0.4 percent. Stocks in Taiwan and South Korea rose as well.",The New York Times
2018,"Stocks, Migrants, Yemen: Your Wednesday Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning, Today is Boxing Day in Britain and some Commonwealth countries, but it’s back to work in the U.S. We’re watching the markets as they reopen, the death of a second migrant child at the southwestern border, and new details about Donald Trump’s draft deferment during the Vietnam War. Stocks opened higher at the start of trading on Wall Street this morning, after a Christmas break and, before that, a four-day sell-off that threatens to end the longest bull market on record. Losses of more than 20 percent are the official marker of a bear market, and the S&P 500 is down almost that much from its high on Sept. 20. President Trump’s repeated criticism of the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, and an attempt last weekend by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to reassure markets have contributed to the volatility. Trading in Asia was mostly flat today, and futures markets suggest a mixed day in the U.S. Explainer: “The real risk is not that insurmountable challenges knock the economy off course,” our senior economics correspondent writes. “It is that poor leadership converts moderate economic shocks into a crisis.” From Opinion: The columnist Paul Krugman asks whether White House policies “matter for the economy, or for the stock market (which isn’t at all the same thing).” On Tuesday, an 8-year-old boy from Guatemala became the second child to die in detention at the southwest border in less than three weeks. It is unclear if his death was the result of the care he received in the U.S., of an arduous journey or of some combination of the two. The response: A White House spokesman said the boy’s death was “very sad” and that the administration was seeking more information. Yesterday: President Trump reiterated his call for $5 billion to fund a border wall, a demand at the center of a partial government shutdown. No legislative action to address the shutdown is expected before Thursday. The details: Mr. Trump has said his wall is already under construction. We mapped the current fencing and what the administration has done so far. For decades, the U.S. has sold tens of billions of dollars in arms to Saudi Arabia on the unspoken premise that they would rarely be used. But American weapons and support have figured prominently in the Saudi-led air war in Yemen, where strikes have killed more than 4,600 civilians. That toll has contributed to a debate in Washington about the pitfalls of the U.S. alliance with Saudi Arabia under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Catch up: Saudi Arabia entered the war in 2015, allying with the United Arab Emirates and a group of Yemeni factions trying to oust Houthi rebels from northern Yemen. At least 60,000 Yemenis have died. Go deeper: The conflict has pushed millions to the brink of starvation. In October, Times journalists documented the crisis. In 1968, a podiatrist in Queens who rented an office from Donald Trump’s father, Fred Trump, diagnosed the future president with bone spurs in his heels, leading to his medical exemption from the military during the Vietnam War. The podiatrist, Dr. Larry Braunstein, died in 2007, but his daughters told The Times that he often talked of coming to the younger Mr. Trump’s aid as a favor to the father. Donald Trump, who had earlier been declared available for service, was 22 at the time. How we know: No paper evidence has been found to corroborate the version of events described by the Braunstein family, who also suggested there was some involvement by a second podiatrist, Dr. Manny Weinstein. The Times began looking into the president’s draft record again when an anonymous tipster suggested that a podiatrist who rented from Fred Trump had provided the medical documentation for a deferment. Background: An investigation by The Times in October showed the extent to which Fred Trump assisted his son over the years, including by giving him the equivalent today of at least $413 million. Intensive parenting has been the norm in the upper middle class since the 1990s. And people across class divides appear to have adopted it as an ideal, even if they don’t have the means to carry it out. Social scientists say the change has a powerful driver: economic anxiety. A still-vulnerable Indonesia: Despite progress in detecting tsunamis early, at least 429 people were killed and nearly 1,500 were injured in last weekend’s disaster. Japan defies whaling ban: The country said today that it would withdraw from an international agreement and resume commercial whaling. An international moratorium on whaling took effect in 1986. A message from the pope: During his Christmas Day address, Pope Francis said that all humans are part of an extended holy family that has lost its sense of fraternity. Protests in Sudan: Widespread demonstrations called for President Omar Hassan al-Bashir to step down. Mr. Bashir has been in power since a military coup in 1989. Kevin Spacey case advances: The actor will be charged with a felony after an accusation of sexual assault that was made public last year, the authorities said. Navy scraps an age-old penalty: A law that takes effect on Jan. 1 will, among other things, eliminate the punishment of “diminished rations” — bread and water — for American sailors. Snapshot: Above, the annual Hyde Park Christmas Day Swim in the icy waters of the Serpentine lake in London. It’s called the Peter Pan Cup because J.M. Barrie, who wrote “Peter Pan,” swam the 100-yard course in 1903. The artists we lost: We offer a tribute to notable actors, musicians, writers and dancers who died this year, using their own words. Late-night comedy: Our columnist looked back at a year in which the occasional nonpolitical joke felt like water in the desert. What we’re reading: This examination of the Internal Revenue Service by ProPublica and The Atlantic.

Potato chips first showed up in The Times 120 years ago today, in a rather ethnocentric article reprinted from The Baltimore Sun listing typical breakfast menus for upper-class families in Puerto Rico. If chips before lunch seem slightly unorthodox, a later mention was even more startling. In 1912, The Times reported that a French scientist had concluded that a jolt of electricity — 1,000 volts — was equal in food value to a porterhouse steak and potato chips. Just four months before, an article detailing the theory began with a quotation from the scientist that was shocking on any number of levels: “If a man is hungry, give him electricity. If he asks for bread or beefsteak, put him in the electric chair and turn on the current.” The 1,000-volt diet never caught on — given a choice between the electric chair and potato chips, the hungry invariably go for the chips.

2018,"Stormy Daniels Ordered to Pay Trump $293,000 in Legal Fees","A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels to pay President Trump about $293,000 in legal fees and sanctions after her defamation suit against him was dismissed. Mr. Trump’s lawyers had requested about $389,000 in legal fees, but the judge, S. James Otero of United States District Court in California, said the number of billable hours was “excessive” and cut the amount by 25 percent to about $292,000. Writing that Ms. Daniels “is already being deterred from filing meritless defamation claims,” Judge Otero ordered her to pay $1,000 in sanctions. In a statement, one of Mr. Trump’s lawyers, Charles J. Harder, said, “The court’s order, along with the court’s prior order dismissing Stormy Daniels’ defamation case against the president, together constitute a total victory for the president, and a total defeat for Stormy Daniels in this case.” On Tuesday afternoon, Ms. Daniels’s lawyer, Michael Avenatti, wrote on Twitter that Mr. Trump and his lawyer sought to “fool the public about the importance of the attorneys’ fees” — an effort he called “an absolute joke.” About two hours later, he added that “Stormy will never have to pay” Mr. Trump or his former personal lawyer Michael D. Cohen “a single dime in attorney’s fees, costs or sanctions.” But the tweet containing the second statement was later deleted. The judge’s order is intended to close out a defamation suit that had alleged that Mr. Trump defamed Ms. Daniels on Twitter last spring. The tweet in question was posted by the president on April 18, one day after Ms. Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, posted a sketch of a man who, she alleged, threatened her in 2011 as she was first considering speaking out about the affair she said she had with Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump called the sketch “a total con job,” depicting “a nonexistent man.” In an October decision, the court sided with Mr. Trump’s lawyers’ argument that the tweet included an opinion, which the president was free to express, and ordered Ms. Daniels to pay his legal fees. According to court documents released on Tuesday, Mr. Trump’s team claimed that five lawyers worked on the case, charging anywhere from $307.60 per hour to $841.64 per hour — rates that the court concluded were reasonable. As recently as last month, the case was a source of tension between Ms. Daniels and Mr. Avenatti, who rose to fame by positioning themselves as critics of Mr. Trump. In a statement provided to The Daily Beast, which was published Nov. 28, Ms. Daniels accused Mr. Avenatti of having filed the defamation suit against Mr. Trump against her wishes. Four days later, Ms. Daniels tweeted that she and Mr. Avenatti had sorted things out. Mr. Avenatti has filed two other lawsuits against the president and Mr. Cohen this year. One seeks to void a 2016 nondisclosure agreement that prevented Ms. Clifford from discussing what she said was an affair she had with Mr. Trump in 2006. The second claims that Ms. Clifford’s previous lawyer, Keith Davidson, conspired with Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump to keep Ms. Clifford quiet.",The New York Times
2018,Stout Defense Leads Huskies to Pac-12 Championship,"Washington 10, Utah 3 Byron Murphy returned a deflected interception 66 yards for the game’s only touchdown to lead No. 10 Washington to a 10-3 victory over No. 17 Utah in an offensively challenged Pac-12 championship game Friday night. In a matchup of the two stingiest defenses in the conference, neither offense could get much of anything going. So it was only fitting that a dropped pass by Utah (9-4) led to an interception for Washington (10-3) and the only touchdown. Both teams had been held to just one field goal when the Huskies broke through late in the third quarter. Jason Shelley’s pass hit Siaosi Mariner in the hands inside the Washington 35. But Mariner couldn’t hold onto the pass, and it ricocheted off his leg and into the hands of Murphy, who raced 66 yards for the score that made it 10-3. Jordan Miller intercepted another pass from Shelley on the following drive, and Murphy got his second interception of the game the next time Utah had the ball. The Huskies sealed the victory with a fourth-down stop in the final minute to earn a trip to the Rose Bowl. The Huskies had four drives of at least 10 plays but got only one field goal out of those. They were stopped on a fourth-and-6 from the Utah 23 on the opening drive, threw an interception in Utah territory on the third drive and had a field goal blocked in the fourth quarter. The one score came on Peyton Henry’s 29-yard field goal late in the first half. That was enough to give Washington a 3-0 lead at the break, but the Utes tied it with a score on the opening possession of the third quarter, when Matt Gay’s 53-yard field goal just cleared the cross bar. The Utes made it to the title game despite losing quarterback Tyler Huntley and running back Zack Moss to injuries in a four-day span in early November. Shelley and Armand Shyne stepped in and let the Utes to three straight wins and a spot in this game, but they weren’t good enough against the Huskies. Shelley’s three interceptions were his first turnovers as a starter. He threw for just 137 yards. Shyne ran for 37 yards on 11 carries. The Huskies came into the season with playoff hopes, but a season-opening loss to Auburn and then a pair of losses to Oregon and California in October ended that quest. But Washington still managed to win the conference and will go to the Rose Bowl for the first time since the 2000 season.",The New York Times
2018,"Strasbourg Shooting Suspect, Chérif Chekatt, Is Killed by French Police","PARIS — The French police on Thursday night confronted and fatally shot the man believed to be responsible for killing three people and wounding many more in Strasbourg this week, bringing a tense, two-day manhunt to an end and providing a moment of relief to a nation shaken first by violent protests and then the rampage at a Christmas market. The attack traumatized Strasbourg and reminded the country of its continued vulnerability to terrorist attacks. French officials said Thursday that they were worried that the police were overstretched after four weekends of handling nationwide protests by the Yellow Vest movement. “The security forces have been under tremendous strain these last few weeks,” said Benjamin Griveaux, the government’s spokesman. The hunt for the suspect, Chérif Chekatt, 29, consumed the work of more than 700 police officers and special investigators searching in and around Strasbourg. The chase ended on Thursday night, when three police officers opened fire on Mr. Chekatt, who shot at them as they pursued him in the residential Neudorf neighborhood of Strasbourg, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said at a news conference in the city. The police used surveillance and other information to track down Mr. Chekatt, he said. The officers “saw an individual walking on the public street, who corresponded to the description” of Mr. Chekatt, said Mr. Castaner, adding that the man “turned around firing at them, they returned fire and neutralized the assailant.” As he fled the market on Tuesday night, Mr. Chekatt managed to elude the police and soldiers, even though he was injured in at least one encounter with them. The attack prompted the authorities to place France on its highest level of alert, which allowed the government to heighten border security and search cars on the main highways leading to and from Strasbourg. Some officials feared that Mr. Chekatt might flee into Germany, given Strasbourg’s location on the French-German border. French officials also moved quickly to tighten security at other Christmas markets, dedicating additional police officers to guard them. Christmas markets are common throughout Europe, and often located in the confines of old city centers, making safety difficult to ensure. Earlier Thursday, the government signaled that it was worried about the ability of the police to handle protests scheduled for Saturday by the Yellow Vest movement in towns, cities and villages around the country, and that it would prefer the organizers called them off. The movement, which is demanding lower taxes, is known for the yellow reflective vests that participants wear and that all French drivers are required to keep in their cars to signal when they are in distress. “The anger has been heard; we have responded to it,” Mr. Griveaux, the government spokesman, said on CNews television, alluding to President Emmanuel Macron’s announcement on Monday that the government would put additional money in the pockets of minimum wage workers, starting in January, and reduce taxes on overtime pay and retirees. “What we are asking you is to be reasonable on Saturday, and to not go protest,” he said, directing his remarks to the protesters. It was unclear if any of the protesters would stay home since, within hours of the government request, some of the higher-profile figures in the Yellow Vests had called on supporters to come out again on Saturday. French security officials had determined that Mr. Chekatt, whom witnesses described as saying “Allahu akbar,” or “God is Great,” in the course of the Christmas market attack, had terrorist motivations. It was unclear how and when exactly he adopted extremist beliefs, but the French authorities said they first detected them during his time in prison. He had a long criminal record, with 27 convictions, mostly for robberies and assaults, in France, Germany and Switzerland. Mr. Chekatt was one of about 20,000 people flagged by the French security services for possible radicalization, and was also flagged with what is known in France as a Fiche S, or an S file, indicating that he was a potential security risk. Such people are tracked by the authorities, but it is not possible to keep all of them under constant surveillance. The Islamic State claimed on its official news agency site, Amaq, that the attacker was “a soldier of the Islamic State,” but used language that suggested that the attack was probably inspired by the group’s ideology rather than directed by the group. Among the victims on Tuesday night was a Frenchman who had been out to dinner with his wife in Strasbourg’s cobblestone-paved historic center, according to news reports and television interviews with a waiter at the restaurant where they had been eating. A Thai tourist was also killed, and his wife was wounded, according to the Foreign Ministry of Thailand, and an Afghan, Kamal Naghchband, 44, who had emigrated to France with his wife and three children to escape the Taliban, died on Thursday after being in a coma for two days. A fourth person was still living, but was described by health officials as brain-dead on Thursday. Mr. Naghchband was with his wife, his children and his mother on Tuesday night when he was shot in the head, said Eyup Sahin, the president of the mosque that Mr. Naghchband attended. A mechanic by trade, Mr. Naghchband had rented space on the mosque’s property for the past three years to operate a garage, Mr. Sahin said. “He was always dynamic, always helpful and willing to fix the mosque’s vehicles as fast as he and his employees could,” he added. Mr. Sahin said that in France, many tended to forget that Muslims could also be victims of terrorism. “Terrorism has pervaded the whole humanity, not religions,” he said. “A terrorist has no religion or humanity in them.” For those in the city not touched directly by the attacks, life was gradually returning to normal. Although the Christmas market was closed, some of the cafes and bars in the center city had already reopened even as homemade shrines were still burning commemorative candles and flowers were being laid in the victims’ memory. The mayor of Strasbourg, Roland Ries, said the end of the manhunt would allow the city to put its “sadness and mourning” behind it and “go back to Strasbourg’s normal life.” On Friday, officials said, the Christmas market will reopen.",The New York Times
2018,Strasbourg Suspect Was on a Watch List: What Are the ‘S Files’?,"PARIS — A deadly attack this week at the Strasbourg Christmas market in France by a suspect who was on a watch list as a possible security risk has drawn scrutiny once again to how the authorities handle suspects who have been flagged as potential threats. The suspect, Chérif Chekatt, 29, was killed on Thursday night after a hunt by French security forces. Armed with a knife and a handgun, he killed four people, left another brain-dead and injured 11 others. The authorities described the Christmas market rampage on Tuesday as a terrorist attack. Mr. Chekatt had a long police record, and he had also been flagged by the French security services for possible radicalization, putting him in a database of people who are suspected of religious extremism. He was also in a separate database for people tagged with a Fiche S, or S File. The S File is a category in a much larger database of people who, for a variety of reasons, are of interest to the French authorities. (Other categories include “M,” for runaway minors, or “V,” for escaped prisoners.) The “S” stands for la Sûreté de l’État, or security of the state. The S Files are used to keep track of people who are thought to pose a potential security threat. That can include soccer hooligans, radical anarchists and people suspected of being jihadists. Being flagged does not mean that a person has been convicted of an offense or is even suspected of one. Mr. Chekatt had never been convicted of a terror-related crime, and several French officials have said that despite his religious extremism, there were no concrete signs that he had been preparing an attack. Born in Strasbourg, Mr. Chekatt had been known to the police starting at age 10 and had his first conviction at 13, according to the French authorities. He had a long police record, with 27 convictions — mostly in France but also in Switzerland and Germany — for crimes including armed robbery. There are about 25,000 on the watch list, according to Interior Ministry figures published last year; and roughly 10,000 of those are suspected of religious radicalization. But having an S File does not automatically put someone under surveillance around the clock, and not everyone in the database is monitored in the same way. In some cases, people who carried out deadly attacks in France had been flagged but were not being monitored at the time of the attack. The S File designation is seen an intelligence-gathering tool but is not the basis for an arrest. For instance, French border police checking the identification of someone flagged with an S File might be under instructions to gather as much information about the person, and then report to government authorities. In one example, Khamzat Azimov, 20, a French citizen born in Chechnya who stabbed five passers-by in May near the Paris Opera, killing one, was flagged in 2016 because of his contacts with people who wanted to go to Syria to join the Islamic State, according to French news reports. Mr. Chekatt did not appear to attempt to go to Syria, according to Laurent Nuñez, France’s junior interior minister. Instead, the authorities noticed Mr. Chekatt’s radicalization in prison, and he was monitored by French intelligence services after his release in late 2015, Mr. Nuñez said. The Islamic State claimed on its official news agency site, Amaq, that Mr. Chekatt had been “a soldier of the Islamic State,” but used language that suggested the attack was probably inspired by the group’s ideology rather than directed by the group. France has been the target of several devastating attacks linked to extremists, and each one has brought calls from opposition politicians on the right and far-right for a crackdown, for the detention or even for the expulsion of everyone on the watch list. Hours after the attack in Strasbourg Laurent Wauquiez of the right-wing Républicains party tweeted, “How many attacks carried out by those flagged with S Files must we endure before we adapt our laws to the fight against terrorism?” But people can be placed on the list for even the slightest indications of jihadist affinity, or merely because they are friends or relatives of someone else under watch. Seven people have been arrested in connection with the Strasbourg attack, including Mr. Chekatt’s parents and two of his brothers. Another brother, Sami Chekatt, 34, who is also on the watch list, has been detained in Algeria on a warrant after the assault, according to the newspaper Le Parisien. Some officials emphasize that while the S Files are a useful tool to help keep track of those in danger of turning to terrorism, rounding people up or kicking them out of the country would defeat the intelligence-gathering purpose of the files. “The S File can target individuals who aren’t very dangerous, and it is used only to watch their movements and trips around the country,” Mr. Nuñez said on French radio this week. “It isn’t a criterion of dangerousness.” Officials have also said that there are too many people on the list to follow closely at all times. After the attack near the Paris Opera in May, a government spokesman, Benjamin Griveaux, said that “zero risk doesn’t exist” and that “those who say pulling responses out of a hat will solve the problem are lying.”",The New York Times
2018,"Strasbourg, Brexit, the Arctic: Your Wednesday Briefing","Let us help you start your day. (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Thank you for all the feedback on our special Brexit section of the briefing over the last week. You may have noticed some other changes — we’ve been working on ways to make the briefing even better. Please let us know what you think. Now, on to the news: A no-confidence vote is planned for Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, there was a possible terrorist shooting in the French city of Strasbourg, and the Arctic is on track for its second-warmest year on record. Here’s the latest: Britain’s beleaguered prime minister faces a no-confidence vote today, after 48 lawmakers from her Conservative Party submitted letters of protest, posing a new and potentially lethal threat to her leadership. Under the party’s rules, Mrs. May needs to win 158 votes from among the 315 Conservative members of Parliament to stay as party leader and therefore prime minister. If she does so, then party members cannot mount another challenge to her leadership for a year, but if she loses the vote, then she withdraws and another leader will be chosen over the coming weeks. If you missed it yesterday: Mrs. May toured European capitals, seeking concessions to try to salvage her agreement on Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union a day after postponing a parliamentary vote on it. But European leaders expressed resistance to further negotiations. “There is no room whatsoever for renegotiation,” said Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission. A telling scene: Some saw a metaphor when Mrs. May was briefly stuck in her car in Germany. The Daily: On the podcast, our correspondents in London discuss the Brexit fiasco. An armed man previously flagged as a threat by the French authorities opened fire in Strasbourg, France, at the country’s largest Christmas market, killing at least three people and wounding a dozen others before fleeing amid mass panic. A terrorism investigation was opened, the city center was closed off and residents were warned to stay home as a manhunt began. Broad challenges: European leaders gathering this week in Brussels for an end-of-the-year summit meeting will confront a new kind of business as usual: constant turmoil. It’s not just the concerns over terrorism or Brexit. Mass protests in France have dashed hopes for a handoff of pan-European leadership from Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany to the French president, Emmanuel Macron. Populism is still potent, and the E.U. also faces a fraying alliance with the U.S., a budget fight with Italy, Russian aggression, increasing authoritarianism in Hungary and Poland, and shaky or coalition-less parliaments across the bloc. Yellow Vests: A month of turmoil has left Mr. Macron’s economic agenda in doubt, and has so far cost the country’s economy an estimated $11.4 billion. Mr. Macron’s proposed relief package for the working and middle classes is estimated to cost about the same, but doubts have emerged about how much it would help. Members of the Yellow Vest movement called for more protests this weekend. The Arctic has been warmer over the last five years than at any time since records began in 1900, and the region is warming at twice the rate as the rest of the planet, according to a report by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. An official with the agency said that increasing air and ocean temperatures were “pushing the Arctic into uncharted territory.” Impact: The warming is shrinking sea ice and wreaking havoc on Arctic life and on weather around the world, the report found. For example, a bitter cold spell in Europe early this year is attributed to a jet stream slackened by warmer Arctic air. Other effects: By midcentury, cargo ships may be able to pass directly over the North Pole, even under moderate warming. The president, in an extraordinary public altercation at the White House on Tuesday, vowed to block full funding for the government if Democrats refused to finance his promised border wall. On Twitter, he said the military could work on building the “Great Wall” whether Congress funded it or not — which would not be legal. The testy back-and-forth in the Oval Office with the Democrats’ congressional leaders, Representative Nancy Pelosi, above left, and Senator Chuck Schumer, right, heightened concern that the two sides might not reach an agreement on spending bills to keep the government running by a Dec. 21 deadline. The issue: Mr. Trump wants $5 billion for the wall, but the administration has yet to spend much of the $1.3 billion Congress approved for border security last year. The confrontation: Ms. Pelosi, the prospective speaker of the House when Democrats take control in January, met the president in verbal combat. “Don’t characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting,” she told him. Here are five takeaways from the fracas, and video of the sparring. Chinese tensions with Washington... : A cyberattack on the Marriott hotel chain in September that collected personal details on roughly 500 million guests was part of a sweeping Chinese intelligence-gathering effort in the U.S., according to two people briefed on the preliminary results of an investigation into the hacking. The development could throw a wrench into U.S.-China trade talks. ... and with Canada: A former Canadian diplomat was detained in China, less than a week after Canada announced the arrest of a senior Chinese executive, Meng Wanzhou of the tech giant Huawei. Ms. Meng has been granted bail while awaiting extradition to the U.S. Seven-hour spacewalk: Two Russian astronauts took to the vacuum of space from the International Space Station to examine a small, mysterious hole that the Russian government says it believes was drilled into a Soyuz spacecraft in an act of sabotage. Though the hole poses no danger, wild speculation has run through the Russian news media blaming NASA at the same time that Russia is trying to persuade the U.S. to extend their space alliance. Google in the hot seat: The company’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, testified on Capitol Hill, fielding questions from U.S. lawmakers on topics like the company’s market power, whether it deliberately suppressed conservative content and its protection of privacy. Person of the year: Jamal Khashoggi, two Reuters journalists imprisoned in Myanmar, a journalist under attack in the Philippines and the staff of The Capital Gazette in Maryland, which was targeted in a mass shooting, were named Time magazine’s person of the year for 2018. Serenading North Korea: The provocative Slovenian rock group Laibach became the first Western band to perform in the totalitarian country back in 2015. Here’s what it was like to put on the show — which was mostly over-the-top covers from “The Sound of Music.” Carbonated politics: A sign on a busy street in Berlin that looked like a Coke ad with a message denouncing the far right wasn’t actually a Coke ad, but the company didn’t disavow it, and that spawned far-right anger at the soda brand.

A heated session of British Parliament turned to chaos on Monday night when a member of the House of Commons grabbed a five-foot, silver-gilt mace, as seen below, and tried to leave the chamber. The mace represents the crown’s authority, and Parliament can’t sit or pass laws without it. Traditionally, the person in charge of guarding the mace — and restoring order in rare mace-snatchings — is the sergeant-at-arms. The sergeant’s role, which dates to 1415, is to escort the speaker of the House before each sitting, carrying the mace during the procession, and to maintain order during the sitting. You can’t miss the sergeant — the traditional uniform sports a frilly lace collar and cuffs, silk stockings and black patent shoes. The sword also comes in handy. After Monday’s breach of protocol, the troublemaking lawmaker said: “They stopped me before I got out of the chamber and I wasn’t going to struggle with someone wearing a huge sword on their hip.” Alisha Haridasani Gupta wrote today’s Back Story.

2018,Strutting the Red Carpet and Worrying About Climate Change,"NO Regrets Parties were held for the film “Paris to Pittsburgh,” Marc Jacobs’s grunge collection and “If Beale Street Could Talk.” Michael R. Bloomberg stood on the red carpet Monday night, smiling his tight smile and rebuffing questions about whether he planned to run for president. His hearing also seemed to fail when asked if he would wed his longtime partner, Diana Taylor. “I didn’t hear that question,” he said, all three times it was asked. That was understandable. After all, he was at Lincoln Center to discuss “Paris to Pittsburgh,” a new documentary about climate change financed by his nonprofit foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies. “It’s critical people understand that something is changing in this world, not for the better,” Mr. Bloomberg said. “And unless we do something, it’s not going to turn out well.” A theme emerged when other well-heeled guests were asked how climate change affected them. “Well, I mean, I own some real estate on the water,” said Christie Brinkley, the former model, who listed her two Hamptons estates earlier this year for a combined $49.5 million. The actor Ed Norton began: “Well, I have a house in Malibu.” And Martha Stewart said: “I live on a farm in Bedford, New York, and we’ve had so much rain this year. I live on the top of a hill, and I’m living in a swamp.” Ms. Stewart also said the children of her former “Apprentice” boss, President Trump, would never be accepted back into New York society because of their father’s environmental policies. “I think they drank the Kool-Aid and I’m sorry about that, because Ivanka is an intelligent, beautiful young woman,” she said. “How can she allow her father to go and start drilling in Alaska? We don’t need oil — just drive a Tesla car.” But aren’t Teslas too expensive for most people to buy? “Of course they can,” she said. “It’s $39,000, cheaper than most cars.” (For the record, the base price for the lowest-end model is $45,000.) After a short walk across Central Park, it smelled like teen spirit at the Marc Jacobs store on Madison Avenue. The designer’s 1993 grunge collection for Perry Ellis was so poorly received that it got him fired. Now, 25 years later, he is revisiting the collection under his own label — everything from $45 rainbow socks to a $2,400 floral chiffon slip dress. Grunge glamour, Mr. Jacobs said, is something “you can achieve if you just let yourself go. Any kind of visual noise is perfect.” The Monday night event drew several scenesters — like the teenage models Presley and Kaia Gerber, and Gigi Hadid — who were not born when Generation X was slouching around in check flannel, checking their beepers. Waiters passed trays of hot dogs among guests including Sofia Coppola, Kim Gordon, Andreja Pejic and the drag personality Miss Fame. The model Karen Elson chatted with the fashion editor Grace Coddington, forming a double supernova of red hair. Sandra Bernhard, herself a ’90s icon, mentioned that the new play “Bernhardt/Hamlet” — about the French actress Sarah Bernhardt in a gender-nonconforming production of “Hamlet” set in 1899 — has been causing confusion. “A woman got there and said, ‘What the hell happened? I thought you were in ‘Hamlet.’’’ Ms. Bernhard said of a recent complaint from a dinner companion. “She left at intermission.” Nobody left during a screening of the riveting “If Beale Street Could Talk,” held Saturday night at the New York Institute of Technology. The new film, directed by Barry Jenkins (who won Oscars for best picture and adapted screenplay in 2017 for “Moonlight”), is based on James Baldwin’s 1974 novel about a young African-American man wrongly imprisoned by a racist system. “So much about the story is still relevant today,” Mr. Jenkins said. “It just shows how pervasive some of these problems have been.” The after-party was at P.J Clarke’s on West 63rd Street, where the film’s cast — Stephan James, Kiki Layne, Colman Domingo and Regina King — mingled with guests including John Cameron Mitchell, Kenneth Lonergan, Alex Gibney and James Schamus, the former chief executive of Focus Features. “I’m probably one of the few people that knew James Baldwin,” said Gay Talese, 86, over a gin martini with a lemon twist. He described a 1966 dinner at his Manhattan home attended by Baldwin and Tom Wicker, a celebrated columnist for The New York Times. “Baldwin got into an argument with Wicker about race, and Wicker’s wife, Neva, said, ‘Jimmy, you can’t talk to my husband that way.’ She was crying and he said, ‘I can talk to your husband as I wish,’” Mr. Talese said. “She ran from the table, into the living room, and grabbed the curtains,” he added, miming Neva burying her face to dry the tears. Did the curtains have to go out to be cleaned? Mr. Talese paused at the question but did not answer. Great men pay no mind to the drapes. An earlier version of this article misstated James Schamus's title at Focus Features. He is the former chief executive, not the current one.",The New York Times
2018,Student Targeted by ‘Troll Storm’ Hopes Settlement Will Send Message to White Supremacists,"An African-American student leader who was targeted by a racist “troll storm” says she hopes an unusual legal settlement with one of her harassers will send a strong message to white supremacists that they will be held responsible for online abuse. Taylor Dumpson had sued Evan James McCarty of Eugene, Ore., and two other defendants, including the publisher of the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer, after she was viciously harassed online. As part of the settlement, filed this past week, Mr. McCarty has agreed to apologize, renounce white supremacy, undergo counseling and help civil rights groups fight hate and bigotry. “People that decide to participate in this kind of activity, they should know that they’re going to be held accountable,” Ms. Dumpson said Friday. She added that the settlement gave her a sense of closure, and that she was proud that important educational and advocacy work would result from it. She called it a “unique opportunity” rooted in the principles of restorative justice, which focuses on rehabilitating offenders through reconciliation with victims. “I’m using what was a traumatic experience for me to help promote racial justice,” she said. Ms. Dumpson, now 22, was singled out after she became the first black woman to serve as American University’s student body president in May 2017. The same day, bananas hanging from nooses were found around the campus. After news outlets reported on the nooses, Andrew Anglin, who runs The Daily Stormer, posted Ms. Dumpson’s picture and personal information online and exhorted his followers to harass and bully her, a tactic he has also employed against Jewish and Muslim targets. One of the people who heeded his call was Mr. McCarty, also now 22, a student and actor who had been leading a secret life online, posting hateful messages and songs under the alias “Byron De La Vandal,” a reference to Byron De La Beckwith, the Ku Klux Klan member who assassinated the civil rights leader Medgar Evers. He was identified as Mr. McCarty by an anti-fascist group in April. The lawsuit stated that Ms. Dumpson constantly feared for her safety amid the relentless harassment, and was eventually diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Despite that turmoil, she graduated from American University and is now enrolled in law school. As part of the settlement, Mr. McCarty agreed to assist Ms. Dumpson in her legal efforts against his two co-defendants, Mr. Anglin and Brian Andrew Ade. Mr. McCarty must also apologize to Ms. Dumpson in writing and on video. She may use his video for “civil rights advocacy, outreach and educational activities,” the settlement states. He agreed to undergo anti-hate training and at least a year of counseling, complete four academic courses on race and gender issues and do 200 hours of community service related to racial justice. Ms. Dumpson’s legal team will monitor his compliance and can inflict monetary penalties if he does not comply. “What we are doing here is pulling back the veil on online racist trolls,” said Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which filed the lawsuit on Ms. Dumpson’s behalf. “For too long, they’ve been allowed to act with impunity,” she said. The Lawyers’ Committee is a nonprofit that was formed in 1963 at the request of President John F. Kennedy, who sought to involve private lawyers in civil rights cases. Ms. Clarke said she hopes the agreement will have “a chilling effect” on white supremacists, and called on the Justice Department to do more to prosecute members of hate groups. In a statement, Mr. McCarty’s parents, Deb and James McCarty, said they were “profoundly sorry” for the harm their son caused to Ms. Dumpson. They said their son “feels deep regret” about his actions and that he had “disengaged in the ideology of the alt-right.” “He is a different person than he was when he hid behind an alias and was persuaded into hateful activity on the internet, and recognizes its potential for harming others,” they said. James Ralph, executive director of the John G. Shedd Institute for the Arts in Eugene, said he was shocked by the revelation of Mr. McCarty’s online activities. Mr. McCarty had worked for the theater and performed in its productions of “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes” and “Mary Poppins,” among others. The organization severed ties after learning of Mr. McCarty’s online activities in April. Afterward, Mr. McCarty called Mr. Ralph to apologize for damaging the institution, but Mr. Ralph was unsure how much he could believe him. “The jury’s always out,” Mr. Ralph said. But he added that he has “both hope and confidence that the terms of the settlement will be effective.”",The New York Times
2018,Students Defiant as Chinese University Cracks Down on Young Communists,"BEIJING — Students at one of China’s most prestigious universities on Friday denounced the government’s efforts to crush a student-led campaign for workers’ rights that has embarrassed the ruling Communist Party. More than a dozen students from Peking University in Beijing, in a rare rebuke of authority, protested Friday on campus to draw attention to the university’s attempts to punish students for taking part in the campaign. The students are part of a small but tenacious group of young communists using leftist ideology to shine a light on labor abuses across China and to call for better protections for the working class. The students have put the government in an awkward position because they are invoking the teachings of Mao, Marx and Lenin, which President Xi Jinping has championed, to point to problems in Chinese society including inequality, corruption and greed. Peking University officials moved swiftly to contain Friday’s protest, holding the students in classrooms and keeping them through the night for questioning, activists said. They were released on Saturday morning. Videos posted online by students showed security guards shoving protesters and teachers grabbing students so they could not leave. In one video posted on Twitter, an activist with cuts on his fingers asserted that the police had injured him. “They are trying to stop us from spreading the truth,” he said. The stern reaction by the authorities reflects the party’s deep anxieties about the young communists and their unusual campaign. The party has long feared student-led protests, especially since the 1989 pro-democracy movement, which had deep student involvement and was crushed in a bloody crackdown around Tiananmen Square. Party leaders may be concerned that the 30th anniversary of the massacre, coming up in June, could inspire new protests. “They don’t want to take any chances about students organizing politically,” said Eli Friedman, a labor scholar at Cornell who in October suspended an exchange program with Renmin University in Beijing because of the recent crackdown. The protest on Friday came after Peking University officials tried to block a Marxist student group from organizing a celebration for Mao’s 125th birthday. On Wednesday, the president of the group, Qiu Zhanxuan, was taken in for questioning by security officials, students said, and he was later removed from his post. On Friday, students held signs demanding that the university reinstate Mr. Qiu and several other members. The university did not respond to requests for comment on Friday. The young communists began organizing in the summer, when dozens converged on the factories of southern China to stand with workers who were seeking to form a labor union without the Communist Party’s official backing. Throughout their campaign, the activists have steadfastly voiced support for Mr. Xi and the tenets of communism. In celebrating Mao’s birthday this week, for example, they sang socialist anthems and chanted slogans like “Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the working class!” While the students’ leftist critique of society has gained traction among a small number of students on university campuses, their numbers have dwindled in recent weeks as the government has intensified efforts to detain leaders of the campaign. More than two dozen activists have been detained, gone missing or placed under house arrest over the past few months. In November, a recent graduate of Peking University who took part in the campaign, Zhang Shengye, was beaten and dragged into a car on campus and driven away, according to witnesses. Since rising to power in 2012, Mr. Xi has sought to rein in dissent, especially on university campuses. Advocates said that the crackdown on the young communists showed that the government was becoming even less tolerant of criticism. “The message is clear,” said Patrick Poon, a researcher at Amnesty International in Hong Kong. “No one can avoid control, even the Marxists.”",The New York Times
2018,Study Shows Big Rise in Teen Vaping This Year,"Use of other drugs, including opioids, alcohol and tobacco cigarettes, was down and marijuana use was steady, the annual survey of American teenagers found. A steep rise in nicotine vaping over the past year, accompanied by widespread minimizing of its potential harm, dominated the findings of a closely watched annual survey of American teenagers, released Monday. The vaping increase was so precipitous, researchers said, that it was the largest annual jump in the use of any substance, including marijuana, they had seen in the project’s 44-year history. In all, the researchers found, the rise amounted to 1.3 million more high school vapers in 2018 than in 2017. “Vaping is reversing hard-fought declines in the number of adolescents who use nicotine,” said Richard Miech, the study’s lead author and a sociologist at the University of Michigan, in a statement. “These results suggest that vaping is leading youth into nicotine use and nicotine addiction, not away from it,” The study, called Monitoring the Future, which is sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and administered by University of Michigan researchers, asks nearly 45,000 students in eighth, 10th and 12th grade about their behavior and attitudes around alcohol and a variety of drugs. More than one in 10 eighth graders said they vaped nicotine in the past year, while 37.3 percent of 12th graders said they had done so, up from 27.8 percent in 2017. The percentage of seniors who said they had vaped within the past 30 days — an indication of more frequent use — just about doubled, rising to 21 percent in 2018 from 11 percent in 2017. Aside from vaping, the study had encouraging news about teenage use of most other drugs. Tobacco cigarettes continued to remain at historic lows, with only 3.6 percent of high school seniors reporting that they smoke daily, compared to 22 percent two decades ago. Marijuana levels remained stable, with 5.8 percent of seniors reporting daily use, a level that has stayed pretty much the same over the last 20 years. The study showed teenagers were beginning to move away from opioids and alcohol. But vaping, predominantly with nicotine but also marijuana, appeared throughout the report as a surging problem. Most e-cigarettes contain nicotine, and the most popular brand among teenagers, Juul, has particularly high levels of it. Nicotine is a highly addictive substance that can interrupt adolescent brain development. And researchers have begun to express concern about the possible long-term effect on the airways of the particles and chemicals in a vape’s aerosol. But 25.7 percent of seniors who vaped insisted they were inhaling “just flavoring,” suggesting that they may not know that many brands use flavored nicotine liquids and salts. More than two-thirds of sophomores said that both the devices and the liquids, which are ostensibly prohibited from being sold to minors, are either “fairly easy” or “very easy” to obtain. “If we want to prevent youth from using drugs, including nicotine, vaping will warrant special attention in terms of policy, education campaigns, and prevention programs in the coming years,” Dr. Miech said. This latest survey aligns with findings released last month by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which said that 3.6 million middle and high school students vaped in 2018. “Not only are teen users of popular vaping devices like Juul re-glamorizing a smoking-like behavior that years of prevention campaigns had effectively stigmatized, they might be paving the way for a transition to conventional cigarettes as well as other substances,” wrote Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, in a blog post.",The New York Times
2018,"Stung by Election Losses, Republicans in the States Seek a Way to Neutralize Democrats","MADISON, Wis. — When Democrats won the governor’s office in Wisconsin, it was one of the party’s most celebrated midterm successes in regaining power in the states. Now Republicans are striking back, moving to slash the power of the new governor even before he takes the oath of office. Democrats reacted with fury, crowding the halls of the State Capitol in Madison on Monday and accusing the Republicans of trying to undo an election they had lost. It was only the latest such Republican effort across the country to try to use legislative action to counter blows the party suffered at the polls. For Wisconsin, a state that both parties will urgently vie to win in 2020 elections, it was one more sign of the ferocious partisan split that has rippled through the state in recent years. “It’s a power grab,” said State Senator Jon Erpenbach, a Democrat, before a hearing on the package of bills that includes restrictions on the incoming governor’s ability to shift how public benefits programs are run, and on his authority to set the rules that determine how state laws are carried out. “They lost and they’re throwing a fit.” The long list of proposals Republicans want to consider also includes wide efforts to shore up their strength before Tony Evers, the Democrat who beat Gov. Scott Walker last month, takes office: new limits on early voting, a shift in the timing of the 2020 presidential primary in Wisconsin, and new authority for lawmakers on state litigation. The Republican plan would also slash the power of the incoming attorney general, who is also a Democrat. In recent years, single parties have come to dominate state legislatures, allowing lawmakers to make significant policy changes in states even as Washington wrestled with gridlock. But in states like Wisconsin and Michigan, where Democrats regained governor’s offices in capitals that Republicans fully controlled for years, Republicans are making last-minute efforts to weaken their powers. It is a model pioneered in North Carolina, where Republican lawmakers in 2016 tried to restrict the power of the governor after a Democrat was narrowly elected to the post. That set off a bitter court battle that continues to this day. In Michigan, Republican lawmakers are considering proposals that would give them more authority to intervene in legal fights involving the state and would shift oversight of campaign finance — efforts that Democrats say are aimed at shrinking the authority of their leaders, including Gretchen Whitmer, who won the governor’s race there, and Dana Nessel, a Democrat who won the race for attorney general. Some local areas are seeing glimpses of similar battles. In Arizona’s Maricopa County — with 4.3 million residents, the nation’s fourth most populous — the Republican-dominated board of supervisors said last month that it was studying a takeover of some Election Day logistics now handled by the county recorder, a newly elected Democrat. The supervisors have said they have a nonpartisan interest in improving the county’s elections. In Wisconsin on Monday, Democrats and liberal groups called the Republicans’ proposals for curbing Mr. Evers’s authority in advance of his swearing in next month a blatant power grab and a rejection of the election outcome. Some said they were considering legal action against any legislation the Republicans may try to push through this week. Republicans, who will retain their legislative majorities under the Democratic governor, have defended the hastily introduced package of bills as a necessary check on executive power. “Wisconsin law, written by the Legislature and signed into law by a governor, should not be erased by the potential political maneuvering of the executive branch,” said Robin Vos, the speaker of the State Assembly, and Scott Fitzgerald, the Republican leader in the State Senate, in a joint statement last week. But as hundreds of angry residents gathered at the Capitol, the Republican leaders spoke bluntly of the ideological clash between their caucus and the incoming governor. “I think that Governor-elect Evers is going to bring a liberal agenda to Wisconsin,” Mr. Fitzgerald said. “There’s going to be a divide between the legislative branch and the executive branch.” “We want to ensure that the new administration doesn’t try to work around the Legislature,” Mr. Vos said, explaining the package of bills that Republicans say they hope will be taken up by the full Legislature on Tuesday. “We want both branches to have an equal seat at the table.” Wisconsin’s capital city has regularly been the scene of political upheaval over the last decade. The 2010 election flipped Democratic control of the governor’s office and both legislative chambers, and Governor Walker built a national reputation by swiftly moving to limit public sector unions’ power, a push that sent thousands of union supporters and Democrats to Madison to protest for weeks and set off a series of recall elections against Republicans and Democrats. The state has long been purple; it voted for Barack Obama for president and also for Donald J. Trump. Wisconsin, which Democrats had carried in presidential races since 1988, played an unexpected role in helping to seal Mr. Trump’s victory. But a longstanding tone of congenial relations between Wisconsin Democrats and Republicans vanished after the Republicans took over eight years ago. Mr. Evers, who has been Wisconsin’s state schools superintendent, condemned the proposals and urged Wisconsin residents to speak up against them. He said Republicans were trying “to take us back to Nov. 6” and change the election results. “We’re not going backwards in time to revote this election,” Mr. Evers said. “I won.” Mr. Evers said he hoped to persuade the legislative chambers — both of which are controlled by Republicans — to vote down the bills. If that fails, Mr. Evers said, a “Plan B” could include litigation. From a hearing room where the legislation was being weighed on Monday afternoon, protesters outside could be heard chanting “Respect our vote” and “Shame.” Hundreds gathered in protest in the cold on the steps of the Capitol, a place where demonstrations by Democrats have been tense and frequent over the past eight years under Republican dominance. Among the package of measures being considered in Madison, Democrats were especially angered about one that would allow Republican leaders in the Legislature to hire their own lawyers to replace the Democratic attorney general on certain lawsuits, including on issues such as voter identification and legislative redistricting. Josh Kaul, the incoming attorney general, defeated Brad Schimel, the Republican incumbent, in November. “This bill is really the biggest aversion of the will of the people in this whole package,” said State Representative Chris Taylor, a Democrat. “It totally guts the power of the attorney general.” “It is an embarrassment,” Mr. Evers said. “Wisconsin has been known for several years now as a state that can’t get along.”",The New York Times

2018,Sudanese Police Try to Break Up Swelling Protests Against Bashir,"CAIRO — The police used tear gas and fired in the air Tuesday to disperse thousands of protesters trying to march on the presidential palace to demand that Omar Hassan al-Bashir, Sudan’s president of 29 years, step down, according to activists and video clips posted online. The clips purported to show crowds of several hundred each gathering on side roads and headed toward the palace on the bank of the Blue Nile. They sang patriotic songs and chanted “freedom,” “peaceful, peaceful against the thieves” and “the people want to bring down the regime.” One clip showed the lifeless body of a protester in Khartoum being carried away and placed inside a car that drove away. The protester’s head showed a gaping wound, and the voice of another protester could be heard saying he was deliberately shot by a sniper. Earlier images circulated by activists showed police snipers on rooftops near the palace ahead of the march. Another clip purported to show two other protesters suffering gunshot wounds to the head and the legs as they were being attended to in a clinic. There were no reliable casualty figures available. Large numbers of security forces were deployed across much of Khartoum Tuesday in anticipation of the march, with soldiers riding in all-terrain vehicles. The police fired in the air, used tear gas and hit demonstrators with batons to disperse them, only for the crowds to assemble again and try to continue their march. Activists said the battles continued after nightfall. The protest was called by an umbrella of independent professional unions and supported by the country’s largest political parties, Umma and Democratic Unionist. The organizers want to submit a petition demanding that Mr. Bashir, in power since a military coup in 1989, step down. Tuesday’s march follows nearly a week of protests initially sparked by rising prices and shortages of food and fuel, but which later escalated into calls for Mr. Bashir to go. He was in the Al Jazeera region, south of Khartoum, on a previously scheduled visit on Tuesday. Live TV coverage showed him addressing supporters there in a rally, and the country’s state news agency said he inaugurated a road and a girls’ school there. In an address in which he frequently quoted verses from the Quran, Mr. Bashir blamed the country’s economic woes on international sanctions and enemies of Sudan who don’t want it to progress. The march followed a joint statement late Monday by the United States, Britain, Norway and Canada, which said they were concerned by “credible reports” that Sudan’s security forces have used live ammunition against demonstrators. The London-based rights group Amnesty International said it had credible reports that the Sudanese police had killed 37 protesters in clashes during the anti-government demonstrations.",The New York Times
2018,"Sudanese Protests, After Days of Violence, Turn Anger Over Bread Toward Bashir","This was meant to be a new era for Sudan. Last year the United States ended two decades of sanctions that President Omar Hassan al-Bashir had long blamed for his country’s poverty and isolation, a move that promised new investment, perhaps even an economic rebirth. But when Mr. Bashir then ended fuel and wheat subsidies, at the suggestion of international lending partners, protests broke out. And over the past week, festering public anger compounded by nearly 30 years of frustration over corruption and economic mismanagement has grown into demonstrations so big and widespread that some say they could topple Mr. Bashir’s military government, or at least seriously challenge its legitimacy. Sudan, a predominantly Arab country on the edge of sub-Saharan Africa, entered its sixth day of protests on Monday, with more planned later this week, including a mass procession to the presidential palace, an elaborate Chinese-built complex opened only three years ago. The Sudanese Professional Association, the organization planning Tuesday’s rally, said in a statement that it would submit a memorandum to the Parliament to “demand the regime to give up the political and executive power to the Sudanese people who flooded the cities with their sole demand to end the regime’s 30 years of dictatorship.” Monday’s demonstration, organized by doctors, followed days of violence during which security forces fired tear gas and at least nine people were killed, according to Amnesty International. Local journalists put the death toll much higher, saying up to 28 had perished in clashes. The authorities have arrested 14 leaders of the National Consensus Forces, an opposition coalition, according to news reports citing its spokesman. The government has shut down internet service and social media sites, as well as universities and schools in the capital, in an apparent attempt to dissuade people from joining the protests. “The regime is panicking,” said Hafiz Ismail Mohamed, an activist with Justice Africa, a nongovernmental organization. “I have never seen them panicking like this.” Protests had begun spontaneously and without apparent leaders, he said, but now, people were organizing themselves into a movement. A government spokeswoman said she would comment on the protests, but subsequent calls went unanswered. Many Sudanese have described hundreds of people lining up just to buy bread, withdraw limited amounts of cash — their salaries — from bank machines or sleeping in their cars for two days waiting to fill up on gas. Inflation has been so rampant, reaching an annual rate of 70 percent in November, according to government data, that many ordinary Sudanese can no longer spend money on meat or fuul, a staple food made of cooked fava beans. Some people now spend 40 percent of their income just on bread, Mr. Mohamed said. Sudan has a long history of street uprisings, two of which brought down the government. Recently, the country saw protests over rising fuel and bread prices in 2013 and earlier this year, but they were largely contained in the capital and snuffed out by the security forces. This time, the protests started in the eastern city of Atbara, a former locus of anticolonial and union activity. The demonstration then quickly spread to half a dozen cities. “The Bashir regime has been facing a crisis of legitimacy,” said Zachariah Mampilly, a professor of political science at Vassar College and the author of “Africa Uprising: Popular Protest and Political Change.” Last year’s lifting of American sanctions came as the Trump administration said the Sudanese government had made progress on a number of issues, including counterterrorism. The State Department also said the government had stopped attacking civilians and had improved in allowing humanitarian aid to reach troubled regions like Darfur, where Mr. Bashir’s government stands accused of massacring hundreds of thousands of people in a genocide starting in 2003. Washington said the country was also curbing its destabilizing activities in neighboring South Sudan, which split off as an independent nation in 2011. Sudan is also playing a central role in the United States-backed war in Yemen. But the United States is still keeping Sudan on its list of terrorism sponsors, which means it will not be granted debt relief, a major drag on the economy. The International Monetary Fund sent a team to Khartoum in July, and Sudan has started a series of reforms and austerity measures in line with its recommendations, including the removal of subsidies, to try to bolster the economy as it struggles with high inflation and a shortage of hard currency. The monetary fund has not yet agreed to a loan — one could follow further down the line — but has committed to technical assistance. “They thought they could address the economic crisis but could not foresee the political reaction” that the effort would cause, Mr. Mampilly said. The measures by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank were designed to alleviate economic suffering, said Ahmed Soliman, an expert on the Horn of Africa at Chatham House, a London-based foreign affairs institute. “But in the short term they have been harmful,” he added. “The subsidies were meant to stimulate growth and companies to trade and that’s not happening.” In part, Sudan is still suffering from South Sudan’s decision to secede, taking with it nearly 75 percent of Sudanese oil reserves. Until the secession, oil revenues consisted of more than half of Sudan’s revenues, Mr. Soliman said, and about 90 percent of exports. But the larger problem, many Sudanese say, is that Mr. Bashir’s government, in power since a military coup in 1989, has not made any significant investments in infrastructure, agriculture or its people, though it has promised to build a museum recording the malign effects of American sanctions. Only 7 percent of the national budget goes to the health sector, for example, compared to 75 percent to defense, security and salaries and perks for senior officials, said Mr. Mohamed, of Justice Africa. The elite has stolen a lot of the wealth too, he added, an accusation government officials have denied in the past. “This regime has no ability to stop the protests by having economic reforms,” he said, “because the structure of the economy is so corrupt that they don’t have a clue how to run it.” “The regime has hit a wall,” he added, “and they don’t know what to do.”",The New York Times
2018,Suicide Among Veterans Is Rising. But Millions for Outreach Went Unspent by V.A.,"Suicide prevention efforts by the Department of Veterans Affairs fell off sharply in the last two years, even though reducing the high suicide rate among veterans is the agency’s top clinical priority, according to a new report. With the department’s top management in turmoil, the suicide prevention effort lacked leadership, planning meetings were repeatedly canceled, millions of dollars budgeted for outreach went unspent, and the television and radio ads that had been broadcast thousands of times across the country in previous years went all but silent. The striking breakdown in prevention efforts is detailed in a Government Accountability Office report released late Monday. The report says that bureaucratic confusion and vacancies in key posts are largely to blame. In a response released with the report, the V.A. concurred with the accountability office’s assessment and said it was already working on correcting the problems. The suicide rate among veterans is about twice that of the general population, and has been rising among younger veterans who served during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. “At a time when 20 veterans a day still die by suicide, V.A. should be doing everything in its power to inform the public about the resources available to veterans in crisis,” Representative Tim Walz, the Minnesota Democrat who requested the investigation, said in a statement. “Unfortunately, V.A. failed to do that.” Mr. Walz attributed the problems to “a deeply troubling level of incompetence” at the agency after a number of experienced senior staff members resigned over differences with President Trump’s political appointees. Among those who left was Dr. Caitlin Thompson, the director of the agency’s suicide prevention office. In an interview, she said she resigned in July 2017 because of repeated changes in how the office was overseen and because she felt mounting pressure to produce work that would be politically flashy but have little impact on veterans’ lives. After Dr. Thompson left, the accountability office’s report said, the suicide prevention office went nearly idle. It spent just $57,000 of its $6.2 million media budget, and its presence on social media, mostly paid posts, declined by 77 percent from the levels of 2015. Meetings were canceled and decisions were deferred because the acting director who replaced her was frequently absent, the report said. Since 2012, the office had been regularly airing public service announcements meant to promote gun safety and reduce the stigma around seeking help. But the report found that as of August, none had been broadcast for more than a year. Dr. Thompson, now with the Cohen Veterans Network, a nonprofit group, said she was dismayed at the falloff. “This is such an important issue, we need to be throwing everything we can at it,” she said. “It’s so ludicrous that money would be sitting on the table. Outreach is one of the first ways to engage with veterans and families about ways to get help. If we don’t have that, what do we have?” As the office’s outreach efforts dwindled, nationwide monitoring showed a steady increase in the suicide rate among veterans age 18 to 34, which is now about 45 deaths a year for every 100,000 people, more than three times the overall national average. The suicide prevention paralysis is one of a number of recent stumbles at an agency that has seen significant turnover of experienced staff and top leadership in the last 18 months. Mistakes in managing the G.I. Bill program led to late or incorrect housing allowance payments for more than 80,000 veterans enrolled in college. A sweeping $16 billion overhaul of the V.A.’s electronic health care records system has hit a number of obstacles, and the expert who was brought in over the summer to lead the project quit within a month. Curt Cashour, the department’s spokesman, said the responsibility for the problems in the suicide prevention program lay with Dr. David J. Shulkin, Mr. Trump’s first secretary of veterans affairs, who was fired in March. He said Dr. Shulkin’s successor, Robert L. Wilkie, had taken steps to address the issue. “Within weeks of his arrival at V.A., then-Acting Secretary Wilkie appointed Dr. Keita Franklin as V.A.’s new suicide prevention director, and she is reviewing the spending for this important program,” Mr. Cashour said in a statement. Dr. Franklin served as acting director during the time when many of the outreach efforts collapsed. Mr. Cashour did not respond to requests for an interview with Dr. Franklin or comment from her. When Dr. Shulkin was the department’s under secretary for health during the Obama administration, he pushed to make suicide prevention the V.A.’s top clinical priority and to increase spending on the effort. As secretary, he extended mental health benefits to thousands of previously ineligible veterans. “It was critical to me,” he said in a phone interview. “I’m not aware of anything else that is taking the lives of 20 people a day that is a result of service and, in my mind, is totally preventable.” But he said that the departure of many longtime employees in recent years had taken a toll. “There were a whole wave leaving in 2016 and 2017,” he said. “A lot left because of some of the turmoil and internal fighting. You can see it’s a real loss.” A photo caption with an earlier version of this article misstated the time period during which 1,892 veterans and service members died by suicide. It was from January to March of 2014, not the whole year.",The New York Times

2018,Suicide Bombing Kills Pakistani Insurgent Wanted for Attack on Chinese,"KANDAHAR, Afghanistan — After the Chinese Consulate in a major Pakistani city was attacked by a squad of suicide bombers last month, Pakistani officials pointed fingers at the commander of a separatist group waging an insurgency in the southwestern province of Baluchistan. On Tuesday, a suicide bomber killed that commander, Aslam Baluch, along with five associates in an upscale neighborhood of Kandahar, in southern Afghanistan. TAJIK. TURKMEN. AFGHANISTAN Kandahar PAKISTAN Bolan region Baluchistan IRAN INDIA Arabian Sea 200 MILES By The New York Times No group claimed responsibility for the latest Kandahar bombing. But it is widely believed to be an act of revenge for November’s consulate assault, highlighting the cross-border trading of insurgents and attacks by proxy that remains at the heart of relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan. To Afghan officials, Tuesday’s attack bore the hallmarks of an operation directed by Pakistan’s military intelligence service, the I.S.I. “The bomber was sent and guided by the I.S.I.,” Maj. Gen. Tadin Khan, the police chief of Kandahar, said on Thursday. Though not specifically named by the authorities, the Taliban, many of whose leaders are believed to live in Pakistan, have carried out suicide bombings in southern Afghanistan in the past. Afghan and Western officials have long accused the Pakistani military, particularly its intelligence service, the I.S.I., of providing covert aid and direction to the Taliban as a way to wield influence in Afghanistan. A spokesman for the Taliban, Zabihullah Mujahid, denied the group’s involvement, saying: “The incident in Kandahar and the killing of any Baluch has nothing to do with us.” In October, General Khan’s brother, Gen. Abdul Raziq, the powerful police chief of Kandahar, was killed by a teenage infiltrator who authorities said had trained in Pakistan. General Raziq was a staunch critic of Pakistan for harboring Taliban leaders. Pakistani officials, in turn, had accused General Raziq, who had a large network of informants and vast wealth, of stirring trouble in Baluchistan and assisting the Baluch separatists. Afghan officials confirmed that General Raziq had housed Baluch separatist leaders in Kandahar for years. The Baluchistan Liberation Army, of which Mr. Baluch was a major commander, has waged armed resistance against the Pakistani state for more than a decade, protesting discriminatory treatment and demanding autonomy for the province. The group has recently stepped up attacks against Pakistani military targets and Chinese targets. It sees China as an “oppressor” that is supporting the Pakistani government and plundering resources in Baluchistan. China is investing hundreds of millions of dollars to develop a port and an economic zone in the town of Gwadar in Baluchistan. The rebel group has established a brigade to carry out suicide attacks, named after a Baluch militant who carried out a failed attack on a Pakistani prime minister in the 1970s. In one of its first operations, last August, Aslam Baluch sent his own son to target a bus carrying Chinese engineers. Mr. Baluch arrived in Kandahar last week, according to some reports. He emerged from a meeting at a friend’s home in Aino Mina township on Tuesday, and as the participants walked to their cars, a suicide bomber approached and detonated his explosives. “The explosion was powerful and close to us,” said Nida Mohammad, a shopkeeper near the house in Aino Mena. “We thought that a rocket landed from somewhere.”",The New York Times
2018,"Suicide, Quarterbacks and the Hilinski Family","Tyler Hilinski, a quarterback at Washington State, killed himself in January and was posthumously diagnosed with C.T.E. His brother is a star recruit at the same position. It’s raw and complicated. Ryan Hilinski, a heavily recruited quarterback at Orange Lutheran High School in California, before a game in October. He sobbed after throwing his first touchdown pass this season, months after his brother’s unexpected death.CreditCreditSam Hodgson for The New York Times IRVINE, Calif. — Ryan Hilinski got the talk in March, two months after his older brother died. “You can walk away,” his parents, Mark and Kym, and eldest brother, Kelly, told him. Deep down, part of them would be relieved if he did. If he were younger, they would have forbidden him to play football altogether. But Ryan was almost 18 years old and one of the best high school quarterbacks in the country. ESPN would name him the top pro-style quarterback in the class of 2019. More than 30 colleges would offer him full scholarships, including blue bloods like Georgia, Ohio State and Louisiana State, and his childhood dream school, Stanford. He had worked too long and accomplished too much for them to take this away from him now. Only he could decide whether to keep pursuing the sport that may have led to his brother Tyler’s suicide, a death that stunned nearly everyone who knew him. One day Tyler was the likely starting quarterback for a team on the rise. The next, he was dead. Tyler Hilinski shot himself in a closet inside his Pullman, Wash., apartment on Jan. 16. He was 21. Four months earlier he had been carried off the field after leading the Washington State Cougars to an electric triple-overtime victory over Boise State. His parents last saw him alive a few weeks before his death, on a family vacation in Mexico. He seemed happy and healthy, which only haunts them further. Where were the warning signs that their middle son wanted to take his own life? “We have no clue what happened,” Mark said. “We will sit here for the next 20 years and not know what the heck happened to Tyler.” The biggest window into Tyler’s mind arrived posthumously, via a brain autopsy conducted by the Mayo Clinic. It revealed that he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a neurodegenerative disease brought on by repeated head trauma. After researchers at Boston University studied the brains of 202 former football players — many families had donated them because of concerns the athletes had C.T.E. — they announced in 2017 that 87 percent of them had tested positive for the disease. Tyler’s death places him at the intersection of two troubling demographics: football players with severe brain damage and suicides among young people. Suicide is the second-leading cause of death for Americans ages 10 to 34. Together, they constitute thousands of lives lost each year, leaving untold thousands more behind to cobble together a life while grieving. For Mark and Kym, dealing with the loss meant starting a foundation, Hilinski’s Hope, which works to reduce the stigma around mental illness. Kelly, who studies medicine, changed his specialty from cardiovascular medicine to neurology. And for Ryan, it meant playing football. Everything he does, he said, will now be for him and his brother. He switched his jersey number to No. 3, which Tyler wore. He tattooed an outline of the lighthouse where they spread Tyler’s ashes on the inside of his right wrist so the football could touch a memory of his brother on every snap. Before his death, Tyler was Ryan’s first call every time he received a scholarship offer. After, Ryan immediately tweeted the news, always referring to Tyler in the announcement. “It’s basically like me telling him first,” he said. He also needed to find a way to play that would allow his family to experience the sport in peace, if that is possible anymore. Maybe it would have to be 2,500 miles away in a place where the Hilinskis could get a fresh start — or something that felt remotely like it. At Orange Lutheran High School, a tall red banner of Ryan hangs on a fence outside the main entrance, part of a series showcasing football players. He sings bass in the honors choir and booms Motown songs in the hallways. Prospective students shadow him on campus, and he once sat in on a school board meeting. He celebrates Mass every weekend. He sometimes stops by Hoag Hospital in Irvine to visit sick children. “Everyone meets him and they’re like, ‘Oh, he’s like a senator already,’” said J.P. Presley, Orange Lutheran’s football coach. It is a carefully applied veneer, one that predated Tyler’s death but has taken on additional importance since. Ryan is discerning about whom he lets in. Behind closed doors, Kelly said, “everyone kind of knows him as this squirrelly, goofy kid,” one who lives to play Fortnite and scarf down McDonald’s and beg Kym to do his laundry. Out in the world, Ryan is the star quarterback, the school figurehead and, now, the most visible representative of an increasingly public-facing family. He believes he no longer has the luxury of acting his age. “After Tyler passed, it’s kind of been like, ‘O.K., now I’m an adult,’” Ryan said. “I’ve got to grow up kind of in a hurry.” The Hilinski boys were always together, always in lock step. Wherever Kelly, 24, went, Tyler, 18 months his junior, would follow. And whenever his older brothers competed in something, Ryan tried to outdo them both. Their parents took to calling them “The Brothers,” not as a statement of fact but as a proper name for an indivisible unit. Before long, they referred to themselves that way, too. So when Kelly quit baseball before his freshman year of high school to play quarterback full time, his brothers inevitably followed suit. Ryan was so young that he cannot recall the first time he put on a helmet, only that it was to help his brothers practice running over a defender. For years, he toiled in their shadows, watching as Kelly left home to play football at Columbia — he would eventually transfer to Weber State — and later when Tyler set off for the Pac-12. Ryan vowed to climb higher and did so by trying to grow into an amalgamation of his brothers’ best qualities. On the field, he has Kelly’s cannon arm and Tyler’s moxie. Away from it, when he is at his best, he blends Kelly’s charisma with what everyone once saw as Tyler’s even keel. “The perfect mix of all of us,” Kelly said. Ryan was the one who tended to Kym when they got the news of Tyler’s death, staying with her as she hyperventilated and ultimately calling an ambulance to take her to a hospital. When Presley, Ryan’s coach, arrived to check on them, he found Ryan in the waiting room, “standing there like a brave warrior while everyone around is emotional.” In the months since, he has learned to cook, taken on extra chores and begun to handle his own media requests. He grits his teeth and stays silent when people mock Tyler’s death on social media. He has dealt with worse in person, like the opposing player who insulted Tyler during a game, or the classmate who waved a flier advertising a suicide awareness event in Ryan’s face and told him, “You should have told your brother to go to this.” Each time, Ryan walked away. Afterward, he would call Kelly to rage about their cruelty and his helplessness. “He can’t defend his brother,” Kelly said. “I can’t stress how hard that is, how tough that is on an 18-year-old boy, to keep that all in.” Football helps him cope, at a cost. On the one hand, the game provides an essential distraction. “When I’m on the field, I forget,” he said. “I say, ‘O.K., I’m going to focus on a slant route rather than: ‘When did it happen? What time of night was it when Tyler passed?’” He added, “Or I’m going to throw a post this time instead of saying, ‘Damn, what could I have done?’” But he can only compartmentalize so much while playing the same position and while dedicating so much of himself to preserving his brother’s memory. Ryan admits he tried to bottle up his grief before the season because he did not want “to let it affect the team.” He and Kelly saw a therapist together in the spring but stopped going because “we didn’t like expressing it.” Ryan instead finds solace in the early mornings, when he’ll wake up at 5:30 and drive to Newport Beach to run by the ocean. Afterward, he retreats to his car and sits alone in the parking lot, talking to Tyler as he watches the waves lap onto shore. The rigors of this season sometimes overwhelmed him. He sobbed so hard after his first touchdown pass that Mark ran down from the stands to embrace him, holding Ryan tight so his son would not collapse. One month later, Orange Lutheran lost after missing what would have been a game-winning field goal. Ryan approached his parents on the sideline. “Tyler would have won that game,” he croaked, using an expletive, before breaking down again. Everything about football now is distressing for the Hilinski family, and most likely always will be. They worry that Ryan could lose sight of where Tyler’s football dreams end and his own begin. “It can’t just be for Tyler,” Kym said. She spent the spring fretting about Ryan’s college decision, wondering whether she would be able to set foot in the same stadiums Tyler played in if Ryan stayed on the West Coast. She and Mark worried even more about whether they could bear sending him more than a short drive away. Most of all, everyone worries whenever Ryan gets hit in a game, none more than when he was concussed in his final high school game. They wonder what those hits could mean now and what they could mean in the future. “If anyone says they’re not, then they’re lying,” Kelly said. “Because every time I hear a smack or see him go down at all, I hold my breath just a little bit. My heart skips.” Ryan said he thinks about C.T.E. in relation to other players more than himself, but he remains wary and knows the risk of a brain injury. “It's one of those things I don't really think about too much during the game,” he said. “I would know, because I got hit last year and everything was blurry and I was like 'Oh man.' I took myself out of the game and said 'Hey, you need to put somebody else in there.' There's definitely a line. If it goes too far, I've got to stop. I won't be some guy out there who doesn't know what sideline to go to.” When Ryan finally decided on a college, he made an unusual choice: He would play for the South Carolina Gamecocks, a middling Southeastern Conference team that had not signed a player out of California since 2015. He said “a big factor” in his decision was to give everyone the hope of a new beginning an entire coast away from heartbreak. Kelly is relocating from Utah and intends to enroll in South Carolina’s medical school. Mark and Kym bought a home in Lake Murray, about 30 minutes from campus. They will settle in sometime this spring. “It would be hard not to be together knowing that we weren’t in Pullman,” Mark said. “And maybe that could have made some kind of difference,” Kym added, completing his sentence. Ryan elected to graduate a semester early, so he will be in South Carolina in a matter of weeks. He adores the food — the fried chicken chain Bojangles’ is a particular favorite — and he is excited to join a new church. He is also looking forward to going home to a new place on the weekends, and doing his part to help the family build their new life. They are planning to adopt a dog and name it Sweet Tea. He has heard plenty about Southern hospitality, and wonders how friendly the new neighbors will be. “I feel like in movies in the South, they’ll come and knock on the door and give you pecan pie,” he said. “I think that’ll be cool.” He is eager to be unpacked. He still carries so much with him.",The New York Times
2018,"Sundar Pichai, Google’s C.E.O., Testifies on Capitol Hill","• Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, testified today before the House Judiciary Committee. • Republicans expressed a growing distrust of the company, while Democrats raised concerns about Google’s privacy practices. • Many lawmakers also expressed concern about the tracking of people’s locations. Republican lawmakers displayed the party’s growing distrust toward Google, raising a broad array of tough questions on the search giant’s market power, plans to relaunch service in China, and whether the site suppresses conservative content. At the core of their questions was a concern over the company’s commitment to free expression. “All of these topics — competition, censorship, bias and others — point to one fundamental question that demands the nation’s attention,” said Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House Republican leader. “Are America’s technology companies serving as instruments of freedom or instruments of control?” “Because a free world depends on a free internet, we need to know that Google is on the side of the free world,” Mr. McCarthy said. Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, highlighted the importance of scrutinizing Google because of the company’s market power in search, cloud-based email and its Android mobile operating system. Mr. Goodlatte also raised concerns that the liberal-leaning political biases of employees may also affect filtering decisions for its search engine. He mentioned a leaked video the day after the 2016 presidential election showing top officials lamenting the victory of President Trump. “This committee is very interested in what justifies filtering,” Mr. Goodlatte said. “Given the revelation that top executives at Google have discussed how the results of the 2016 elections do not comply with Google’s values, these questions have become all the more important.” Mr. McCarthy is among several Republican members who have made online political bias a talking point in campaign fund-raisers. Claims of anti-conservative bias within the technology of Google, Facebook and Twitter have been disputed by numerous technologists and academics. Democrats had their own set of tough questions for Mr. Pichai on privacy and the company’s competitive practices. But they also expressed frustration with the political bias claims. “I must dispense with the complete illegitimate fantasy dreamed up by some conservatives that Google and other platforms have anti-conservative bias,” said Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the top Democrat on the committee. Officials were expected to be merciless for Mr. Pichai’s first appearance before Congress. When he declined to appear in a Senate hearing in September, lawmakers called the act “arrogant,” and they put out an empty chair in his absence. Though lawmakers asked Mr. Pichai a variety of pointed questions, they also lauded Google as an American icon. “Your company should really be held out as a success story of America’s free enterprise system,” said Representative Keith Rothfus, a Republican of Pennsylvania. “Despite the nature and scope of today’s hearing, Google is still the story of the American dream,” Mr. Goodlatte said. “We do not want to impose burdensome regulations on your industry,” said Representative Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana. Going into a third hour of the hearing, Republicans offered little detail on how they would follow up on concerns about privacy and anti-conservative bias. Democrats, in large part, defended the company of political bias claims. Representative Ted Lieu, Democrat of California, said negative news coverage of members like Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, were perhaps the result of his views on immigration. “Don’t blame Google or Facebook or Twitter, consider blaming yourself,” Mr. Lieu said. During Mr. Pichai’s testimony, the first question from Mr. Goodlatte was about whether consumers understand the frequency and amount of location data that Google collects from its Android operating system. It was the first of many questions directed at Mr. Pichai about the collection of location data and apps that run on Android smartphones, some citing an investigation by The New York Times. Mr. Pichai said repeatedly that Google offers users controls for limiting location data collection and that it did not sell user data, carefully avoiding the question of how the company uses such data in the practice of selling advertising. The sharpest exchange came when Representative Ted Poe, Republican of Texas, held up his smartphone and asked Mr. Pichai whether Google was tracking his whereabouts if he walked to the other side of the room. Mr. Pichai said, “not by default,” adding that it depended on the congressman’s settings on the apps he had installed. But when Mr. Pichai would not respond yes or no, Mr. Poe raised his voice and said Mr. Pichai appeared to be evading his question. “You make $100 million a year,” he said to Mr. Pichai, who is one of the highest-paid executives in the technology industry. “You should be able to answer that question,” he said. “I’m shocked you don’t know. I think Google obviously does.” Before the hearing, Google’s critics drew attention to their grievances against the company that became fodder for lawmakers. A group of employees, who organized a walkout of 20,000 workers from the company’s offices last month over its harassment and discrimination policies, released a letter stating that Google’s concessions to the protests were not enough and that it planned to push for the end of mandatory arbitration in all cases and for all employees, including temporary and contract staff. The protests were prompted by an article in The New York Times in October revealing that Google had paid millions of dollars in exit packages to male executives accused of misconduct, while staying silent about the transgressions. “But just as Google wants to convince the public that it can handle consumer privacy matters behind closed doors,” the employee group wrote, “it tells the same to its employees by forcing arbitration, requiring them to waive their right to sue or participate in a class-action lawsuit in all cases of discrimination.” Separately, more than 50 human rights organizations signed a letter to Mr. Pichai demanding that the company stop working on Project Dragonfly, the initiative within Google to build a censored search engine that it may use in the Chinese market. A search engine that restricts content banned by the Chinese government is “troubling,” the groups said, because it would contribute to repressive censorship and surveillance. Google has eight products with more than one billion monthly users, including search, YouTube and Google Drive, its suite of productivity apps. But a product that has struggled to amass users provided fodder for questions from lawmakers about Google’s handling of user data. Google announced on Monday that it found a security vulnerability last month in Google Plus, the company’s answer to Facebook. The problem exposed the personal information of 52 million users to third-party developers even if the users had set their information to private. Google said it had no evidence that any developers were aware of or had misused the vulnerability during the six days that the bug existed. Google said it would now move up the timing of when it plans to shutter the consumer version of Google Plus, to April from August. In October, Google announced that it found a similar security issue with Google Plus. Google found this vulnerability in March but did not report it immediately, waiting seven months to disclose the bug because it had found no evidence that anyone had exploited the problem to obtain user information. However, it brought new light to questions about how big technology companies handle user data.",The New York Times
2018,Suns Outscore Slumping Knicks by 24 Points in Third Quarter,"Suns 128, Knicks 110 Devin Booker tied his season high with 38 points, T. J. Warren scored 17 of his 26 during Phoenix’s decisive third-quarter surge, and the Suns beat the Knicks, 128-110, on Monday night at Madison Square Garden. Emmanuel Mudiay had 32 points, 6 rebounds and 6 assists for the Knicks, who lost for the seventh time in eight games. The rookie forward Kevin Knox scored 17. The Knicks played without their leading scorer, Tim Hardaway Jr., who had a sore right heel. They were also without the rookies Allonzo Trier (strained left hamstring) and Mitchell Robinson (sprained left ankle). Mudiay, averaging 18.5 points in his previous eight games, had 18 by halftime and Knox had 13 as the Knicks led, 66-59, at the break. The game turned quickly in the third quarter, when the Suns went 16 of 22 from the field — one of the misses was a halfcourt heave as the buzzer sounded — and outscored the Knicks by 41-17. “We were up in the first half and at halftime, I think we got a little relaxed and thought the game was over and they were going to roll over for us,” Knox said. “But that’s not what happened.” The score was 79-79 after Mudiay’s layup, but Warren made a long 3-pointer to fuel a 21-4 finish to the quarter. Warren had another 3 later in the run, and Jamal Crawford hit two jumpers and had four assists, including an alley-oop pass to Richaun Holmes. “The water was coming through the dam through so many holes,” Knicks Coach David Fizdale said. “We didn’t show a lot of toughness during that run.” With a 100-83 lead entering the fourth quarter, the Suns kept up the pressure and quickly put the game out of reach. After starting 4-24, have now won three in a row for the first time since March 2017. Booker returned on Saturday from a six-game absence with a left hamstring strain and scored 28 points against Minnesota. He was even better with a game under his belt, hurting the Knicks not only with his perimeter shooting but also going 14 of 15 from the free-throw line and grabbing seven rebounds. We’re building,” Booker said. “We’re getting better every game.”",The New York Times

Edward Gorey — who concocted the famous opening credits for the PBS “Mystery!” series — was himself a tantalizing mystery, one that Mark Dery, in an over-ample new biography, sets out to solve, only to acknowledge at the end that it can’t be done. Well, every human being is a mystery, and none of us can be “solved,” but Gorey certainly invites the discussion — by the life choices he made, by the nature of his accomplishments and by his provocative self-presentations. (“Part of me is genuinely eccentric,” he acknowledged, “part of me is a bit of a put-on. But I know what I’m doing.”) There are mysteries within the mystery, and for Dery the mystery that matters most is that of Gorey’s sexuality — he gnaws away at it relentlessly throughout the 400-odd pages of his narrative. Was Gorey straight? Not very likely. Was he gay? Probably, but not actively. Did he have any sexual life at all? Was he asexual? Gorey himself addressed the question in an interview he gave to Boston magazine late in life. “I am fortunate in that I am apparently reasonably undersexed or something. I’ve never said that I was gay and I’ve never said that I wasn’t.” Responding to the direct question “What are your sexual preferences?” he replied: “Well, I’m neither one thing nor the other particularly. I suppose I’m gay. But I don’t identify with it much.” Dery makes much of the fact that when the interview was reprinted after Gorey’s death, the final two sentences were suppressed, but by the time this particular reader had reached Page 410 of “Born to Be Posthumous,” he was so tired of the endless speculation that he wouldn’t have perked up if it turned out that Gorey’s interests lay in extraterrestrials. Gorey himself clearly got tired of the issue. “I realize that homosexuality is a serious problem for anyone who is,” he said, “but then, of course, heterosexuality is a serious problem for anyone who is, too. And being a man is a serious problem and being a woman is, too. Lots of things are problems.” There had certainly been no sexual intimacy between the young Ted and his greatest friend (and roommate) at Harvard, the very gay poet Frank O’Hara, or his other great poet-friend there, John Ashbery. It was another close Harvard friend, Larry Osgood, to whom Gorey confessed “that he once had a sexual experience in his late teens, I think. And he hadn’t liked it. And that was that. He wasn’t going to do that again.” According to Dery, “one of the great unsolved mysteries of Gorey’s life is what, exactly, happened at that first (and, by all accounts, last) attempt at sex, which put him off the idea forever. It’s Gorey’s Rosebud moment, the experience that made him who he was.” Here we have Dery at his most off the wall. Surely, many — most? all? — teenagers have had mortifying sexual experiences and haven’t been traumatized forever. Gorey did acknowledge that something important was missing from his life, writing to his great friend Alison Lurie when he was 28 that he “ought to be having a few direct emotional experiences, however small.” What he did have, by his own account, were “infatuations.” “I thought I was in love a couple of times,” he said when he was in his late 60s, “but I rather think it was only infatuation. It bothered me briefly, but I always got over it. I mean for a while I’d think, after some perfectly pointless involvement that was far more trouble than it was worth — I’d think, ‘Oh God, I hope I don’t get infatuated with anybody ever again.’” A more fundamental issue than his presumed asexuality, it seems to me, was his resistance to, or immunity from, emotional intimacy. Dery puts it this way: “He had good friends, but whether he had any close friends is an open question,” and he quotes Ashbery as saying, “I feel that he was somehow unable and/or unwilling to engage in a very close friendship with anyone, above a certain good-humored, fun-loving level.” Jason Epstein, who launched Gorey’s brilliant career at Anchor Books, remarked of his tiny stuffed apartment, “There was no room for two in that apartment — or in that life.” Perhaps the closest Gorey ever came to intimacy was with Peter Neumeyer, an editor-writer with whom he collaborated on three children’s books beginning in 1968. Theirs was a true meeting of minds, as we realize from their almost feverish published correspondence, “Floating Worlds.” “You know far more about me than anyone else in the world,” Gorey wrote to Neumeyer. But surely it was the fact that the relationship was primarily epistolary that made it possible for him to express himself so openly. And it lasted only a year or so. Even with this intellectual crush, Gorey needed to withdraw from the pressures of intimacy. Nor was he remotely touchy-feely — a locution he would have abominated — apparently shrinking even from handshakes and hugs. When Dery asked Skee Morton (Gorey’s cousin, in whose house on Cape Cod he lived on and off for years), “Did you ever see him hug anyone?,” she answered, “He hugged me at my father’s funeral. I think that’s the only time.” Carol Verburg, a Cape Cod friend, said, “Physical contact … was not in Edward’s repertoire. His level of physical contact was cat level.” He certainly was more at ease with cats than with people: He had five of them — down from six — at the time of his death. “Of all his characters, his cats are the only ones who look truly happy,” Dery acutely remarks. People perplexed him. “In one way,” he said, “I’ve never related to people or understood why they behave the way they do. … I think life is the pits.” Gorey liked to say that he had a “perfectly ordinary childhood.” “I was out playing Kick-the-Can along with everybody else,” he said, perhaps a touch disingenuously. But not many kids in Chicago had learned to read before they were 4, and had made their way through “Frankenstein” and “Dracula” and Dickens and a load of Victor Hugo before they were 8. Or had astronomical I.Q.s. Or drew their first picture at 1½ (“very funny little sausagey drawings, which are meant to be railway cars”). Nor did many Midwestern kids born in 1925 have a grandmother who had created a scandal when she divorced her husband, vice president of the Illinois Bell Telephone Company, to the accompaniment of headlines. (“TRIED TO DRIVE ME INSANE” and “PHONE MAN KEPT HER IN SANITARIUM UNTIL REASON FLED.”) As Gorey put it, “My grandmother would go insane and disappear for long periods of time.” No wonder asylums turn up in so many of his tales. And no surprise that one of the cousins remarked, “It was a fairly volatile family.” Volatile in other ways as well. Dery goes into far too much detail tracking the endless, clearly compulsive changes of residence the Gorey family undertook throughout his childhood, climaxed by his moving to Florida with his mother when he was 12, some time after his parents were divorced. Soon, though, he was back at school in Chicago. By the time he was 19, he had had at least 11 different addresses and had attended five different grammar schools. “Sometimes we just moved a block away into another apartment; it was all very weird.” His parents simply weren’t compatible. Dad (Edward Leo Gorey) was a crime reporter for The Chicago Evening American, Mom (Helen Garvey Gorey) was a mom. Both parents, Dery tells us, “were of Irish descent, though the Garveys — moneyed, Republican, Episcopalian — were the lace-curtain variety, several rungs up the socioeconomic ladder from the working-class, Democrat, devoutly Catholic Goreys.” By the standards of the day, Helen had married beneath herself. Soon after the divorce, Dad — who by now was publicity director of the Drake and Blackstone hotels — had married a Latina nightclub singer, Corinna Mura (born the far-from-Latina Corynne Constance Wall), whom we can see in “Casablanca,” singing “Tango delle Rose” in Rick’s Café. In time, this marriage crumbled too, and then, in 1952, 15 years after their divorce, Ed and Helen remarried. (One day that year, Skee Morton recalled, Ted said to her, “Oh, incidentally, my parents got married again today.”) He was never close to his father, didn’t speak of him and only rarely saw him. Whereas his tangled relationship with his difficult mother never untangled: “We were far closer than I really wished most of the time, and we fought a good deal right up until the time she died, at the age of 86. She was a very strong-minded lady.” One constant throughout Gorey’s peripatetic school years was his drawing. He was always making cartoons and designing things for yearbooks, and his great good luck was attending the Francis W. Parker School, an advanced, liberal place that encouraged individual thinking and creative work. It was there that he met his lifelong friend Connie (Consuelo) Joerns and palled around with Joan Mitchell, on her way to becoming a world-famous Abstract Expressionist artist — they liked each other while scorning each other’s art. (Gorey made it very clear that whatever he may have been, it was certainly not a painter.) In his application for a Harvard National Scholarship, after emphasizing his interest in looking at and making art, he lists his other preoccupations: music, ballet, theater and movies. And books. His application lists 69 books he had read in the current year, ranging from Homer and Plato to Joyce and P. G. Wodehouse — all these apart from the innumerable mysteries he read (and would read throughout his life), including “my favorite author in all the world,” Agatha Christie. (When she died, he reports thinking, “I can’t go on.”) This passion for detective novels may be the one cultural impulse he shared with his equally addicted parents. Accepted by Harvard, he postponed matriculating until his situation with the draft was clarified. The United States was well into the war, and he was, indeed, drafted in May 1943. Four months of basic training at Camp Roberts in central California (“God’s garbage pit”); then assignment — given his record-breaking intelligence tests — to learn Japanese; then, when that program was shut down, assignment to Dugway Proving Ground, in the Great Salt Lake Desert, to become a company clerk: typing, sorting mail, keeping the company books and, he reported, staying “sloshed on tequila.” And writing plays, which Dery convincingly labels “self-indulgent juvenilia.” The dialogue is over the top of the top: “Have you ever danced naked before a lesbian sodden with absinthe?” But here also are his lifelong Anglophilia, “love of nonsensical titles, preposterous names (Centaurea Teep, Mrs. Firedamp), even more preposterous place names (Galloping Fronds, Crumbling Outset) and absurd deaths.” And here are more resonant themes that will recur through the next 50 years: “the melancholy of lost time … the stealthy tiptoe of our approaching mortality … and of course, angst, ennui, the banal horrors of everyday life, arbitrary and unpredictable turns of events, cruelty to children (a governess kills her charge’s pet canary), the cruelty of children (a little girl bashes her big sister’s head in with a silver salver) and murder most foul.” Gorey had practically no formal art instruction — a few classes here and there — and Harvard was as much a social experience as an educational one: He majored in French, he says, to give himself an excuse to read all of French literature, having read everything he needed to in English. His favorite writers were and remained Austen, Trollope, E. F. Benson (the Lucia novels) and Arthur Waley’s adaptation of Lady Murasaki (“Genji” was a lifelong obsession). For a couple of years after graduating, he hung around Boston, mostly working in bookshops. Unlike so many literary young men and women of his moment, he didn’t rush to travel through postwar Europe. (Despite his lifelong passion for things English, he went abroad only once: to the Scottish islands for a couple of weeks, after falling in love with the Powell-Pressburger movie “I Know Where I’m Going.” There was a layover in Heathrow, the closest he ever got to seeing England itself.) He mounted a well-attended show of watercolors in Cambridge, and he helped to found and was deeply involved with the Poets’ Theatre there, which staged plays by O’Hara, Ashbery, Richard Eberhart, Archibald MacLeish, Yeats, Lorca and Beckett (the first American staging of “All That Fall”) and presented Dylan Thomas’s first American reading of “Under Milk Wood.” He contributed two plays of his own, as well as designing sets and everything else that needed designing. He was beginning to sell drawings to various publications, and in late 1952 sold his first cover art to a major magazine, Harper’s. But essentially he was treading water — and he was 27. And then a college friend, Barbara Zimmerman — married to Jason Epstein, a young publishing whiz at Doubleday — suggested to her husband that Ted would be the perfect person to create the jacket art for Anchor Books, the new line of quality paperbacks Jason was launching. Gorey dithered — “At first I said no, but then I thought, ‘I’m not really surviving very noticeably in Boston, so I’ll move to New York, much as I hate the place.’” And so at the start of 1953 he moved, “and embarked on what is laughingly called my career.” By now Gorey had more or less perfected his eccentric image: the full beard (possibly to hide a weak chin), the scarves, the rings, the sneakers, the full-length coats, which would morph into the fur coats that would identify him throughout the remainder of his 34 years in New York. With his old friend Connie Joerns serendipitously a co-worker, he stayed at Anchor for seven years, not only producing the art for 50 or so covers (all hand-lettered) but art-directing: doing layouts, pasting up mechanicals, setting type, all of which he learned on the job. Dery can be good on Gorey’s art: “His contrapuntal use of white space, solid black shapes, and fine-lined shading produces beautifully balanced compositions that make us want to linger on each scene, exploring every nook and cranny. At times, he lights his scene as if it were a movie set or a stage, spotlighting the central figure amid the surrounding shadows.” And he recognizes that the Anchor covers could be startling in their implications. No one saw this more clearly than Gorey’s friend Maurice Sendak, who recalled a cover illustration Gorey did for Melville’s novel “Redburn” featuring a prominently crotched male observer staring at three rough-tradish sailors. “The jacket,” Sendak remarked, “summed up completely the kind of confused homosexuality of that novel.” In due course, Epstein left Doubleday and Anchor behind, and Gorey followed, by now having achieved some visibility with the miniature picture-and-text volumes on which his fame and reputation ultimately rest. The first, in 1953, was “The Unstrung Harp,” a long (for Gorey) account of the agonies undergone by a novelist Dery describes as of “the hand-wringingly neurotic variety.” We find here already the fine line and fiendishly demanding crosshatching that would distinguish most of the hundred-odd books to follow. Then, a few years later, beginning with “The Doubtful Guest,” came a burst of superb oddities that no one knew quite what to make of but which took hold with a growing number of connoisseurs of … oddities. “The Fatal Lozenge,” “The Curious Sofa: A Pornographic Work by Ogdred Weary” (it was far from pornographic), “The Hapless Child,” the haunting “The Willowdale Handcar” (three friends disappear into the mouth of a tunnel and fail to emerge) and half a dozen books that, as it happens, I published at Simon & Schuster, including the eerie “The West Wing” (no text), “The Gilded Bat” (tragic tale of a ballerina) and what is perhaps Gorey’s most famous work, “The Gashlycrumb Tinies,” an abecedarian (alphabet to you) book that in 26 grim spreads carries us from “Amy who fell down the stairs” through “Neville who died of ennui” to “Zillah who drank too much gin.” Dery makes much of the question of whether works like these should have been published as children’s books, but there was no way that could have happened in the relatively bland days of the 1950s. Gorey did, however, illustrate a number of other writers’ books for children. My dealings with Ted were impersonal, although we had a nodding acquaintance from performances we both attended at the New York City Ballet. It was City Ballet that consumed him throughout his New York years. He had grown up on the Ballets Russes and Martha Graham, but soon after buying his first ticket for City Ballet, in 1953, he became a passionate devotee of Balanchine’s art. Famously, he attended every performance the company gave during its New York seasons — eight performances a week — skipping a few “Nutcrackers” only at the very last. To him, as to many of us, Balanchine was the greatest figure in all the arts of our time, and it was Balanchine who kept him anchored in New York. After Balanchine died, and disliking the city after 34 years of living in it as much as he had to begin with, Gorey decamped permanently to Cape Cod, where he had bought the house in which he lived until his death. Mark Dery, alas, knows practically nothing about ballet and ballet history. Everything he tells us is clearly received wisdom at best. He is equally weak in other areas. He refers frequently to Gorey’s love for silent film (which he identifies as one of a “pantheon of canonically gay tastes”), but his knowledge of silent film is as thin as his knowledge of ballet. (D.W. Griffith’s hardly obscure “Orphans of the Storm,” for instance, is not about “children in peril.” The Gish sisters are beautiful young women fending off wicked men.) Other mistakes of Dery’s are less factual and more the result of misunderstandings and a hyperbolic and dramatizing vision of cultural life. He sees things in terms of cults, cliques, inner circles, smart sets — a kind of outsider resentment. Yes, Gorey had pals who would join him in the lobby at intermission — or he would join them. Given his height and elaborate way of dressing he was more visible than other people, but there was nothing exclusionary or self-asserting about his manner. His views were firm, but his nature was modest. (Dery even ascribes “a cult following” to Gorey’s beloved movie “I Know Where I’m Going.” No. It came out in 1945, it got great reviews and a lot of people fell in love with it — and still love it. That’s not a cult.) Nor was “seeing a Balanchine premiere an indispensable part of being culturally au courant, of understanding the zeitgeist”; it was something you did because Balanchine was so important to you that you couldn’t wait to see his latest effort. But then Dery is a self-proclaimed “cultural critic,” and cultural critics tend to deal in zeitgeists, not art. For those in New York in search of Gorey’s work, the place to go was the famous Midtown bookstore the Gotham Book Mart (“Wise Men Fish Here”). There, piled up next to the cash register, could be found his latest productions, and there he was championed by the original owner, the imperious Frances Steloff, and her successor, Andreas Brown, who eventually took charge of Gorey’s business affairs. It was Brown who insisted on putting together the very popular “Amphigorey” anthologies that, even if the crowded format diminished the subtle effects of the individual volumes, brought Gorey out of the cold and, along the way, made him a considerable amount of money. And it was Brown who, when a theater producer wanted to translate Gorey’s modest Cape Cod production of “Dracula” to Broadway, strong-armed Ted into agreeing, exacting a huge advance plus “points” (that is, a percentage of the profits) and thereby making him financially secure for life. Gratifying, of course, but Gorey hated the fact that the “Edward Gorey Production of Dracula” simply enlarged his original set designs rather than substituting newly designed ones appropriate to the larger scale. When he first saw them, he told Dick Cavett in an extended interview, “I practically had cardiac arrest, is what I practically had.” (The Tony he won for “Dracula” — for costumes, bizarrely, not sets — he gave to a friend.) Brown’s merchandising of Gorey products presses on successfully today, with calendars, bookmarks, T-shirts, postcards, mugs — you name it! — widely available. Dery, however, takes potshots at Brown and his co-trustee of the now very rich Edward Gorey Charitable Trust, especially for their handling of the immense Gorey archive. Not coincidentally, perhaps, Brown would not sit for an official interview for “Born to Be Posthumous.” Nor did the two friends to whom Gorey left $100,000 each in his will: Connie Joerns and the dance critic Robert Greskovic, whom Dery barely mentions. And yet he boasts in his “note on sources” of the “more than 78 in-depth interviews with people who’d known Gorey, each of which was recorded and transcribed to ensure accuracy.” What does he think biographers do? He’s also proud of having “tracked down the addresses Gorey called home during his Chicago boyhood.” If only he hadn’t! At times his passion for detail is just bewildering. Did we need to know that Bobbs-Merrill, the publishing house where Gorey spent a “dreary” year, was located at 3 West 57th Street? Dery isn’t an experienced biographer, so it’s understandable that he stumbles. But he is an experienced writer, and although parts of his Gorey book are persuasively written — as are the bulk of the essays in his collection, “I Must Not Think Bad Thoughts” — the new book is so swamped in clichés that I kept being reminded of the famous pieces Frank Sullivan wrote for The New Yorker about a fictional Mr. Arbuthnot, “the cliché expert.” People in the Dery universe pound the pavement and keep an eye peeled, books both fly off the racks and roll off the presses, letters fly thick and fast, things speak volumes, are grist for the Freudian mills and do a land-office business (in no time flat). And, speaking of The New Yorker, Dery seems fixated on it — why else, when referring to a profile of Gorey by Stephen Schiff, does he identify him nine times as writing in the magazine? And speaking yet again of The New Yorker, why doesn’t Dery capitalize its “The”? Where, indeed, are the copy editors at his generally excellent publisher, Little, Brown? By the mid-80s, once Gorey was permanently installed in his house in Yarmouth Port, his books had become somewhat predictable and thin — more manner than content. “Gone,” Dery accurately reports, “was the spiderweb delicacy of his classic style, replaced by a thicker, bolder line. Gone, too, were the eye-buzzing pattern-on-pattern compositions and dizzily detailed wallpaper of his heyday, exchanged for monochrome backdrops.” One gets the feeling that he was going through the motions. Alexander Theroux, author of the interesting if factually precarious “The Strange Case of Edward Gorey,” told an interviewer that, in around 1990, Gorey had told him that “he’d lost his talent.” But he was enjoying his life. His enduring fascination with theater had gripped him again, and he was the driving force behind countless amateur plays, puppet shows and revues that absorbed most of his time and energy and gave him endless pleasure — sometimes more pleasure than they gave his local audiences. His tastes in his later years were if anything wider and seemingly more than ever incompatible with one another. Genji and Mozart and Balanchine, yes, but also “Buffy” and “Golden Girls” and “All My Children.” As for movies, he venerated the glorious silent serials of Feuillade and the masterpieces of Ozu and Naruse but he also indulged happily in the most graphic splatter films. When asked whether these popular tastes reflected “a scholarly interest in American pop culture,” he answered, “No, I just like trash.” Similarly, his highly personal collections, mostly culled from yard sales, extended to worn stuffed animals, telephone pole insulators, rocks and old machinery (“I just like rusted iron”). As for success, after “Dracula” he said, “I began to realize what it would be like to be rich and famous, but I’ve decided unh-unh.” In this, he uncannily resembles Paul Taylor. In other words, he un-self-consciously and firmly lived by his own lights — a perfect example of the “inner-directed man” of David Riesman’s “The Lonely Crowd.” An admiring Dick Cavett put it this way: “You have done exactly, as I see it, what you want to do.” To which Gorey, true to form, replied: “Well, I guess I have. But only because I didn’t really see any way of doing anything else.” He even died his own way, stubbornly refusing to take standard precautionary measures that would almost certainly have postponed the heart attack that killed him in 2000. His way baffled a lot of people, because there weren’t a lot of people like him. Chris Seufert, who filmed him for a documentary, said: “My background in anthropology really was appropriate. My sense, shooting him, was that he was indeed the last of a disappearing race. … But the thing with Edward was, there was no race. He was the most one-of-a-kind person you’d ever meet.” His mother, candid as always, summed things up this way: “But then, Ted always did puzzle me.”",The New York Times

2018,"Supreme Court Won’t Hear Planned Parenthood Cases, and 3 Court Conservatives Aren’t Happy","WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear two cases arising from efforts by states to bar Planned Parenthood clinics from the Medicaid program, drawing a rebuke from the court’s three most conservative justices and opening a window onto the court’s internal dynamics. It takes four votes to add a case to the court’s docket, but the cases attracted only three — Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch. Neither of the court’s other conservatives — Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh — proved willing to supply a fourth vote. That split on the right side of the court is evidence that Chief Justice Roberts is trying to keep the court out of major controversies and that Justice Kavanaugh, who joined the court in October after a fierce confirmation battle, is, for now at least, following his lead. In his dissent, Justice Thomas questioned his colleagues’ motives. They had voted to duck the cases, he wrote, for a bad reason. “What explains the court’s refusal to do its job here?” Justice Thomas wrote. “I suspect it has something to do with the fact that some respondents in these cases are named ‘Planned Parenthood.’” But, he said, the cases are not about abortion rights, but only about whether individuals may sue to challenge decisions by states to withdraw funding from Planned Parenthood clinics. “Resolving the question presented here would not even affect Planned Parenthood’s ability to challenge the states’ decisions; it concerns only the rights of individual Medicaid patients to bring their own suits,” Justice Thomas wrote. That issue warranted the court’s attention, Justice Thomas wrote. “This question is important and recurring,” he wrote. “Around 70 million Americans are on Medicaid, and the question presented directly affects their rights. If the majority of the courts of appeals are correct, then Medicaid patients could sue when, for example, a state removes their doctor as a Medicaid provider or inadequately reimburses their provider.” Though the general legal question of who may challenge funding decisions has no particular political implications, recent cases have involved efforts by state officials opposed to abortion to cut off payments to Planned Parenthood clinics. In letting stand two decisions allowing patients to challenge state funding determinations, the Supreme Court effectively sided with Planned Parenthood. In the cases the justices turned away on Monday, from Kansas and Louisiana, appeals courts acknowledged that states have broad power to decide which health care providers may supply services for the program. But that power has limits, the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver, ruled in the case from Kansas, Andersen v. Planned Parenthood of Kansas, No. 17-1340. “States may not terminate providers from their Medicaid program for any reason they see fit, especially when that reason is unrelated to the provider’s competence and the quality of the health care it provides,” Judge Gregory A. Phillips wrote for a divided three-judge panel. Five of the six appeals courts that have considered the issue sided with the clinics. The exception is the Eighth Circuit, in St. Louis, which last year allowed Arkansas to withdraw Medicaid financing for Planned Parenthood. Disagreement among federal appeals courts often prompts Supreme Court review. Lawyers for Kansas had urged the justices to resolve the dispute. “More than 70 million people — one out of every five Americans — are enrolled in Medicaid,” they told the Supreme Court. “The 10th Circuit’s decision permits any one of them to challenge a termination decision of an individual provider in federal court.” Planned Parenthood’s local affiliates responded that Congress had meant to allow suits from patients in addition to federal supervision. The groups added that there was no reason to fear a flood of litigation. “It would be wrong to assume that Medicaid recipients — some of the poorest members of our society — are enthusiastic about the prospect of bringing lawsuits against states,” their brief said. “They would much prefer that states just follow the rules and allow them to obtain health care from qualified and willing providers.” The Supreme Court also declined to hear a companion case from Louisiana, Gee v. Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, No. 17-1492. The court unanimously decided that invasions of mobile homes and other vehicles count as “burglaries” for purposes of the federal Armed Career Criminal Act, a kind of three-strikes statute. It requires stiffer sentences for people convicted of possessing firearms if they have earlier been found guilty of three violent felonies or serious drug charges. The law says burglaries are violent felonies that can require longer sentences. But it does not specify what qualifies as a burglary. The Supreme Court has said the crime requires invasion of “a building or structure.” But the defendants in the two cases — Victor Stitt of Tennessee and Jason Sims of Arkansas — were convicted under state laws that allow prosecutions of burglaries of mobile homes and other vehicles in which people sleep. Justice Stephen G. Breyer, writing for the court, quoted from an earlier decision describing a purpose of the law. It was meant, the court said, to cover crimes that give rise to “the possibility of a violent confrontation between the offender and an occupant, caretaker or some other person who comes to investigate.” That same rationale, Justice Breyer wrote, applies to mobile structures. “An offender who breaks into a mobile home, an RV, a camping tent, a vehicle or another structure that is adapted for or customarily used for lodging runs a similar or greater risk of violent confrontation,” he wrote. It did not matter, Justice Breyer added, that some structures are occupied only occasionally. “After all,” he wrote, “a burglary is no less a burglary because it took place at a summer home during the winter, or a commercial building during a holiday.” The cases, United States v. Stitt, No. 17-765, and United States v. Sims, No. 17-766, were argued in October on Justice Kavanaugh’s first day on the bench. The court also added an appeal to its docket, one that asks it to overrule its 1997 decision in Auer v. Robbins, which ruled that agencies’ interpretations of their own regulations are generally entitled to deference. The Auer decision has been the subject of much criticism, and several justices have urged the Supreme Court to revisit the ruling. In a 2016 dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas said it was “on its last gasp.” The new case, Kisor v. Wilkie, No. 18-15, concerns a regulation of the Department of Veterans Affairs concerning disability benefits.",The New York Times
2018,Supreme Court Won’t Revive Trump Policy Limiting Asylum,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court refused on Friday to allow the Trump administration to immediately enforce its new policy of denying asylum to migrants who illegally cross the Mexican border. The Supreme Court’s two-sentence order revealed a new dynamic at the court, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. joining the four-member liberal wing in refusing to immediately reinstate the administration’s asylum policy. The chief justice, appointed to the court by President George W. Bush in 2005, is now plainly at the court’s ideological center, a spot that had long belonged to Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who retired in July and was replaced in October by Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. The court’s ruling thwarted, at least for now, President Trump’s proclamation last month that only migrants who arrived in the United States legally or applied at a port of entry would be eligible for asylum. And it is likely to only heighten tensions between Chief Justice Roberts and Mr. Trump, for whom limiting immigration is a central concern and who has been quick to criticize judges who rule against his immigration programs. After a lower court blocked the new asylum rules last month, Mr. Trump dismissed the ruling as the work of an “Obama judge,” a reference to Judge Jon S. Tigar of the United States District Court in San Francisco, who issued the ruling blocking the program. Chief Justice Roberts issued a statement a few days later rebuking Mr. Trump. “We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,” the chief justice said, adding that an “independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for.” After issuing a temporary restraining order blocking the initiative nationwide, Judge Tigar entered a preliminary injunction this week to the same effect. “Whatever the scope of the president’s authority,” Judge Tigar wrote in the earlier ruling, “he may not rewrite the immigration laws to impose a condition that Congress has expressly forbidden.” Steven Stafford, a Justice Department spokesman, said the administration would continue to defend the policy. “The court has not yet fully considered the merits of this case,” he said. “We will continue to defend the executive branch’s lawful authority over the discretionary benefit of asylum.” The policy at issue in the case is one of a handful of efforts by the Trump administration to shrink the asylum system — by both discouraging people from applying, and by placing higher burdens on those who choose to proceed anyway. Immigration officials have restricted the number of people who can apply for the status each day at ports of entry while also trying to rule out the possibility of requesting the status at any other location. “If they can execute on both sides of that strategy, that means there are no asylum protections at all,” said Omar Jadwat, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union. Taken together, the result of the changes has been a buildup along the border of waiting migrants, whose chances of gaining refuge in the United States appear more slim with the introduction of each new policy. On Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security announced another blow to the migrants — an initiative that would require them to wait in Mexico throughout the duration of asylum cases, which can take years to complete. Judge Tigar’s ruling was one of an extraordinary series of losses for the Trump administration in the lower courts in cases on subjects as varied as transgender rights, protections for young immigrants, whether Mr. Trump is unlawfully profiting from his office and whether a question on citizenship may be added to the next census. A divided three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, refused to stay Judge Tigar’s earlier order. The majority opinion was written by Judge Jay S. Bybee, who was appointed by President George W. Bush. “We are acutely aware of the crisis in the enforcement of our immigration laws,” Judge Bybee wrote. “The burden of dealing with these issues has fallen disproportionately on the courts of our circuit. And as much as we might be tempted to revise the law as we think wise, revision of the laws is left with the branch that enacted the laws in the first place — Congress.” The administration has frequently asked the Supreme Court to intercede in such cases, but it has met with very limited success. Earlier requests for stays were rejected over the dissents of two or three of the court’s conservative members — Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito and Neil M. Gorsuch. The court’s newest member, Justice Kavanaugh, did not note a dissent in any of those cases, suggesting that he was following Chief Justice Roberts’s lead. That changed on Friday, casting the new dynamic at the court into sharp relief. The Supreme Court’s brief order gave no reasons, as is typical in rulings on stay requests. The case is at a preliminary stage, and it will move forward in the lower courts. The next step is for the Ninth Circuit to hear the administration’s appeal of Judge Tigar’s preliminary injunction. If the appeals court affirms it, Judge Tigar would ordinarily conduct further proceedings on whether to make the injunction permanent. Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the A.C.L.U., which represents groups challenging the new asylum policy along with the Center for Constitutional Rights and the Southern Poverty Law Center, said he welcomed the court’s action. “The Supreme Court’s decision to leave the asylum ban blocked will save lives and keep vulnerable families and children from persecution,” Mr. Gelernt said. “We are pleased the court refused to allow the administration to short-circuit the usual appellate process.” In blocking the administration’s new asylum policy, lower courts ruled that a federal law plainly allowed asylum applications from people who had entered the country unlawfully. “Any alien who is physically present in the United States or who arrives in the United States,” the relevant federal statute says, may apply for asylum — “whether or not at a designated port of arrival.” That language makes the case an easy one, said Stephen Legomsky, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis and the former chief counsel for Citizenship and Immigration Services. “The statutory language is so clear,” Professor Legomsky said. “The only surprising thing for me is that four justices were willing to stay the injunction.” In urging the Supreme Court to issue a stay of Judge Tigar’s ruling, the Trump administration said the president was authorized to address border security by imposing the new policy. “The United States has experienced a surge in the number of aliens who enter the country unlawfully from Mexico and, if apprehended, claim asylum and remain in the country while the claim is adjudicated, with little prospect of actually being granted that discretionary relief,” Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco told the justices. “The president, finding that this development encourages dangerous and illegal border crossings and undermines the integrity of the nation’s borders, determined that a temporary suspension of entry by aliens who fail to present themselves for inspection at a port of entry along the southern border is in the nation’s interest,” Mr. Francisco wrote. The challengers said that Congress had made a different determination, one that only Congress can alter. “After World War II and the horrors experienced by refugees who were turned away by the United States and elsewhere, Congress joined the international community in adopting standards for the treatment of those fleeing persecution,” lawyers with the A.C.L.U. wrote. “A key safeguard is the assurance, explicitly and unambiguously codified, that one fleeing persecution can seek asylum regardless of where, or how, he or she enters the country.”",The New York Times
2018,Supreme Court’s Double Jeopardy Case May Have Implications for Trump Associates,"WASHINGTON — In an extended argument on Thursday that touched on history, the role of precedent and fundamental questions of constitutional interpretation, the Supreme Court considered whether it should overrule a series of decisions that sometimes allowed criminal defendants to be prosecuted twice for the same crimes. There did not seem to be a majority ready to make that move. The Constitution’s double jeopardy clause generally forbids subsequent prosecutions. But the Supreme Court has made one exception. Saying that the federal government and the states are independent sovereigns, the court has allowed separate prosecutions of the same conduct in state and federal courts. The case before the justices has attracted attention because the court’s decision could have implications for the legal problems faced by associates of President Trump. Should he pardon them for federal crimes, a Supreme Court ruling that alters the definition of double jeopardy could complicate efforts by state prosecutors to pursue parallel charges. But the justices gave no indications on Thursday that they were focused on such issues. Instead, they debated the doctrine of stare decisis, which is Latin for “to stand by things decided.” Stare decisis, Justice Elena Kagan said, “is a kind of doctrine of humility where we say we are really uncomfortable throwing over 170-year-old rules that 30 justices have approved just because we think we can kind of do it better.” Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh appeared to agree. “The question is,” he said, “when are we going to upset that stability, when are we going to depart from the humility of respecting precedent and overrule it?” Justice Neil M. Gorsuch warned against rushing to overrule decisions. “It took until last year for this court to overrule Korematsu,” he said, referring to a passage in the court’s decision in June upholding President Trump’s travel ban. The court disavowed Korematsu v. United States, the 1944 decision that endorsed the detention of Japanese-Americans during World War II. Justice Stephen G. Breyer said respect for precedent must have exceptions. “If it always holds, we wouldn’t have Brown v. Board,” he said, referring to the 1954 decision that barred segregation in public schools. That decision overruled Plessy v. Ferguson, the 1896 decision that said “separate but equal” facilities were constitutional. The case before the court on Thursday concerned an Alabama man, Terance Gamble, who was prosecuted by state authorities for possessing a gun after having been convicted of a felony. He was convicted and sentenced to a year in prison. As the state case moved forward, federal prosecutors charged Mr. Gamble for the same conduct. This time, he was sentenced to 46 months, with the two prison terms to run concurrently. Mr. Gamble argued that this violated the double jeopardy clause, but lower courts said the dual prosecutions were permissible under Supreme Court precedent. There have been signs that at least some justices are uneasy with that line of cases. In 2016, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, called for a fresh look at whether the exception makes sense. “The matter warrants attention in a future case in which a defendant faces successive prosecutions by parts of the whole U.S.A.,” she wrote. As that alliance suggested, the issue does not divide the justices across the usual ideological lines. At Thursday’s argument, there appeared to be both liberal and conservative justices inclined to support each side of the debate. Louis A. Chaiten, a lawyer for Mr. Gamble, relied heavily on the original meaning of the double jeopardy clause, citing English decisions that apparently had refused to allow subsequent prosecutions for crimes adjudicated by foreign courts. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. appeared troubled by the contemporary implications of those decisions, saying they could thwart prosecutions of terrorists who murder American tourists abroad. Justice Kavanaugh seemed to agree, citing national security concerns. Other justices raised concerns that overruling the precedents could hamper subsequent federal civil rights prosecutions after acquittals or lenient sentences in state courts. Eric J. Feigin, a lawyer for the federal government, said that was a real concern and could pose difficulties for federal prosecutions of “the recent shootings of the synagogue in Pittsburgh and of the African-American church in Charleston.” But Justice Ginsburg said a decision barring subsequent prosecutions would apply only when the state and federal crimes were identical, while federal civil rights statutes require proof of facts not needed to establish guilt in typical state prosecutions for ordinary crimes. Kyle D. Hawkins, the solicitor general of Texas, who was representing a coalition of more than 30 states, urged the justices to leave the current system in place. The argument in the case, Gamble v. United States, No. 17-646, lasted 80 minutes instead of the usual hour, an indication that the justices viewed the issues it presented as particularly important.",The New York Times
2018,Surfing Remade in the Rockaways,"The Rockaways’ surf scene comes to reflect the area’s diversity and its history. Three years after Hurricane Sandy lashed the Rockaways, the boardwalk marched down the beach in broken segments as the public housing built under Robert Moses was hemmed in by condos. Out in the surf, not much changed as the bathymetry returned to normal, but the predominantly white, male crowd of surfers had. Part of that shift happened when Louis Harris, 46, founded the East Coast chapter of the Black Surfing Association in 2016. Mr. Harris bought his first surf board after moving to the Rockaways in 2006. After getting his bearings in remote beaches, he joined the crowd at Beach 90th Street. “That’s when I saw B.J.,” Mr. Harris said. Brian James — “B.J.” — the only other black man in the water, paddled over to Mr. Harris and asked if he wanted to hang out afterward. “‘If you’re going to be a surfer, you have to take it seriously,’” Mr. Harris recalled him saying. “‘You’re a black guy. Everybody’s eyes are on you.’” From then on, Mr. James taught him how to navigate the world of surfing. Mr. Harris later offered free surf lessons to any children who would show up, many from the neighborhood where more than 66 percent of its population identify as nonwhite, according to the office of the New York State Comptroller, and the median income is the second lowest in Queens. He built a community around the idea that children in the Rockaways should be engaged — and that surfing alongside skate lessons, cooking workshops, and snowboard trips was an inextricable part of that. Surfers like Mr. Harris are carving out a space for themselves in the Rockaways, and are challenging the notion that surfing belongs to white men. In 2014, 14-year old Marcell Dockery set a mattress on fire in his Coney Island apartment building. The blaze killed one responding officer, critically injuring another. When asked why, Dockery cited boredom. The response haunted Mr. Harris. That same year, Mr. Harris read about Tony Corley in The Surfer’s Journal, who founded the Black Surfing Association in 1975 in California. Corley’s departure point was assembling some sense of belonging as he felt like the sole black surfer in central California. And then in 2015, Corley’s story coupled with Dockery’s moved Mr. Harris to the point where he proposed creating an East Coast Chapter. Mr. Corley agreed. Unquestionably, that good will began for Harris with B.J.’s mentorship. “I thank him for that,” he said. “He took the time.” In his memoir, “The Nautical Negro,” Mr. James detailed his experience in Rockaway 20 years ago. “The complexion of the lineup was beginning to change, and some people didn’t like it,” he wrote. “Being one of the first black surfers to crack the lineup in a place like Rockaway was no picnic.” After all, modern surfing took shape in Hawaii. The sport’s forefather, the Olympic athlete Duke Kahanamoku, visited Far Rockaway in 1912 for one of the first surfing demonstrations in America. The values of the surfing that Kahanamoku celebrated spoke to inclusivity and Aloha, meaning an ethos of compassion, but the opposite has often held true along the coasts. “Surfing was shaped and molded in his image,” said Matt Warshaw, 58, the author of “The History of Surfing.” “He wanted to share the thing he loved with the rest of the world.” But as surfing spread after World War II, the magnetic center jumped from Waikiki to Malibu. The concentration of wealth along America’s coast afforded those with affluence access, and in turn, surfing grew whiter. “It goes from being Duke, Hawaiian and dark to young, white and suburban,” Mr. Warshaw said. With that, the sport took on a whole new spirit. “I wince at a lot of what surfing has stood for and not stood for,” Mr. Warshaw said. “Surfing has a terrible history with regard to gender and sexism.” But, he believed it was class rather than race that haunted the history of surfing. Allison Marsiello, 35, who moved to the Rockaways three years ago, felt that while the scene was changing, it still had the traces of surfing’s darker side. Women had to work doubly hard to claim their place in the water, where men often cut them off, paddle around them or even catcall them, she said. When Benita Hussain, 39, first surfed Rockaway Beach in 2010, it felt like a different world. There were almost no restaurants along the worn wooden boardwalk, and the water was empty. “It felt a lot more wild,” she said. It became her go-to spot after studying with Dion Mattison, a surf coach who founded the Conatus Surf Club in 2013. After Sandy, things looked different out in the water. “There’s more and more women,” Ms. Hussain said. But when she looks around, she feels as if she is the only brown one. “That, to me,” she said, “I’ve felt no matter where I surf in New York. It’s not something I carry with me when I’m surfing, but when I’m getting out of the water, I remember the fact that I’m different.” The boardwalk’s slow but steady makeover has rendered the place almost unrecognizable. Although gentrification in the Rockaways began before Sandy, the exodus of nearly 16 percent of the population after the storm created immense change throughout the peninsula. “It felt like you’d picked up Williamsburg and put it on the beach,” Ms. Hussain said. “It was young, hip and generally white people, and I was always uncomfortable with that.” Ms. Hussain acknowledged that she is one of the surfers in Rockaway who come in to surf and head home shortly after. Local residents know them as those that are “down for the day.” As for the atmosphere in the water, Ms. Hussain said, she knows there are people who are unhappy she is there. Selema Masekela, 47, a sports commentator and journalist who grew up variously in New York, Southern California and South Africa while his father, an activist, was in political exile during apartheid, has grappled with the racial issues that haunt the history of surfing. He calls it the “quiet results of segregation.” “The outdoors in general were one of the last bastions for segregation to continue to exist,” said Mr. Masekela, who is black. “Culturally, there’s been this idea that the ocean is just not for us. Where did that come from?” In the Jim Crow era, people of color had limited access to the coasts. Later, urban planners like Robert Moses prevented public transportation to public beaches. Today, many coasts can remain inaccessible for monetary reasons. For example, it costs $400 for a nonresident permit to park at the beaches of East Hampton during the summer. Mr. Masekela hoped those barriers would be erased in time, because the ocean altered the arc of his life. During his first surf, “something poured into me,” he said. But his memories weren’t all positive. People lobbed epithets at him and told him he didn’t belong. “It was such a dehumanizing experience,” Mr. Masekela said. “You learn how to almost smile through it, but it’s a constant battering.” In the last few years, though, he’s seen promise. Mikey February, a black surfer from South Africa, became the first to join the World Tour of Surfing. “It was magic,” Mr. Masekela said. “It was a powerful thing for me.” Mr. Warshaw, the author, echoed the sentiment. As the World Tour of Surfing reaches its final leg this year, the governing body of the tour vowed to pay female athletes the same amount as men in 2019. Nevertheless, Mr. Masekela said, “There’s still far more room for growth.” As to how that change translates locally in the Rockaways, “People have to look across the street at those buildings and think to themselves: ‘I want to be a part of sharing this,’” Mr. Masekela said. Paul Godette, a 23-year-old Far Rockaway native, started surfing just last year. “Nobody really surfed,” he said of his crew, which mostly skateboarded. For him, it began outside Boarders Surf Shop when he started talking to Johnny Knapp, a surfer who lives in Brooklyn, about the surf boards strapped to his car. Mr. Knapp, 33, promised Mr. Godette that if he got a wet suit, he’d loan him a board. Mr. Godette made good on the offer, and soon after, the two were in the water together. Afterward, Mr. Knapp gave him the board. “That was it,” Mr. Godette said. Skating had long claimed his heart, but now it belonged to surfing. “It changes your whole perspective,” he explained. He said he got his passport this summer and was planning a trip to Central America to surf for the first time outside of New York. When I asked if he felt like the only black guy in the water at Rockaway, he told me no. “Because usually, I’m not.” An earlier version of a picture caption associated with this article misstated the year that Louis Harris founded the East Coast chapter of the Black Surfing Association. It was 2016, not 2015.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Survival of the Sneakiest,"Stealth can win out over speed and strength in the arms race of evolution. Dr. Barash studies the evolutionary factors influencing human behavior. “The race is not to the swift,” we learn from Ecclesiastes, “nor the battle to the strong.” But as Damon Runyan once wrote, that’s the way to bet. One of my students at the University of Washington, where I taught animal behavior and evolutionary biology, once asked me if the Bible was inconsistent with evolution by natural selection, since — as she understood it — the biological race is indeed won by the swift and battles by the strong. She was surprised by my response. I grant that much of the time, Runyon’s cynicism is consistent with the nonhuman world, no less than the human one. When a cheetah chases a gazelle, the race is typically won by whichever is swiftest. This arms race between predator and prey has resulted in remarkable speediness on the part of each: faster gazelles select genetically for faster cheetahs, and vice versa. When two bull elk battle over which one gets to control and mate with a harem of cow elk, I’d bet on the stronger. But as I explained to my student, even in the supposed world of “nature red in tooth and claw,” the fiercest don’t always win. This is especially true because “winning” in evolutionary terms has very little to do with being victorious mano a mano, and everything to do with being successful in getting one’s genes projected into the future. (More precisely, winning genes are those that manage to promote identical copies of themselves in succeeding generations.) Examples are legion. Among those highly aggressive bull elk, some individuals spend so much time and energy displaying and fighting that unassuming and unaggressive bulls sometimes sneak into the harem and mate with females while the ostensible lord and master is preoccupied with maintaining his dominion by clashing antlers with his more obvious competitors. Ornithologists have even coined the phrase “aggressive neglect,” referring to the observation that some male birds are so busy defending their territories against interlopers that they neglect their paternal duties to provision their young, who end up undernourished and sometimes dead. Not a good evolutionary outcome for the pushy, ostensible “winners.” The biological world also offers a panoply of cases in which a seemingly winning tactic — often involving high levels of aggression — is paradoxically undone by its own success, resulting in a balance between the assertive and the downright meek. Among pumpkinseed sunfish, for example, some males are relatively large and heavily pigmented; they vigorously and conspicuously defend territories in which they mate with females. One might think that selection would strongly reward effective territorial defense, so that males would be as large and imposing as their ecological niche permits. But when the sunfish population consists of mostly strong, aggressive, highly pigmented and assertive males, the opportunity arises for males of a very different sort to enter the picture. These individuals — though fully male, in that they produce sperm — are female mimics. The territorial males welcome them into their aquatic boudoirs, whereupon immediately after a real female deposits her eggs, the female mimics release their sperm, and then skedaddle. The traditional large males are readily fooled so long as the mimics are rare, but as more mimics succeed, the big fish become less abundant and the mimics more plentiful. Then the dynamic turns. Those traditional males become increasingly aware of the presence of mimics and keep them away, whereupon the number of those assertive males rises once again. At equilibrium, the evolutionary race is not only to the big and aggressive, but also to a certain number of the small and sneaky. I never advised my students to take their cues from natural selection. Evolution is a wonderful thing to learn about, but a terrible thing to learn from. By the same token, although I strongly recommend learning about the Bible — after all, familiarity with it is a prerequisite for basic cultural literacy, at least in the Western world — I also wouldn’t recommend deriving all of one’s ethical precepts from it. For me, the Bible contains too much encouragement of slavery, ethnic and religious intolerance, murder, infanticide and outright genocide. But even though it isn’t clear that the meek (whether animals or people) will inherit the earth, it is worth noting that our modern understanding of animal behavior and evolution is at least compatible with the other side of Scripture: urging the legitimacy of a kinder, gentler perspective on how best to live.

2018,Opinion | Surviving a Criminal Presidency,"No one is above the law in America. Opinion Columnist It is very possible that the president of the United States is a criminal. And it is very possible that his criminality aided and abetted his assumption of the position. Let that sink in. It is a profound revelation. Last week, prosecutors made clear in a sentencing memo for Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, that Trump himself had directed Cohen to break campaign finance laws. Stop there. Yes, there is still information dribbling out about Trump’s efforts to build a tower in Moscow during the election and about his campaign’s ties with Russians during the campaign. Yes, there is the question of obstruction of justice, which I believe has already been proven by Trump’s own actions in public. Yes, there are all the people in Trump’s circle who have been charged with or have admitted to lying about any number of things, including their contacts with Russians. But beyond all that, we now have an actual, and one assumes provable, crime. A federal crime. And the president is its architect. Trump likes to say on the issue of immigration that if we don’t have a border, we don’t have a country. I say that if we don’t have justice, we also don’t have a country. America is a country of laws, and if we are to believe that, and not allow that to become a perversion, no man or woman can be above the law. As Thomas Paine wrote in his 1776 pamphlet “Common Sense”: “In America the law is king. For as in absolute governments the King is law, so in free countries the law ought to be king; and there ought to be no other.” And yet, Trump, his team and to some degree his supporters in Congress seem to view Trump as very much above the law — or at least some laws. The defense is bizarre: Since he is the president, there are laws he isn’t obliged to obey. In other words, it is permissible for him to break some laws, but not others. Last year, one of the president’s lawyers went even further, claiming that the “president cannot obstruct justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer under [the Constitution’s Article II] and has every right to express his view of any case.” This all holds the potential to further make a mockery of a system of justice that already privileges power. America’s jails are already filled to the brim with people who have been charged with a crime but not yet convicted of one. According to the Prison Policy Initiative, “70 percent of people in local jails are not convicted of any crime.” Their primary infraction is that they are poor and powerless. The justice system doesn’t coddle them; it crushes them. And yet, people keep making excuses for Trump: “We haven’t yet seen evidence of collusion.” “Yes, he lies, but that’s mostly rhetoric.” “So what; he paid off a porn star to spare his family shame.” No, no, no. According to prosecutors, Trump directed Cohen to commit a felony. Then he lied about it and either allowed or instructed others to lie about it on his behalf. He misled the American people through a conspiracy of lies, and he did so to help attain, and then maintain, his presidency. As The New York Times pointed out on Saturday, prosecutors have “effectively accused the president of defrauding voters, questioning the legitimacy of his victory.” There simply must be consequences for such a brazen act of lawlessness. Now, I am under no illusion that Trump will be indicted as a sitting president or that any efforts to impeach him will prove successful. But at some point his term will end, and at that point the statute of limitations may not have expired. As The Times put it, “The prosecutors in New York have examined the statute of limitations on the campaign finance violations and believe charges could be brought against Mr. Trump if he is not re-elected, according to a person briefed on the matter.” As New York magazine put it in a headline, “Trump 2020 Shaping Up to Be a Campaign to Stay Out of Prison.” The statute of limitations for campaign finance violations is five years. Re-election may well be Trump’s only hope of evading justice. But that also gives voters enormous power in 2020. They won’t just be selecting the next president and determining the direction of the country. They may also be deciding whether or not a president will be tried, convicted and imprisoned for the first time in the country’s history. This is a weighty responsibility, but it is a necessary one. We have to prove that our institutions are more important than our ideologies, that the dream, the whisper, the precious possibility of America cannot be trampled by the corrupt and the fraudulent, the venal and the lecherous. America has to prove that it can indeed survive a criminal presidency. Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and Instagram.",The New York Times
2018,Suspect Arrested in Shooting Death of California Police Officer,"A man who was in the United States illegally and involved in a street gang was arrested on Friday in connection with the shooting death of a California police officer during a traffic stop two days earlier, the authorities said. The man, Gustavo Perez Arriaga, 32, was taken into custody at a home near Bakersfield, Calif., Sheriff Adam Christianson of the Stanislaus County Sheriff’s Department said at a news conference on Friday. The police, following leads in their search for the gunman, had the home under surveillance for more than 24 hours after the shooting of the officer, Ronil Singh, 33, of the Newman Police Department. Officer Singh was shot after stopping a driver, identified by officials as Mr. Perez Arriaga, on suspicion of drunken driving, in Newman, Calif., which is not far from Modesto. Officer Singh was then taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead, according to a statement from the Sheriff’s Department. Mr. Perez Arriaga, who had two previous arrests for driving while under the influence, was brought in wearing Officer Singh’s handcuffs to Stanislaus County where he was to be charged with murder, Sheriff Christianson said. He did not immediately know the dispositions of the drunken-driving charges. The sheriff said Mr. Perez Arriaga had crossed the border from Mexico illegally into Arizona “some time ago,” worked as a farm laborer and bragged on social media about being active in a street gang. Mr. Perez Arriaga’s reported status as someone who was in the country illegally added to the charged debate over immigration. President Trump tweeted about it on Thursday and at the news conference Sheriff Christianson criticized California’s so-called sanctuary policies, which limit cooperation between federal immigration authorities and state and local law enforcement. “I’m suggesting that the outcome could have been different if law enforcement wasn’t restricted, prohibited or had their hands tied because of political interference,” he said. “My point is: Why are we providing sanctuary for criminals? Gang members? It’s a conversation we need to have.” The sheriff said that officials believed the suspect was making his way to Mexico when he was arrested at a home in Lamont, Calif., about 10 miles outside of Bakersfield. The sheriff said two other men who were also in the country illegally, Adrian Virgen, 25, and Erik Razo Quiroz, 27, were charged with accessory after the fact to a felony for helping Mr. Perez Arriaga escape. Mr. Virgen, Mr. Perez Arriaga’s brother, was arrested in Hanford, and Mr. Razo Quiroz, his co-worker, in Modesto. The sheriff said the two men deliberately provided investigators with misleading information about the suspect’s whereabouts. Three other people — a 57-year-old woman and two men, one 59 and the other 36 — were arrested at the house in Lamont and charged with aiding and abetting Mr. Perez Arriaga, the Kern County Sheriff’s Office said on Facebook. Officials did not immediately provide details about how those three helped Mr. Perez Arriaga. Sheriff Christianson said it was believed that Mr. Perez Arriaga was alone in his vehicle at the time of the shooting. He was unarmed when he was arrested, Sheriff Christianson said. A motive for the shooting was unclear. The Kern County sheriff, Donny Youngblood, suggested at a separate news conference that it might have been related to being stopped for suspicion of drunken driving, adding, “For a suspect to take an officer’s life over a driving under the influence doesn’t make any logical sense to me nor anyone else.” Officer Singh was an immigrant from Fiji, and had worked for the Newman Police Department since July 2011, officials said. He was married and had a 5-month-old son. After spending Christmas morning with his family, he went on duty that night. The officer’s younger brother, Reggie Singh, was distraught as he spoke at the news conference led by Sheriff Christianson. Through tears, he thanked the law enforcement agencies for their work in making the arrests. Referring to his brother, he said: “Yes, he’s not coming back. There’s a lot of people out there that miss him.”",The New York Times
2018,"Suspected of Crimes, Netanyahu Is Also Suspected of Fear-Mongering","JERUSALEM — No sooner had the Israeli military excavators begun to drill into the rocky ground than the suspicions burst forth. They were not directed so much at Hezbollah, Israel’s archenemy to the north: Few Israelis were completely surprised at their government’s assertion that the group had dug tunnels under the Lebanese border. Residents there have complained of strange sounds at night for years. Instead, the distrust was directed at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who recently assumed the additional role of defense minister, and who is facing increasing legal woes. The military operation to expose and destroy what his government described as tunnels into Israeli territory began two days after the Israeli police recommended that Mr. Netanyahu be indicted on bribery, fraud and other charges — the third corruption case against him and potentially the most damaging. At the same time, Mr. Netanyahu is trying to preserve his fragile coalition amid accusations that he has not been tough enough in handling the simmering conflict with Gaza to the south. He and his political opponents are now in an election year. On television, radio and social networks, many Israelis wondered if the tunnels disclosure was a cynical ploy akin to the 1997 black comedy “Wag the Dog,” in which a political candidate invents a war to distract from his personal predicament. While Mr. Netanyahu hasn’t exactly done that, critics said he appeared to be pumping the serendipitous military action against the tunnels for all it was worth. More than the tunnels, the operation has exposed the extent of Mr. Netanyahu’s problematic situation — a potentially noxious mix of national security and personal and political expediency that risks damage to Israeli public confidence. “In legal terms, there is nothing to prevent Netanyahu continuing in office,” said Shlomo Avineri, a professor emeritus of political science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. “But there’s also a question of the public standing of a prime minister and minister of defense under investigation. There have been prime ministers who have resigned for much less.” While acknowledging the importance of destroying tunnels, detractors immediately ascribed dubious political motives to the timing of the action and decried the drumbeating and media hype of what they said was basically a defensive engineering project on Israeli soil. They said even the name of the maneuver, Operation Northern Shield, seemed overly alarming and reminiscent of past wars. “This operation was necessary. We have to tell the truth,” Tzipi Livni, the leader of the parliamentary opposition, said on radio on Tuesday morning. “But from here to these dramas is a long way off.” Speaking to international journalists a few hours later, Ms. Livni was more circumspect, saying nobody had invented the tunnels as a political fiction and refraining from any criticism. Yoav Gallant, the minister of construction and housing and a retired general, criticized the claims of political opportunism. “We shouldn’t take the process of protecting Israel’s security and turn it into a political tool,” he said in Parliament on Monday. “Such behavior is worthless. A little modesty, a bit of courtesy, and some respect for the government of Israel and the cabinet, and less rage and shouting about the wrong things,” he added. Jim Mattis, the American secretary of defense, said he fully supported the Israeli operation to destroy tunnels from Lebanon into Israel built by Hezbollah. “This is exactly the right thing to do,” Mr. Mattis told reporters on his way to Ottawa. “There’s nothing provocative about it.” Mr. Netanyahu addressed the nation on Monday night in what many saw as a superfluous live broadcast from the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv, alongside the outgoing military chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot. General Eisenkot emphasized that the cabinet had approved the anti-tunnel operation nearly a month ago. The army distributed unusually voluminous amounts of information including aerial images and footage of what the army said was a Hezbollah operative fleeing from a booby-trapped camera inside one of the tunnels. “Is this Operation Northern Shield or Operation Netanyahu Shield?” asked Yoel Hasson, an opposition politician in the Israeli Parliament, on Twitter. In a letter to the Parliament’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, he questioned both the timing of what he dismissively called a “bulldozer operation,” and the overwrought way in which it had been presented, as if Israel were going into battle. Israelis have seen this sequence of events before. When Menachem Begin’s government bombed an Iraqi nuclear reactor at Osirak three weeks before the 1981 elections, for example, many suspected it had been timed for political gain. Mr. Begin denied the assertion, saying Israel had information the plant was about to start operating. Any attack after that point, he argued, could have blanketed Baghdad with radiation. Still, Mr. Netanyahu was seen as exploiting the fears of ordinary Israelis who are already jittery, seemingly always on the brink of the next war. Mr. Netanyahu summarized a similar conundrum confronting his predecessor, Ehud Olmert, in 2008, at the height of Mr. Olmert’s legal troubles. Describing Mr. Olmert, then a rival, as “up to his neck in investigations,” Mr. Netanyahu said: “He does not have a public or moral mandate to determine such fateful matters for the state of Israel when there is the fear, and I have to say it is real and not without basis, that he will make decisions based on his personal interest in political survival and not based on the national interest.” Mr. Olmert was a caretaker prime minister at the time, having been forced from office even before he was criminally charged. Unlike Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Olmert was an unpopular prime minister, widely blamed for Israel’s perceived failure in the monthlong war against Hezbollah in 2006. He eventually went to prison for crimes including bribery, fraud, obstruction of justice and breach of trust. Others defended Mr. Netanyahu and gave more charitable explanations for the aggressive publicity surrounding the anti-tunnel operation. They said Israel needed to build international legitimacy for the action in case it led to an escalation, since Hezbollah’s response is not yet clear. In addition, the publicity appeared intended to show the failures of the United Nations peacekeeping monitors in southern Lebanon, and the flouting of United Nations resolutions by the Lebanese government and Hezbollah. “Discovering tunnels is a vast challenge,” wrote Amos Yadlin, a former Israeli military intelligence chief and now director of the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, “and the time for National Security Awards and decorations will come, social-media cynicism aside.” Professor Avineri said the anti-tunnel operation had been clearly legitimate but “overshadowed by the fact that it’s been exaggerated, presented as a bit more than it is and working for the benefit of Netanyahu politically.” He added: “Everything has to be deconstructed in terms of the election campaign, which is taking place on both sides, including the opposition. In a country where security and defense are at the core of political debate, every government tries to utilize it for its own purposes and the opposition will criticize it for whatever it does.” And if anything, Mr. Netanyahu is known to be cautious and averse to military adventures. Zipi Israeli, an expert in public opinion and national security, said historically, military campaigns have rarely helped incumbents in elections. “I think Netanyahu understands that,” she said. “If things deteriorate and there are casualties, that won’t be in his favor.” She added, “The festivities are usually only on the first day.”",The New York Times
2018,Sy Kattelson Dies at 95; Photographer Made Art From Street Life,"Sy Kattelson, a photographer and member of the influential Photo League, who captured workaday New York in pictures of nuance and intimacy for half a century, died on Nov. 24 at a care facility in Rhinebeck, N.Y. He was 95. His death was confirmed by his daughter, Raina Kattelson. Mr. Kattelson joined the League in 1947. A leftist documentary and artistic photography group based in New York, the League championed a new aesthetic and helped shape a generation of young photographers. He was not as well known as members like Paul Strand, Sid Grossman, Berenice Abbott and Lisette Model, but he set himself apart with photographs that tended to be less political, often showing New Yorkers in unguarded moments as they rode subways, walked the avenues, wheeled perambulators and otherwise went about their urban business. “Most people doing that type of work were doing poverty-stricken people, like on the Lower East Side,” Mr. Kattelson told The New York Times in 2017. “I started to think, ‘What about people like me, who were not in poverty?’ So I tried to show people what they were living like.” One Kattelson photograph showed pedestrians from the waist down making their way through a crosswalk, their legs almost an afterthought to the shadows and reflections in a puddle, which takes up the entire foreground. Another picture showed a woman seated alone on the Third Avenue El Train in 1948, her pensive face lit like a scene from a film noir. Another captured people milling about on 14th Street, some faces reflected in glass and others disconnected by shadows and a ladder in the frame. Everyone is intent on their own pursuits, but they all share the same space. “Mr. Kattelson’s weakness — if it can be called that — is his respect for the strangers he photographs,” Vivien Raynor wrote in reviewing an exhibition at the Jersey City Museum in 1988. She added, “His presence is never felt, but his inquiring yet merciful sensibility is everywhere.” The Photo League dissolved in 1951 after it was accused of having ties to Communism. During the 1950s, Mr. Kattelson shot fashion photography for Glamour magazine and then worked at a color photography lab. He eventually moved on to more artistic compositions, sometimes made with double exposures or by collaging different prints. “I didn’t want to keep making the same pictures all over again,” he told The Times. In one 1990 photograph, Mr. Kattelson overlaid an image of people making their way through a crowded intersection onto one of a less cluttered street scene showing a bike and a bus — a portrayal of the transient energy of New York. Mr. Kattelson’s photographs appeared in the important “This Is the Photo League” exhibition in 1948-49. Last year, the Howard Greenberg Gallery in Manhattan, which represents him, held a solo exhibition of his work, the first in about two decades. His photographs are in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the National Portrait Gallery. Seymour Kattelson was born in the Bronx on Feb. 11, 1923. His father, Robert, was an electrician, and his mother, Bertha (Garfunkel), owned a corset shop. Seymour grew up in the Bronx and Queens and attended Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan, where he discovered a penchant for engineering. But he left school before graduating because he thought that, as a Jew, he had little chance of becoming an engineer; he also wanted to find a job to help his family make ends meet during the Great Depression. A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018 He grew interested in photography after he was hired as a delivery boy for the Aremac Camera Company in Midtown Manhattan. He went on to learn the basics of the craft working at photo studios in the city. In 1942, with the onset of World War II, he enlisted in the Army Air Corps and became an aerial cartographer. After the war he was briefly an Army publicity photographer in France. When he returned home, he married Rita Lord. The marriage ended in divorce, as did a second, to Estelle Haber. In 1961 Mr. Kattelson moved to Woodstock, N.Y., where he established an art house movie theater that became the Tinker Street Cinema. He sold the theater, now known as Upstate Films/Woodstock, and moved back to New York City in the 1980s. Mr. Kattelson moved back upstate, to Saugerties, in the early 1990s and lived there until three years ago, when he moved across the Hudson River to Rhinebeck. In addition to his daughter Raina, from his marriage to Ms. Haber, he is survived by three grandchildren.",The New York Times
2018,"Syria Faces Brittle Future, Dominated by Russia and Iran","BEIRUT, Lebanon — Turkey is threatening to invade Syria to eradicate Kurdish fighters. Syrian forces are rolling toward territory the Americans will soon abandon. Israel is bombing Iran-backed militias deep inside Syria. And Russia could soon move to crush the last vestige of the Syrian anti-government insurgency. The Syria that the United States military is vacating on President Trump’s orders is a Balkanized version of the country that plunged into a calamitous civil war nearly eight years ago. Now, with the American troop withdrawal and the demise of the insurgency against President Bashar al-Assad, Iran and Russia will be even freer to flex their power in Syria. “Welcome to the post-American Middle East,” Richard N. Haass, a longtime diplomat and president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said in a Twitter post on Wednesday. A look at the changing complexities of the Syria conflict: After years of bloodshed set in motion by the Arab Spring protests that had inspired hope for democratic change, the most likely Syrian future, Middle East analysts project, is a far more brittle version of what existed before the war: Mr. Assad leading a repressive government puppeteered by Russia and Iran. Both countries are longtime allies of Mr. Assad’s. By rescuing him with Russian airpower and Iranian manpower, they have embedded themselves even further. Shiite Iran, which competes with Sunni powers led by Saudi Arabia for influence across the region, has sent tens of thousands of Iranian and proxy fighters to Syria. It is building Shiite shrines and strengthening Shiite militias that it hopes to use as leverage against Israel. Russia, which already exerted considerable political influence in Syria, holds sway over its foreign policy, military and security services. That is part of the price Moscow exacted for having protected Mr. Assad, a brutal autocrat once described by Western leaders as finished. Although they may find staying in Syria costly, frustrating and unpopular back home, Russia and Iran have secured an advantage from outlasting the United States: regional clout. For both countries, this is “the dream scenario,” said Daniel Benaim, a fellow focusing on the Middle East at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research group in Washington. “They get to tell the story that they’ve been telling to every actor on the ground — America’s friends and America’s foes alike — that America is no longer a reliable partner in the Middle East.” Two thousand Americans were deployed in northeast Syria, collaborating with Kurdish-led forces to wipe the Islamic State from the area. But that partnership angered neighboring Turkey, which sees the autonomy-minded Kurds as a dangerous enemy. How — or even if — the fight against the Islamic State in Syria will now proceed remains unclear. An estimated 30,000 Islamic State adherents are believed scattered in the country. Many experts anticipate that a hasty American pullout could spawn another major battle, either as Turkey moves to crush its Kurdish foes, or as Mr. Assad’s forces retake the northeast, or both. It is possible that the Kurds and Mr. Assad could come to a deal first. If not, a new round of fighting could send new waves of refugees — Kurds and others — fleeing toward Iraq in a new round of mayhem that could also help incubate the Islamic State’s revival. “That’s absolutely a possibility, the risk of total chaos,” said Aron Lund, a Syria analyst and fellow at the Century Foundation, a think tank, “when the thing that’s been keeping the situation stable — not saying it was good or bad, but stable — just disappears in a puff of smoke.” According to the Institute for the Study of War, Russia, Iran and Iran-backed militias, including the Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah, are well-positioned to seize territory in northeast Syria abandoned by the United States. They occupy 29 nearby positions, according to the group, and a further seven across the Iraq border. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which tracks Syria’s war via a network of citizen monitors, said on Sunday that the Syrian government had dispatched thousands of fighters toward the Islamic State’s last patches of territory in the northeast. The last major redoubt of the rebels opposed to Mr. Assad are crowded into Idlib Province in northwestern Syria, neighboring Turkey. Russia may help Mr. Assad’s forces retake the province eventually. But Russia also is expected to first negotiate with Turkey, which has supported anti-Assad groups and has a vested interest in what happens along its border with Syria. Analysts say Iran can now link Shiite partners in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon in a unified front against Israel. In Syria, Iran and Hezbollah aim to strengthen a military presence near the Golan Heights, annexed by Israel after it was captured in the 1967 war. Israel has made clear it will not tolerate an increased threat from Syria, which the Israelis demonstrated on Tuesday with airstrikes near Damascus. The Russians, who have good relations with Israel, have tacitly allowed it to conduct such operations in the past. Still, the Kremlin protested on Wednesday what it called Israel’s “gross violation” of Syrian sovereignty. The Iranian-led Shiite partnership in Syria faces a basic shortcoming: few Shiites in a Sunni-majority country. Still, Iran has extended its influence among both Syrian fighters and civilians. In some parts of Syria, Iran has distributed cash to pay for housing to people displaced by the war; in others, it has established Shiite shrines that, according to the Observatory, have drawn visitors from Iran, Iraq and Syria. Defying the Syrian government’s historic secularism, Iran and Hezbollah have infused parts of the country with a strikingly religious tint. It was rare in the past, for example, to see celebrations for Ashura, a major Shiite holiday, in non-Shiite areas of Damascus. Now, however, Ashura parades and rituals are much more visible. Some soldiers in the historically secular Syrian army have become more religious after joining Iran-backed Shiite militias. Others have switched to such militias for nonreligious reasons. Fighters in Iran-backed groups receive better pay and more days off than the army offers, and joining a Shiite militia does not necessarily mean converting to Shiism. But it is a marked shift from the old way. “It’s no longer purely secular,” said Ali Rizk, a Beirut-based analyst who writes about Iran. He said Iran and Hezbollah have spread their Shiite beliefs among some of the Syrian forces. “It’s only human — after all, these units were coordinating with each other, fighting side by side.” Russia has cemented ties with Syrian leaders, strengthened relations with Turkey and eclipsed the United States as the power to contend with in the Middle East. The Russians have also demonstrated a canny understanding of Syrian sensitivities — dispatching military policemen from Russia’s predominantly Sunni Muslim Chechnya region, for example, to negotiate rebel withdrawals and keep the peace in Sunni areas retaken by Mr. Assad’s side. On a visit to the formerly insurgent-held southern suburbs of Damascus in October, three Russian military policemen were patrolling with a green armored vehicle that bore the Russian flag. Syrians greeted them in Arabic, sometimes throwing in a “privyet” — “hi” in Russian. Many have welcomed the Russians, preferring them to the government’s security enforcers or to Shiite militiamen backed by Iran. Those in the area who still opposed the government said they were heartened in the spring, when a YouTube video showed Russian military policemen arresting Syrian soldiers accused of looting. Then, in June, when Shiite militiamen arrested two Sunni men, the Russians pressured the militias into releasing them, residents said. The incidents helped persuade residents that Russia has no interest in stoking Sunni-Shiite frictions, and could counter any moves by Mr. Assad’s forces to exact revenge on the opposition. “Iran has a sectarian project,” said Ahmed al-Buqa’a, 55, who had three sons fight with the rebels, “but Russia doesn’t care about people’s ethnic and religious backgrounds.” Iran and Russia are already in a competition, with Russia wanting a self-supporting Syrian government weaned from Russian military and financial help, and Iran preferring something weaker, analysts said. Both countries have already begun placing advisers in Syrian security agencies, said Joost Hiltermann, the Middle East program director for the International Crisis Group. But both face challenges to staying in Syria. Neither can afford Syria’s reconstruction, which by some reckonings could exceed $200 billion. The Russians “want to find an exit from Syria basically, militarily, leaving in place their two bases and their own people within the security apparatus, and Russian companies to help with reconstruction,” Mr. Hiltermann said. “They don’t want to get bogged down militarily.” The Iranian government has faced opposition to its military adventures in Syria at home, where the economy has been deeply strained by American sanctions. Danielle Pletka, senior vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative Washington research group, said the Iranians had so far exercised power deftly in Syria, “but it’s going to be a lot harder for them to do that given the economic straits they’re in.” Both patrons may find Syria’s stability hard to re-establish under Mr. Assad. Already, peaceful protests against him have been staged in areas where he has reasserted control, analysts said. “Peacetime will present challenges that the war let him paper over,” said Alexander Bick, a lecturer and research scholar at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies who oversaw Syria issues at the National Security Council under the Obama administration. “The Russians are very keenly aware,” he said, “that Assad’s position is fragile, the economy is totally destroyed, and politically it’s a mess.”",The New York Times
2018,"Syria Pullout by U.S. Tilts Mideast Toward Iran and Russia, Isolating Israel","JERUSALEM — The American decision to withdraw from Syria has abruptly scrambled the geopolitics of the Middle East, clearing the way for Iran to expand its influence across the region, leaving Israel virtually alone to stop it, and raising the prospect that thousands of Islamic State prisoners could be set free. Beyond the region, President Trump’s announcement ricocheted Thursday from Moscow, where it was praised, to Washington, where it was the catalyst for the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. The decision shows that even a relatively small move — the United States has only about 2,000 troops in Syria — can have far-reaching consequences in a complex war, leaving allies struggling to cope and adversaries pleased and emboldened. “Donald’s right, and I agree with him,” said President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, whose influence over Syria can only grow more dominant as the United States exits. Turkey, Iran and the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad also stand to reap enormous immediate benefits from the American withdrawal. On the other hand, allies like the Kurdish forces who fought alongside the United States in Syria feel betrayed and are threatening to free thousands of Islamic State prisoners if the United States abandons them. Israel, which hoped the American presence in Syria would block Iran from completing its corridor to the sea, now has to reckon with a new reality. “This leaves us alone in the arena with the Russians,” said Michael Herzog, an Israel-based fellow of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and a former Israeli defense official. “We are alone in the battle against Iran in Syria.” As the American decision ripples across the region, many countries will be forced to reassess their relationships. The result could be a series of new balancing acts: Israel trying to tilt Russia against Iran, Turkey playing Russia and the United States off one another, and Syria balancing the Kurds against Turkey, among others. “You look at any country in this region, and they can’t trust us, and they don’t want to trust the Russians, but who else is there?” said Daniel C. Kurtzer, a former ambassador to Egypt and Israel who now teaches at Princeton. The American presence in Syria was particularly vexing for Iran, preventing Iranian-backed militias from crossing into Syria from Iraq. A pullout would free Tehran to treat the Iraqi border as fully porous, easing the movement of fighters and weapons — and potentially of the advanced missiles and other weapons through Syria to Hezbollah, Iran’s partner in Lebanon. That freedom of movement could also ease the pain of American sanctions, which are damaging Iran’s economy. “The area is oil-rich,” said Lina Khatib, a Middle East expert at Chatham House in London. “So removing U.S. troops could increase the chances of Iran getting its hands on oil fields in the northeast.” No constituency stands to lose more from a United States withdrawal than its Kurdish allies in eastern Syria. As if to signal that it would not go quietly, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces are discussing the release of 3,200 Islamic State prisoners, a prominent monitoring group and a Western official said Thursday. Mostapha Bali, the spokesman for the Syrian Democratic Forces, denied there was any discussion of releasing prisoners from the Islamic State. “Any news coming from such sources is not reliable and is not coming from us,” he said. But a Western official from the United States-led coalition fighting in Syria, which includes more than a dozen countries, confirmed that such discussions had taken place. “The best result of terrible options is probably for the Syrian regime to take custody of these people,” said the official, who insisted on anonymity because he was not permitted to speak publicly. “If they are released it’s a real disaster and major threat to Europe.” Some analysts played down the threat as a bluff, or a cry for attention, saying that if the Islamic State prisoners were freed they could sooner be expected to turn on the Kurds than thank them. But a report by the Syrian Observatory on Human Rights said the Syrian Democratic Forces leadership was discussing the prisoners’ release because many of their home countries had refused to take them back. The Observatory, a London-based group with a network of citizen monitors throughout Syria whose work is widely considered credible, said the militia was also concerned that it would need all of its fighters to defend against a possible Turkish military invasion. That invasion became more likely with Mr. Trump’s announcement, which was seen as giving Turkey a green light to carry it out. The American withdrawal helps Turkey in two ways: it abandons the Kurds, whom Turkey sees as a threat, and removes American troops from northeastern Syria, which President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he will invade to attack Kurdish positions there. An invasion, however, would not be free of risk. “The problem for them is that if they do go in, there is always the possibility that they run into a protracted guerrilla struggle,” said Steven A. Cook, a Middle East expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. The greater likelihood, analysts said, was that the Kurds seek an agreement with Syria’s president, Mr. Assad, that grants them limited autonomy in eastern Syria in exchange for their loyalty. Such an agreement would put Turkey into greater conflict with both Mr. Assad and the Russians. To Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Mr. Trump’s decision came as a deep embarrassment heading into an election year in which his national-security credentials, closeness with Mr. Trump and obsessive focus on stopping Iranian expansion were central to his argument for another term. Mr. Netanyahu said he learned of the withdrawal decision in talks with Mr. Trump on Monday. “This caught the Israeli government by surprise,” said Ofer Zalzberg, an Israeli analyst at International Crisis Group. “I don’t know whether indeed Trump called Netanyahu two days ago or not, but that’s a very short time between two close allies. That’s barely a heads-up.” Mr. Netanyahu seemed to reach the height of his influence in Washington earlier this year when Mr. Trump moved the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and then abandoned the Iran nuclear agreement, which Mr. Netanyahu had railed against for years. But Mr. Netanyahu ends the year “appearing to have mismanaged Israel’s relations with the two global superpowers, the U.S. and Russia,” Mr. Zalzberg said. Mr. Putin has refused to meet with him since the accidental downing of a Russian military jet in Syria during an Israeli airstrike in September. While Israeli military experts played down the tactical dangers of being left alone to fight Iran in Syria, many said an American retreat was debilitating to Israeli morale. “It’s all of 2,000 soldiers,” said Eyal Zisser, an expert on Syria and Lebanon at Tel Aviv University. “Psychologically, though, they were there, which to a degree put the others — the Russians, the Iranians — on notice.” But an abrupt American pullout gives credibility to the idea, increasingly pervasive in the Middle East, that the United States’ support for its allies is not what it once was, Mr. Zalzberg said. “And that narrative is very harmful for Israeli power and deterrence, irrespective of the veracity of it,” he said. Russia may be the biggest beneficiary of an American departure, which would leave it as the major global power in Syria and restore its Soviet-era role as a player in the Middle East. Mr. Putin’s praise for Mr. Trump aside, he is likely to use an American withdrawal to “tell the world that Russia’s won against the U.S. in this proxy war,” said Ms. Khatib of Chatham House. And with good reason, she added: “Russia will take advantage of the vacuum to set the terms for the trajectory of the Syrian conflict as it wishes. It paves the way for Russia to treat Syria as part of its virtual territory.” But while Moscow and Tehran may both gain in the short term, the end of the war in Syria is likely to bring them into conflict, as their alliance in support of Mr. Assad will give way to competing interests: Russia wants a strong government in Damascus that is loyal to Moscow, while Tehran wants a weak regime on which it can impose its will. “It seems to me we’re seeing the rise of a new axis in the Middle East, aligning Russia, Israel and countries like Saudi Arabia against Iran,” Ms. Khatib said. “But this will take a while to play out. And it does not remove the immediate danger that is now going to increase when it comes to Israel’s own security.”",The New York Times
2018,"Syria, Facebook, Interest Rates: Your Wednesday Evening Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump ordered a rapid withdrawal of all 2,000 U.S. ground troops from Syria, declaring the four-year American-led war against the Islamic State largely won, officials said. “We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency,” the president said in a Twitter post. He offered no details on his plans for the military mission in Syria, and there was no official announcement of the strategy from the White House. Pentagon officials seeking to talk the president out of the decision argued that such a move would betray Kurdish allies who have fought alongside American troops in Syria — and who could be vulnerable to an attack by Turkey. Above, in the Syrian town of Derik. “At this time, we continue to work by, with and through our partners in the region,” a Pentagon spokesman said in a short statement. Mr. Trump believes that U.S. forces cannot alter the strategic balance in the Middle East and should not be there — a view that Barack Obama fundamentally shared, our national security correspondent writes. _____ 2. The Fed raised interest rates. The U.S. Federal Reserve announced a widely expected quarter-point increase, and signaled that it planned to continue raising rates next year. The Fed chairman emphasized that the national economy was relatively healthy, while saying the choppy global economy and the recent sell-off in stocks had gotten officials’ attention. The nuanced message added up to muddy guidance about the Fed’s plans — and markets didn’t like it. Above, at the New York Stock Exchange. Rising interest rates have consequences for savers and spenders alike. Here’s what you need to know. _____ 3. Facebook shared more about you than you know. A Times investigation found the social network gave major technology firms far more access to users’ personal data than it had disclosed, effectively exempting some partners from its privacy rules. Facebook let Spotify and Netflix read, write and delete users’ private messages. It permitted Amazon to obtain users’ names and contact information through their friends. In all, Facebook shared data with more than 150 companies, including The Times. Above, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive. The data-sharing deals may have violated a 2011 agreement with the Federal Trade Commission that banned Facebook from sharing user data without explicit permission. Here are the five main takeaways from our investigation. Ready to break up with Facebook? Our consumer tech writer has a how-to guide. _____ 4. The Roman Catholic Church in Illinois vastly underreported the number of priests with sexual misconduct allegations against them and inadequately investigated reports of abuse, according to a scathing report from the state’s attorney general. Illinois dioceses have publicly identified 185 clergy members as having been “credibly” accused of child sexual abuse, the attorney general said. But her investigation found that the Catholic Church had withheld the names of more than 500 additional priests and clergy members who had been accused. Above, Cardinal Blase Cupich, the archbishop of Chicago. The investigation found that allegations “frequently have not been adequately investigated by the dioceses or not investigated at all.” The report concluded that the Catholic dioceses in Illinois were incapable of investigating themselves and “will not resolve the clergy sexual abuse crisis on their own.” _____ 5. A stopgap spending bill that Congress is expected to pass this week would keep the government funded through Feb. 8. It would also push a fight with President Trump, above, over billions of dollars for a border wall, to the New Year and a divided Congress. The interim measure could pass the Senate as soon as tonight, before being taken up by the House on Thursday and sent to President Trump ahead of the midnight Friday deadline — when funding is set to lapse for nine federal departments. Democratic leaders in both houses said the party would support the compromise. Mr. Trump has publicly embraced shutting down the government over the wall, but White House officials signaled a softer position in the last couple days. _____ 6. Climate change is ravaging the natural laboratory that inspired Charles Darwin. As the world’s oceans heat up, the Galápagos Islands are a crucible. And scientists are worried. Not only do the islands sit at the intersection of three ocean currents, they are in the cross hairs of one of the world’s most destructive weather patterns, El Niño, which causes rapid, extreme ocean heating across the Eastern Pacific tropics. Above, a marine iguana feeding on algae. A Times correspondent and photographer traveled 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador to the islands, where warming waters are threatening native creatures with starvation and death. _____ 7. Like rotting lemons and sulfur. When Californians voted to legalize recreational marijuana, lawmakers didn’t anticipate the uproar the aroma of millions of flowering cannabis plants would generate. The plants are pungent, to put it mildly, and that’s making neighbors furious. In Sonoma County, residents are suing to ban cannabis operations. Farther north, the Mendocino County sheriff’s deputy says the stench is the No. 1 complaint. And in Santa Barbara County, growers are installing odor-control systems designed for garbage dumps. Above, a grower in Santa Rosa, Calif. “If someone is saying, ‘Is it really that bad?’ I’ll go find a bunch of skunks and every evening I’ll put them outside your window,” one man said. “It’s just brutal.” _____ 8. We have a reading list for tomorrow’s feminists. Children absorb stereotypes by the time they are ready for preschool. But when they read books that break gender assumptions, research has found, they reach for less stereotypical toys and broaden their future goals. Our reporter covering gender and families suggests a dozen books for children to help. One encourages boys to help around the house and promises: “If you learn to work hard, you can do something cool — fight fires, bake cakes, fly a spaceship, teach school.” Another is the true story of woman who followed her dream of becoming a shark scientist, ignoring the people who told her to be a secretary or a housewife. _____ 9. Penny Marshall, best known as Laverne from ABC’s blue-collar duo “Laverne & Shirley,” died Monday at age 75. In that role, our television critic writes, Marshall continually struck a balance between sarcasm and sweetness. She was terrific at the big physical moments the show demanded, and she let Laverne reveal the parts of herself she tried to guard. Marshall was also the first woman to direct a feature film that grossed more than $100 million: the 1988 comedy “Big,” about a 12-year-old boy who magically turns into an adult, played by Tom Hanks, and then has to navigate the grown-up world. Above, on the set. We’ve collected key screen moments — and let you know where to watch them — from her career as an actor and a director. _____ 10. Finally, it’s time to lace up your skates. New Yorkers have dozens of places to ice skate, from Prospect Park to Coney Island to Clove Lakes Park on Staten Island — along with Manhattan’s big rinks, Lasker and Wollman.

U.S. shift on Syria, higher interest rates, a China-Pakistan military partnership. Here’s the latest: • President Trump ordered a full withdrawal from Syria. U.S. officials said they were ordered to pull all 2,000 U.S. ground troops from Syria within 30 days. Top generals are against the move, saying it would betray Kurdish allies who have fought alongside American troops there. And the White House has yet to officially announce the withdrawal. Above, U.S. special forces. “We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. He offered no details on his plans for the military mission, nor a larger strategy, in Syria. _____ • U.S. Federal Reserve raises interest rates. The widely expected quarter-point increase signaled confidence in the health of the U.S. economy. But U.S. stocks erased early gains after the announcement, which also indicated that rates would continue to be raised next year. Markets were well prepared for a rate increase, but policymakers had also been expected to calm jittery investors by emphasizing that further increases in 2019 would depend on sustained economic growth. Instead, the Fed indicated that interest rates would rise two more times next year. Above, the Federal Reserve building. _____ • Facebook shared private user data with tech giants. A Times investigation found the social network gave major technology firms far more access to users’ personal data than it had disclosed, effectively exempting some partners from its privacy rules. Facebook let Spotify and Netflix read, write and delete users’ private messages. It permitted Amazon to obtain users’ names and contact information through their friends. In all, Facebook shared data with more than 150 companies, including The Times. The data-sharing deals may have violated a 2011 agreement with the Federal Trade Commission that banned Facebook from sharing user data without explicit permission. Here are the five main takeaways from our investigation. _____ • A tighter military partnership for China and Pakistan. Under China’s $1 trillion Belt and Road Initiative, Pakistan is working on distinctly defense-related projects, including a secret plan to build fighter jets. China insists the program is peaceful. The confidential plan, reviewed by The Times, would also deepen the countries’ cooperation in space, a frontier the Pentagon recently said Beijing was trying to militarize.

2018,"Syria, Federal Reserve, Gatwick Airport: Your Thursday Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning, We start with the U.S. withdrawal from Syria, what rising interest rates mean for you, and the Senate vote to avert a government shutdown. President Vladimir Putin, giving an annual speech today, called President Trump’s plan to withdraw American troops “the right decision.” Mr. Putin said U.S. troops were in Syria illegally, having never been invited by the government of President Bashar al-Assad, as Russian forces were. Russia’s support of Mr. Assad has put it on the opposite side of the Syrian conflict from the U.S. Catch up: Mr. Trump’s decision, announced on Wednesday over the objections of his military and civilian advisers, fulfills the president’s frequently expressed desire to bring troops home. But it also cedes control of Syria to Russia and Iran, and it abandons America’s Kurdish allies. News analysis: Mr. Trump doesn’t believe that U.S. forces can alter the strategic balance in the Middle East, a view shared by his immediate predecessor, Barack Obama, our national security correspondent writes. From Opinion: “The Islamic State has not been ‘defeated’ — and our mission in Syria has not been fully accomplished,” two counterterrorism officials in the Trump and Obama administrations write. Senators approved a spending bill Wednesday night that would keep the government funded through Feb. 8 and leave the question of funding President Trump’s southern border wall for the new year. The bill is expected to pass the House today and to be sent to Mr. Trump before the deadline of midnight Friday. It was unclear, however, if the president would sign the measure, which doesn’t include the $5 billion he has demanded for a wall. If you missed it: In a farewell speech to Congress on Wednesday, Speaker Paul Ryan said that politics in America is “broken.” A former rising star in the Republican Party, Mr. Ryan oversaw the enactment of a tax overhaul that many welcomed but that has also contributed to a growing federal deficit. The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate for the fifth consecutive quarter on Wednesday, as expected, emphasizing continued economic growth. The benchmark rate will now sit in a range of 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent, near the lower end of what the central bank considers the neutral zone, in which rates neither stimulate nor restrain the economy. President Trump has repeatedly urged the central bank to keep rates low. Watch: The Fed’s chairman, Jerome Powell, said political considerations played “no role” in the decision. For you: Rising interest rates affect both savers and spenders. The Roman Catholic Church in the state withheld the names of at least 500 priests who were accused of the sexual abuse of minors, Illinois’ attorney general said on Wednesday in a report that also accused the church of neglecting to investigate victims’ allegations. The report by Attorney General Lisa Madigan said 690 priests had been accused of abuse, but only 185 names were made public. Why it matters: The report is the latest effort by state prosecutors to hold the Catholic Church accountable. At least 16 states have opened investigations since August, after a grand jury report in Pennsylvania accused more than 300 priests of sexual abuse over 50 years. Yesterday: Pope Francis accepted the resignation of an auxiliary bishop of Los Angeles accused of sexual misconduct with a minor. Dr. W. Melvin Brown III is a native of Charleston, S.C., a military veteran who served two tours in Afghanistan, an emergency-room doctor and a family man. But the African-American couldn’t break the barrier of a social club founded a few years before the Civil War. His white friends are furious. Facebook criticism: Lawmakers in the U.S. and Britain called for greater oversight of the company after a Times report about undisclosed data-sharing. Here are five ways Facebook shared users’ data. North Korean denuclearization: The country won’t dismantle its nuclear weapons program until the U.S. also agrees to diminish its military capacity near the Korean Peninsula, its official news agency said today. London airport suspends flights: Gatwick Airport, Britain’s second busiest, is shut down today after a drone was seen flying illegally nearby. The authorities said it was a deliberate act to disrupt flights during the busy holiday season. Imitating Russian election tricks: A group of Democratic tech experts tested tactics in Alabama’s fiercely contested Senate race last December similar to those used nationally by Russia, according to people familiar with the effort and a report on its results. China detains another Canadian: The Chinese government is holding a third Canadian citizen, apparently in retaliation for the arrest of a technology executive. Relief for Russian oligarch: The Trump administration plans to lift sanctions against the business empire of Oleg Deripaska, one of Russia’s most influential businessmen, after lobbying by his companies. American demographics: U.S. population growth is at its lowest level since 1937, up 0.62 percent from July 2017 to July 2018, the Census Bureau said.

2018,"Syria’s Kurds, Feeling Betrayed by the U.S., Ask Assad Government for Protection","BEIRUT, Lebanon — Feeling betrayed by the United States, its Kurdish allies in Syria asked the Syrian government on Friday to protect them from possible attack by Turkey. The request surprised some American officials and could help open the way for the forces of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, backed by Russia and Iran, to start retaking the Kurdish-held part of the country near Turkey’s border. That would be a big step toward Mr. Assad’s goal of reclaiming all of Syria, upended by almost eight years of war. It was also the first sign that President Trump’s abrupt announcement last week that he was withdrawing American troops from Syria was not only shifting alliances in the conflict but directly benefiting Mr. Assad — a brutal autocrat once described by Mr. Trump as an “animal” responsible for chemical attacks and other atrocities. American-backed Kurdish People’s Protection Units, or Y.P.G., said the Syrian government should send troops to the city of Manbij, near the Turkish border. The request amounted to a United States ally calling on an enemy of the United States to protect it from another American ally, Turkey. The Kurdish militias are regarded by Turkey as dangerous, autonomy-minded insurgents. The United States regards them as valuable partners in helping rout Islamic State extremists from Syria — the original purpose of the American military deployment four years ago. Although the American troops in Syria number only about 2,000, they have been a deterrent to an assault on the Kurdish militias by the Turks. The American presence also discouraged Mr. Assad’s forces from sweeping into the area even as they retook major areas elsewhere from anti-government fighters, often with the support of Russia and Iran. With the request for help on Friday, the Kurds invited Mr. Assad into at least some of those areas that he had coveted. Some American officials were taken aback by the Kurdish announcement, voicing frustration and anger to their Kurdish counterparts, according to a senior American official. There was no consultation or coordination, the official said. While the United States understands the Kurdish motivation to open discussions with the Assad government, the official said, the Kurdish position did not necessarily reflect views of Arab members of the Kurdish-Arab coalition fighting the Islamic State in eastern Syria, and said it amounted to a unilateral bargaining gambit. The Kurdish-led militias control about one-quarter of Syria’s territory, including valuable agricultural land and oil reserves in the north and east of the country. Kurdish control is opposed not only by the Turks, but also by the government of Mr. Assad as well as its Russian and Iranian backers, who want the territory to fall back under the control of Damascus. Mr. Trump’s surprise announcement that he would pull American troops had raised fears of a scramble by competing forces to exploit the resulting vacuum. Through their alliance with the United States, Syria’s Kurds gained unprecedented military and political power during the war. As Islamic State fighters were pushed back, the Kurds often filled the political gap left behind, establishing councils to run local affairs. But aware that the United States could eventually withdraw, they also began talks with the Syrian government about reconciling. Abdulkarim Omar, a foreign relations official with the Kurdish-led administration in northeastern Syria, said by phone on Friday that the talks continued and that the only issue that had been agreed upon so far was the Syrian Army deployment near Manbij, after the Americans withdraw. As of mid-December, the Syrian government holds the central and southern parts of the country. Turkey Qamishli Manbij Hasaka KURDISH Control Aleppo Idlib Raqqa Rebel Control Latakia Government Control Deir al-Zour Hama ISIS Control ISIS Control Homs Palmyra Albu Kamal Syria lebanon Damascus Iraq Sweida Dara‘a Jordan Turkey Manbij Hasaka KURDISH Control Aleppo Idlib Raqqa Rebel Control Government Control Deir al-Zour Hama ISIS Control ISIS Control Homs Palmyra Albu Kamal lebanon Syria Damascus Iraq Jordan Turkey Manbij Hasaka KURDISH Control Aleppo Idlib Raqqa Rebel Control Deir al-Zour Government Control ISIS Control Hama ISIS Control Homs Palmyra Albu Kamal lebanon Syria Damascus Iraq Jordan Turkey KURDISH Control Manbij Aleppo Raqqa Rebel Control ISIS Control ISIS Control Government Control lebanon Syria Iraq Damascus Jordan By Sarah Almukhtar | Source: Conflict Monitor by IHS Markit When asked if that agreement had been coordinated with the United States, he said, “You can ask the Americans.” But much remains uncertain for the Syrians living in those areas, especially since the two parties to the agreement described it in different ways. The Kurds said that the Syrian Army would take over only border areas to protect against a Turkish attack, but not deploy inside Manbij itself. The areas run by the Kurds in Syria have long stood apart in the conflict. They had hoped, with their American friends, to pioneer an alternative model for Syria’s future. While none of the other powers fighting in Syria liked the situation, they mostly avoided attacking the area for fear of provoking the United States. Now, with that deterrent set to end, the future of the northeast is up in the air. Those most likely to gain, analysts say, are the Syrian government and its allies, who want to bring the northeast back under the control of Damascus, both for the good of Mr. Assad and for their own interests. Russia would like to see Mr. Assad regain control of Syria’s oil reserves to help finance the country’s reconstruction, while Iran wants to geographically connect forces it supports in Syria and Lebanon with those in Iraq. “An American withdrawal from Syria is the equivalent of handing Syria on a silver plate to Iran and its militias,” said Muhannad al-Talaa, the commander of an Arab militia near the United States military base at al-Tanf, near the Iraqi border. “If the U.S. withdraws and we are forced to leave, Iran will have a steady supplies route through Iraq to its militias and Hezbollah in Syria.” A swift American withdrawal could also benefit the remnants of the Islamic State. While the organization has lost nearly all of the territory it once held, experts estimate that it still has thousands of fighters who have returned to their insurgent roots and can still mount attacks. If the local forces fighting the jihadists lose their American battlefield commanders, they would be forced to rely on the small cadre of British and French forces still in Syria, which could cause confusion, experts say. Although President Trump initially lobbied to pull American troops out in 30 days, the Pentagon has pushed for a withdrawal that could take months, citing the danger to American forces if ordered to dismantle their outposts quickly. It is also possible that the Pentagon will allow Kurdish militia fighters to keep at least some of their American-supplied weapons, a United States defense official said, despite assurances to Turkey last year that the armaments would be repossessed when combat operations concluded. But it is unclear how American forces will continue to support their local allies on the ground, although the Pentagon has proposed a number of strategies that include keeping Special Operations troops in Iraq that can launch missions into Syria, something President Trump hinted at during his visit to Iraq Wednesday. That may be necessary, as many doubt the ability of the Syrian government and its allies to see the battle against the Islamic State through to the end. “I don’t think the regime and its militias can handle that issue very well given how much the United States has struggled with it,” said Faysal Itani, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who studies Syria. The biggest losers in an American withdrawal will be the local forces who found themselves empowered by their partnership with the United States. They included Arab militias that oppose the Syrian government and did not want to live under its rule. “The Americans stabbed us in the back,” said Mohammed Jabr, a member of the military council in Deir al-Zour in eastern Syria. “They played with us.” But topping the list of America’s aggrieved allies in Syria are the Kurdish forces who served as the primary fighting partners against the Islamic State. The Kurds’ alliance with the United States turned them from a marginalized minority into power brokers for a large part of the country. But without the United States, they will find themselves between the Syrian government, which wants them back under the control of Damascus, and Turkey, which wants them destroyed. “I think they really have only one choice, which is to accept what Assad offers, and he is not going to be altruistic,” said Randa Slim, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. “He is going to try to get the Kurds to accept whatever maximalist demands he can offer.”",The New York Times
2018,"T Suggests: A Store With a Mushroom Garden, a New Detroit Hotel and More","Things Editors Like A roundup of things our editors — and a few contributors — are excited about in a given week. Since they launched their unisex clothing brand, Olderbrother, in Portland, Ore., four years ago, the designers Bobby Bonaparte and Max Kingery had hoped to open a retail space. It’s rarely an easy rite of passage — and perhaps made more complicated when an elaborate display of mushrooms is among the desired amenities. Fungi aren’t typically the province of fashion designers, but Bonaparte and Kingery create their garments with natural textiles and dyes, and for fall 2018, they made boxy plaid button-downs and roomy corduroy pants from organic Japanese cotton colored with chaga mushrooms. “We saw a store as a portal to bring people into what we’re doing,” Bonaparte explains. “It’s kind of like the idea behind a farm-to-table restaurant, using each seasonal concept as a way to re-envision the shop and tell a new story.” Last month, following a search for a location on both coasts, the first Olderbrother store officially opened inside a 1940s bungalow on Venice Beach in Los Angeles. The mushroom garden, fully realized, is unmissable, positioned in the center of the room, while clothing racks filled with the brand’s eco-friendly basics run along the perimeter. Chunks of chaga sourced from the Adirondacks sit atop shelves like abstract sculpture and even the tiles covering the service counter are crafted from mushrooms. The designers also assembled a stack of books that keep with the theme, from a Tintin comic in which the titular hero visits a Chinese healer to technical Russian foraging guides. “Brick-and-mortar retail is giving us another type of meaningful experience with our customers,” Kingery says, noting that until this point their business has been mainly online. He and Bonaparte now jokingly refer to the store as “the shroom shack” — an apt name, really, until springtime, when their saffron-dyed range moves in. 566 Rose Avenue, Venice, Calif., olderbrother.us. — HILARY MOSS Here’s yet another reason to visit Detroit next year: the debut of a major hotel project from Shinola, the Michigan-based luxury goods company whose headquarters are about three miles south. The property, designed by Shinola, along with the firms Gachot Studios and Kraemer Design Group, is on the city’s historic Woodward Avenue and encompasses a duo of restored buildings — the brick-fronted, 1915 former T.B. Rayl Co. department store and a former Singer sewing-machine factory. The 129 guest rooms reflect the brand’s Americana aesthetic, outfitted with Shinola clocks and turntables (a nod to Detroit’s music heritage), striped alpaca blankets, leather throw pillows, custom-made candles and bathroom fixtures that resemble watch case backs. But Shinola — and its several, mostly local, collaborators in the project — hopes to make the hotel a hangout for the entire city. The food and beverage operation is led by the chef Andrew Carmellini, of New York City’s Locanda Verde and the Dutch, and will include an indoor-outdoor beer hall, a cocktail lounge and a fried chicken spot, Penny Red’s. There’s also San Morello: a Southern Italian restaurant serving wood-fired pizza and homemade pastas made with ingredients sourced from nearby Michigan farms. It will welcome its first diners next week, ahead of the hotel’s official opening on January 2. shinolahotel.com — JOHN WOGAN Growing your first beard is often an exciting right of passage into adulthood. But for men of color, that excitement is frequently tempered by pain and insecurity thanks to an accompanying smattering of razor bumps, acne scarring and subsequent hyperpigmentation. Among the seemingly thousands of skin-care products on the market, there were none that specifically addressed these issues until Ceylon, which launched in the fall. Created by the friends Patrick Boateng and Blake Rascoe, who met at Morehouse College, Ceylon is the first dermatologically focused skin-care brand developed with men of color in mind. The initial set of skin-care essentials — formulated with the assistance of the Washington, D.C.-based dermatologist Dr. Lynn Mckinley-Grant, who has over 30 years of experience — comprises a noncomedogenic face wash, a hydrating toner and a moisturizer that uses alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs), which have been shown to help with hyperpigmentation and skin turnover. The lotion’s hydrating formula is designed to avoid the dryness and skin bleaching that many people of color experience when using mainstream products. Boateng and Rascoe emphasize that while improving skin care is one of their current goals, it isn’t their only one. “We’re seeking to open the door to better skin health and self-care for our community,” says Boateng, with “Ceylon serving as a potential gateway to better health outcomes for people like us.” ceylon.com — ABID HAQUE The Israeli choreographer Noa Eshkol, who was born in a kibbutz in Palestine in 1924, is well known — in the dance world, at least — for cofounding the Eshkol-Wachman Movement Notation, a language of symbols that describe and document the movements of the human body. But, lesser known is that, starting in the early ’70s, Eshkol (who was also the daughter of Israel’s third prime minister, Levi Eshkol) made what she called “wall carpets,” joyful textile collages and abstract quilts that she sewed with the help of her dancers out of discarded fabric. She compared the process to “action painting.” There was only one guiding principle: that no material should be cut or purchased. These pieces were first championed by the American artist Sharon Lockhart, who discovered the textile works in Eshkol’s archive in Holon, Israel — where Eshkol lived until her death in 2007 — on a research trip to the country in 2008. Lockhart immediately called her gallerists, Tim Neuger and Burkhard Riemschneider, of the respected Berlin-based gallery Neugerriemschneider, who are credited with giving some of today’s most celebrated artists, such as Rirkrit Tiravanija and Olafur Eliasson, their earliest solo shows. “They are extraordinary,” said Neuger, referring to the wall carpets, “like rhythmic visions of dances themselves. It seems each textile offcut or hand-me-down has been choreographed into its place in the composition.” Lockhart used Eshkol’s body of work as a jumping-off point for an installation of video pieces and photographs titled “Sharon Lockhart | Noa Eshkol,” which traveled to various galleries and museums (including the Jewish Museum in New York and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art) from 2011 to 2012. Since then, Eshkol’s wall carpets have been infrequently shown, but as of today, an exhibition of a dozen of the pieces — including “Window to the Garden With Birds,” a four-meter-long work of birdlike figures, throbbing with color — will be on view at Neugerriemschneider until mid-January. Linienstrasse 155, 10115 Berlin, Germany, neugerriemschneider.com. — GISELA WILLIAMS Over the last year, I have slowly switched to using clean beauty products. How hard could it be to live without sulfates, anyway? The up-and-coming beauty label Esker recently caught my eye with its tasteful packaging, and it has become a mainstay on my bathroom shelf. Created in Los Angeles by the California native Shannon Davenport, who worked as a trend forecaster and became a certified aromatherapist, Esker is a thoughtful brand and not too overwhelming for newer acolytes of the clean beauty world. Davenport offers three kinds of essential oils — all of which are vegan as well as paraben and sulfate free — that can either clarify, restore or firm. I’ve become a fan of the restorative oil, which contains notes of frankincense, bergamot, rosemary and ylang-ylang flower. There is also a matching body wash. Best of all, Esker products come with a small package of wildflower seeds, which Davenport encourages you to plant in your yard or flower box to help attract bees, who, as nature’s pollinators, are under threat from habitat loss, urban sprawl and global warming. eskerbeauty.com — THESSALY LA FORCE",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | T.M. Landry and the Tragedy of Viral Success Stories,"We focus on outliers and ignore systemic injustice. Mr. Gerald is the author of “There Will Be No Miracles Here.” I was once a poster child for a certain version of the American dream. The one where poor black children need unforgiving discipline to overcome the inevitable obstacles in their lives so they can vault themselves into the meritocracy. It’s the same dream that led to tragedy at the T.M. Landry College Preparatory School in Louisiana, where The New York Times recently reported that administrators allegedly abused children in their quest to send them to elite universities. Around the world, people reacted in horror to the story. I was disturbed by what I read too. But I was also disturbed by the way this one school was being described as a singular, extraordinary case of fraud and abuse perpetrated by two villains. The truth is much worse. T.M. Landry is an inevitable result of systemic injustice, of decades of school and housing policies designed to maintain white supremacy and punish the poor and working class. Part of what drives this system, and distracts from its horrors, is a myth in which we all participate: the American dream. The American dream relies on stories like mine and the Landry situation to distract from the American reality: There is a conveyor belt that sends most young people, especially from neighborhoods like mine, from nothing to nowhere, while the chosen few are randomly picked off and celebrated. Now we condemn the people who ran the school — who gave us, for years, what we wanted — while letting ourselves off the hook. I was born, as the myth goes, on the wrong side of the tracks in Oak Cliff, a Dallas neighborhood. I was raised by my grandmother, who worked as a domestic, and by my sister, who adopted me when our mother disappeared. I watched my father struggle with addiction and watched my friends endure the same or worse. Then, when I was 17, a man from Yale showed up at my high school to recruit me for its football team. The Yale man said, everybody said, that this was the best thing that could happen to me and to the whole community. “Take this ticket, boy,” they told me. I wasn’t so sure. Yale seemed like another world. I tried to find excuses for not going. On the first day of my recruiting visit, I texted my sister: “These people are so weird.” “You’ll fit right in,” she replied. I took the ticket and worked hard to fit in. I played varsity football. I interned on Wall Street. I worked in Washington in the early years of the Obama administration. I went to Harvard Business School, where I started a nonprofit to support small-business owners. But one story like mine or one Landry scholar does not mean the system works. It doesn’t. Children suffer because we have starved their schools and neighborhoods of resources. And because we have convinced them that their only hope is an assimilation that demands they forsake who they are and where they come from. The reality is that a kid from my neighborhood is expected to earn $21,000 a year — less than his or her parents were expected to make. Across the country, 13 million children, from every ethnicity, live in households without enough to eat, and one in every 30 children doesn’t have a stable household at all. When we highlight those few against-all-odds stories, we send the message that all it takes to succeed is grit and resilience and willpower. We tell kids that if they don’t succeed, it’s their fault — not the inevitable outcome of a decades-old program of structural cruelty advanced by neoliberals and conservatives, not to mention the centuries of white supremacy on which the nation was founded. We sensationalize a school like Landry as a miracle when it seems to work, as a crime scene when it doesn’t. And that’s abetted by an ecosystem of Ivy League admissions committees and media outlets that fetishize kids who have escaped their seemingly doomed environment but pathologize those kids who don’t. There is another secret, too: The American dream can also destroy people who make it “out.” I had achieved, by my late 20s, about everything a kid is supposed to, but I was cracked up by the process. So were many of my friends. Before I finished my book about that experience, one of my closest friends from Yale, who’d made a similar Horatio Alger journey, took his own life. He came to me in a dream a few months later and told me: “You know, we did a lot of things we wouldn’t advise anybody we loved to do.” I knew what he meant. If you catch it from the right angle, a kid picking himself up by his bootstraps can look like a suicide. We “success stories” are driven from elementary school on to be perfect. To ignore whatever hardships we’ve endured, whatever loneliness or pain we feel in the new worlds we’re sent off to. We are given the kind of advice I heard a senior administrator offer a group of black Yale freshmen a few years ago: “If you’re going to be a token, just be the best token you can be.” And as the ones who “made it,” we feel no right to complain about this bitter bargain that offers us the keys to the kingdom as long as we leave pieces of ourselves behind. I’ve traveled the country over the past few months and learned that there is a generation, maybe more, of traumatized high achievers, suffering in silence. It’s time to break the silence. We can’t let the tragedy of Landry be blamed on the people directing it, rather than being seen as a symptom of a national disease. That disease stems, in part, from political choices that have rotted the social safety net and made access to a good education the birthright of only a tiny elite. But the disease is also, more perniciously, the legacy of the demand that black children be raised as John Henrys, no matter if it kills them in the process. We need to stop substituting hopeful stories for justice. We must ensure that all children have a true opportunity to realize their potential. We ought to subscribe to a new vision of success, where the goal is not just great kids, but free and whole ones too.

2018,"TabeTomo, Serving Tsukemen Ramen, Opens in the East Village","Off the Menu Signature pizzas in SoHo, a celebrity French chef’s meatpacking district presence, and more restaurant news. People line up for ramen all the time. But in Los Angeles and Hawaii, they’ll evidently wait hours for tsukemen, a style of ramen invented in Tokyo that involves serving the noodles and broth in separate bowls so you can dip one into the other. It’s not new in New York; Masaharu Morimoto’s Momosan in Midtown Manhattan serves it. But it’s the showcase item at this compact new spot in the East Village, co-owned by Tomotsugu Kubo, who worked at the Tsujita restaurants, tsukemen hotspots in Los Angeles, and who was head chef at one of them. In New York, Mr. Kubo says he will take up to 60 hours to simmer his broth to deep perfection. The noodles are thicker than garden-variety ramen, the better to sop up the soup, and additions like eggs, pork belly, spinach and dried seaweed can dress up the meal. Regular ramen bowls are also served. Donburi rice bowls topped with sashimi or fried chicken, among other options, are also on the lineup, along with appetizers like crisp chicken skin, braised pork belly, edamame and pickles. The focus of the room is a large counter with seating on three sides. 131 Avenue A (St. Marks Place), 646-850-6414, tabetomonyc.com. Stefano Callegari, a former Alitalia flight attendant, studied pizza during more than 100 stopovers in Naples, and wound up opening pizzerias in Rome, Florence and Milan. Now he is bringing his signature style to SoHo. Individual round pizzas come with toppings that are classic and inventive, like cacio e pepe, and mozzarella, Stilton and port. He will also sell square Roman-style sheet pizzas whole or by the slice, and supplì large, gooey rice balls. There is waiter service for the 32 seats and a few outdoors. (Opens Friday) 267 Lafayette Street (Prince Street), 917-262-0302 larossa.love. Fresh from opening Swan in the design district of Miami, the French celebrity chef Jean Imbert, who also runs several places in Paris, is now in the kitchen at this spacious meatpacking district addition.

2018,Tabloid Publisher’s Deal in Hush-Money Inquiry Adds to Trump’s Danger,"With the revelation by prosecutors on Wednesday that a tabloid publisher admitted to paying off a Playboy model, key participants in two hush-money schemes say the transactions were intended to protect Donald J. Trump’s campaign for president. That leaves Mr. Trump in an increasingly isolated and legally precarious position, according to election law experts. Hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments made in 2016 to keep two women silent about alleged affairs are now firmly framed as illegal campaign contributions. The news about the publisher, the parent company of The National Enquirer, came on the same day that Mr. Trump’s former lawyer Michael D. Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison in part for his involvement in the payments. “I blame myself for the conduct which has brought me here today,” Mr. Cohen said, “and it was my own weakness and a blind loyalty to this man” — a reference to Mr. Trump — “that led me to choose a path of darkness over light.” Mr. Cohen said the transactions were an effort to cover up the president’s “dirty deeds,” a claim that was buttressed when federal prosecutors announced that the tabloid publisher, American Media Inc., said it had bought one of the women’s stories to ensure she “did not publicize damaging allegations about the candidate.” “A.M.I. further admitted that its principal purpose in making the payment was to suppress the woman’s story so as to prevent it from influencing the election,” prosecutors said in a statement announcing they had struck a deal not to charge the company in exchange for its cooperation. As part of the deal, dated in September but previously kept private, the company also agreed to train employees in election law standards and appoint a qualified lawyer to vet future deals that may involve paying for stories about political candidates. The cascading disclosures marked a turning point in the multiple investigations related to Mr. Trump and the campaign he led. Until recently, the inquiries had produced numerous guilty pleas and indictments but no direct accusations of illegality by the president. That changed with Mr. Cohen’s assertions, outlined in detail by prosecutors, that his own crimes were done “in coordination with and at the direction” of Mr. Trump. Where the investigations go from here is not clear. The prevailing view at the Justice Department is that a sitting president cannot be indicted, though prosecutors in Manhattan could consider charging him after leaving office. Investigators have continued to scrutinize what others in the Trump Organization may have known about the crimes described by Mr. Cohen, including its chief financial officer, according to people briefed on the matter. Prosecutors have met with campaign officials and asked how the campaign interacted with Mr. Trump’s company, which shared office space and employees. Establishing a nexus between Mr. Cohen’s efforts to silence the women and Mr. Trump’s campaign is central to making a criminal case of election law violations. That is why A.M.I.’s admission carries so much weight, said Richard L. Hasen, an election law professor at the University of California, Irvine. “It’s looking a lot like an illegal and unreported in-kind corporate contribution to help the campaign, exposing the Trump campaign and Trump himself to possible criminal liability,” Mr. Hasen said. A.M.I., run by Mr. Trump’s longtime friend David J. Pecker, had previously claimed it had paid $150,000 to the model, Karen McDougal, to secure the rights to publish her story of an alleged affair with Mr. Trump. But the company never published it, and people familiar with its operations had said it was part of a longstanding practice, known in the tabloid trade as “catch and kill,” to suppress damaging stories about favored people. Prosecutors said that Mr. Cohen had intended to reimburse A.M.I. for its payment to Ms. McDougal by arranging a bogus $125,000 fee to an A.M.I. affiliate for “advisory services.” Although Mr. Pecker signed off on the deal, he later contacted Mr. Cohen and called it off. He also instructed Mr. Cohen to tear up the paperwork, prosecutors said. In addition to McDougal, Mr. Cohen said he arranged a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels, a pornographic film actress, to squelch her story of an alleged affair with Mr. Trump. He said that he used his own money, but that Mr. Trump had agreed to pay him back, with the reimbursement eventually being couched as legal fees billed to the Trump Organization. A.M.I. was also involved in the early stages of Mr. Cohen’s dealings with Ms. Daniels. Rather than pay her, as it did with Ms. McDougal, the company notified Mr. Cohen that she was trying to sell her story. Until this week, it was largely Mr. Cohen’s word against the president’s denials. That is why the admission by A.M.I. is “highly significant, because it goes to corroborate” Mr. Cohen’s testimony, said Jeff Tsai, part of the prosecution team that accused Senator John Edwards of campaign finance violations when he arranged for payoffs to a pregnant mistress during his 2008 presidential campaign. “In any future prosecution, Mr. Cohen’s credibility is squarely at issue — as it should be — and that is where you see the nature of corroboration, either in the form of witnesses or documents, become such a pivotal factor in a prosecution,” Mr. Tsai said. The Edwards case — which ended in an acquittal and mistrial — has been invoked by Trump allies as an example of prosecutorial overreach. Central to Mr. Edwards’s defense was that the payments were intended not to help his campaign but to hide the affair from his wife — that they were personal, not political. Six Trump advisers or officials have been charged by the special counsel. Mr. Trump seemed to hint at this strategy in a tweet responding to Mr. Cohen’s admissions, in which he made an oblique reference to a “simple personal transaction” that was being wrongly called “a campaign contribution.” Given the president’s stance, the disclosure of A.M.I.’s understanding that the efforts were campaign-related — and its promise of future cooperation — shows that potential witnesses against Mr. Trump go beyond Mr. Cohen. Indeed, the A.M.I. agreement with prosecutors said there was at least one other person associated with Mr. Trump’s campaign involved in an initial discussion in August 2015, attended by Mr. Cohen and Mr. Pecker, in which they agreed that the publisher would help the campaign by identifying negative stories about Mr. Trump’s relationships with women “so they could be purchased and their publication avoided.” But many details remain hidden. Among them, the statement did not say whether the other campaign member was Mr. Trump himself — identified by prosecutors last week as attending a similar meeting — or some other person. A.M.I. had no comment on Wednesday. Mr. Pecker had been steadfast in his support of Mr. Trump, equating any attack against him as an attack against A.M.I. But one associate of Mr. Pecker’s, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Mr. Pecker felt betrayed when the president’s legal team failed to push back against revelations in July that Mr. Cohen had recorded a conversation with Mr. Trump discussing the McDougal payment. The recording seemed to support the notion that A.M.I. was complicit in an illegal campaign finance scheme. In admitting to the scheme, Mr. Pecker, his lieutenant Dylan Howard and A.M.I. are now protected from criminal prosecution.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Taiwan’s Democratic Model,"letter The government writes that its voters cherish the right to vote. To the Editor: Yi-Zheng Lian sounds a cautionary note in “China Preys on Taiwan’s Openness” (Op-Ed, Nov. 29), worrying that if Taiwan falls to the Chinese Communists, Hong Kong “could be next.” It may have escaped Mr. Lian’s notice, but Hong Kong’s fate was sealed in 1997 when it was handed over to the Chinese Communists, and notwithstanding the promises made to allow the colony some degree of autonomy, Beijing’s heavy hand has continued every year to close into a fist, breaking those promises, bit by bit, almost since the handover itself. Taiwan’s voters are pragmatic, and their hard-earned democracy allows them to vote incumbents failing to serve their interests out of office. The right to vote is also something that Taiwanese people deeply cherish and are willing to defend. Taiwan recognizes the threat of disinformation campaigns and is developing countermeasures to strengthen transparency. To think that Taiwan would so easily let go of its freedom is a mistake.

2018,Taking College One Meal at a Time,"Facing mounting costs at Cornell, Samuel Issiah Williams decided to skip a meal plan his senior year and think creatively to get by. At a dorm movie night, he might find sandwiches. At an open mic, it could be a few boxes of pizza. Other Cornell students might see free food at campus events as a bonus. But for Samuel Issiah Williams, it is often dinner. Mr. Williams, 22, is a Cornell senior majoring in information science. He arrived on campus this semester facing rising tuition costs, unexpected health insurance fees and thousands of dollars in loans. Rather than add to his mounting debt, he decided to forgo a meal plan — thousands of dollars for the year — and instead make do with canned goods and freebies around campus. “This is what I have to do to save money,” he said last month at his parents’ home in Jamaica, Queens. “That’s how it’s going to be.” Through Children’s Aid, one of the eight agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, Mr. Williams got help for the fall semester, receiving $652.85 from the fund for meals and textbooks. He hopes to stay steadily nourished until May, when he graduates and plans to get a job in web design. Born in the tropical South American country of Guyana, Mr. Williams still has not quite gotten used to the snow on Cornell’s campus in Ithaca, N.Y. He grew up in Guyana’s capital, Georgetown, where mango, guava and cashew trees grew in his backyard. His parents made and sold hats from a vendor’s stand downtown, but they wanted better economic and educational opportunities for their five children. With his family, Mr. Williams immigrated to the United States in 2008 in the midst of the recession. Settling down in Brooklyn, they joined other family members in a two-bedroom apartment that now housed 13. Mr. Williams slept next to his cousin on a bottom bunk, while his two brothers shared the top. “We slept fine,” he said. “It wasn’t something we thought about that much.” Still, those early years in the United States were difficult for the Williams family. In their second Brooklyn apartment, they contended with difficult neighbors, and one night, Mr. Williams’s father was mugged and had to stay home for a week tending to his injuries. “We didn’t feel safe there,” Mr. Williams said. “That was the worst experience.” While his parents worked low-wage service jobs in the city, they instilled in their children a tireless academic work ethic. Mr. Williams became a standout student at Benjamin Banneker Academy, excelling particularly in math and English. He tutored math after school, earned scholarships to help pay for college and graduated on the honor roll. Several prestigious colleges accepted him, but “I had to look at the financial aid package to determine if I would be able to go or not,” he said. The initial package that Cornell offered in 2015 seemed like a dream come true: The university covered all first-year costs except for a student contribution fee. Tuition costs rose each year, though, and so did the contribution fees for Mr. Williams and his parents. A $350 student health fee, which caused an uproar on campus, was also put into effect. And a policy change required over 2,000 students, including Mr. Williams, to spend about $2,800 on the school’s health insurance this year. His application for a waiver, relying on his mother’s insurance plan, was denied. (Cornell has changed the policy to allow more students to waive the school plan for the next calendar year.) So Mr. Williams turned to loans and money from his parents to stay afloat. He also works at a laboratory on campus, where he cleans up after experiments — but he has little time to earn additional money, given the coursework for his five classes this semester. After class, he cooks simple meals for himself. His favorite childhood foods — like Guyanese cook-up rice — are too challenging and expensive to make, so he often relies on pasta, canned beans and chicken tenders. He watches a GroupMe message channel on campus that points students to free food and shows up to those events. “I always find a way,” he said. Mr. Williams says that he does not often talk about his financial struggles with his classmates. But hunger is a pervasive problem across college campuses, affecting millions of students, according to a survey released this year by Temple University and the Wisconsin HOPE Lab. Of the 43,000 students at 66 colleges surveyed, 36 percent had trouble getting enough to eat on a daily basis. For Mr. Williams, his student loans are a constant source of anxiety. “In the back of my mind, I’m always telling myself, ‘Once you graduate, all this money’s going to accumulate. You’re going to be in debt,’” he said. After graduation, Mr. Williams plans to earn an internship or job in front-end software or web design. He is interested in designing apps and also has aspirations to publish his poetry and short stories. His ultimate goal is to be his own boss, so that he does not have to rely on anyone except for himself. “At some point in my life, I hope to be self-employed,” he said. “I can’t imagine myself working for someone else my entire life.” Donations to the Neediest Cases may be made online, or with a check or over the phone.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Taking Responsibility or a Requiem? Men Talk About #MeToo,"How is the movement perceived by men and what is their role in it? Our readers shared their thoughts. Ms. Harris and Ms. Tarchak are senior editorial assistants. The #MeToo movement has magnified the voices of women, but two recent Opinion articles explored the effects of the movement on men: “Eight Stories of Men’s Regret,” a collection of short essays from male readers about past sexual encounters, and “#IAmSexist,” an essay by George Yancy in The Stone series that asks men to take responsibility for their part in perpetuating violence against women. Men responded to both pieces with a mix of reactions, including protestation, apology and ideas about how both victims and perpetrators might move forward. A selection of their comments is below, edited for length and clarity. I know I’ve said things that created discomfort, embarrassment and shame for girls and women that I knew in school, at work and in public. Most of this occurred in my teen years and early 20s. I’m guessing that my frontal cortex began to operate in my mid-20s and I began to behave like a decent adult. I became a better man. But I was part of the problem. I am sorry. — Michael, Minnesota I have not sexually assaulted anyone but I think I have come close. As I reflect on my behavior over the past 70 years, one of the things I see is that there are no barriers put in front of men. The message is: We are entitled to all the sex we can get and are duty-bound to pursue it; it is up to women to stop us. That message is supported by our culture. We need to teach boys the lessons of Mr. Yancy’s article from an early age. — rkh, Binghamton Human attitudes toward differences between the sexes did not emerge solely from the misguided ideas of ancestral social architects, as Mr. Yancy implies in his essay. They are the byproducts of natural selection among primates. We are still waking up to the realization that historically acceptable practices by men are truly abysmal in a moral society, which means we have generations of counter-evolutionary education before us until we can realistically expect permanent change. In the meantime, we need to be cautious about assigning blame and be patient while men right themselves, lest we find our nation even more divided by men falsely claiming victimhood. — GBarry, Atlanta O.K., I’m bewildered. Popping a bra strap? Kissing a girl and discovering that she, maybe, didn’t want to be kissed? Let’s not start turning every woman into a victim and every male into a predator. What I’ve found is that most men I’ve known are gentlemen and would never think of assault or rape. What I’ve found about women is that most have been highly interested in sex since high school. Most of the time, at least with me, they were initiators or conspirators. Male-female relationships are tough. People get hurt on both sides. But overall, it’s worth it. — Ralphie, Connecticut The whole dynamic between men and women must change to one of true equality before any of this toxic masculinity that Mr. Yancy refers to will change. When the time comes for women to be just as likely as a man to initiate contact, ask to date, make the first sexual moves and the like, then there can be equality. But if men are expected to walk the line between seduction and harassment, and women are either complicit or victimized, nothing will change. — Ronald Giteck, Minnesota In high school and college, I learned about some of the games and manipulations men and women engaged in, but the greater weight of the malfeasance was often with the boys who assumed the roles of aggressors and initiators. We accepted those roles as part of our culture. I don’t think any of us thought we were damaging anybody, we just wanted what we wanted. Now I cringe inwardly when I think of the stupid stuff I did. I wish I could find these girls and women and apologize. — robertladner, Miami In my experience, there were women who weren’t clear about what they wanted or changed their minds during our tango. A teenage boy facing those complexities mid-seduction is unlikely to try to divine a woman’s intentions. He just wants to get her clothes off. Once he’s a man, a woman’s changeability can be every bit as baffling. It’s a game with loose rules, one that’s forever confusing, even maddening. Nonetheless, he must remain as sure as he can be that she’s consenting. — Paul, Canada Perhaps we should create hashtags for all of our wrongs: #IAmSexist, #IAmRacist, #IGentrify, #IAmTryingtoUnderstandDiscussionsAboutGenderbutamnotthereyet. I’m a white male, which surely you know by now. I am 51. I am doing the best I can with what I have. I try to treat everyone respectfully while I improve myself as I learn. I’m not going to undermine that process by branding or punishing myself with pejorative terms, especially when they can be so broadly interpreted. — SMR, North Carolina In response to Mr. Yancy’s essay, let’s save the confessions for those who have actually committed a sin. I’ve always striven to practice feminist ideals and treat women with the same respect and equality with which I treat men. I’m happy to say that #IAmNotASexist — RP, New York There can be no question, ever, that the victims suffer more than the perpetrators. However, if we are to make any significant progress on this monumental societal problem, the perpetrators must learn to be unflinchingly honest with themselves and those around them. That requires the trust that their tentative efforts won’t be belittled. Opening and draining these wounds for both parties is ugly and uncomfortable, and utterly necessary. — Harry R., Massachusetts Do our regrets and apologies set us free emotionally? Experience suggests the answer for many is no. What if one’s apology does not receive a response or is rejected? While confessing the errors of one’s ways may be beneficial, what, if anything, can set things right? Most of us carry burdens to our graves, unrelieved, unsatisfied. Can what’s done be undone? — Doug Giebel, Big Sandy, Montana To Doug Giebel: I see repentance in the testimonials in “Eight Stories of Men’s Regret,” an acknowledgment of harm done and a determination to behave differently. They also lighten the burden of shame and allow some dignity for the man who comes forward. Our shame is not enough to heal the harm we do to one another, nor is it enough to heal ourselves. Repentance, though, can be transformative, if felt deeply. — Dwain, Rochester While I do not disagree with Mr. Yancy’s proposition that we should assume responsibility for our sexism, it is an incomplete rendering of a collective sexism, which includes women. The one feeds the other, especially among the youngest of us. Until boys and girls are provided, from infancy, by caretakers and society, equal access to cognitive and emotional expression, adults will be but immature examples of their potential. — Jbg, Cape Cod, Mass.

2018,Taking Surprise Medical Bills to Court,"Some legal experts say contract law could provide consumers another avenue to challenge unexpected hospital bills. Joaquin Lopez had emergency gallbladder surgery after rushing to an emergency room last year. He has been haggling with Baptist Memorial Hospital in Memphis over what he owes ever since. The 37-year-old college professor was hit with a nearly $8,000 bill from the out-of-network hospital — that was after the $11,000 he and his insurer had already paid. Consumers are increasingly vulnerable to such so-called balance bills, which represent the difference between what insurers pay and hospitals’ list prices. List prices can be several times higher than what the hospitals accept from Medicare or in-network insurers. Congress is considering bipartisan legislation to limit balance billing. But some legal scholars say that patients should already be protected against some of the highest surprise charges under longstanding conventions of contract law. That’s because contract law rests on the centuries-old concept of “mutual assent,” in which both sides agree to a price before services are rendered, said Barak Richman, a law professor at Duke University. Thus, many states require, and consumers expect, written estimates for a range of services before the work is done — whether by mechanics and plumbers or lawyers and financial planners. But patients rarely know upfront how much their medical care will cost, and hospitals generally provide little or no information. While consumers are obligated to pay something, the question is how much? Hospitals generally bill out-of-network care at list prices, their highest charges. Without an explicit price upfront, contract law would require medical providers to charge only “average or market prices,” Mr. Richman said. In several recent cases, for example in New York and Colorado, courts have stepped in to mediate cases where a patient received a big balance bill from an out-of-network provider. They ordered hospitals to accept amounts far closer to what they agree to from in-network private insurers or Medicare. “This is the amount they are legally entitled to collect,” said Mr. Richman. Dr. Lopez’s bill came after he sought help at the emergency room following excruciating abdominal pain. Sent home with pain medication, he awoke hours later to a phone call from the hospital: Come back! A review of his tests showed he needed surgery. He didn’t stop to ask if the hospital was in his network, or for a cost estimate. So, in an example like that, is there mutual assent? Hospitals say yes, that signed admission forms, which include a promise to pay, constitute mutual assent, even if there was no price disclosed. No, counters Mr. Richman. If a tax preparer provided no upfront estimate, he could not suddenly bill a client for $10,000 if the going rate for the service was $1,000 or less. The higher fee would never hold up in a court of law, since there was no “mutual assent” about price. But what, if anything, should Dr. Lopez offer to pay? What is reasonable or average in a system where the price of a hip replacement can range from $15,000 to $150,000, or a blood test can be $5 to $500? Based on the hospital’s list prices, Dr. Lopez’s bill came to nearly $21,000. His insurer, Cigna, using a formula it said is similar to what Medicare uses, said the maximum it would cover was $11,160. It paid 80 percent of that lower amount, and Dr. Lopez paid the remainder. Baptist Hospital is billing Dr. Lopez for nearly $8,000 more, saying it wants the full charges. “I’m an economist,” said Dr. Lopez, who teaches at the University of Memphis. “I understand how abusive these practices are. There is not a single market price.” Indeed. Healthcare Bluebook, a consumer website that uses claims data to estimate costs, shows gall bladder surgery in Memphis costs as little as $14,000, but could be tens of thousands more, with a “fair price” of about $18,000 — which is generally less than full billed charges, but more than in-network insurers would pay. That complexity — and the cost of hiring an attorney — have made legal challenges to medical bills on the basis of contract law relatively scarce. Also, “it’s not a well-settled area of the law,” said Mark Hall, director of the Health Law and Policy Program at Wake Forest University, who backs the contract law protection theory. Even though hospitals have lost some cases, their arguments have also found traction. The Virginia Supreme Court last year ruled in favor of a hospital, saying admission paperwork a patient named Glenn Dennis signed in the emergency room was a valid contract. The hospital had sued him over an $84,000 bill for his out-of-network care. Still, the court left open the key question of just how much of that Mr. Dennis owed, sending that back to a lower court. That court previously ruled that Mr. Dennis owed only about $500 on top of the $27,255 his health insurer had paid. That reflected a discount the hospital commonly gave uninsured patients, the circuit court judge wrote. The two sides are still working on a settlement. For those caught up in the disputes, determining a fair price is hard. “That’s where courts struggle, creating health care prices,” said Mr. Hall. One way is to look at what hospitals accept for in-network care from private insurers. But hospitals generally object to releasing that, saying it’s a trade secret. A 2017 Texas Supreme Court ruling has, at least for now, broken through this position. It said that hospitals in some legal disputes must disclose those in-network rates they allow in-network insurers to pay. “Hospitals are really trying to prevent this sort of thing because they are uncomfortable having someone ask them to justify” their charges, said George Nation, a law professor at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania, who filed a court brief in the Texas case on behalf of the patient’s argument. In June, the hospital involved in the dispute asked for a rehearing, saying such disclosure would weaken its bargaining power. Several other hospitals are backing its request, illustrating the broad concern. Dr. Lopez has hired a lawyer to fight his bill. Consumers in some states might have legal backup under balance-billing laws. But rules vary, often don’t apply to all types of insurance and may cover only emergency medical treatment costs. Tennessee’s law, which went into effect in July, requires hospitals to notify patients of estimated costs and that they could receive balance bills. After getting a balance bill, consumers should attempt to negotiate a reduced amount, said Wendy Netter Epstein, a health law professor at DePaul University College of Law. Online look-up tools like Healthcare Bluebook or Fair Health can provide estimates of average costs for procedures. Dr. Lopez said he offered to pay 20 percent of the disputed amount, but it has not — so far — been accepted. Baptist Memorial Hospital encourages patients to file appeals and, if a better offer is made by the insurer, “we accept it and dismiss the patient’s balance,” said David Elliott, vice president of managed care and chief executive of Baptist Health Services Group, in an emailed statement. Dr. Lopez has appealed twice to Cigna to cover more of the bill — without success. For now, his lawyer has written to the hospital, disputing that Dr. Lopez owes more than was already paid by the insurer. The letter said Dr. Lopez planned to avail himself of any protection under state or federal law. Kaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

2018,"Talal bin Abdulaziz, Reformist Saudi Prince, Is Dead at 87","Prince Talal bin Abdulaziz, a senior member of the Saudi royal family who supported women’s rights and once led a group of dissident princes, died on Saturday. He was 87. His death was announced by his son Prince Abdulaziz bin Talal on Twitter, and confirmed in a statement on Prince Talal’s website. Neither statement specified where he died or what the cause was. Prince Talal was an older brother of King Salman and the father of the billionaire businessman and investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. His father, King Abdulaziz, was the founder and first ruler of modern Saudi Arabia. His sons have ruled since his death in 1953, with the throne passing from brother to brother. Prince Talal served as minister of communications in the 1950s and minister of finance in the early ’60s. A tribute on his website credited him with opening the first private hospital in Riyadh in the 1950s and providing funds for free medical care there. In 1957, a time when girls had no access to formal education in Riyadh and schools were open only to boys, he founded the first school for girls there. Soon after he was appointed finance minister, he led a group of princes, known as the Free Princes Movement, which called for a constitutional monarchy that distributed some of the king’s powers. The group advocated the creation of a constitution to govern the kingdom, rather than rules based solely on clerical interpretation of the Quran and other religious doctrines. Prince Talal led the group from Beirut and from Cairo, which under President Gamal Abdel Nasser was an adversary of Riyadh. The prince’s assets were seized, but he was not stripped of his nationality, a punishment Gulf monarchies have employed against dissidents. After rifts emerged between Prince Talal and Egypt, he was allowed to return to Saudi Arabia in 1964 under King Faisal, who had deposed his brother King Saud that same year. Prince Talal served until 2011 as a member of the Allegiance Council, a body of senior princes designated to meet and choose the next king from among themselves. He had reportedly left the council after questioning its efficacy when a senior prince was appointed to the line of succession without the council being fully consulted. Complete information on survivors was not immediately available.",The New York Times
2018,"Taliban Appear Ready to Discuss Peace Talks, Except With Afghan Officials","KABUL, Afghanistan — Representatives from the Taliban, the United States and several Asian countries gathered in the United Arab Emirates on Monday for what officials cautiously described as important meetings that could lead to formal talks to end the 17-year war in Afghanistan. The optimism fostered by months of urgent American diplomacy was dampened by the Taliban’s apparent refusal to meet with a delegation of the Afghan government, although Afghan officials said late Monday that they had not given up hope that the two sides would talk. The Taliban said in a statement on Sunday that they would meet representatives of the United States as well as Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates. Those countries, American allies that have varying levels of influence over the Taliban, have been at the center of a Trump administration push to help shape the peace process. The Taliban said nothing on Sunday about meeting with the Afghan delegation, even though government negotiators also arrived for the talks, said Mujib Rahman Rahimi, a spokesman for the Afghan government. Afghan officials said late Monday that conversations to arrange a meeting were continuing. Senior officials met the other delegations and discussed the need for “direct engagement of the Afghan government with the Taliban,” said the Afghan national security adviser, Hamdullah Mohib. Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, said late Monday that Taliban representatives had “no plans to meet and will not meet with the representatives of the Kabul administration.” The Taliban have long refused to hold formal talks with the Afghan government. The militants have insisted on first brokering an agreement with the United States, which the group sees as the force that toppled their government in 2001. The group seems to have shown more flexibility in recent weeks after a series of meetings with Zalmay Khalilzad, the American envoy assigned to bring everyone to the table. Taliban representatives participated in a conference on Afghan peace hosted by Russia last month that was also attended by a delegation from the Afghan side. In addition to meeting the Taliban on several occasions, Mr. Khalilzad has been visiting countries in the region and trying to persuade them to push the insurgents to the table. Chief among them is Pakistan, where Taliban leaders have long taken sanctuary. The ability to keep bases in Pakistan has been an important factor in the group’s ability to withstand the military might of a broad international coalition, which at its peak included more than 130,000 troops. The Trump administration has increased its diplomatic and financial pressure on Pakistan, at a time when the country is struggling economically. Afghan officials said that Taliban leaders based in Pakistan were in the United Arab Emirates for talks — in addition to members of the Taliban political commission, who are based in Qatar — a sign that Pakistan may be pulling its levers. If formal talks begin, the peace process is expected to be a long and complicated process. After nearly two decades, the war has become increasingly complex and drawn in other regional players, including Russia and Iran. Previous efforts to start official peace talks have failed. In 2008, delegations arrived in Oslo, only for the Taliban to pull out at the last minute, citing attacks against members of the group in Pakistan. The Afghan government met with a Taliban delegation in 2015 in Pakistan. But the authority of the Taliban delegation was questioned, and that process came apart when news leaked that the Taliban leader Mullah Omar, on whose behalf the group said they had come, had been dead for three years.",The New York Times
2018,"Taliban Talks Covered Fate of U.S. Military Presence in Afghanistan, Envoy Says","KABUL, Afghanistan — In the most substantial formal talks so far with the Taliban, United States officials discussed the future of the American military presence in Afghanistan and an offer of a three-month cease-fire during which the insurgents and the Afghan government could have negotiations, a senior American diplomat said on Thursday. The diplomat, Zalmay Khalilzad, the Trump administration’s special representative in charge of the talks for Afghan reconciliation to end the 17-year war, briefed Afghan leaders in Kabul on two days of talks with the Taliban this week in the United Arab Emirates. The discussions included representatives from the U.A.E., the host country; Saudi Arabia; and Pakistan — the only three nations that recognized the Taliban regime before it was toppled by the American invasion in 2001 and that still have varying degrees of influence over the insurgent group. Mr. Khalilzad said in interviews with the Afghan TV channels ToloNews and Ariana that progress had been made in the talks even though Taliban representatives refused to meet with a delegation sent to the U.A.E. by the Afghan government. “Unfortunately, Taliban did not agree to meet with the Afghan delegation, and I think it was the wrong decision on their part and left a negative impression to the participating countries,” Mr. Khalilzad said. The Taliban have adhered strictly to their position not to meet with the Afghan government until it has reached agreements with the United States, which it sees as the main force behind denying them a return to power. For a long time, the Taliban have aimed to sort out with the Americans the future of the United States’ military presence and a timeline for its withdrawal, the fate of Taliban prisoners and the delisting of their leaders from sanctions before they agree to talks with the Afghan government. “They told us they want to talk to us first to address the security issues and then talk to the Afghan side to address the political matters,” Mr. Khalilzad said. The Arab participants in the talks proposed a three-month cease-fire during which all substantial issues would be discussed, Mr. Khalilzad said. The Taliban representatives said they would take the issue to their leaders as they did not have the authority to commit to such a step. Mr. Khalilzad said the Taliban’s red line in the recent talks remained an agreement over the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan. The United States, on the other hand, wants assurances that Afghanistan will not become a haven for terrorists who want to target the United States. The Taliban regime had hosted members of Al Qaeda, including its leader, Osama bin Laden, who was responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. “I said that if the menace of terrorism is tackled, the United States is not looking for a permanent military presence in Afghanistan,” Mr. Khalilzad told ToloNews. In recent months, American diplomats have been in a hurry to start negotiations for a political end to the Afghan war largely out of concern that President Trump, who has expressed dismay at the American presence in the country, was losing patience. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump overruled the advice of his military and civilian officials to order the withdrawal of American troops from the conflict in Syria. The Americans’ urgency has not gone down well with the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, whose administration fears it is being sidelined in talks by Mr. Khalilzad. The morning after Mr. Khalilzad briefed the Afghan leader, Mr. Ghani’s national security adviser, Hamdullah Mohib, wrote a series of messages on Twitter that many read as a reflection of the government’s displeasure with the American envoy’s efforts. “As a sovereign country, no other country or individual has the right or the authority to discuss new governance formulas or structures for Afghanistan, including political dispensations, which violate the Afghan constitution,” Mr. Mohib wrote. “The authority to make any decision about Afghanistan’s future lies with the Afghan people and their elected leaders. There is no substitute for an elected government. There will be no deal over the sacrifices of the Afghan people,” he added. Mr. Khalilzad, in response, said the talks in the U.A.E. had not discussed “any single thing about the future political settlement, like an interim administration in Afghanistan.” All those were issues that the Afghans needed to resolve among themselves, he said.",The New York Times
2018,Talking About Money Is Extremely Hard. Do It Anyway.,"Sketch Guy I recently sent out an email asking people on my mailing list for a simple “yes” or “no” response to the following question: Is it hard for you to talk about money with your spouse or partner? I got hundreds of replies. But buried in those replies was one that I found particularly difficult to read: “The answer is YES! It is hard, because it often feels defensive. She spent too much. He spent too much. Was that aligned with our values? What are our values? How come there isn’t more? And if only she would spend less, then I wouldn’t have to work so hard. :)” And now, drumroll please, the part of that message that made it so hard to read: “From, The Spouse.” In other words, my spouse. I have to admit that upon reading that, I was discouraged. There was even a part of me that felt a little bit like a fraud. Who am I to be talking to other people about money if my own wife feels this way? But I also need to admit that she’s right. It’s challenging for us to talk about money. It’s hard to talk to our parents about it. It’s hard to talk to our children about it. It’s hard to talk to our siblings, too. Whether we have more or less than average or than our close family members, any back-and-forth often feels defensive on both sides. And you know what? That’s O.K. This, my friends, is one of the keys to talking about money: knowing that it’s going to be hard. Sometimes, it’s going to be painful. And that’s O.K. My wife and I have been married for 23 years. She’s my best friend. We’ve had more fights about money than I’d care to admit. But we’re still married. And she’s still my best friend. And that’s the point. In spite of the difficulties we have talking about money, we’ve both agreed not to give up. Talking about money may not be necessary for all couples. I got one reply from someone who told me that she and her husband decided long ago not to talk about money. A decade into their marriage, he still has no idea how much she makes. If that works for you, great! More power to you. But I doubt that it is the case for the vast majority of you. My own experience is that talking about money is unavoidable. Like taking out the trash and doing the laundry, it’s just one of those things that has to happen. And if that rings true, then you really have just two options. You can end your relationship, in that way ending the fights about money. Or, you can keep trying. My advice is to keep trying. At some point, you’re going to have to have a conversation about money — with a spouse, a roommate, your kids, your aging parents — but did anyone ever teach you how to talk about money?",The New York Times
2018,Targets of U.S. Sanctions Hire Lobbyists With Trump Ties to Seek Relief,"WASHINGTON — On a July evening, Trump administration officials and allies, including the president’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, gathered with investors atop the Hay-Adams hotel overlooking the White House for a cocktail reception featuring a short presentation by the Democratic Republic of Congo’s special envoy to the United States. An invitation for the reception billed it as an opportunity to learn about “the role Africa plays in gaining access to critical minerals, such as cobalt” and to discuss “the strategic relationship” between the United States and the nations of Africa. In fact, the reception was part of an aggressive $8 million lobbying and public relations campaign that used lobbyists with ties to the Trump administration to try to ease concerns about the Congolese president, Joseph Kabila, whose government was facing threats of additional sanctions from the Trump administration for human rights abuses and corruption. The lavish cocktail party was one example of a lucrative and expanding niche within Washington’s influence industry. As President Trump’s administration has increasingly turned to sanctions, travel restrictions and tariffs to punish foreign governments as well as people and companies from abroad, targets of those measures have turned for assistance to Washington’s K Street corridor of law, lobbying and public relations firms. The work can carry reputational and legal risks, since clients often come with toxic baggage and the United States Treasury Department restricts transactions with entities under sanctions. As a result, it commands some of the biggest fees of any sector in the influence industry. And some of the biggest payments have been going to lobbyists, lawyers and consultants with connections to Mr. Trump or his administration. “People overseas often want to hear that you know so-and-so, and can make a call to solve their problem,” said Erich Ferrari, a leading Washington sanctions lawyer who said he has tried to disabuse prospective clients of such notions. It is a perception that matches up with the pay-to-play mind-set that defines politics in many parts of Africa, Asia, the Middle East and the former Soviet states. As politicians and executives from those regions have increasingly been targeted by sanctions, they have sought to apply that approach — backed by huge sums of cash — to navigating Washington, lobbyists and former government officials say. This has been encouraged, they say, by the willingness projected by Mr. Trump and his team to make deals around sanctions and tariffs exemptions. Previous administrations had worked to wall off politics from those processes, which are supposed to be overseen primarily by career officials and governed by strict legal analyses. In June, after a personal intervention by Mr. Trump, the Commerce Department rescinded sanctions that could have crippled the Chinese technology giant ZTE, which had fought the sanctions through an intense three-month lobbying push that cost $1.4 million. A $108,500-a-month lobbying campaign has helped delay the imposition of sanctions against an industrial conglomerate owned by the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. Among the leaders of the lobbying efforts for both ZTE and Mr. Deripaska’s companies was Bryan Lanza, a former Trump campaign aide who maintains close ties to administration officials. His firm, Mercury Public Affairs, has signed other clients facing punitive measures from the United States government, including the United States subsidiary of Hikvision, a company owned by the Chinese government. The company, according to lobbying filings, paid a Mercury team including Mr. Lanza a fee that started at $70,000 a month to lobby on the carrying out of a military-spending bill. The bill bars the United States government from purchasing video surveillance products made by a handful of Chinese companies, including Hikvision, ZTE and Huawei, whose chief financial officer was arrested in Canada at the request of the United States government, apparently on suspicion of violating sanctions against Iran. Sanctions targets who had not previously tried to win reprieve are sensing an opening. Viktor F. Yanukovych, the former president of Ukraine, who had sanctions levied against him in 2014, has discussed a push to win relief and refurbish his image with well-connected law and lobbying firms including Greenberg Traurig. Among the other Trump-linked lobbyists who have received big contracts from targets of sanctions and tariffs is Brian Ballard, a top fund-raiser for Mr. Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee. His firm signed a $125,000-a-month contract in August 2017 to represent the Turkish-state-owned bank Halkbank, which has been working to avoid punishment for its role in a billion-dollar scheme to evade sanctions on Iran. The representation brought Mr. Ballard into discussions with Mr. Giuliani, who represented a gold trader charged in the scheme. Then there is the lawyer Alan Dershowitz. His criticism of the special counsel’s investigation of Mr. Trump has endeared him to the president. But Mr. Dershowitz also has a long history of representing clients in transnational legal matters, including sanctions. Mr. Dershowitz is advising Dan Gertler, an Israeli billionaire who was the target of sanctions by Washington last year for using his connections to Mr. Kabila, the Congolese president, to facilitate what the Treasury Department called “opaque and corrupt mining and oil deals.” Mr. Dershowitz called Mr. Gertler “a very good person” who is “being targeted primarily because of the actions of other people.” While Mr. Trump has invited Mr. Dershowitz to the White House to discuss Middle East issues on multiple occasions, Mr. Dershowitz said he had not used his access to lobby on behalf of Mr. Gertler. “I would never raise an issue like this,” he said. Mr. Kabila’s government has stocked up on consultants who have cast themselves as able to broker access at the highest levels of the administration. It has paid $8 million to its security contractor, an Israeli firm called Mer Security and Communication Systems, to hire American lobbyists, according to lobbying filings. Mer paid $500,000 in April 2017 to Alston & Bird, the firm of former Senator Bob Dole. Mr. Dole’s team indicated that it could secure a meeting between Mr. Kabila and Mr. Trump, according to people familiar with the relationship. The meeting never happened, and Mer ended the subcontract in frustration. Mer proceeded to invest millions more in lobbying and public relations firms with lower profiles but closer ties to the Trump team. Lobbying filings show $360,000 paid by Mer to Adnan Jalil, a former congressional liaison for Mr. Trump’s campaign; $250,000 to the firm of Nancye Miller, the wife of the Trump campaign adviser and former C.I.A. chief R. James Woolsey Jr.; $680,000 to the firm of former Representative Robert L. Livingston, an early Trump endorser; and $598,000 to the firm of Brian Glicklich, who has represented Trump allies such as Breitbart News and Rush Limbaugh. Mer also agreed to pay $1.25 million to the firm of Robert Stryk, who had worked with Trump campaign officials, to organize the Hay-Adams event and meetings around it for Mr. Kabila’s special envoy to the United States. (Mr. Stryk’s firm, Sonoran Policy Group, also signed a $100,000-a-month contract in August to represent Somalia in its bid for increased military aid from the Trump administration and removal from its travel ban list. And Sonoran registered as a subcontractor for a law firm to lobby for a notorious Serbian arms dealer who was hit with sanctions for selling weapons to Liberia). At the time of the Congolese reception, the Trump administration and the international community were pressuring Mr. Kabila to step down, partly by intimating that his allies might face additional sanctions. Not only had he been accused of violent repression of dissent and looting millions, but he had overstayed the country’s constitutionally mandated term limits by nearly two years. The Congolese officials at the reception posed for photos with Mr. Giuliani, and afterward there was some confusion about his connection to the lobbying effort. Francois Balumuene, the Congolese ambassador to the United States, suggested in an interview in September that his country was working with Mr. Giuliani to figure out the administration’s position on an upcoming presidential election called by Mr. Kabila to avoid threatened sanctions. “What I know is that it is possible that Giuliani will let us know how to go ahead,” Mr. Balumuene said. He referred additional questions about Mr. Giuliani’s role to the country’s special envoy to Washington, Raymond Tshibanda, who could not be reached for comment. Mr. Giuliani said he was not serving as an intermediary between the Democratic Republic of Congo and the administration. In an interview in September, he initially said he stopped by the reception for a half-hour to “say hello to people” and to impress a woman with whom he had been dining by taking her “to the top of the Hay-Adams to see a Washington party” with a “great view.” But he later suggested that he attended at least partly because he was interested in exploring business opportunities, adding, “We’ve always wanted to see what’s Africa all about.” And someone familiar with Mr. Giuliani’s business affairs said that one of his companies has recently been negotiating a consulting deal to work in the Democratic Republic of Congo, possibly through Mer. In text messages on Sunday, Mr. Giuliani said that “if I do it, it would only be security consulting” similar to what he does in other countries, not lobbying. “Beyond that, I can’t say anything other than you can assume if we are working in a foreign country, we are doing security — physical and cyber, antiterrorism, emergency management.” It is not clear whether the lobbying overseen by Mer had much effect, and several of Mer’s subcontracts with Trump-linked lobbyists have expired. Less than a month after the Hay-Adams event, Mr. Kabila announced that he would not seek a third term in presidential elections scheduled for this month. While some Trump administration officials are concerned that the elections are being tilted in favor of Mr. Kabila’s chosen successor, the United States has not leveled additional sanctions against the country since Mr. Kabila’s announcement — an outcome some lobbyists on the account are privately claiming as a victory. In October, Mer signed a new $200,000 contract with a public relations firm called Sanitas International that was co-founded by Christopher Harvin, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign who had worked in President George W. Bush’s administration. The firm is seeking to demonstrate to the news media that Mr. Kabila does, in fact, intend to step down and hold free and fair elections.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Tax Breaks for Charity: Who Benefits?,"letters Should the tax law on donations be changed? Some say yes; others think that philanthropists may spend their money better than the government would. To the Editor: Re “When the Rich Give, We Pay,” by Aaron E. Carroll and Peter B. Bach (Op-Ed, Nov. 27): Let me get this straight. What the authors are saying is that every time donors in the top tax bracket give $100 million as a charitable contribution to a university or a hospital, they are really giving only $68 million, and the government is in effect picking up the difference. Like a two-to-one matching fund. So we taxpayers are forced to support cancer research and scholarships for needy students. How awful! We could be spending those tax dollars on something important like a border wall or more tax reductions for the wealthy. The tax code is written, in part, to incentivize certain behaviors. Lots of things may need fixing, but removing the incentive for charitable giving can’t be one of them. Lawrence KaplanArdsley, N.Y. To the Editor: Perhaps it is time to make a semantic distinction between charity and philanthropy. Charity is what most ordinary Americans give in order to help the less fortunate, or perhaps to help their house of worship. A tax deduction is the last thing on their minds when giving. By contrast philanthropy is what the megawealthy give in order to burnish their image, see their name chiseled in granite and glass, and, above all, enjoy a huge tax break. It would make sense, therefore, for tax breaks to be classified into three categories. For genuine charity, the compassionate sort, given quietly and without fanfare, there would be the full break. Larger gifts for real needs such as the operating costs of hospitals or school tuitions would get a break of lesser magnitude. Self-aggrandizing philanthropy for the construction of egotistic monuments — especially museums — would merit only a minimal tax break, if any. The narcotic high of seeing one’s name over a building in Harvard or a medical industry in New York should be sufficient compensation. J.J. GrossJerusalem To the Editor: I don’t understand the logic of critics of charitable tax breaks that we should be taxed on income we voluntarily elect not to keep for our own benefit but to give to a charity. John KeefeBrooklyn To the Editor: Aaron E. Carroll and Peter B. Bach argue that collective decision-making in how tax dollars are spent is morally superior to private decision-making by high-income individuals who give money away. I have a simple question for the gentlemen: Have you ever met any of the people who sit on congressional appropriations committees? I have. Once you watch them in action, it’s clear that giving them more tax money to waste is a bad idea. The federal appropriations process is hopelessly corrupt. The one thing that might help would be to reduce the size and scope of the federal government so that more spending decisions are made at the local level. The closer to home the decision-making, the greater the possibility of fiscal discipline. The average taxpayer knows there is no accountability for congressional decisions made thousands of miles away. John A. Charles Jr.Portland, Ore.The writer is president of the Cascade Policy Institute. To the Editor: Even though my wife and I have always aimed to donate 10 percent of our income to charitable causes, I recommend eliminating the tax deduction entirely for all charitable donations, as well as the tax deduction for residential mortgages. In fact, we should eliminate all itemized deductions for personal income tax filings. This would ultimately reduce the tax burden on individuals, but, even more important, it would finally yield that holy grail, a tax return the size of a postcard, thus freeing up an entire army of accountants to do real, productive work for the economy instead of extracting millions of dollars from taxpayers to help them file returns every year. Of course charitable organizations will fight this initially, but I believe that the elimination of the tax deduction will not keep people from giving. David LaurynChicago",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Taxing Carbon Emissions,"letter Senator Sheldon Whitehouse writes that “the savings from avoiding climate catastrophe are immense.” To the Editor: I must respectfully disagree with my friend John Barrasso’s Op-Ed article (“Cut Carbon Through Innovation, Not Regulation,” nytimes.com, Dec. 18). First, the referendum result in Washington State looked like more relentless campaigning by the fossil fuel industry against climate action; without that industry onslaught, the carbon tax referendum there would probably have passed. Second, a carbon tax is not “expensive,” except maybe for fossil fuel interests, as in our proposals all the money goes back to the public. In addition, taxing carbon moves energy markets toward cheaper renewables. On balance, people save money. On top of that, the savings from avoiding climate catastrophes are immense. If you really want to innovate, there has to be a cost to carbon pollution. Without that, where is the incentive to innovate? Today, fossil fuel enjoys a $700 billion-a-year subsidy in the United States, according to the International Monetary Fund. That subsidy warps the economy; it discourages innovation. We need to come together to solve this problem, not let the fossil fuel industry’s talking points lead us away from a meaningful solution because leading us astray suits its interests.

2018,Opinion | Taxpayers Always Lose Industry’s Shell Game With Jobs ,"G.M. is the latest example of a company getting incentives based on empty promises. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. When General Motors announced that it was idling five plants in the United States and Canada last week, there was shock in two American cities. One was Warren, Ohio, where G.M. builds the Chevrolet Cruze at its Lordstown assembly plant. Folks in the industrial heartland are no strangers to this kind of betrayal. But after forking over $60 million in state and local incentives in the last decade, they believed they had done enough to get G.M. to maintain Lordstown, which has built 16.3 million vehicles since 1966. The other shocked town was Washington, D.C., where President Trump learned that thousands of the manufacturing jobs he had promised — a promise that had helped him win the state of Ohio in 2016 — were being killed. Mr. Trump reminded G.M.’s chief executive, Mary Barra, that the federal government had propped up the company to the tune of $50 billion in loans and other assistance during the Great Recession. He told her to shut a factory in China and move the work to Ohio. Ms. Barra made it clear that G.M. has to operate on behalf of G.M. shareholders, not Mr. Trump. The company has excess manufacturing capacity — sales of sedans like the Cruze and the Impala are falling — and it has to invest in autonomous cars and other technologies. Somewhere else. Federal, state and local governments have gotten into the habit of providing corporations with incentives to move, incentives to stay, bailouts to stave off failure and tax benefits to build on success and create more jobs. All are based on promises about job creation and economic development that more often than not prove hollow. The Republicans promised that last year’s tax cut would prompt investment that creates jobs — G.M. got a $157 million tax bonus through its third quarter — but corporations have also used that money to cover the expenses of closing plants. (So far this year, companies in the United States have cut about a half million jobs, 28 percent more than at the same time last year.) Corporate incentives tripled between 1990 and 2015, according to the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. The trend seemed to slow a bit after that, but then Nevada changed the game, plunking down $1 billion for Tesla’s battery plant. Wisconsin topped it with a $4 billion offer for a Foxconn plant. This year Virginia and New York rang up $6 billion for Amazon’s benefit. “There is now a new normal,” says Amy Liu, vice president and director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at Brookings Institution, “among Tesla, Foxconn and Amazon, we are breaking the billion dollar bank for the first time.” By paying incentives, governors, mayors and other politicians feel they’re “winning” jobs from competitors. As New York City mayor, Bill DeBlasio, put it, at the end of the day, 25,000 jobs are going somewhere. Why shouldn’t the city have them? The Foxconn deal might hold part of the answer to that question. Foxconn, an Apple components supplier, plans to build an electronics plant south of Milwaukee that would employ 13,000 people. But its incentive agreement works out to an astonishing $230,000 per job, which defies a reasonable return on investment. The auto companies are particularly good at the incentives game because they can offer relatively high-paying manufacturing jobs that don’t require four-year college degrees. Remember that G.M. pioneered the auction approach in 1985 when it ran a national beauty contest for a site to produce its new Saturn brand cars. Spring Hill, Tenn., was the winner, and agreed to cough up decades of tax revenues. The United Autoworkers agreed to reduced wages. (“Today’s Jobs at Yesterday’s Wages,” declaimed one headline.) Saturn production died in the downturn, and Spring Hill’s manufacturing lines were closed in 2009. They reopened in 2012 after, yes, more concessions from Tennessee. To be continued? For a corporation looking to move, site selection specialists are good at identifying multiple locations that can meet their needs. Amazon’s search for a second headquarters sent economic development agencies around the country into peak insanity. The reality, though, Ms. Liu said, is that most job creation comes from the expansion of existing companies and from start-ups, not by luring companies from other locations. Still, the game goes on. In 2015, the conglomerate Honeywell got a $40 million, 10-year tax credit from New Jersey (Chris Christie, proprietor) to induce it to remain based in Morris Plains, N.J. But Honeywell will soon be based instead in Charlotte, N.C. — after getting $46 million to grease the move south, plus added incentives that could amount to as much as $16,000 per job. North Carolina is so hungry for corporate headquarters that its legislature passed a bill that directly underwrites Honeywell’s move. Honeywell, which says it will keep enough jobs in New Jersey to continue qualifying for the credit, is also moving jobs to Charlotte from South Carolina, which had used incentives in the past to grab them from other states. In leaving metropolitan New York for Charlotte, Honeywell cited the ability to recruit talent, which is, oddly enough, the same reason Amazon cited to choose metropolitan New York, in the form of Queens, for its HQ2. That, and as much as $3 billion in incentives. In announcing the move, Honeywell’s chief executive, Darius Adamczyk, tried to smooth any ruffled feathers in the Garden State, saying his decision “does not reflect any issues with the quality of our experience in New Jersey … New Jersey will remain a substantial employment center for us.” Of course it will, until a better offer comes along. And that’s exactly the problem with our corporate welfare system. Companies like G.M. know that if they dangle a new plant like a piece of meat — perhaps the one that will make autonomous vehicles — the political and economic development dogs will come running. And they will always find lawmakers ready to provide tax breaks with a wispy hope that they will make everyone’s life better. Like G.M., they’ll behave as if the Lordstown plant never existed. And soon, it might not. Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram. An earlier version of this editorial, referred inaccurately to an incentive New Jersey gave to Honeywell.

2018,Taylor Swift Said to Use Facial Recognition to Identify Stalkers,"When Taylor Swift played the Rose Bowl in May, a kiosk was set up for adoring fans to view videos of her. But there may have been more to that screen than met the eye. According to an interview in Rolling Stone, the kiosk took photos of people looking at the videos. The images were sent back to a “command post” in Nashville where they were cross-referenced, using facial recognition technology, with a database of people who had been identified as potential stalkers of the pop star. The use of facial recognition was revealed by Mike Downing, the chief security officer of Oak View Group, an entertainment company, who told Rolling Stone that he observed the technology firsthand as a guest of the company that designed the kiosks. “Everybody who went by would stop and stare at it, and the software would start working,” Downing told Rolling Stone. Facial recognition is proliferating both as a technology to help law enforcement identify criminals and as a convenient feature to help consumers unlock their phones, among other functions. Its use is also growing in the entertainment realm: Madison Square Garden is among the venues employing it. The Swift security team’s reported use of facial recognition, however, could represent a new tactic: luring people to step in front of the camera, rather than just scanning a crowd or waiting for fans to pass by. It was not clear which company designed the kiosk, whether it was used at other concerts, whether any potential stalkers were identified and, if so, what was done about them. The Oak View Group and Swift’s representatives did not respond to requests for comment. Only a couple of states have laws restricting the use of facial recognition, and California is not among them. Nonetheless, many civil liberties advocates consider it to be among the most invasive surveillance technologies because it can be used to recognize people at a distance without their knowledge or permission, curtailing their ability to go about their business anonymously in public. “Obviously, stalking of celebrities is a real problem,” Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst for the American Civil Liberties Union, said in an interview. “This is a somewhat sympathetic deployment of the technology, but nonetheless, there are a number of concerns about where this goes.” Microsoft has called on Congress to regulate facial recognition. In a blog post on Dec. 6, Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, went further, saying that such a law should require companies to “place conspicuous notice” where the technology is being used. That way people who don’t want to be subjected to facial recognition might avoid it. Earlier this year, civil rights groups, led by the A.C.L.U., asked Amazon to stop selling its image recognition technology, called Rekognition, to law enforcement agencies. Amazon employees later sent a letter to Jeff Bezos, the company’s chief executive, with similar demands. Amazon has said there have been no reports of law enforcement abuse of the company’s facial technology and that the technology had been used for beneficial purposes, such as reuniting missing children with their families. (The New York Times used Amazon’s services earlier this year to help identify attendees at the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.) Swift has had several documented instances of stalkers. Just this month, Roger Alvarado agreed to a plea deal that included six months’ imprisonment in connection with a break-in at Swift’s New York City townhouse. The police said he had been asleep in her bed. In 2014, Swift discussed her need for a security detail in an interview with Esquire. She spoke of “the sheer number of men we have in a file who have showed up at my house, showed up at my mom’s house, threatened to either kill me, kidnap me, or marry me.” “This is the strange and sad part of my life that I try not to think about,” she said. “I try to be lighthearted about it, because I don’t ever want to be scared. I don’t want to be walking down the street scared. And when I have security, I don’t have to be scared.”",The New York Times
2018,Taylor Swift? Cardi B? The 2019 Grammy Nominations’ Snubs and Surprises,"Like most major awards shows, the Grammys in recent years has attempted a precarious balancing act: maintaining its status as the music establishment’s kingmaker — and live CBS concert event — while also trying to confront the reality of its staid, overwhelmingly white and male history. [Kendrick Lamar leads nominees and women dominate major categories: see the full story.] The leading nominees in 2019, like those from this year, come from hip-hop — namely Kendrick Lamar, Drake and Childish Gambino — but they are joined by a handful of women from multiple genres, many of them newcomers to this particular party. That doesn’t seem like an accident: After tensions came to a boil after the ceremony in January, the Recording Academy said it actively sought younger voters and empowered a task force focused on diversity and inclusion. Here to discuss the new crop of nominees and what it might mean for the show in February is The New York Times pop music team: the chief pop critic Jon Pareles, the pop critic Jon Caramanica, the music editor Caryn Ganz and the pop reporter Joe Coscarelli. PARELES Let’s start with a caveat: Having the most nominations does not guarantee wins. It’s more a measure of how many categories someone can qualify for — and in the era of “featuring,” that favors guest rappers and hook singers who can show up in multiple spots. COSCARELLI It’s true — Drake’s seven nominations come in five categories, so he’s competing against himself (with “God’s Plan”) as a featured artist on Travis Scott’s “Sicko Mode” for two rap trophies. PARELES This year, the Grammys made a major defensive move: They expanded the nominations in top categories from five to eight, so there’s wider representation among the nominees; the Oscars tried the same strategy. But the additional choices may end up splitting the vote in those main categories, where genres are pitted against one another. Hip-hop fans will be divided among Kendrick Lamar, Drake, Childish Gambino and Cardi B for record of the year, while ballad and movie-theme lovers — more typical Grammy voters — can unite behind Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper for “Shallow.” Diversity initiatives are a start, but will mere nominations appease anyone? COSCARELLI And will Drake even show up? He’s been nominated more than 40 times in his career, but won only three times and has not made quote-unquote Grammy Moments a part of his legacy. He hasn’t even attended the last two years, and openly mocked the show for awarding “Hotline Bling” — a song with no rapping — the best rap song trophy. Kendrick, on the other hand, has been a fixture on the Grammys stage, despite losing album of the year three times. Is this finally his year — for curating a soundtrack! — like those “we’re sorry” Oscars for Al Pacino and Martin Scorsese? How many times will rappers keep playing this game if they continue to lose in the big four categories despite keeping the music industry afloat with their streaming success? [See the list of nominees.] CARAMANICA Here is the problem, as it may unfold: Those who helped finalize the nominations had an eye toward making the big categories as fair and open-eared as possible. That means acknowledging hip-hop’s primacy as a cultural force, and also its indisputable popularity. But when these nominations are subjected to the entire pool of Grammy voters, many of whom hail from different generations with different aesthetic values, they might skip right past Drake and Kendrick — among the most meaningful artists of this decade — in favor of something a little more relatable. So if Kacey Musgraves or Brandi Carlile walk away with the album of the year trophy, you’ll understand the primary reason. And if some of the most famous figures in hip-hop refuse to come and keep smiles on their faces while they are summarily marginalized, you’ll understand that, too. COSCARELLI Let’s talk snubs. The obvious one is Taylor Swift, who despite being a Grammys darling, landed only one genre-category nomination for “Reputation” after the album’s lead single, “Look What You Made Me Do,” was similarly minimized last year. Did she get Ed Sheeran-ed — that is, left out of the major categories, like some figured Sheeran did last time, because the Grammys were too afraid that they’d have to answer for it if the voters just went ahead and picked her again over an artist of color? CARAMANICA That’s totally plausible, but given Taylor Swift’s place as one of the most significant and also popular musicians of the past decade, it’s a little surprising to arrive at a point in which she has been underrated, and also unacknowledged. But here we are: “Reputation,” which came out last November, is an excellent pop album, but also Swift’s least successful. Her stylistic jolt to an aggressive pop sheen was perceived as too sudden, and the album, by her standards, is a dud — certified only three times platinum. And here in the Grammy conversation, she was effectively ignored; nominated for best pop vocal album, and nothing else. GANZ I suspect the Grammys will regret the Taylor snub. She’s a reliable creator of awards-show content: reaction shots in the crowd, big performance numbers, memes. If she can encourage people to register to vote, she can lure people to watch an awards show with increasingly dwindling ratings. COSCARELLI Pop vocal album is basically a Top 40 graveyard, seemingly where the Grammys put all the big pop acts that may have once made it to the album of the year pile: Ariana Grande (“Sweetener”), Camila Cabello (“Camila”), Shawn Mendes (self-titled), Pink (“Beautiful Trauma”) and Kelly Clarkson (“Meaning of Life”). Others who were openly gunning for an album of the year nomination, like Travis Scott, also ended up only in genre awards, while old-school Grammy shoo-ins like Paul McCartney and U2 were shut out entirely. (Kanye West, meanwhile, is only in the producer of the year category, despite being ubiquitous for a large portion of this exhausting year.) Is this an actual sea change moment in terms of who gets nominated where? [Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder.] PARELES Actually, I think the producer nomination is the right slot for West. His own “Ye” was only seven songs long and didn’t feel like an album, while the producer nomination recognizes that whole batch of seven-song releases: ”Ye,” Pusha-T, Kids See Ghosts, Teyana Taylor. The nomination admits that as a producer, West still knows how to slice up and stack up samples to make songs move forward. Yet it doesn’t reward his own rapping or, by extension, his other public antics. But the snubs in the rock categories, which have often been a soft place to land for longtime, brand-name guitar bands, suggest either that the Grammys are trying to slough off their elder-generation image or that there’s so little interest in the rock categories that blocs can stuff the ballot box. When Ghost and Greta Van Fleet can outpoll U2 in best rock album, or Fever 333 — who? — can grab a best rock song nomination, something is afoot. GANZ The rock categories have been the scene of egregious weirdness for too many years to count now — remember Highly Suspect? But you’re right, Jon, and this is the first year in recent memory that the show doesn’t have a major legacy artist seemingly lined up to perform. (Should we start worrying about the Aretha Franklin tribute?) COSCARELLI The biggest shock nominations, which will have a lot of people Googling today, are right there at the top: six nominations, including album, record and song, for the folk singer Brandi Carlile (who had just one prior nomination) and five for H.E.R., who put out a pretty modest R&B debut. Carlile had the producer Dave Cobb in her corner, and he’s Grammys bait, but where did these come from? PARELES Well, it’s easy to see where Brandi Carlile came from. She’s more Americana or alt-country than folk, she’s got a gorgeous voice, she has built an extremely loyal following over multiple albums (including Barack Obama) and she writes songs (with her band members) that can pull people’s heartstrings. If the TV show treats her right in performance, she could gather a lot of new fans. For me, her latest album was slightly heavy-handed, but I’m not a Grammy voter. “The Joke,” her song that got nominated, is a consoling piano ballad about how people who have been scorned and left out will prevail as they persevere, and it’s got as big an emotional crescendo as an Adele song. She remade another song on her album, “Party of One” — a truly tortured longterm-relationship ballad — as a duet with Sam Smith. Those are the kinds of songs the Grammys have always favored. CARAMANICA Can I just interrupt to iterate that it is completely within the realm of possibility that more people will vote for Carlile than for Drake, or Cardi B, or several other more famous artists. And now that I have taken a moment to listen to Carlile’s album, I can confirm that would be a mistake. COSCARELLI As far as gender goes, things definitely look better than last year, when Lorde and Alessia Cara were pretty much all alone at the top and Bruno Mars swept the big awards. But more than how many women were nominated — and I do think we deserve an acceptance speech from Cardi B, who has five nods — I think the Grammys really ducked a disaster by not giving any posthumous nominations to XXXTentacion. It had already been reported that he, along with Post Malone and Cardi B, would not be eligible for best new artist because of the music they’d released before the eligibility period — which leaves a pretty bizarre category — but his album “?”, which hit No. 1 and had the No. 1 single “Sad!,” could’ve ended up in other categories, raising the specter of his abuse allegations. Obviously the Grammys doesn’t need any more PR headaches, but are we surprised he was shut out, given the way the BET Awards and American Music Awards feted him anyway? PARELES It does seem the Grammys were being risk-averse. The best new artist category very deliberately fudges the eligibility period, because so many acts now have a string of online or indie releases long before radio or Grammy voters know they exist. The mush-mouthed official language is “if their eligibility year release/s achieved a breakthrough into the public consciousness,” whatever that is. (Bon Iver won in 2012, four years after he released his million-selling debut album.) So the idea that XXXTentacion wasn’t eligible is dubious. But besides not wanting to condone XXXTentacion’s behavior, the Grammys may also have considered that he could not appear on the show. COSCARELLI When we get into the smaller categories, that’s where things get really wacky, as usual. CARAMANICA Another year, another inexplicable cleaving of R&B into essence-less subcategories that are then rendered even less meaningful by a seemingly random distribution of nominees within them. In best urban contemporary album, there is “Everything Is Love” by the Carters, Jay-Z and Beyonce’s first collaborative album, and strictly speaking, more hip-hop than R&B (which only matters because the category is limited to albums “containing at least 51% playing time of newly recorded contemporary vocal tracks derivative of R&B”). PARELES The Grammys are really flummoxed by Latin music. Best Latin rock, urban or alternative album is a desperate catchall category that still manages to completely ignore a Latin and global phenomenon that became inescapable in 2017 with “Despacito”: reggaeton-flavored songs that dance past the language barrier. Even if they can somehow resist the groove, the Grammys should have been paying attention to the tens of millions of streams for the many offspring of “Despacito” — and to eligible 2018 albums by Ozuna and J Balvin. The Grammys did notice Balvin (and Bad Bunny) by nominating them with Cardi B on “I Like It,” but that’s no compensation. CARAMANICA I can’t help but think, if boycotts are in order, this easily avoidable situation would make for a more than valid one. PARELES Joe, I want to see that Cardi B acceptance speech as much as you do, but I fully expect song and record of the year to belong to “Shallow.” It’s not only a ballad and a song from a movie soundtrack — the Grammys like those — but it’s also a song from a movie about the music business itself, with big-screen images and sympathetic characters for Grammy voters to remember. Lady Gaga is a familiar name and a familiar (and boffo) Grammy show performer. To me that win seems inevitable, which could raise one more question: How could best new artist possibly omit Bradley Cooper?",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Teaching Children Regardless of Grade,"Fixes Educators in a remote valley in India devised a community approach to instructing students when teachers were sparse. It’s catching on. Ms. Dharssi is a journalist who reports on global development, sustainability and immigration. One day at the beginning of the 2017-2018 school year in the rural Rishi Valley region of Andhra Pradesh, India, two dozen children in Grades 1 through 5 gathered quietly around four tables on colorful mats on the floor of their one-room school, working with books and worn laminated materials. Few looked up when I walked in. Their school has no chairs and is more than three hours from Bangalore, the closest major city. But the students were working with learning aids so effective that by now they’ve been adopted by more than 250,000 schools across India and in more than a dozen countries, including Kenya, Nepal and Sri Lanka. The common problem they address is one of the thorniest in education: teaching in primary schools where one teacher instructs children at multiple grade levels at once. The issue contributes to what Unesco called a “global learning crisis” in 2014, when it found that 130 million children couldn’t do basic math or read, even after four years in school. Recent data indicates the crisis is even more grim, according to Manos Antoninis, director of the Global Education Monitoring report at Unesco. But experts, including Mr. Antoninis, say that Rishi Valley’s pedagogy, which lets children study at their own pace, offers a solution to the problem. The approach has also been found to be useful in wealthier countries like Britain and Germany, and is applicable in countries like the United States, where teachers often manage large classes of students who have varied levels of understanding even within the same grade. “This methodology addresses the last child in the classroom, even the last child who is a disruptive child, who is a slow learner, who is a regular absentee,” explained Rama Anumula, an educator who created the approach with her husband, Padmanabha Rao. In the Rishi Valley school when I visited, students in different grades were studying Telugu, the local language, side by side. At one table, a teacher helped six students, including a 5-year-old girl learning the alphabet with foam letters and a girl in fourth grade reading a song about diversity in India. At another table, a boy in first grade helped a girl learn the word for “muddy road.” Nearby, two fourth graders took turns rolling dice in a game with words they recently learned. At their school, the students work through the curriculum with hands-on activities they complete independently, as well as with teachers and peers. One decade after the approach was adopted in schools run by the Rishi Valley Rural Education Center, dropout rates were 30 percent lower than in nearby public schools, while student achievement in reading and math was up to 40 percent higher, according to the center. Now, Ms. Anumula and Mr. Rao, who lead the Rishi Valley Institute for Educational Resources, work with Unicef, nongovernmental organizations and governments to spread their pedagogy. The pair’s approach is based on the idea that traditional lecturing at children seated in rows and divided by ability or grade isn’t effective. That was their conclusion when they moved to the countryside to pursue farming after earning postgraduate degrees in English in the 1980s. In the rural area, Ms. Anumula met child laborers who had dropped out of school, yet yearned to be able to read the hefty novels she carried. Clearly, they were highly motivated. But when Ms. Anumula and Mr. Rao spoke with villagers, they heard complaints that local children couldn’t do basic math after years in school. When they visited rural public schools, they saw an unworkable system: lone teachers lecturing students across multiple grade levels in turn, plowing through textbooks even as few students understood the material. The problem is widespread. Millions of students are in multigrade classrooms worldwide, especially in developing countries, but teachers rarely receive training to manage such classrooms and policymakers neglect the problem, said Angela Little, a professor emeritus at University College London with expertise in multigrade education. But Ms. Anumula and Mr. Rao saw opportunities to harness the natural drive and helpfulness of children by breaking down the ranked-by-grade learning in favor of a community approach. “It’s like a family environment,” said Mr. Rao. “Older and younger children together, they can learn many things helping each other.” In 1987, the couple began testing alternatives at the Rishi Valley Rural Education Center, which runs schools for children from villages that surround a renowned boarding school. Ms. Anumula and Mr. Rao worked with teachers to parse the required curriculum around hands-on activities. They refined them by watching to see what excited students and teachers, and tossing out what didn’t work. In 1993, they published a model of their system, which replaces textbooks with activity cards. It’s called multigrade multilevel learning, or activity-based learning. The method is meant to let students study at their own pace. They work through the curriculum by following subject-specific “learning ladders” that outline lessons with various levels of support from the teacher. Each rung of the ladder represents a learning milestone; the cards outline activities that introduce the student to a new concept, give him or her a chance to practice it and evaluate his or her understanding of it, along with possibilities for enrichment and remediation. To help children relate to concepts, activities incorporate local dialects, folklore and natural materials from the local environment. The curriculum also incorporates community festivals and group activities like singing and puppetry. Students typically begin learning milestones at a table for teacher-supported work, where the teacher introduces the concept. Students follow the ladder to identify their next activity and then move through other tables to do work that is either teacher-supported, peer-supported, partly teacher-supported or independent. Teachers track student progress and adjust tasks as needed. This way, the process engages learners who differ in natural quickness, prior knowledge and time to study. Child laborers, who frequently miss school for work, can pick up where they left off. The method allows for a “personalized education that one usually associates with very developed economies” and “makes that affordable for low-resource environments,” said Fabio Segura, head of international programs at the Jacobs Foundation, a Swiss nonprofit organization focused on improving child and youth development worldwide. Starting in 2015, the foundation considered more than 3,600 models to improve education in Ivory Coast’s cocoa-growing communities. Rishi Valley’s model is one of 12 the foundation is testing, with assistance from cocoa companies and the government, Mr. Segura said. In Germany, about 150 schools use the method, according to Ulrike Lichtinger, a professor at Vorarlberg Teaching University in Austria. She spreads the approach with educators like Thomas Müller, professor of special education at Julius Maximilian University in Würzburg, Germany. When he introduced it at a school for children with emotional and behavioral problems where he was headmaster, students became more attentive and behavioral problems dropped “nearly to zero,” he said. The approach gives students greater control over learning than conventional classrooms, said Kathrin Trimborn, a German teacher who studied the method for her doctorate and works with students with emotional and behavioral problems. “Working with the learning ladder, they always know, ‘O.K., I’m here and I have to do —- for the next week —- this, this, this. So many steps.,’” she said. “But they see how they improve and that’s what’s really, really motivating for them.” Nevertheless, the way this teaching method overturns classroom and teaching norms has inhibited its spread in some places. In India, the pedagogy runs into a “chalk-and-talk” culture in which teachers stand in front of a class, lecturing from textbooks, and evaluate students based on memorization, said Venu Thane, coordinator at the Rishi Valley’s educational resource institution. Changing that culture will take more than new teaching models. In fact, less than a third of primary classrooms in seven Indian states that used the method did so faithfully, according to a 2015 Unicef study. The problem was that most teachers were poorly trained or didn’t understand the model. Others didn’t take it seriously, which means they didn’t appreciate how it could enhance their teaching. Some schools reverted to textbooks instead of activity cards, or didn’t adapt activities to make lessons relevant for their students. The findings underscore what Mr. Rao describes as the biggest challenge to using the model to improve education, “dilution.” What’s needed is political backing, buy-in from teachers and long-term support for teachers, he added. That was the lesson from Tamil Nadu, a southern Indian state, Mr. Rao said. In 2003, Chennai, the state capital, introduced the method to 264 public schools with help from the Rishi Valley’s institute. Based on results, many families pulled their children out of private schools and put them in public schools, a reversal of the usual trend. In 2007, Chennai’s commissioner, M. P. Vijayakumar, was given the job of extending the approach to the state’s 37,500 public schools. Within a year, average academic achievement in math, English and Tamil language classes increased by as much as 29 percent, according to a government-commissioned evaluation. But Tamil Nadu’s success waned after Mr. Vijayakumar, a dedicated civil servant who gave his mobile number to thousands of teachers, retired the following year. According to Unicef’s 2015 study, many local teachers still didn’t understand the model well. Such setbacks are to be expected, Mr. Vijayakumar said, noting that teachers have lectured at children in rows for centuries. Reform, he said, is not magic. “Changing the mind-set of so many teachers and so many parents and millions and millions of children, it takes time,” he said. Even so, the approach is having a notable impact. Children in Indian states that use it performed “significantly better” on a national survey of learning achievements last year, said Begur Ramachandra Rao, an education specialist at Unicef India, in an email. The Rishi Valley institute is now more deliberate about assuring that the model is adopted rigorously. The institute prefers contracts of three years or more so it can adequately support teachers and troubleshoot, Padmanabha Rao explained. This is a departure from a previous model, in which the institute helped with curricular adaptation and initial teacher trainings before moving on. The institution is also incorporating technology into the method with support from the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation and the World Economic Forum. The institute has developed digital training guides, including videos, to help officials and teachers understand it. Last year, the institute also added activities involving tablets to the method in government schools in Andhra Pradesh. Students’ results are uploaded to a database where officials can pinpoint which schools need more support, Mr. Rao said. After working to improve education for three decades, Ms. Anumula and Mr. Rao are committed to continuing the trial and error process. They’re driven by a singular goal. “Let children really enjoy childhood,” Mr. Rao said.

2018,"Tear Gas Still Lingering, France’s President Will Address the Nation","PARIS — With the smell of tear gas and smoke still lingering in Paris and other cities after a fourth weekend of protests, France’s president planned a nationwide address on Monday to respond to the anger among many middle-class and working-poor citizens frustrated over their declining economic means. The televised speech by President Emmanuel Macron, announced by the Élysée Palace on Sunday, will be his first substantive public answer to the so-called Yellow Vest movement that has transfixed France and spilled into other countries in Europe. Mr. Macron has been conferring with advisers and ministers and will meet with a wider group on Monday, including local elected officials, members of Parliament and union representatives, to discuss proposals aimed at addressing at least some of the movement’s demands. “Clearly we have underestimated the need of our fellow citizens to speak up about the difficulties they face and to be involved in the formulation of solutions,” Benjamin Griveaux, a government spokesman, said in an interview Sunday on Europe 1 Radio. “The solutions that we need to find must take into consideration each person’s reality — it’s almost like tailored to fit,” he said. “The anger that is being expressed is sometimes very different from one area to another.” The Yellow Vests take their name from the fluorescent hazard vests adopted by the protesters as a sign of their economic distress. The challenges Mr. Macron will face in speaking to his fellow citizens are considerable. He must connect with the many who feel abandoned and make clear not only that he understands their anger but also that he is prepared to listen to their ideas and take action, analysts said. At the same time, he must project strong resolve against the destruction of private property to preserve the allegiance of the small-business owners who have seen their shops vandalized or who have been forced to close on successive Saturdays. Mr. Macron must also stand with the many French who have been outraged by the desecration of national monuments, or who have seen their cars burned or other property destroyed. With fires lit by protesters still smoldering in some of France’s largest cities on Sunday, local officials and small businesses voiced their dismay over the vandalism and lost business during the usually busy Christmas season. Although the authorities released numbers suggesting that the protests on Saturday were smaller than those on earlier weekends, the final total showed that there was no difference between those on Saturday and those a week earlier, suggesting they were not abating. The mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Juppé, who has been generally supportive of Mr. Macron, summed up the messages he hoped the president would send on Monday as he walked through his city. Fires burned there for several hours on Saturday as violent confrontations between the police and the Yellow Vests punctuated the protests. Mr. Macron needs to “speak to the French people and speak quickly,” said Mr. Juppé. The president, he said, needs “to respond concretely to certain legitimate expectations” with “understanding, empathy.” But Mr. Juppé said Mr. Macron also had to project firmness and speak with “authority” about the need to maintain order and stop the vandals. Mr. Macron’s address will be the first time in about 10 days that he has said anything beyond a short statement at a news conference in Buenos Aires at the end of the G-20 meeting. That statement came just a few hours after attacks on the Arc de Triomphe by Yellow Vests and vandals, known as “casseurs.” They defaced it with graffiti and broke into its museum. Then they smashed shop windows on a nearby avenue, stealing goods and destroying bank machines. This past weekend’s violence was notable both for its spread to a couple of neighborhoods of Paris that had been less affected in past weeks and by unprecedented violence in Bordeaux, where protesters and casseurs set multiple street fires and besieged one of its oldest shopping streets. If the Yellow Vests movement’s ability to bring business to a halt appears unchanged, so does its standing with the public nationwide. Although relatively small numbers of people go into the streets — France has a population of 67 million and the most that have turned out to protest is less than 300,000 — support for their grievances remains at about 70 percent, despite the violence and destruction of property, according to several different polls. The movement’s persistence suggests that despite the government’s announcement that it would drop a planned increase in the fuel tax in 2019 and delay an increase in the cost of home heating until after the winter, the protesters and those who support them may not be appeased without a deeper look at the distribution of wealth in France. The main difference between the protests this weekend and those on the last one was an increase in the police presence and a more aggressive strategy by the authorities. That meant there were many more arrests, some even before the demonstrations began. Nearly 2,000 people were taken into custody nationwide, almost three times as many as on Dec. 1, when 682 were arrested. The numbers of injured this past Saturday were fewer than on Dec. 1. A total of 325 people were hurt, including police officers, compared with a total of 485 the preceding week, according to revised figures from the Interior Ministry.",The New York Times
2018,Tech Stocks Often Rise and Fall Together. They Shouldn’t.,"Strategies The stock market often acts as though tech stocks were members of a close-knit family that must always travel together. Tech stocks, as a group, drove the stock market higher in the first part of 2018, and led the entire market lower this autumn, or so it is frequently said. I’ve lumped tech stocks together this way myself in describing market action recently and as far back as the early 2000s. Talking about tech as if it were a monolith isn’t entirely wrong. Tech stocks often do move in a pack — mainly because investors frequently treat them as a cohesive entity. But when it comes to assessing what individual companies are really worth, treating tech stocks as a homogeneous group is a major mistake, says Aswath Damodaran, a New York University finance professor. It is a form of sloppy thinking that leads to wacky share valuations and an inefficient and vulnerable market. As he has written in his provocative blog, the differences between tech companies tend to be more important than the similarities. Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google were joined together under the acronym Faang when they accounted for much of the market’s rise. But they are not remotely the same in organization, focus or business model, nor are older companies like Microsoft, IBM, Intel, HP and Cisco. “What we call ‘tech companies’ really includes a broad range of companies that are at different stages of maturity,” Professor Damodaran said in an interview. “The aging process for tech companies — which usually start out as high-growth companies — is very rapid. “Also, some companies are more tech at their core. Some are less tech,” he added. “We should be looking at companies along a kind of a spectrum, along at least two dimensions.” The problem, then, is twofold. ■ First, Professor Damodaran said, “tech companies live in dog years.” They have accelerated life cycles and behave differently as children and mature adults. A young money-burning company like Tesla and an old cash-generating company like IBM need to be evaluated with different metrics. ■ Second, tech has become ubiquitous. “Nearly all big companies today are tech companies, at least to some degree,” he said. In late 2018, simply using advanced technology isn’t a distinguishing characteristic. Even the newspaper industry — which used linotype machines and pneumatic tubes when I started as a copy boy in the 20th century — has a lot in common with tech companies. Like Netflix and Spotify, for example, The New York Times and The Washington Post use streaming technology and data analysis to feed information and entertainment to growing armies of digital subscribers. “On the day that, say, 60 percent of profits and revenues come from digital sources, do we reclassify these companies as tech companies?” Professor Damodaran asked. Similarly, he compared Tesla, which makes electric cars and is widely viewed as a tech company, with Ford and General Motors. Should Ford and G.M. be categorized as tech companies, too, when the bulk of their revenue eventually derives from electric vehicles? He is not suggesting that every company will need to be called a tech company. Perhaps none of them should. But, certainly, we should be more careful about describing — and valuing — those that now seem pre-eminently in the tech mold. Tesla and IBM are at two ends of what Professor Damodaran calls the tech company life cycle. As an infant company, Tesla poses a valuation challenge. Assessing the value of a stock typically starts with an assessment of earnings and cash flow, but that requires imagination with Tesla because it churns out annual losses, not earnings. Yet investors in the stock market collectively say Tesla is worth about $60 billion, more than G.M. or Ford, which make profits. Will Tesla become profitable enough to justify its current price? Professor Damodaran believes its shares are grossly overvalued. “But it’s hard to know with a young company,” he conceded, adding that Tesla is “a risky proposition but not an impossible one.” Old profitable companies like IBM are easier to value. The stock market says it is worth about $110 billion, based on a price-to-earnings ratio of 8.4. That ratio is less than half the level at which the average stock trades, presumably because IBM hasn’t been growing rapidly and, by some metrics, has been shrinking. There is risk in buying these shares, too, but of a different sort. It’s paramount for an older company to generate cash at a reasonable share price, and trying to “reinvent a company like IBM” — and shift it into a high-growth mode with big acquisitions like IBM’s planned $34 billion purchase of Red Hat — could be a dangerous waste of cash, Professor Damodaran said. “An old company can’t run as fast as a young company can, and usually it shouldn’t try,” he said. There are exceptions, though. In Professor Damodaran’s typology, Apple and Microsoft are ancient but have experienced rejuvenation, Microsoft most recently with the strategic turn to cloud computing taken by its chief executive, Satya Nadella. Apple had a second life with the return of Steve Jobs in 1997 and the subsequent births of the iPod and iPhone — though Apple is looking its age now, Professor Damodaran said. Both companies generate enormous amounts of cash, he said, and so can be valued with traditional stock analysis. Sober analysis is critical to market health. Consider the damage done by bouts of magical thinking about the value of tech stocks. In March 2000, for example, at the height of the dot-com bubble, the market gave Cisco Systems a value topping $500 billion, briefly making it the world’s most valuable company. In a misjudgment of stupendous proportions, investors gave Cisco a greater value than 24 big companies combined — including Apple, Ford, J. P. Morgan, Anheuser-Busch, McDonald’s, Staples and Texaco. What were people thinking? Apparently, that Cisco was worth an astronomical price-to-earnings ratio of 196.2 because it would grow at a breathtaking pace forever and become the beating heart of a transformed economy. That vision was revealed to be hallucinatory when the dot-com bubble burst. Today, Cisco trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of about 19.3. While valuations are generally more subdued today, imprecise thinking about tech stocks abides, with troubling implications. Amazon, for example, trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 109 — more than five times the valuation of the average stock. That has given its shareholders, including its founder, Jeff Bezos, astonishing wealth. It has allowed the company, which is old in tech years, to behave like an upstart, Professor Damodaran said, plowing profits into new businesses and disrupting entire industries. Investors have chosen to believe that, at some point, Amazon will raise prices sufficiently to reap big profits. Yet with higher prices, it could not constitute as much of a threat to competitors and might not grow rapidly. Like Tesla, Amazon’s business model raises this question: Can the company ever earn enough to justify the share price it still commands? I asked the same question recently about Netflix, and could pose similar queries about other high-flying stocks. The answers should be different in each case, because tech stocks really aren’t the same. One day, grouping them together is likely to seem quaint and, possibly, dangerous.",The New York Times
2018,Tech Workers Got Paid in Company Stock. They Used It to Agitate for Change.,"SAN FRANCISCO — Silicon Valley technology firms are known for giving stock to their workers, a form of compensation that often helps employees feel invested in their companies. But tech workers are now starting to use those shares to turn the tables on their employers. As many tech employees take a more activist approach to how their innovations are being deployed and increasingly speak out on a range of issues, some are using the stock as a way to demand changes at their companies. At Amazon, more than a dozen employees who had received stock grants recently exercised their rights as shareholders. In late November and early December, they filed identical shareholder petitions asking the e-commerce giant to release a comprehensive plan addressing climate change. Their filing appears to be the first time that tech employees have led their own shareholder proposal, according to activist investors. In the proposal, which will be voted on at Amazon’s annual shareholder meeting next spring, employees asked the company’s board to say how it would respond to climate change and reduce its dependence on fossil fuels. “We realized we could use our position as employees and our power and our rights as shareholders to bring visibility of this issue to the board and the top leaders of this company,” said Eliza Pan, a program manager who has worked at Amazon for five years and is one of the employees who signed on to the proposal. Ms. Pan, who earned Amazon shares as part of her compensation package, said workers must own at least $2,000 in stock for a year to file a shareholder proposal. “We had this power, and we wanted to leverage that power,” she said. The move by Amazon’s employees builds upon similar activism at Google this year. In March, its workers were part of a shareholder petition by Zevin Asset Management that sought to link executive compensation to diversity and inclusion goals. Google’s employees did not directly file the proposal, but joined Zevin and presented it at the annual shareholder meeting of Alphabet, Google’s parent company. The proposal was ultimately voted down, but Pat Miguel Tomaino, the director of socially responsible investing at Zevin, said the firm planned to work with Google employees to resubmit it for the 2019 shareholder meeting. “Workers are looking at who holds power and where changes can be made,” said Yana Calou, an engagement manager at Coworker.org, an organization that allows colleagues to start campaigns together. “Workers are shareholders themselves, and risks to workers and users are often risks to shareholders, so there is a natural alliance of shared interests.” Amazon declined to comment on its employees’ advocacy, but it said it was taking steps to address climate change. “We have set a goal to power our global infrastructure with 100 percent renewable energy and are investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency innovations,” said Kara Hurst, director of worldwide sustainability at Amazon. The company, based in Seattle, has installed solar energy systems at 25 of its fulfillment centers and has streamlined its packing process to reduce its use of packing materials, she added. Google declined to comment on its employees’ participation in shareholder proposals. The moves are part of a broad activist stirring by tech workers this year. Employees at Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce and Google have publicly objected to who was buying their products and to how certain technologies — such as facial recognition and artificial intelligence — would be used. Last month, about 20,000 Google employees staged a walkout because the company had richly paid executives who had been credibly accused of sexual harassment, leading the company to apologize and end forced arbitration in such cases. Shareholder proposals have in the past been used largely by activist investment firms and others to advocate for changes. “It’s fairly unusual to see this, where employees are taking a stand in regard to the company they’re working for,” said Natasha Lamb, a managing partner at Arjuna Capital, a wealth-management fund that focuses on climate issues. Tech employees, more than in many other industries, have a ready-made way to become activist shareholders because of how they are paid. Google, Facebook, Apple and tech start-ups such as Airbnb have all made stock a component of compensation. At privately held companies, tech workers often get stock options, which give them the option to buy shares at a set price. Publicly traded companies tend to grant restricted stock options that automatically transfer shares to employees over a period of time. “Because so much value is being created, or we hope is going to be created, it’s appealing to employees to receive some potential part of that pop or growth in value,” said Mary Russell, a lawyer and founder of Stock Option Counsel, a legal firm in Palo Alto, Calif., that advises tech employees on their compensation. “The culture of the companies is that we need to do this to incentivize people to build the value of the company.” But by paying employees this way, tech companies open themselves up to this kind of shareholder advocacy, she said. “They are setting themselves up to have quite a large group of stockholders who would of course, like any other stockholder, have the right to bring forward a shareholder proposal,” Ms. Russell said. Employee shareholder proposals may ultimately not be effective since shareholder-led proposals are often shot down. And because tech founders often possess a large chunk of the shares in their companies — Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and its largest shareholder, owns 16 percent of the company; the Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have about 51 percent of voting shares in Alphabet — the proposals have little chance of passing without founder support. Tech employees said it was worth taking that risk. Shareholder proposals often gain attention because they are distributed to stockholders and are included in annual proxy statements, the employees say, and they give workers a way to raise their grievances directly to the board, rather than just to managers. “Banding together with other shareholders amplifies my voice and makes all of our voices more powerful,” said Ms. Pan of Amazon. At Amazon, white-collar employees previously brought up issues by speaking at companywide meetings or using internal petitions, while its warehouse workers have pursued labor organizing. In June, for example, employees petitioned the company to stop selling facial-recognition software to law enforcement agencies because they believed the technology should not be used for surveillance. The company has not stopped the practice. The climate change shareholder proposal grew out of discussions among employees who had noticed other tech companies unveiling plans to address it. Since 2016, for instance, Google has issued environmental reports about its response to climate change. “It’s important to make change and work for change wherever you happen to be, and I happen to be an employee at Amazon,” said Emily Cunningham, a user experience designer who is backing the climate change proposal and who has received Amazon shares as part of her compensation. She said it was important for employees to publicly demand a plan. “It’s affecting the public, it’s affecting business,” she said.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Technology Has Destroyed Reality,"Turning Points Turning Point: Facebook and Twitter removed or suspended millions of pages, groups and accounts in an effort to combat bots and trolls. On June 20, 2017, the BBC evening news opener broke down. For four minutes, a breaking-news animation alternated random still pictures with tracking shots of a presenter who sat stoically in silence. The elements of the familiar sequence were jumbled, messed up and nonsensical. The scene was the result of a technical glitch — a system crash. But it also served as an image of automation run amok, of decades of breaking news finally resulting in broken news. The message still resonates: In this new age of artificial stupidity, technological disruption has turned destructive. Its greatest victim is reality itself. It is a far cry from an earlier period of digital expansion, when internet communication was seen to promote global exchange and understanding. The time when the word “global” was likely to attach to the word “digital” is most definitely over. The new elites in many Western countries are no longer cosmopolitan and globalist, but rather isolationist and identitarian. Before, technology was supposed to connect and mediate. The online world seemed like a Disney vision of multiculturalism, promoting sterile tolerance from above. Now technology divides and fragments; it identifies and ranks people. Mária Schmidt, a historian close to Hungary’s illiberal leader, Viktor Orban, argues that automation and artificial intelligence will reduce the demand for labor and thus for migration. So automation not only disadvantages local workers, but also benefits closed and homogeneous societies. It also wrecks the public conversation via bots and botnets impersonating real people, spreading viral disinformation and broken news. This rise of artificial stupidity is the antithesis of, or rather the millions of shabby little cousins to, artificial intelligence. Just as socialism in practice has been a far cry from the glorious promises of revolutionaries, artificial stupidity is a mediocre and greedy version of the sublime machine intelligence intended to elevate and improve human life. All sorts of minor communication applications are artificial stupidities. And though they may not seem impressive, their real-world effects are baffling: the destruction of public discourse and the polarization of populations; wages and hours managed by algorithms; customer service, clerical, counseling or legal work eliminated by virtual assistants or chatbots. Even simple things, such as buying a ticket for a plane, train or concert, have become arduous and frustrating chores in an era of targeted, opaque pricing. Instead of a common reality and a set of rules that apply to everyone, we have frustration, dysfunction and a waste of precious time and energy. And automation is not alone in chipping away at modern society. The few platforms that effectively own the digital communication sphere today operate without serious checks and balances, or even basic competition in an open market. Their algorithms are proprietary and unknown. There are few alternatives, if any, for consumers. The result is an endless cycle of broken news and quarter-truths, stretched and repurposed ad nauseam, because in the age of artificial stupidity, truth is traded for popularity and reach. The norms of reality TV have found a foothold in the digital age. The point is not that there is no reality — the point is that it’s every fact for itself, competing against all others, while social media multiply alternative versions of it. If you don’t like the reality you are facing, there is always another one, custom-made for your preferences. This is our real, existing digital world: nothing more than hourly waves of feverish and toxic agitation, played out over stale mainstream channels that discourage innovation and experimentation, drown in excruciating advertisements and drain people’s attention and souls. An unpopular truth cannot survive online in such a world, because traction is privileged over veracity. And to artificially stupid automatons and algorithms, reality is defined as brute quantity, by ranking, ratings and elimination. The truth doesn’t fit into that mold. The truth is a piece of work with unruly and messy details that nevertheless require attention and never fully add up. It is usually much too complicated to be entertaining, and it may not be to everyone’s liking at all. It may not make things easier or more efficient — quite the opposite, in fact. If truth is not a marketable item, like clean environments or livable neighborhoods, the platforms that manage digital communication seem to show little interest in maintaining it, letting broken news propagate. As a result, fake reports, digital rumors and conspiracy theories have moved from fringe to mainstream. They have also created a new reality. As I write this, a mob is marching through the East German town of Chemnitz, yelling anti-migrant slogans and chasing nonwhite people. They are not brandishing pitchforks; they are more likely to wield cellphones. After all, in Germany Facebook activity correlates with white-supremacist violence. Racist gatherings are organized in a matter of hours on social media, and algorithms built into platforms amplify social division and benefit extremist organizations. Digital technology augments authoritarian movements, and the digital native segues seamlessly into the digital nativist. Facts, on the other hand, are often quite unspectacular. They will not improve, and may even deteriorate, if they are “liked” or shared. And both facts and the truth rely on strong institutions, not consumers, to defend them: judiciaries, scientific communities, an independent press. It is no coincidence that all those institutions are being undermined in many countries around the world — see the rioters in Chemnitz fuming at the “lying press,” the defunding of scientific research throughout the Western world or attempts at the partisan realignment of judicial institutions, such as Poland’s Supreme Court. There are many short-term solutions to help prevent the further onslaught of broken news. Challenging or regulating monopoly platforms is one of them. Making their algorithms transparent and open to public assessment, legislation and debate is another. We can ban bots and anonymous accounts from social media, and strengthen institutions with durable and tested rules to establish and confirm facts. But we cannot have our factuality cake and eat it too. Truth will rarely be popular or profitable. To expect its popularity to correspond to its veracity is not even artificially stupid, but just stupid.",The New York Times

2018,Opinion | Tell Me One More Time What to Do About Grief,"Accept the lasagna. Do not start reading that Joan Didion book. Ms. Firestone is a comedian. Someone is gone. Perhaps this is the first year you had to get used to it, or maybe you’ve had years of practice with how the calendar keeps going, and it’s still hard. Either way, for right now I recommend getting in the bath. Lie faceup if you want. I prefer facedown, coming up for air every few seconds like a nervous snorkeler. On a personal note, my bathtub is short, so I am forced to choose between submerging the top half of my body or submerging the bottom half. I always choose the top half, leaving my legs out of the water, looking like the first dolphin to live in an apartment. Now onto a jigsaw puzzle, or doodling, or just stacking your mail into a Jenga-like pile. Anything that uses your hands more than your head. Stay in your robe all day, or if that’s too warm, try a shirt with no pants, like Winnie the Pooh. Eat something. Tell one of those people who keep saying, “Let me know if there’s anything I can do” that there is something they can do and it’s to bring you more pretzels — the good kind, or really any kind but the ones you bought last time, because those were bad. How can they make a pretzel bad? I don’t know, but they can, and they did and last time you bought them. Eat, rest, keep yourself clean, but this loss doesn’t seem to go away. You start to wonder, can this be avoided going forward? Maybe you should cut off ties and become a hermit. Even then, the rat you befriend over forgotten Saltines will naturally have a shorter life span and you might find yourself alone, mourning a rodent, scream-crying for a creature you named Little Miss Crunchy. I believe it’s in our nature to want to be loved, to try to love in return. And if our gorgeous personalities don’t push everything away, mortality certainly takes care of the rest. This past January I lost my closest friend to cancer. Her name was Adina. She was a writer. For 26 years, we had one of those friendships where you couldn’t do anything without the other person weighing in. She knew how a pair of pants would fit me before I even tried them on. I have memorized where our arms would go when we hugged. The complexities of grief continue to bewilder me, but what I do know with certainty is that I am here and she is not, and now, a new year will begin without her. If you also grieve, I am sorry. Because it’s not only that someone has died, but that no one alive seems to know what to do about it. Some people will disappear or will silently drop off lasagna, while others will push you too hard to try Zumba. The bottom line is that people hate to see you broken and will fumble to help you get through it. So here I fumble, offering you what has helped me: Buy foods that are easy to prepare, and make it your only goal to eat them before they go bad. Save your darkest thoughts for a journal, and never reread this journal. Label it in such a way that no one will ever be tempted to read it, like, “My Longer Dream Interpretations” or “A List of My Moles.” When you think about the person who is gone, try to remember everything, not just the good. Remember the fights. Remember the small annoyances. It’ll keep the person whole. Accept awkward apologies and flowers. Try your best to love other people besides the one you lost. And finally, whatever people tell you, do not start reading that Joan Didion book. My grandma, who is 89 and very sharp, sent me an email the other day. Despite sticking with an AOL address, she’s very good at email. At her age, she has seen most of her friends go, so her perspective on grief is somewhat different from mine, maybe more practical. This year, she has sent me several emails, some with recipes for stew, some with progress reports on her broken molar (update: It doesn’t hurt!). Most recently, she sent me this quotation, from “The Summer Day,” a poem by Mary Oliver: “Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?” The new year begins, and somehow we keep moving. For those of us still here, what will we do? Jo Firestone is a comedian and a writer. Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.",The New York Times
2018,A Deep Dive Back Into ‘The Sopranos’,"5 Things About Your Book The world of TV now “barely resembles the one into which Tony Soprano’s SUV rumbled back in 1999,” the critics Matt Zoller Seitz and Alan Sepinwall write in “The Sopranos Sessions.” “All the aspects of the series that once startled viewers have become accepted: serialization; narrative and moral ambiguity; antiheroes or villains as main characters; beauty for its own sake.” The book, being published to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the show’s premiere, includes highly detailed recaps of each episode; several interviews the two authors conducted with the series creator, David Chase; a debate about the much-discussed final moment of the final episode; and writings by Seitz and Sepinwall that were published in The Star-Ledger, the New Jersey newspaper, when “The Sopranos” originally aired. Below, Seitz, the television critic for New York magazine, and Sepinwall, the chief television critic for Rolling Stone, talk about the show’s ambiguous finale, the nature of Chase’s recollections and more. When did you first get the idea to write this book? MATT ZOLLER SEITZ I’m the creative director of the Split Screens Festival, and in our first year, 2017, we gave an award to David Chase. The event went well, and he was so lively and entertaining. With the 20th anniversary coming up, it seemed like a good time. And Alan was the person I wanted to do it with, since we had done so much about the show and had written together before. ALAN SEPINWALL It seemed like a good excuse to get together, and nostalgic because of the time we had spent together at The Star-Ledger. A lot of things we’ve written about wouldn’t exist without this one show. The anniversary definitely forced our hand and gave us an excuse to do it, and I’m glad it did, because I’m not sure when I would have rewatched the whole series, and wow, is it a great show. What’s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it? SEPINWALL We knew we were going to be talking to David Chase about the show, and that we were going to cover everything. And we kept asking ourselves: Is he going to say anything about the ending? We were strategizing and strategizing, knowing it would come up in the seventh of eight interviews we were doing. But in the sixth, I randomly asked him a question about preparing for the end, and he said “Well, I had that death scene in mind for years before,” and I didn’t want to say anything because I was afraid he was going to take it back. And Matt plunged in and said, “David, do you realize you just said ‘death scene’?” I don’t know if we have a definitive answer, because I don’t think that scene lends itself to one, but we talked much more about his intentions behind it than I ever thought David would do. SEITZ We didn’t get him to admit Tony died or anything like that. He was saying that the original intention was to have intimations that Tony died, but he moved away from that to something more philosophical in nature. But David would talk about things being intentional without really being intentional. I asked him: Is it possible that a lifetime of consuming gangster films where heroes die at the end left a flavor? And he said, “That’s possible.” In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write? SEITZ We fought to include samples of writing we did while we were at The Star-Ledger. I wanted some of that stuff to be preserved because a lot of it’s not available online. But also to give you a sense of how we were thinking about the show when it was new and there was nothing else like it. We ended up breaking it up so that the stuff related to James Gandolfini was in its own section, and that made the book feel very sad and melancholy at the end. It leaves you with a sense of finality. Tony may or may not have died, but the guy who played Tony did, and that feels like the end. SEPINWALL I get very nerdy and detail-oriented. And I was going to ask Chase a lot of detailed questions: Why did this happen? Why did that? Tell me about this or that back story. But he often didn’t remember, or wasn’t interested in going into the details. It became much more talking about the feeling behind things. There’s definitely trivia in there. But a lot of it is just David Chase discussing his own creative instincts and how much comes from his gut, and I think that became a lot more interesting than the nerdy stuff I was focused on when we started. SEITZ I was surprised and moved by some of David’s recollections of his adolescence and childhood in New Jersey. There are some almost lyrical reminiscences in those parts of the interview. Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work? SEITZ Probably the biggest influence on this book is my therapist, Marc Kaminsky. I’ve been in therapy with Marc for 12 years, and in addition to being a fine therapist, he’s a fine poet. He psychoanalyzes me with a lot of literary references and scraps of poetry. That really works with a guy like me, who tends to frame things as if they’re a narrative. Psychoanalysis is a pretty good tool to have when you’re talking to any artist. SEPINWALL A high school teacher named Timothy W. Lynch. He currently teaches math somewhere in New Jersey. At the time I discovered him, he was teaching in Los Angeles, but he moonlit as a recapper of “Star Trek: The Next Generation” and “Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.” I discovered him in college, and I thought: Wait, you can talk about TV shows one episode at a time? Insert whatever mind-blown GIF you want. And somehow I made a whole career of that. Persuade someone to read “The Sopranos Sessions” in 50 words or less. SEITZ You get to put the show on the couch and be Dr. Melfi. SEPINWALL You have an excuse to revisit one of the greatest and most influential shows ever made. And you get a really dramatic peek behind the curtain of the man who made it and all those decisions, including the ending that you’re still arguing about 10 years later.

2018,Tell Us 5 Things About Your Book: A Music Critic’s Look Back at Formative Years in Chicago,"Q. & A. In 2015, Jessica Hopper published “The First Collection of Criticism by a Living Female Rock Critic,” which gathered reviews, profiles and broader cultural musings that Hopper had written for a wide variety of zines, alternative weeklies and mainstream music publications. Her new memoir, “Night Moves,” takes us inside her diaries. It’s composed of brief, impressionistic pieces, dated starting in 2004, that she wrote while living in Chicago (where she’s still based). A love letter to the city, it’s also a glimpse into Hopper’s friendships and her time navigating the scene that she was documenting in her public work. Below, she talks about her early writing on blogs, changes in music culture, the band that serves as a “beacon and guidepost for almost everything” she does and more. When did you first get the idea to write this book? The idea for this book didn’t exactly come from me. Putting together my previous book, which is an anthology of about 15 years of my criticism, involved rereading almost everything I’d ever written — published and not. In 2014 or 2015, I was going through it with my friend Alice, and she said, “You have a bunch of writing about Chicago and hanging out and going to shows that doesn’t fit with this book, but I think you need to go back to it at some point.” Those things came from blogs I had had, fanzines I had made at that time, different writing that wasn’t music criticism, that wasn’t reviews of records. Once I put it together, I saw that it very much documented this ephemeral music scene. It witnessed a time that’s the twilight of this moment before the ubiquity of smartphones, a time of great change in my neighborhood, a wave of gentrification that I was part of. It also witnessed a period where I’m jumping into my life as a young writer, and also a time where my friends are my family, when I’m in love with all my friends. It was like this liminal space between what was and what is, and it felt useful to bring that document forward — even just the stuff about what it was like to participate in music culture before everyone was documenting it on Instagram. What’s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it? There’s a line in there that says, “If I’m not living my most hopeful politics at the ripe old age of 29, then what am I doing?” To read that at 40 — the first time I came back upon it, even though it was something I had written — it redirected me as a writer in my real life, in my current life as a suburban mom, as someone who’s working on her fourth book. Young me kind of put the screws to old me. In some ways the thing that I’m most grateful for about doing this book, is getting to see the things that have progressed and not; the distance that I’ve staked — and not — between my younger, perhaps more idealistic, self and my geriatric cynicism. In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write? Writing these blogs, whether this was true or not, you had this sense of writing to your friends, your community, because who else cared? Music at that time was more like a cloister. There was a sense that you were within the realm of the underground, and there was a particular lingua franca, and certain ways that you would shorthand things. Sometimes, when I was going back and revising, I was refining to offer more context because I did want to let people in more — pulling back a little and contextualizing something that, if you were in that world at that time, needed no explanation. Certainly there’s my own weird slang and use of language — abuse of language — still in there. But putting things into a book a decade later, I wanted to crack open this world a little bit more. Some little moments are documents of things that were important then. Maybe we don’t need a full oral history of the hot-dog stand that stayed open till 4 a.m. that was the place where punks leaving this venue across the street would encounter the jocks and people from other parts of town who were coming in as the new denizens of the neighborhood. But at the time, that was a crucial place. When you look back, even in these glimpses, it sets the stage in some ways for what these neighborhoods have become, a decade later. Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work? The central influence on what I do and how I do it is a luminary post-punk band from D.C. called Fugazi. Since I was a teenager, it’s served as a beacon and guidepost for almost everything that I do. It seems kind of ludicrous, in 2018, that there would have been a band that showed up at some point and said, “We’re not just going to make good records but we’re going to provide a framework by which to live.” But Fugazi was that for me and a lot of folks I know, because they gave us a way of doing it ourselves. The big way that they’ve been most influential to me, and that I think about on almost a daily basis, is that they didn’t really advertise their records above ground. They weren’t trying to push to the mainstream. I interviewed Ian MacKaye, Fugazi’s co-founder, once when I was 19, and he said: “Fugazi isn’t for everybody. It’s for the people who want it and need it, and they’re going to dig until they find it.” To me, that idea is very present in the product of this book. Persuade someone to read “Night Moves” in 50 words or less. It’s a book about falling in love with a city. And if you’ve ever been someone who’s truly fallen in love with a city, and been thrilled to discover your place in it, it’s a book for you.

2018,Tell Us 5 Things About Your Book: Tossing and Turning in ‘Insomnia’,"Q. & A. Anyone who has ever struggled to rest throughout an entire night — which I imagine is all of us, at one time or another — will sympathize with Marina Benjamin, who plumbs the agony of her own sleeplessness in her new book, simply titled “Insomnia.” In it, Benjamin describes the different varieties of middle-of-the-night dislocation — nights when “the thickening, sense-dulling” darkness “hangs velvety as a pall,” or the “luminous moonlit nights, lurid nights, when everything feels heightened.” She recounts her own experiences and frustrations, but also calls on the works of a wide range of others to illuminate the subject, like the poet Rumi, the painter Magritte and the philosopher David Hume; as well as fictional characters, like Odysseus’s wife, Penelope (“his absence stirs her desire, but then her insomnia curdles that desire into despair,” Benjamin writes). Below, she discusses the particularly bad bout of insomnia that inspired her to write the book, the recurrent image of sleeping women in classical art and more. When did you first get the idea to write this book? It grew out of experience. I’ve been an insomniac all my life. In childhood, it was much more a refusal to sleep, because I didn’t know where we went to — the usual kind of terror of night. Insomnia comes very much more from the outside now; it feels like an assault. At the start of 2017, I was experiencing a particularly rough bout of it. It started intruding on and disrupting my sense of reality. I had various family problems detonating around me, blasting up from nowhere, it seemed. It felt that life had become very, very unwieldy, as though day and night had been turned upside down. Nonsense mingled with sense. I was exhausted, limping through the days. I decided I wanted to write about it. Because I began writing from this distorted place, the first 5,000 words kind of gushed out; it was almost like automatic writing. Being in my mid-50s has felt unmoored, which is a very fruitful place to be, partly because it’s liminal — middle life is a transition moment, by definition, and so is insomnia: You’re precariously balanced between two worlds. I like the idea of being in that place and writing from that place, and to write a whole book in that strange way, with ambiguity and uncertainty, so we get dropped into my altered state. What’s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it? I was struck by the recurrent image of sleeping women and vigilantly wakeful ones — like Penelope — in literature and art. I had never thought of the various meanings that might attach to slumbering women, or what it was they meant or symbolized. The sleeping women I looked at were in mainly two areas. One was paintings; there were lots of classical women depicted as sleeping. And Silas Weir Mitchell’s rest cure was another fruitful area, where women who were exhibiting anxiety were basically put to bed for days and forbidden to get up except for bodily functions. It drove the writer Charlotte Perkins Gilman to the edge of madness. In my reading about that, these depictions of sleeping women seemed to embody the malaise of an entire society that was sated on the comforts of capitalism but alienated from its own wants; a kind of decadence, if you like, but in its worst manifestations. Another surprise was how active premodern people were at night; how common it was for them to perform at night functions that we associate with the day: chatting with friends, getting haircuts (sometimes in bed). The luxury of privacy was very rare, and many people didn’t have bedrooms that were separate spaces that were private and individual. They might have a divan in the living room or often in their office. In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write? What changed was its scope. When the first 5,000 words spilled out, they came largely in the nature of personal complaint — a way of venting my own frustrations with not sleeping. Then I got interested in philosophical and psychological perspectives: why we contrast darkness to light; how we navigate thresholds; how, with insomnia, we need to reckon with our own inner darkness — you feel that very palpably when you’re awake at night starting at the ceiling, drowning in a well of uncertainty and longing. The form of the book gave me certain freedoms that grew as the book progressed. The digressive associative style, designed to mimic the insomniac experience, allowed me to expand my inquiry so I could bring in bigger themes: capitalism, the use of stimulants and the experience of other insomniacs, so that it’s not just an interior, experiential inquiry. Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work? I visit a lot of galleries when I look for inspiration. If I had to pick a single artist who I find inspiring in this way, I’d pick Edward Hopper. It’s partly because he’s drawn to interior spaces, to rooms rather than landscapes. The people he paints are often alone, like the insomniac, lost in contemplation, looking out the window. Apart from the lushness of his work — the gorgeous palette of colors — there’s a real humanity there that I’m pulled to. But also a cheekiness — wanting to spy on people and learn their secrets. And at the last retrospective of his work that I went to in London, I was surprised at the size of some of the canvases, as if he wanted to envelop you so you have an immersive experience, much like reading. Persuade someone to read “Insomnia” in 50 words or less. It elevates insomnia to see it as more than just a sleep disorder in need of a cure, or a state of lack. I felt that if we embraced insomnia — the joys and terrors of darkness — then we could celebrate what it means to live life fully and startlingly awake.

2018,"Tennessee Earthquake, Strongest in Decades, Jolts Homes in the Region and Atlanta","A 4.4-magnitude earthquake struck on Wednesday morning in rural East Tennessee, rattling homes as far away as Atlanta in the region’s most powerful jolt in more than 45 years. The earth shook around 4:14 a.m. local time just outside Decatur, Tenn., a city of about 1,600 people near the Great Smoky Mountains, according to the United States Geological Survey. The earthquake was shallow, about five and a half miles below the surface, sending ripples throughout the area and into neighboring states. It was the strongest earthquake in East Tennessee since a 4.7-magnitude earthquake struck near Maryville, Tenn., in 1973, the National Weather Service said. A second earthquake in the same area on Wednesday, a 3.3-magnitude jolt, struck about 15 minutes after the first one, the U.S.G.S. said. The earthquakes were not on a known fault, the U.S.G.S. said, but they did occur in one of the most active earthquake zones in the Southeast. That area, known as the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone, extends to the northern parts of Alabama and Georgia. People in a 310-mile area, from Southern Kentucky to Southwest Georgia, felt the larger earthquake, the U.S.G.S. said. In Atlanta, the largest metro area in the region, people said they woke up to find their houses shaking. There were no reports of injuries or serious damage. Karen Webb, a dispatcher at the Meigs County Sheriff’s Department in Decatur, said a few residents called to report that small items had shifted in their houses during the earthquake. “A picture turned over,” Ms. Webb said. “Maybe a lamp.” In Cobb County, Ga., an Atlanta suburb, the police received at least seven 911 calls from people who mistook the ground shaking for someone trying to break into their home, said Ross Cavitt, a county spokesman. “Police attributed those calls to the earthquake because they came in at that time and there was no other evidence of an intruder,” Mr. Cavitt said in an email. The earthquake struck about two miles east of the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant, one of the largest nuclear power stations in the United States. But the Tennessee Valley Authority, which operates the plant, said that engineers had not found damage at Watts Bar or other facilities in the area. “TVA facilities are designed to withstand seismic events,” the Tennessee Valley Authority said on Twitter. Mary Colbaugh, who works at the Decatur Family Diner in Decatur, said she felt the ground shake as she was driving to work on Wednesday. But it was not any reason for alarm, she said. “We heard the roar and a little shake,” Ms. Colbaugh said in an interview. “It’s a tremble.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Terms and Conditions for Telling Me About Your Day,"Was it bad? I am sorry. But I don’t want to hear about it yet. Ms. Blachor is the author of “The Feminist’s Guide to Raising a Little Princess.” These Terms and Conditions regulate when you (“HUSBAND”) may tell me (“WIFE”) about your day. These Terms and Conditions are in effect immediately after you step over the threshold of our shared domicile and are binding in perpetuity. If HUSBAND enters the domicile and sees or hears one or more children yelling, fighting, whining, grabbing, pinching or demanding parental intervention by stretching the word “Mom” into two interminable syllables, he is prohibited from telling WIFE about his day. He is further obliged to recall that fateful moment six years earlier when he and WIFE considered which parent would shift to a part-time schedule during the early childhood years. If HUSBAND enters the domicile and one or more children are hungry, unbathed, tired or running away from the potty in terror, he is prohibited from telling WIFE about his day. If WIFE is hungry, unbathed or tired because Jacob had his recurring Bobgoblin nightmare the previous night, HUSBAND is similarly prohibited from telling WIFE about his day and is also contractually obligated not to say, “You look tired.” If HUSBAND has forgotten to bring home the 8.5-by-11-inch durable plastic dividers specified by Mrs. Herman at the first-grade parent-teacher meeting, which WIFE attended alone, he is prohibited from telling WIFE about his day. If it is Tuesday or Thursday, the day when WIFE has driven to the other side of town to drop Charlotte off at her Mini Movers class, then circled back to get Jacob to his Gangnam Capoeira hybrid class on time, and then spent the rest of the evening in rush-hour traffic collecting them, HUSBAND is prohibited from telling WIFE about his day and is further required to acknowledge the 1950s cosplay patterns he and WIFE have regrettably fallen into since having children. If WIFE is on a device trying to squeeze in a few minutes of work in her efforts to earn money and parent and “have it all,” HUSBAND is prohibited from telling WIFE about his day. Notwithstanding the foregoing, he will reflect on the difficulty of anyone achieving a proper work-life balance in a country that does not legislate family leave and affordable child care policies and will nod in agreement as WIFE rightly assails this sorry state of affairs. If HUSBAND has remembered to bring home the 8.5-by-11-inch dividers but the dividers fail to have the color-coded adhesive tabs Mrs. Herman described in her PowerPoint presentation, he is prohibited from telling WIFE about his day and is further obliged not to suggest this detail is unimportant, since he was not the one to attend the parent-teacher meeting and hear about the importance of color-coded tabs. If HUSBAND enters the kitchen and sees an open bottle of wine on the counter, he should think twice about telling WIFE about his day. If WIFE wonders out loud, “How do we get out of this traditional gender-role trap?,” he may answer thoughtfully but may not use this opening as an invitation to tell WIFE about his day. If one or more children are watching their show, HUSBAND has up to 24 minutes to tell WIFE about his day. If HUSBAND makes a disparaging comment about the perils of using screen time as a babysitter, he abdicates this right immediately. If HUSBAND has remembered to bring home the dividers and the adhesive tabs but has forgotten that the dividers must be translucent with pockets, he is prohibited from telling WIFE about his day but he is invited to pour himself a glass of wine and wonder what made Mrs. Herman the way she is. If HUSBAND makes a comment that causes WIFE to laugh and manages to segue into an anecdote about his day, he may continue telling WIFE about his day until one or more children interrupt with an improvised sock puppet show.

2018,Tesla Names Larry Ellison and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson to Its Board,"Tesla added Larry Ellison, executive chairman and founder of the software giant Oracle, and a senior executive at Walgreens Boots Alliance to its board of directors, fulfilling a key provision of a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The board added Mr. Ellison, who bought three million shares of Tesla stock earlier this year, and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, who is in charge of human resources at Walgreens Boots Alliance, as independent directors on Thursday, the company said in a securities filing on Friday. Tesla stock closed up 5.6 percent on Friday after the company announced the appointments. In September, the S.E.C. required Tesla to add two independent board members and an independent chairman to settle a securities fraud lawsuit the commission brought against the company and its chief executive, Elon Musk. Securities regulators brought the case after Mr. Musk said that he had secured funding for a private buyout of the company in August. In November, Tesla named Robyn M. Denholm chairwoman after Mr. Musk stepped down from that role, another requirement of the settlement. Ms. Denholm was the chief financial officer of Telstra, the dominant telecommunications company in Australia. Mr. Ellison founded Oracle in 1977 and has became one of the wealthiest people in the world as the company expanded during the technology booms of the 1990s. In October, Mr. Ellison defended Mr. Musk, whom he called a “very close” friend, at an Oracle corporate meeting with financial analysts. Ms. Wilson-Thompson spent 17 years in human resources at Kellogg, the cereal giant, before joining Walgreens Boots Alliance in 2010. With Ms. Wilson-Thompson’s arrival, Tesla’s board now includes three women. In addition to Ms. Denholm, the company’s board includes Linda Johnson Rice, chairman and chief executive of Johnson Publishing Company. The company’s board includes several people who have close personal and professional ties to Mr. Musk, including Mr. Musk’s brother, Kimbal; Brad Buss, who served as chief financial officer of SolarCity, the solar-panel maker run by Mr. Musk’s cousin that Tesla acquired in 2016; Ira Ehrenpreis, an investor in SpaceX, Mr. Musk’s rocket company; and Antonio Gracias and Steve Jurvetson, who are both directors of SpaceX. The S.E.C. is still examining Tesla’s claims about production goals. Since the settlement Mr. Musk has continued to spar with the agency, calling it the “Shortseller Enrichment Commission” on Twitter, and saying in a recent interview on the CBS program “60 Minutes” that he does not respect the S.E.C.",The New York Times
2018,Tesla Scrambles to Sell Cars Before a Tax Break Fades,"This year, Mitch Mallin bought a metallic blue Tesla Model 3 sedan equipped with heated seats and a bevy of other options, all for $56,000 — twice as much as he had ever paid for a car before. The final cost will be lowered by a $7,500 federal tax credit, a bonus available to buyers of electric vehicles. Mr. Mallin, a retired actuary from Farmington Hills, Mich., said he probably would have bought the car even without the tax credit because he wanted to “participate in the movement” to fight global warming and drive zero-emission cars. Still, the credit “was factored in,” he said. “It’s almost like a rebate.” But not for much longer. Under federal rules, the full tax credit is available only on the first 200,000 cars that a manufacturer sells in the United States; two quarters later, the credit is reduced. Tesla reached that threshold in July. As a result, the credit available to Tesla buyers will fall to $3,750 for cars delivered on or after Jan. 1, then will be halved again on July 1 and go away completely in 2020. The phaseout could hurt Tesla’s ability to reach a broader group of car buyers. The company’s lineup starts at nearly $50,000, before incentives, for the Model 3 and climbs to $140,000 for a top-of-the-line Model X sport utility vehicle. Tesla has long promised an entry-level Model 3 that would cost $35,000, but the company has acknowledged that it could not sell that car profitably right now. “How many buyers are there out for a $60,000 car?” asked Karl Brauer, executive publisher of the auto information providers Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book. “There’s always the possibility Tesla is going to hit the saturation point.” In the last month, Tesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, have been scrambling to sell as many cars as possible before the end of the year. “You may be able to get a Tesla before the $7500 US tax credit drops in 2 weeks, even if you haven’t placed an order yet,” Mr. Musk said via Twitter on Dec. 15. Last week, Mr. Musk went even further by pledging to reimburse customers if delivery problems caused them to get a tax credit of $3,750 instead of $7,500. “If Tesla committed delivery & customer made good faith efforts to receive before year end, Tesla will cover the tax credit difference,” he said in a tweet. The company’s sales centers have been telling prospective customers that the company has hundreds of Model 3s in inventory around the country and can deliver cars to buyers within 48 hours in many cases. Its Indianapolis showroom, because it is close to a large inventory lot, has been offering same-day deliveries to walk-in customers. Some analysts said they doubted that the halving of the tax credit alone would slow sales next year. Many of the company’s customers are well-off professionals, dedicated environmentalists or devoted believers in Tesla who would most likely be unfazed by the loss of tax credits. “I think there’s still so many people who want to buy a Model 3 and are willing to pay a lot of money for it,” said David Whiston, an auto analyst at Morningstar. “I’m not worried about it.” Despite protracted manufacturing glitches — customers had to wait several weeks to take delivery of a Model 3 — and the legal troubles of Mr. Musk, Tesla had a breakout year in sales. In the first three quarters of 2018, the company delivered more than 154,000 cars, including 82,000 Model 3 sedans. In all of 2017, the company sold just 101,000 cars. The surge in Model 3 production and sales helped drive Tesla to a third-quarter profit of $312 million, its first quarterly profit in two years and its largest ever. Dr. Peter Bankoff, an anesthesiologist with homes in Arizona and Colorado, took delivery in August of a silver, all-wheel-drive Model 3 that cost $65,000. He reserved the car in March 2016 and was so eager to get it, he didn’t think much about the tax credit. “I’m sure I’ll use the credit, but after waiting two and a half years for the car, I was going to buy it no matter what,” Dr. Bankoff said. He’s enthralled by the car, too. “It’s the most fun you can have with your clothes on,” he said. That Tesla has so many customers willing to pay full price for a Model 3 is a reflection of the strength of the company’s brand and its success in drawing luxury car buyers. In the first nine months of the year, Tesla reported sales that exceeded those of more established brands like Volvo, Acura, Infiniti, Lincoln and Cadillac, and trailed only Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi and Lexus. Dr. Rob Frank, a plastic surgeon from Oak Park, Ill., had been driving an Acura TL until the end of October, when his Model 3 arrived. While he loves the car’s acceleration, he said, it wasn’t just technology that drew him in. “I like Elon’s vision for the company,” Dr. Frank said. “I like what he’s trying to do.” The tax credit, he added, had no impact on his buying decision. Tesla isn’t the only automaker dealing with a tax-credit phaseout. General Motors is expected to pass the 200,000 sales mark as early as this month. The credit is available now on the Chevrolet Volt, a plug-in hybrid, and the all-electric Chevrolet Bolt. In the first 11 months of 2018, G.M. sold more than 32,000 Volts and Bolts. The market for electric cars will soon become much bigger as manufacturers like Audi and Mercedes-Benz begin selling new models that will be eligible for the full $7,500 tax credit for some time. In the first half of 2019, Audi is expected to begin offering the E-Tron, a battery-powered S.U.V. that would be a direct competitor of the Model X. The E-Tron is expected to have a starting price of about $75,000. Mercedes-Benz is expected to introduce a small electric sedan next year to compete with the Model 3. Knowing that it could be harder to sell its cars in 2019, Tesla appears to be doing everything it can to close sales before the end of the year. The company is making available for sale vehicles that have been used as demonstration models, and others that had been assigned to customers who are planning to take delivery after the first of the year. Since October, Tesla has also allowed customers who buy without a test drive three days to return the car for a full refund, a step that makes it less risky to buy a Tesla sight unseen — something Mr. Mallin, the retired actuary, did. “I hadn’t even sat in one before I bought mine,” he said.",The New York Times

2018,Texas Judge Strikes Down Obama’s Affordable Care Act as Unconstitutional,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge in Texas struck down the entire Affordable Care Act on Friday on the grounds that its mandate requiring people to buy health insurance is unconstitutional and the rest of the law cannot stand without it. The ruling was over a lawsuit filed this year by a group of Republican governors and state attorneys general. A group of intervening states led by Democrats promised to appeal the decision, which will most likely not have any immediate effect. But it will almost certainly make its way to the Supreme Court, threatening the survival of the landmark health law and, with it, health coverage for millions of Americans, protections for people with pre-existing conditions and much more. In his ruling, Judge Reed O’Connor of the Federal District Court in Fort Worth said that the individual mandate requiring people to have health insurance “can no longer be sustained as an exercise of Congress’s tax power.” Accordingly, Judge O’Connor, a George W. Bush appointee, said that “the individual mandate is unconstitutional” and the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid. At issue was whether the health law’s insurance mandate still compelled people to buy coverage after Congress reduced the penalty to zero dollars as part of the tax overhaul that President Trump signed last December. When the Supreme Court upheld the mandate as constitutional in 2012, it was based on Congress’s taxing power. Congress, the court said, could legally impose a tax penalty on people who do not have health insurance. But in the new case, the 20 plaintiff states, led by Texas, argued that with the penalty zeroed out, the individual mandate had become unconstitutional — and that the rest of the law could not be severed from it. The Justice Department’s response to the case was highly unusual: though it disagreed with the plaintiffs that the entire law should be struck down, it declined this year to defend not just the individual mandate, but the law’s provisions that protect people with pre-existing conditions. That prompted a coalition of 16 states and the District of Columbia, led by California, to intervene and defend the law. On Friday night, a spokeswoman for Xavier Becerra, the California attorney general, said California and the other defendant states would challenge the ruling with an appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans. “Today’s ruling is an assault on 133 million Americans with pre-existing conditions, on the 20 million Americans who rely on the A.C.A.’s consumer protections for health care, on America’s faithful progress toward affordable health care for all Americans,” Mr. Becerra said in a statement. “The A.C.A. has already survived more than 70 unsuccessful repeal attempts and withstood scrutiny in the Supreme Court.” Attorney General Ken Paxton of Texas, who initiated the lawsuit, applauded the decision, saying in a statement, “Today’s ruling enjoining Obamacare halts an unconstitutional exertion of federal power over the American health care system.” He added, “Our lawsuit seeks to effectively repeal Obamacare, which will give President Trump and Congress the opportunity to replace the failed social experiment with a plan that ensures Texans and all Americans will again have greater choice about what health coverage they need and who will be their doctor.” Mr. Trump, who has consistently sought the law’s repeal and has weakened it through regulatory changes, posted a response to the ruling on Twitter late Friday night: “As I predicted all along, Obamacare has been struck down as an UNCONSTITUTIONAL disaster! Now Congress must pass a STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions.” The White House, in a separate statement late Friday, said: “We expect this ruling will be appealed to the Supreme Court. Pending the appeal process, the law remains in place.” If Judge O’Connor’s decision ultimately stands, about 17 million Americans will lose their health insurance, according to the Urban Institute, a left-leaning think tank. That includes millions who gained coverage through the law’s expansion of Medicaid, and millions more who receive subsidized private insurance through the law’s online marketplaces. Insurers will also no longer have to cover young adults up to age 26 under their parents’ plans; annual and lifetime limits on coverage will again be permitted; and there will be no cap on out-of-pocket costs. Also gone will be the law’s popular protections for people with pre-existing conditions, which became a major talking point in the November midterm elections, as Democratic candidates constantly reminded voters that congressional Republicans had tried to repeal the law last year. Many Democrats successfully centered their midterm campaigns on protecting the Affordable Care Act’s insurance mandates for pre-existing conditions. Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, one of the few Democratic senators to save his seat in a heavily Trump-friendly state, excoriated his opponent, West Virginia’s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, for joining the lawsuit decided in favor of the Republicans on Friday. Democrats in Wisconsin campaigned on a pledge to withdraw the state from the suit, and after they won, that state’s Republican Legislature passed legislation blocking the newly elected Democrats from withdrawing. That legislation was signed into law on Friday by Gov. Scott Walker, who lost his bid for re-election in November. But most Republican candidates insisted during the campaign that they did not want to withdraw protections for pre-existing conditions, and most were silent after Friday’s ruling. Without those protections, insurers could return to denying coverage to such people or to charging them more. They could also return to charging people more based on their age, gender or profession. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan research organization, estimates that 52 million adults from 18 to 64, or 27 percent of that population, would be rejected for coverage under the practices that were in effect in most states before the Affordable Care Act. “If this Texas decision on the ACA is upheld, it would throw the individual insurance market and the whole health care system into complete chaos,” Larry Levitt, a senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, wrote on Twitter. “But, the case still has a long legal road to travel before that’s an immediate threat.” Democrats immediately attacked the ruling as absurd. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California said that when the party took control of the House next month, with her as speaker, it would “move swiftly to formally intervene in the appeals process to uphold the lifesaving protections for people with pre-existing conditions and reject Republicans’ effort to destroy the Affordable Care Act.” In his ruling, Judge O’Connor agreed with the plaintiffs that the individual mandate could not be severed from the rest of the Affordable Care Act because it was “the keystone” of the law, essential to its regulation of the health insurance market. “The individual mandate is inseverable from the entire A.C.A.,” he declared. The judge said he would not “parse the A.C.A.’s provisions one by one,” but had to invalidate the whole law, including the expansion of Medicaid and the requirement for employers to offer coverage to workers. “The Medicaid-expansion provisions were designed to serve and assist fulfillment of the individual mandate,” he wrote. At oral arguments before Judge O’Connor in September, California and the other intervening states had argued that the mandate could not be unconstitutional if it was not forcing people to pay penalties anymore. But even if Judge O’Connor threw it out, they said, the rest of the law could legally be severed from it and survive. The ruling came a day before the end of the fifth open enrollment season for Affordable Care Act coverage in most states, one in which sign-ups for “Obamacare,” as the coverage sold through the law’s marketplaces is known, have declined so far by about 12 percent compared with last year.",The New York Times
2018,"Texas Tent City Housing 2,500 Migrant Children Is Said to Close in January","A tent city in the Texas desert that came to symbolize the mass detention of migrant children by the Trump administration will most likely be closed within weeks. An official with BCFS, the shelter operator that has been running the encampment in Tornillo, Tex., said late Sunday that the expectation was that by Jan. 15, all 2,500 children would be on their way to a parent or sponsor in the United States. “By mid-January, the children should be all released,” said the official, who was not authorized to speak with the news media and spoke on condition of anonymity. “We’re not extending our contract with the government.” The official said that BCFS’s contract would expire on Dec. 31, and that it would be extended daily until all the children have been released from the Tornillo shelter. Some children at Tornillo have been there since it opened in June, and minors at other shelters have been stuck for about a year. On Sunday, workers started dismantling mobile showers and restroom trailers, the official said. In shutting the shelter, BCFS would also disassemble tents, bring down power lines and cart away the furnishings — including bunk beds, washers and dryers, and medical equipment — that had turned the site into a mini-city for adolescents. Most had traveled to the United States from Central America to flee violence and poverty. Representative Beto O’Rourke, Democrat of Texas, had said earlier Sunday that the chief executive of BCFS had told him that minors were no longer being admitted at the sprawling Tornillo facility, which sits in his district on a barren patch of land about 35 miles from El Paso. Even if BCFS folds up the tent city at Tornillo, the government could try to find another operator to erect a shelter there. Evelyn Stauffer, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, did not confirm that the tent city would close. In response to questions, she said in a statement that the agency was working for the release of the minors “as soon as possible.” “Our focus is always on the safety and best interest of each child,” the statement said. “These are vulnerable children in difficult circumstances, and H.H.S. treats its responsibility for each child with the utmost care.” During a visit to Tornillo on Sunday with dozens of demonstrators, Mr. O’Rourke said the BCFS executive, Kevin Dinnin, had explained that only the lack of space on flights during the holiday travel season was preventing hundreds of minors from more quickly joining their families. Mr. O’Rourke said that since opening in June, the tent city had cost taxpayers $144 million, a figure the shelter official did not dispute. The price of sheltering a minor at Tornillo is about $400 a day compared with about $200 in brick-and-mortar locations. In revealing that the children would be released, Mr. O’Rourke said they have been “in a tent in the middle of the desert, in a kind of purgatory or limbo, not knowing when or if you will see your family again.” The impending closure of Tornillo follows a recent policy reversal by the Trump administration that is designed to speed up the release of about 15,000 minors who have been parked for months in some 100 shelters across the country. On Tuesday, the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the care of migrant children through its Office of Refugee Resettlement, announced that it would no longer require fingerprints for all members of a household where a migrant child is to live. Instead, fingerprints will be required only of the adult who is sponsoring the minor. The agency said modifying the policy was in the best interest of the minors, and a senior agency official said the government made “lousy parents.” Sponsors of migrant children who cross the border and are taken into custody of the United States authorities must still pass criminal and extensive background checks. But others in the same home will not be subjected to that extra vetting, which was introduced by the administration in June. As a result, it will take significantly less time to place children with their families, and their stays in the shelters will be much shorter. After a lull during President Trump’s first year in office, the number of migrant youths, typically adolescents, making the journey alone to the United States border soared in 2018. The enhanced screening delayed their release, stretching the shelters that housed minors to nearly full capacity. Most of the children at Tornillo have been waiting for the results of F.B.I. checks for everyone in the households of their potential sponsors. “Kids kept coming but none were being released,” said the BCFS official, adding that the screening had created a “terrible capacity logjam.” At its peak, nearly 3,000 minors were warehoused at Tornillo, which originally was intended to provide temporary housing. The facility opened in June with about 360 teenagers and its population swelled. Its creation and expansion highlighted the degree to which the Trump administration has taken a disaster-oriented, militaristic approach to the care and housing of migrant youths. Previous camps had been erected for about 30 days for those made homeless by natural disasters, such as hurricanes. Most of the children at Tornillo were transferred there from other facilities. BCFS, which is based in San Antonio, runs six other shelters in Texas and California with about 1,000 total beds. It initially signed a contract with the federal government to run Tornillo for 30 days; the Department of Health and Human Services began extending that contract on a monthly basis and then, in October, for another three months. The fingerprinting of every household member had inhibited undocumented immigrants from coming forward out of concern they could be deported. Indeed, the information has been shared with the Department of Homeland Security, leading to the arrest of some 170 immigrants. The lengthy warehousing of minors had come under attack from immigrants’ advocates, Democratic lawmakers and medical professionals, who had raised concerns about its negative impact on the mental health of the children. “All of us who care about the safety and well-being of children are relieved to hear that the appalling internment camp in Tornillo is reportedly being emptied out,” said Dr. Amy J. Cohen, a child psychiatrist and trauma expert who has interviewed migrant children in shelters. “One hopes that this means that it will be shuttered for good.” On Sunday, as dozens of protesters sang Christmas carols outside the Tornillo encampment, one bus with adolescents departed. The BCFS official said that on Monday, another 118 children were booked on flights departing Christmas Eve.",The New York Times
2018,Texas’ One-Stop Shopping for Judge in Health Care Case,"Sidebar WASHINGTON — When lawyers for Texas and 19 other states were deciding where to file a lawsuit seeking to wipe out President Barack Obama’s health care law, they had many choices. But they settled on a federal courthouse in Fort Worth, Tex. Forum shopping in litigation is common, and liberal lawyers challenging Trump administration initiatives like to file their cases in places like San Francisco or Brooklyn. But the lawyers in the health care case did more than choose a venue where the mix of judges was likely to include ones apt to favor their arguments. They effectively chose their own judge. That is because there is only one active judge in the Fort Worth Division of the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Texas. He is Judge Reed O’Connor, and he has quite a track record. He ruled for Texas in 2015 when it challenged an Obama administration measure extending family leave benefits to married same-sex couples. That decision came two years after the Supreme Court extended federal benefits to such couples and just months before the court established a constitutional right to same-sex marriage nationwide. He also ruled for Texas in 2016, blocking the Obama administration from enforcing guidelines expanding restroom access for transgender students. And this month he accepted Texas’s arguments that the entire 2010 health care law was rendered unlawful by a 2017 congressional action adjusting one of its provisions. Since 2015, The Texas Tribune found, Judge O’Connor has heard almost half of the state’s suits against the federal government filed in federal court in Texas. A new article in The Columbia Human Rights Law Review by Alex Botoman called for an end to such judge shopping. “As long as court procedures allow politically motivated litigants to pick their judges, the judiciary risks enabling, rather than combating, the growing view that judges are mere political actors,” he wrote. “That is a risk that a country committed to an independent judiciary can ill afford to take.” Mr. Botoman, a recent graduate of Columbia Law School who is now serving as a law clerk to a federal judge, drew a distinction between forum shopping and judge shopping. Congress created 94 federal judicial districts. Were cases filed in those districts randomly assigned, litigants would have no assurance of being heard by a particular judge. There are, for instance, 12 authorized judgeships in Judge O’Connor’s district, the Northern District of Texas. The problem arises because districts are typically subdivided into geographical divisions. By itself, that is a harmless convenience, allowing litigants to avoid traveling hundreds of miles to courthouses in remote parts of sprawling districts. But some courts also assign particular judges to particular divisions. Some also let litigants file their cases in any division of the district. That combination allows plaintiffs to choose their own judges. The problem is common, Mr. Botoman found. In at least 81 divisions in 30 district courts, he wrote, one or two judges hear all of the division’s cases. In districts that let plaintiffs sue wherever they like, he wrote, “having divisions with only a few assigned judges makes it easy for plaintiffs to judge shop.” A few courts make exceptions in politically charged cases, requiring them to be assigned at random across all of the district’s judges. That approach could serve as a model, Mr. Botoman wrote. “While judge shopping is always concerning, in cases between two private parties, any hardships that can be attributed to a judge-shopped outcome are typically borne only by the parties to the case,” Mr. Botoman wrote. “But challenges to laws and regulations are different.” “Because the effects of these cases are felt well beyond the original parties,” he wrote, “it is especially important to ensure that judge assignments are made with the highest degree of impartiality.” Such a change would not be hard to achieve, Jonas Anderson, a law professor at American University, wrote in a 2016 article urging action to prevent judge shopping in patent cases in the Eastern District of Texas. No congressional action was needed, he wrote, as courts have great discretion in deciding how to allocate cases within their districts. “The court itself can make this assignment procedure change with a simple memo from the chief judge,” Professor Anderson wrote. There was a small sign of change along those lines in Judge O’Connor’s district not long ago. Texas filed the family leave and transgender cases, along with several other challenges to federal programs, in the Northern District’s Wichita Falls Division. At the time, Judge O’Connor was the only judge in the division. In 2016, Chief Judge Barbara M. G. Lynn, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, took a modest step to constrain Judge O’Connor’s power, announcing that she would handle 15 percent of the civil cases filed in the Wichita Falls Division, to be assigned randomly. After that, Texas filed two cases against the federal government, including the one challenging the health care law, in the Fort Worth Division, where Judge O’Connor is the only active judge, along with two semiretired ones. He heard both cases.",The New York Times
2018,Thai Court Holds Bahraini Soccer Star Who Escaped Persecution,"A political refugee who spoke out against a powerful ruling family in the Gulf moved one step closer on Tuesday to being extradited to his native Bahrain by the Thai authorities. A Thai court formally extended the detention of Hakeem al-Araibi, once a star defender for the Bahraini national soccer team, for 60 days, during which Thailand’s immigration department can prepare his extradition. Mr. Araibi was stopped last month at an airport in Bangkok after a flight from Australia, where he had been living as a legal refugee after fleeing a crackdown on Arab Spring protesters in the small Gulf nation. Mr. Araibi was initially detained because of an Interpol red notice, an alert from the global police agency meant to inform nations about individuals with active arrest warrants, the Thai authorities said. While red notices are not legally binding, they can be used to detain fugitives so they can be extradited to the country where they were convicted of a crime. But red notices have also been abused by authoritarian governments that want to bring home critics who have fled abroad, human rights groups say. That is why Interpol over the past several years has instituted reforms that require the agency to vet each person who is added to the red notice database. Refugees like Mr. Araibi are also supposed to be exempt from red notices. Yet, critics say, Interpol has not been rigorous enough in ensuring that the red notice database is not being used to settle political vendettas. Nearly a week after he was detained in Bangkok, Interpol rescinded the red notice for Mr. Araibi, Thai officials said. By that time, however, Mr. Araibi was already behind bars in a country with a record of sending asylum-seekers back to countries where there is credible evidence that they will face torture or political persecution, including China, Pakistan and Bahrain. Thai officials said they were keeping him in detention because they had received an extradition request from the Bahraini authorities, based on a 10-year jail sentence for charges including vandalism that human rights groups say was politically motivated. “This is a guy with a public profile who’d fled a country where he made credible allegations about being tortured to the point that he was granted asylum in Australia,” said Bruno Min, a senior policy adviser for Fair Trials, a global criminal justice watchdog. “Why was the red notice on him allowed to be published in the first place? What this shows is that the system put in place is still not good enough to stop abuses from happening.” Bahrain has a history of using red notices to force dissidents to return home. In 2014, Thailand, acting on an Interpol alert, turned over another critic of the Bahraini ruling family to officials from there. The United Nations said evidence suggests that dissident was beaten severely during his journey back to Bahrain, and he remains in prison. In 2014, Mr. Araibi was sentenced in absentia to 10 years in prison for having vandalized a police station. Yet minutes before that crime supposedly occurred, he was playing in a televised soccer match. The judge who convicted him is a member of Bahrain’s ruling Khalifa family. After fleeing abroad, Mr. Araibi spoke out against a senior Bahraini soccer official, whom he accused of allowing the torture and imprisonment of members of the national team believed to have supported the Arab Spring protests in Bahrain. Some are still in jail. That official, Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa, also a member of Bahrain’s ruling family, is the head of the Asian Football Confederation and a vice president of FIFA, the international body governing soccer. In 2016, Sheikh Salman ran, unsuccessfully, to lead FIFA. Concerns over how his family was ruling Bahrain helped to scuttle his candidacy. Mr. Araibi said that he believed Sheikh Salman had failed to stop his torture. Last week, in a rare political intercession, FIFA, which was been plagued by corruption scandals, called for Mr. Araibi’s return to Australia. Australia’s foreign minister, Marise Payne, has also urged Thailand to allow Mr. Araibi to fly back to Australia. The protests against the Sunni Muslim ruling family of Bahrain were broad-based, with some 200,000 people, many members of the nation’s Shiite majority participating, human rights groups said. Mr. Araibi’s brother participated in the protests and Mr. Araibi said in a phone call from detention in Bangkok that his brother’s activity prompted his eventual torture. The sequence of events preceding Mr. Araibi’s detention at a Bangkok airport on Nov. 27 has led activists to question whether Thailand may have informed the Bahraini authorities about Mr. Araibi’s upcoming trip. In October, Mr. Araibi and his wife applied for visas to holiday in Thailand. In early November, that visa was granted. The Interpol red notice, which stemmed from a request from Bahrain, was only vetted and published after Mr. Araibi received visa approval from the Thai immigration authorities. “In the wake of Jamal Khashoggi’s murder, the repressive Gulf states seem confident that their global hunt of expat dissidents can continue without fear of consequences,” said Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, director of advocacy for the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy in London, referring to the killing of the prominent Saudi journalist in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Over the weekend, the Thai Foreign Ministry said that Thailand carried out the detention after requests from both Bahraini- and Australian-based authorities. “The detention was carried out in response to the red notice alert received from the Interpol National Central Bureau of Australia and the formal request from the Bahraini government for his arrest and extradition,” the statement read. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, along with the Australian Federal Police, did not respond to requests for comment. But it would be unusual for officials in a country that had given Mr. Araibi refugee status to have also reported him to the Thais. Australia has extradited individuals with red notices on them to countries where rights groups say they could be subjected to torture, such as Egypt. And it is possible for different bureaucracies within one country to work at cross purposes, rights watchdogs said. “Quite often, with red notices, we have seen that there’s not a lot of dialogue between two different bodies, like law enforcement and immigration,” said Mr. Min of Fair Trials, which has extensively researched abuses of Interpol red alerts. On Tuesday, Mr. Araibi’s request for bail was denied, said his lawyer, Nadthasiri Bergman. He will be transferred from immigration detention to Bangkok’s notoriously overcrowded remand prison while his case works its way through the courts. The process could take weeks. Mr. Araibi and his wife had wanted to spend a belated honeymoon in Thailand, he said. From detention, he described his bewilderment at how a planned holiday had transformed into the likelihood that he would be forced to return to a country where human rights groups say thousands of people have been tortured for their involvement in the crushed Arab Spring movement. “My wife and I, we want a vacation,” Mr. Araibi said. “I do not want to go back to a torture place.”",The New York Times
2018,"Thailand to Allow Medical Marijuana, a First in Southeast Asia","BANGKOK — In a region known for its harsh penalties for illegal drugs, Thailand is set to become the first nation in Southeast Asia to allow the use of marijuana for medical purposes. Thailand’s military government, which has called elections for the end of February, has backed medical usage, which must be approved by the nation’s monarch, King Maha Vajiralongkorn. By a vote of 166 to 0, the military-appointed National Legislative Assembly approved legislation this week that would allow the use of cannabis under medical supervision. Thirteen members abstained. The measure is expected to take effect next year. “This is a New Year’s gift from the National Legislative Assembly to the government and the Thai people,” the lawmaker who headed the drafting committee, Somchai Sawangkarn, said during a televised session on Tuesday. Thailand’s penalty for recreational use — up to five years in prison for possession of 10 kilograms or less — would remain in place. Marijuana can be useful in treating a wide range of conditions, including glaucoma, epilepsy, chronic pain and the side effects of chemotherapy. In the United States, California became the first state to legalize medical use in 1996. Now, it is one of 33 states that allow medical cannabis. Last month, Britain began allowing doctors to prescribe medical marijuana for patients with “exceptional need” after two children with epilepsy were denied the use of cannabis, which they relied on in their treatment. Some jurisdictions are stricter than others in defining which medical conditions can be treated with cannabis. In Canada, as well as several American states including California, the legalization for medical use paved the way for lifting restrictions on recreational use. But in Southeast Asia, there has been little tolerance for medical marijuana until now. In Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, marijuana traffickers who are caught face capital punishment. In Malaysia, a man who sold cannabis oil to patients was sentenced in August to death by hanging. The Malaysian prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, said in September that the sentence should be reviewed. In Indonesia, a British man told the BBC this month that he faced up to 15 years in prison after he was arrested with cannabis oil that he used to treat chronic pain from arthritis. Details of how medical marijuana will be administered in Thailand remained unclear. Only people authorized by the government will be allowed to plant or possess marijuana. Medical users will be required to have a prescription or medical marijuana identification card. Thailand is headed by the king, but the government is run on a day-to-day basis by the military regime, which seized power in 2014 after months of strife between rival factions. Parliamentary elections, based on a Constitution drafted by the military, are scheduled for early next year. Allowing the use of medical marijuana could win support from some Thais for military-backed parties.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | That Christmas When the Trumps Saw Red,"The conversation Anger can be power. But maybe it shouldn’t be. Ms. Collins and Mr. Stephens are opinion columnists. They converse every other week. Bret Stephens: Gail, I was all set for us to converse about Michael Cohen and the Russians.

Does Bush’s passing cause you to rethink the way you viewed him when he was in office? Gail Collins: I realized a long time ago I’d underestimated him — maybe when I started comparing him to his son, the walking foreign policy disaster. And now, of course, every former president looks great compared with Donald Trump. If Warren Harding had died this week, we’d all have been thinking: “Well sure his Secretary of the Interior went to jail, but compared to Donald Trump …” Bret: Agreed. James Baker was right when he said Bush 41 was the best one-term president we’ve ever had. The largely peaceful collapse of the Soviet Union. The successful reunification of Germany. Lightning victory in the gulf war. The end of the Noriega regime in Panama. The negotiation of NAFTA. The Americans with Disabilities Act. Also, the complete absence of malice. Bush 41 was probably the last president who refused to govern in a state of remorseless partisan war with his opponents. Obviously that wasn’t true of his political campaigns, particularly against Mike Dukakis in 1988, but it did typify his time in office. It’s almost hard to imagine that we could recover that style of politics. With that in mind, what are you looking forward to when Democrats take over the House come January? Gail: Infrastructure. Lots and lots of talk about infrastructure. One of the very few things both parties in Congress and the president agree on is that infrastructure is … good. Don’t know that they’ll get any farther than that, but if anything happens I’m thinking it’ll be about road repair. Here in New York we have a desperate, critical need to get a new train tunnel under the Hudson River. The existing ones are in terrible shape and if either ever has to be closed down, it’ll be a major blow to the economy of the city, the region and the country. So far Trump just hasn’t gotten on board. Reliable sources tell me it’s because he doesn’t want to pay a lot of money for something people can’t see. Anything you hope Congress will or won’t do? Bret: An immigration bill. But, yeah, infrastructure first. I say this with some reluctance, ideologically speaking. I think a lot of huge infrastructure projects are boondoggles of dubious long-term economic value — even if they create jobs while they are being built. And, as we’ve learned from the Second Avenue subway misadventure, it’s easy to inflate costs massively when the taxpayer is footing the bill and government isn’t controlling the costs. That said, every time I go through Penn Station I’m reminded of how awful our rail lines are next to every other developed country. And any time I fly from JFK to Hong Kong or another Asian destination I feel as if I’m departing from the 20th century and arriving in the 22nd. So, yes, infrastructure. Gail: I’ve always suspected that many conservatives hate mass transit because it just fundamentally offends their sense of individualism. That you can’t be the heroic American Man Who Rides Alone if you’re sitting in a car with 40 other people making multiple stops in New Jersey. But go on. Bret: There’s more than a little something to that. As for immigration, I liked our colleague Tom Friedman’s formulation from his column the other day: “A high wall with a big gate.” Not because I think the wall is such a great idea — the money would be better spent on personnel and technology, not concrete — but because I think it is a price worth paying for a path to citizenship for the Dreamers, an expanded H1-B program for high-skilled immigrants and their spouses, and other steps to make immigration to the United States fairer, safer and easier for every law-abiding person who wants to come and make this a better country. Gail: Good luck getting that past the president. And if we want to resolve the border issues, there’s also going to have to be a very big effort to fuel economic development in Central America. This really isn’t a problem about Mexicans anymore so much as impoverished refugees from the violence and hunger of countries like Honduras. Bret: Agreed. We need some version of a “Plan Colombia” for Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, modeled on the military and financial assistance the United States gave to Bogotá that successfully helped Colombians get the upper hand against insurgents and drug cartels. And that’s another one for the “good luck getting it past the president” file. Gail: But here’s something I’ve been meaning to ask you about: the report on global warming. The president just won’t buy the idea that it’s happening. I suspect that’s why he was so nuts about the California fires — he was babbling about raking the forests because he didn’t want to go near the real issue. We haven’t talked about global warming in a long time. Any reactions? Bret: Given the topic, I guess the first thing I should say, yet again, is that I do not dispute the science that climate change is happening and that much of it is man-made. And Trump and his administration should simply acknowledge the fact. I’m less clear, say, that we should attribute events like the devastating forest fires to climate change alone as opposed to a host of additional causes, including too many people living in fire-prone areas (and often causing the fires), as well as poor forest-management practices. I’m also skeptical that we have any genuinely practical solutions right now to climate change — at least solutions that don’t create environmental or political problems of their own. “Do something” may be an emotionally satisfying statement, but it’s a lousy guide to policy. I was reminded of this the other while reading a fascinating piece in The Times Magazine about the ecological devastation wrought by biofuels — which were seen as part of the climate-change cure just a few years ago. The riots in France sparked by the government’s climate-related hike to diesel fuel taxes are also a reminder that the term “climate sensitivity” should be a political term as well as an ecological one. Gail: It’s true that overdevelopment is one of the causes of the California fires — as well as all the terrible flooding in places like Florida and Texas. Interesting that the president never mentions that. Bret: We could do a lot to discourage people from living in places they shouldn’t be in the first place, for instance by ending or reforming the National Flood Insurance Program. Gail: Totally agree about the flood insurance. But not about your suggestion that just saying “Do something” is the worst possible response to global warming concerns. Worst possible response is to gut the existing regulations and then just say, “Wait and see.” Bret: Agree partially. The ethanol subsidies have been a fiasco. Cap-and-trade systems are prone to corruption. A carbon tax probably makes the most sense but tends to be regressive. My own view is that reinvesting in nuclear plants makes the most sense from an environmental and technological point of view, so long as you can reform the regulatory picture to make them economical. Gail: If you’re worried about solutions that create problems of their own, there’s the one about getting rid of the radioactive waste. One of the reasons I’m in the “Do something” camp is because there are plenty of strategies that would be helpful even if they didn’t turn out to do much over the long run for the global warming. We already mentioned mass transit, controlling overdevelopment of beaches and other fragile areas. Reducing car emissions makes the air better. Encouraging the solar heating industry and wind power gives us an economic boost. And if I go on I will wind up once again pointing out that the worst possible approach is the one the president is taking — overturning the existing anti-warming regulations and shrugging his shoulders as if the whole issue was slightly less important than the weekend golfing schedule. We spend a lot of time jointly beating up on Trump: Is there anything he’s doing that you’d want to praise with a little holiday-season cheer? Bret: Let me think …. …. thinking. …. thinking. Ah, O.K. Well, he didn’t completely wreck free trade this week, though the new NAFTA is worse than the old one and it isn’t clear it can get congressional approval. So I guess I’m mildly cheered that he has almost prevented a disaster he needlessly caused. What about you? Anything to like? Gail: Well … I do appreciate he doesn’t come back to New York for weekends any more. We’ve got enough traffic jams from the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree. Speaking of trees, I have to admit I’ve never been more fascinated with White House holiday decorations than this year. Those blood-red pseudo-firs are truly memorable. And sort of perfect for an administration that so frequently makes the nation go, “Yipes!” Bret: This is the new third-rail of American politics: Melania. And Melania’s taste. For reasons I don’t quite get, liberals and conservatives seem to have made some kind of tacit pact not to criticize her or her choices as first lady. They weren’t so kind to Hillary Clinton. But here goes: that was the tackiest White House Christmas display ever. Of all time. It looked to me as if Derek Zoolander had been brought in as style consultant. And that he, in turn, had subcontracted the task to Imelda Marcos. It looked like a staging for an avant-garde version of Federico García Lorca’s “Bodas de Sangre.” It looked — if looks could sing — as if “White Christmas” were being performed by Ozzy Osbourne just as he bit the head off a bat. It looked as if John Bolton had been chosen to perform an exorcism, sadly not on the president. Otherwise: pure class! Gail: O.K., that is the best interior decorating critique of the year. On the Trump plus side, the National Football League will be happy to know that, thanks to the president, I have developed a modest affection for professional sports. You have to live in Trumpland all week, but on the weekends you can turn it all off and watch people tossing balls around. You go to a party and rather than depressing everybody with talk of the latest tweets, you can just say “Hey, how about those Giants?” Or Rams or Bears or whatever animal mascot you like. Bret: Poor Bears. Shoulda beaten the Giants on Sunday. Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.",The New York Times
2018,"That Punishing Blockade? ‘We’ve Moved On,’ Qatar Says","DOHA, Qatar — For signs of how Qatar has adapted to the blockade imposed by its neighbors, you need to go no further than the Al Meera grocery in a strip mall across from a mosque, in a residential part of the capital. Shelves where local products were once rare now hold Qatari milk, Qatari tissues and Qatari cucumbers. “This is Qatari. This is Qatari. This is all Qatari,” a supervisor said, pointing out Qatari-made laundry detergent, dish soap and disinfectant. Producing such products at home may be business as usual for many countries, but for Qatar it was one of many defensive shifts made to survive a political and economic assault by its neighbors. Eighteen months after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt imposed a land and sea blockade aimed at bringing Qatar to heel, this tiny, gas-rich strip of sand jutting into the Persian Gulf is still refusing to capitulate. In the meantime, it has adapted, retooling its economy and foreign relations in ways that could reshape the strategic layout of the Persian Gulf. Qatar has beefed up its military, pursued deeper ties with neighbors like Iran, and doubled down on the maverick behavior that rankled its Arab neighbors in the first place, like breathlessly covering their scandals on its Al Jazeera satellite network. “We carried on; we moved on with our economy; we moved on with our life,” Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said this weekend at the Doha Forum, an international conference in the Qatari capital. Qatar still held out hope for reconciliation, he said, but the blockade had caused “a very deep wound among the people” that would be difficult to heal. Many countries would have collapsed under the type of restrictions imposed on Qatar by its larger and more powerful neighbors, who accused it of financing terrorism, interfering in their domestic affairs and growing too close to Iran. They were especially incensed by Qatar’s support for a range of activists across the Arab world, including the political Islamists that other Gulf monarchs consider a threat to their rule. Qatar’s leaders deny the allegations of interference and financing terrorism, and say what really angered their neighbors was the country’s independence, its refusal to march in lock step with the Saudi and Emirati leaders who have long called the shots in the region. The country’s vast wealth cushioned the blow of the blockade. Qatar dipped deeply into its $340 billion reserve funds to establish new trading partners, build up domestic industries and, in some cases, create new ones from scratch. This month, Qatar announced that it was leaving OPEC, the Saudi-dominated oil cartel. And while it remains a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a body formed to promote unity among the Arab Gulf states, Qatar expects little from it. Qatar’s emir, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, declined to attend its summit meeting in Saudi Arabia this month, sending a junior official instead. Discussing ways to end the blockade was not on the agenda. “It seems that the Qataris, the people as well as the government, have closed the door a bit on trying to get back into the G.C.C. at all costs,” said Andreas Krieg, an assistant professor of security studies at King’s College London. “They want to get this resolved, but the threshold for finding a solution to the crisis is very low.” Qatar would like progress on certain issues, like being able to use its neighbors’ airspace and some easing of travel restrictions for families separated by the crisis, he said. “Nothing else is itching or hurting them anymore,” he said. “The pain they thought they would feel they don’t feel.” In a meeting with New York Times editors last month, Foreign Minister Thani said Qatar was no longer spending its reserves to adjust to the new reality. “We are over the blockade,” he said, adding that, perversely, it had helped Qatar by pushing it to open new markets. Economists, however, say the blockade has sapped Qatar’s economy as the government has marshaled its reserves to airlift in supplies and stabilize banks. Tourism income and real estate prices have fallen, they say, and consumer prices have gone up, cutting into the budgets of the foreign workers who make up 88 percent of the country’s 2.4 million people. The Doha Forum pointed to Qatar’s new direction. The government flew in hundreds of businessmen, researchers, journalists and officials from Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America for the event. Lenín Moreno, the president of Ecuador, gave opening remarks, and Hassan Ali Khaire, the prime minister of Somalia, spoke on a panel. While previous editions of the conference featured speakers from Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates, this time Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran was given his own session. Adding to the Qataris’ swagger is the feeling that self-inflicted wounds by Saudi Arabia and the Emirates have given Qatar a free leg up. The murder of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in Istanbul has tarnished the kingdom’s reputation in Washington, and the United Arab Emirates are still dealing with the fallout over its conviction of a British grad student, Matthew Hedges, on spying charges in a trial that British officials said had no basis. Foreign Minister Thani said that the Khashoggi killing lifted the veil on Saudi Arabia’s “impulsive” leadership. “The world is starting to see what Qatar has seen for the last 18 months,” he said. Qatar’s foes have taken aim at Al Jazeera, demanding that Qatar take it off the air for its often critical coverage of Arab leaders and its sympathetic treatment of dissidents and political Islamists. But that demand has been a nonstarter, too. “Al Jazeera continues its business as normal,” Abdulla al-Najjar, an executive at the channel, said in an interview. The channel had been outlawed and blocked on digital platforms in the blockading countries, he said. But it is still widely watched across the Arab world, even in countries where it is banned, by viewers with VPNs. “We speak truth to power,” Mr. Najjar said. “This is why most of the Middle Eastern governments don’t like us.” Qatar’s biggest concern with the rift is security, which has led to increased investment in the military. Qatar recently extended mandatory military service to one year from three or four months for Qatari men and began allowing voluntary service for Qatari women. It has been buying top-of-the-line fighter jets from the United States, and is expanding Al Udeid, the largest American military base in the Middle East, which Qatar hosts. For many Qataris, the biggest blows have been social and psychological, as they have come to terms with their closest neighbors branding them as enemies and waging a propaganda campaign against them. “The biggest damage was to the social ties,” said Hizam al-Qahtani, a Qatari law student sitting down to a steak in the glitzy district of Pearl Qatar with three friends. All four had relatives on the other side of the blockade, they said. Some of the relatives had cut off all but basic communication, fearful of being accused of disloyalty by their governments. Others had cut off all contact. Mr. Qahtani said that his uncle, a Saudi citizen, had died recently in Saudi Arabia and that none of his brothers, who are Qataris, were able to attend the funeral. “He was buried there without his family present,” Mr. Qahtani said. His friends complained that they could no longer easily travel to Mecca in Saudi Arabia for religious visits or to Dubai for fun. One said he had enrolled in a summer program at an Emirati university but lost his tuition payment of more than $4,000 when the blockade began. Even if the crisis ended, the distrust would remain, they said. “Even if it is solved, Qatari citizens won’t forget the betrayal that happened and the fierce media attacks,” said Abdulkarim al-Qahtani, also a law student. “We cannot forget.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | That’s One Alternative Santa,"When we were about to make our holiday debut as parents, I informed my wife that we would be celebrating the season not only with Santa Claus but also with Hanukkah Harry. Mr. Ruttenberg is editor of the comedy journal The Lowbrow Reader. My wife was raised Catholic with a big C, and I was raised Jewish with a small j. As a tacit compromise, we are bringing up our daughter with such godlessness that when visiting my in-laws’ home, she mistook the crosses hanging in each room for light switches. Nonetheless, come December, there is but one figure who reigns supreme among her set: he of the ho ho hos. I know it sounds Grinchian, but the Santa thing irritated me immediately. In theological terms, there is little love lost between me and Judaism. But culturally — with my unwavering devotion to Stern on the radio, Roth on the page, Dylan on the stereo and kugel in the oven — I am a Hasid. So, when we were about to make our holiday debut as parents, I informed my wife that we would be celebrating the season not only with Santa Claus but also with Hanukkah Harry. “He’s the Jewish version of Santa,” I explained, a touch of sanctimony creeping into my voice. My wife, who grew up in Italy, seemed skeptical. “Did you learn about Harry at Hebrew school?” she asked. “I don’t recall,” I said, truthfully. “It was a Reform temple, so they mostly just talked about the Holocaust. But I definitely remember him from when I was a kid. At some point, there was even a ‘Saturday Night Live’ skit parodying the Harry phenomenon.” Accordingly, without so much as a single internet search, Hanukkah Harry entered our household’s holiday rite. During her first few Decembers, my daughter learned that while some presents came from Santa, other gifts — invariably the better ones — were from her beloved Harry. Naturally, she quickly grew to cherish both mythical figures, awaiting their bounty every season. Last year, I swelled with pride upon hearing her explain to a pre-K classmate that while a sock puppet was bequeathed to her by Santa Claus, the huge dollhouse came courtesy of Hanukkah Harry. Her playmate seemed impressed, if perplexed. That night, my daughter inquired about Harry: Why was Santa so prevalent yet Harry so scarce? Why didn’t her friends — even those who celebrated Hanukkah — recognize him? Could she see pictures of Harry? My daughter had recently turned 4, and it seemed as good a time as any to begin exploring her heritage. Together, we approached the computer and searched for Hanukkah Harry. The top result was a video: “The Night Hanukkah Harry Saved Christmas,” the very “Saturday Night Live” routine I remembered from my youth. I figured it would make a fun starting point. The sketch was hilarious — funnier than what I had hazily remembered. As it begins, we meet a bedridden Santa (Phil Hartman), chagrined that a stomach virus is preventing him from carrying out his holiday duties. In desperation, he calls on the one other figure with unlimited powers of gift distribution: Hanukkah Harry, embodied by the incomparable Jon Lovitz. As Harry fills in for his gentile counterpart, we follow him to the Christmas tree of two surprised children, played by Victoria Jackson and Mike Myers, whose hint of a mullet betrays the late ’80s air date. Mr. Lovitz portrays Harry as a menschy Yiddish grotesque, garbed in Borough Park finery and commanding a trio of airborne donkeys with names from the old country. As with much great ethnic humor, the heartiest laughs are drawn from observations finely tuned and oddly gentle. Harry spots a glass of milk awaiting Santa and becomes alarmed that it will spoil. He brings a coffee ring to Santa’s sickbed and repeatedly sings the praises of cottage cheese as a remedy. Informed by Santa that a boy has landed on the naughty list for speaking out of turn, Harry wails: “What, is that a crime? He’s a kid. Kids talk! I’ll bring him a little something.” I could not pinpoint whether this parodied a known stereotype. It simply reminded me of my Aunt Belle, so I laughed. My daughter laughed, too. Prime Jon Lovitz — his jowly face a Gary Shteyngart protagonist, his voice a pocket protector come to life — tends to draw that response, particularly among the unjaded. We still, however, needed to explore the roots of Hanukkah Harry, so I veered away from the video to continue our internet search. “Hanukkah Harry is a fictional character on ‘Saturday Night Live,’” Wikipedia’s entry read. “Typically sloppy,” I scoffed. “Hanukkah Harry made his ‘S.N.L.’ debut …” the AV Club wrote. “That’s weird,” I muttered. “Christians have Santa Claus, but in the ’80s, Jews got ‘Hanukkah Harry,’ courtesy of ‘Saturday Night Live,’” reported The Forward. My face dropped. The Lovitz sketch wasn’t a parody of Hanukkah Harry; it was Hanukkah Harry. In my haste to enrich my daughter’s cultural life, I had entered that sad realm of imbeciles who confuse satire for fact. What other horrible parenting did I have up my sleeve? Might I teach my daughter about the scriptures through Church Chat? Perhaps the wonders of ancient Egypt via King Tut, Funky Tut? Yet my daughter was thrilled. Repeat viewings of the sketch were requested; a Lovitz doll was called for. The character’s provenance was not her concern. Hanukkah Harry existed — and he was funny. She was right, of course. It isn’t as if Santa Claus — possibly dreamed up by pagans, aided and abetted by Coca-Cola — is some paragon of spiritual purity. Plenty of cherished seasonal rituals emanate from unlikely places, be it the cheesy musical that gave us Irving Berlin’s “White Christmas” or — I don’t know — some crackpot’s yarn about a can of oil outlasting its expiration date. The more I thought about it, the more Mr. Lovitz’s character seemed a worthy addition to America’s holiday canon. And so, this Hanukkah, I intend to fry latkes using my mother’s recipe (carrots are the key). I will present my daughter with her nightly loot. And as my fellow Jews the world over light menorahs, the eternal flames twisting through centuries to connect them to their woebegone forebears, my family will gather to pay our respects to Hanukkah Harry, the Not Ready for Prime Time Player who delivers toys to Jewish girls and Jewish boys.

2018,Opinion | The $25 Nap Is Worth It,"Hypercapitalism squeezes every last drop out of us. Mr. Marche is a novelist and journalist in Toronto. The season of the nap is upon us. It’s cold. It’s dark. It’s going to be cold and dark for the foreseeable future. Anyone reasonable knows in his or her bones that the proper course of action over any given afternoon for the next several months is to take a nap. And so late stage capitalism has, naturally, found a way to pose the question: What would you pay for one? At the Dreamery, an outfit opened by the mattress company Casper in Manhattan, naps are for sale. To be more precise, a 45-minute session in a darkened nook with peace and quiet is for sale for $25. To be clear, this institution is no pod hotel. It’s no Japanese slab in a train station for professionals with too many meetings and no real desire to return home. If you need a room for a transaction of a temporary and illicit nature, it is definitely not your place. This is a nap joint; it sells the idea of the nap as much as the nap itself. From the street, you pass through a blue tunnel, flecked with starry lights, to a room that looks like the bedroom of a wealthy child whose parents met at a Decemberists concert. Everyone speaks in hushed tones. Everything you might need to prepare for your nap is available: various lotions and balms, free toothbrushes, pajamas. “You miss a hundred percent of the naps you don’t take,” reads a little message on the mirror of the changing room. From there, a steward guides you into a quiet space filled with the hutches. You lie down inside, behind heavy curtains. When you’re ready, you turn off the light. Forty-five minutes later the light goes on again. Is a nap worth $25? The answer is obviously yes. Here, at this point in the argument, it is traditional for me to bring up all the studies that show the benefits of napping, the ones that describe how a third of American adults aren’t getting the sleep they need for optimal health and well-being, or the research from the University of Michigan that found that a group who napped for 60 minutes had significantly higher tolerance for frustration and more focus than people who didn’t. But really, you need experts to tell you that? Look around the world around 2:30 in the afternoon. [Discover the most compelling features, reporting and humor writing from The New York Times Opinion section, selected by our editors. Sign up for Sunday Best.] I’ve been a freelancer for more than 10 years now, working from home; the quality and quantity of work I can do emerges directly from my ability to concentrate. I do not understand how people have creative careers without napping. Every day at about 1 p.m., everyone faces the same choice: sleep until 2 p.m. and then work until 5, or daydream and drift around social media and take pointless meetings until 7 p.m. The friends I have who still work in offices inform me that their bosses insist they take the second option, that napping is equated with laziness. I genuinely find it bizarre. One piece of nap research demonstrated that if you nap properly, it’s like waking up from a full night’s sleep. You can double your day’s worth of concentration. Hypercapitalism works by squeezing every last drop out of us. New York, of all the cities in the world, makes that reality most apparent. The city that never sleeps is, on closer inspection, the city that just needs five more minutes. The day before my $25 nap, I caught a relatively decent bit of sleep on the E train coming in from Kennedy Airport. Half the train was napping. Homeless people, those left behind by hypercapitalism, seemed indifferent to the discouragement of the seat design. Some people had specific techniques. A nurse crooked her arm in the window well and turned it into a pillow. One guy managed to fold his head onto his knees and sleep that way. I can nap on the subway only if I’m in a corner so I can wrap my arms through the bars. The only problem with the $25 nap is the pressure the money puts on you. The clock is running, and naps are best when the clocks stop running, when the weight of slumber falls on you of its own accord. Still, the rest was delicious. What I purchased was the ability to concentrate for the afternoon. Under hypercapitalism, the most beautiful things are the surest signs of impending crisis. The nap seems like a luxury, or even a sign of weakness, a regression into infantlike torpor. Nothing could be further from the truth. In a gig economy, the ability to take a nap is a huge advantage. The availability of a proper nap for a reasonable fee is yet another example of how inequality works. People with enough money will be able to afford the naps that allow them to have enough intellectual energy to make the money to afford the naps. Eventually the luckiest among us will all be perfectly efficient mobile brains recharging in glamorous pods alongside our phones. It’s exhausting to contemplate.

2018,The 10 Biggest Upheavals of Lincoln Center’s Tumultuous Year,"Has there ever been a year at Lincoln Center more filled with tumult and change than 2018? Scandals rocked some of its biggest institutions; around the fountain there was a twilight-of-the-gods feeling. The Metropolitan Opera fired the conductor James Levine, who had shaped the company since the 1970s, after it concluded that he had engaged in sexual misconduct. Next door, Peter Martins, who had led New York City Ballet since the 1980s, retired amid an investigation into his behavior. (Both men have denied wrongdoing.) [See what our critics chose as the best classical events of 2018.] [And listen to our favorite recordings of the year.] The sped-up regime change at the Met and City Ballet came as the New York Philharmonic and the Juilliard School also had changings of the guard, if more deliberately planned ones. And it was not just Lincoln Center’s independent constituent organizations that faced turmoil: Governance woes continued to plague the center itself, which manages the campus. Debora L. Spar left as its president after just a year, Lincoln Center’s second leader in a row forced out early. New blood is coming in: Yannick Nézet-Séguin, 43, became music director of the Met; Jaap van Zweden, 58, became music director of the Philharmonic; and Damian Woetzel, 51, a former City Ballet star, became president of Juilliard. So, as 2019 dawns, many of Lincoln Center’s biggest institutions will be substantially different than they were at the start of 2018. Here is a look back. Mr. Levine helped define the Met, the biggest performing arts organization in the nation, for more than four decades. He conducted a staggering 2,577 performances there; shaped what was performed and how; and became the company’s public face through decades of telecasts. The Met moved him into an emeritus position in 2016 after he battled years of health problems — but still expected him to conduct often. The following year, The New York Times reported that several men had come forward to accuse Mr. Levine of sexually abusing them when they were teenagers or students of his. The Met suspended Mr. Levine, then fired him in March, saying that an investigation the company commissioned had “uncovered credible evidence that Mr. Levine engaged in sexually abusive and harassing conduct toward vulnerable artists in the early stages of their careers, over whom Mr. Levine had authority.” Mr. Levine, who denied any wrongdoing, sued the Met for breach of contract and defamation; the Met then countersued him, arguing that he had violated his duties and harmed the institution. The cases are pending in New York State Supreme Court. [Read about Mr. Levine’s firing, his lawsuit and the Met’s countersuit.] Mr. Martins, a former star dancer, had led City Ballet since the death of its founder, George Balanchine, in 1983 — for a few years in conjunction with Jerome Robbins, then on his own. He was credited with keeping the Balanchine flame burning; maintaining the quality of the dancing; and championing choreographers including Alexei Ratmansky, Christopher Wheeldon and Justin Peck. Then, in late 2017, City Ballet and its affiliated academy, the School of American Ballet, began investigating an anonymous accusation of sexual harassment against him. Articles in The New York Times and The Washington Post detailed allegations that he had been physically abusive. Mr. Martins announced his retirement on New Year’s Day. The company later said that it had not corroborated the allegations against him, but called for new policies to keep dancers safe. City Ballet is now being led by an interim team as it seeks his successor. [Read our chief dance critic on what his departure means for City Ballet.] Ms. Spar was brought in as a change agent. A former president of Barnard College, she was hired to lead Lincoln Center, the umbrella organization that manages the campus, home to independent cultural institutions including the Met, City Ballet and the Philharmonic. Lincoln Center also produces educational initiatives and its own artistic programming. It is a tough job. For most of this century, the center has been trying, without success, to jump-start a project to renovate the lackluster home of the New York Philharmonic, now known as David Geffen Hall. Ms. Spar’s predecessor, Jed Bernstein, was forced out of his post after officials faulted him for failing to disclose a consensual affair with a woman he had promoted. The center’s last successful president, Reynold Levy, who was credited with leading the $1.2 billion renovation of much of the campus, called his memoir “They Told Me Not to Take That Job.” Ms. Spar was gone in a year, pushed out after a rocky tenure in which senior staff members balked at changes she wanted to make. A budget deficit opened while she was in the position, and some board members faulted her for not addressing it quickly enough. [Read about what Ms. Spar’s departure says about Lincoln Center.] After a 34-year run leading Juilliard, with its prestigious music, dance and drama programs, Joseph W. Polisi retired in June. He built Juilliard’s first dormitory; added new programs in jazz studies and historical performance practice; and proved adept at fund-raising. He offered a warning of sorts in his final commencement address. “Rather than being a subject of pious platitudes, the arts must be viewed as an essential part of our existence which can be easily neutralized by an uncaring populace or an insensitive political leadership,” he said. “That is why you, our graduates, must be effective advocates for the arts in the time ahead.” [Read more about Mr. Polisi’s tenure.] Each summer since 1996, the Lincoln Center Festival has taken over the campus with visiting theater troupes, dance companies, orchestras, opera companies and performance artists. Until this year. The festival, which was run by the complex, was discontinued — to save money and to consolidate artistic leadership under Jane Moss, who has energized Lincoln Center’s other summer festival, Mostly Mozart, with more ambitious programming. The plan calls for beefing up the offerings of Mostly Mozart and the annual fall White Light Festival to make up for the loss of the summer festival. But how successful that will be — given the center’s recent deficit problems and its lack of a permanent president — remains to be seen. [Read our chief classical music critic’s take on a summer without Lincoln Center Festival.] As it adjusted to life after Peter Martins, City Ballet was jolted with another scandal: Three male principal dancers were forced out after they were accused in a lawsuit of sharing, through text messages, sexually explicit photos of women. It began when one of the men, Chase Finlay, was accused of sending to friends explicit pictures and videos of a young woman he had been dating to friends, without her consent, and asking others to send back their own explicit photos. He resigned. Two other dancers accused of sharing explicit photos, Zachary Catazaro and Amar Ramasar, were then fired. The trouble brought the rest of the company together for an extraordinary statement of unity at the start of the fall gala. “We strongly believe that a culture of equal respect for all can exist in our industry,” Teresa Reichlen, a principal dancer, said, reading a statement that she and another dancer, Adrian Danchig-Waring, had written on behalf of the company. “We will not put art before common decency, or allow talent to sway our moral compass.” [Read more about the upheaval at City Ballet.] On the eve of its season, the Philharmonic announced that it had taken the extremely rare step of firing two key players: its principal oboist, Liang Wang, and its associate principal trumpet, Matthew Muckey. Adam Crane, the Philharmonic’s vice president for external affairs, said that the men were dismissed after a five-month investigation of allegations of misconduct. He said that the accusations against them were sexual in nature but did not elaborate. Lawyers for both men have denied any wrongdoing, and their union has filed a grievance to contest their firings. The case will go to arbitration early next year. [Read more about the firings here.] Mr. Nézet-Séguin, the dynamic music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra, had already been tapped as the Met’s next music director before Mr. Levine’s troubles began. But as the crisis mounted, he moved up his start date to this season, two years ahead of schedule. His presence is already being felt. He and the Met’s general manager, Peter Gelb, have announced plans to collaborate with other arts organizations around the city and to commission new works, including the first operas the Met has ever commissioned from women. After he led his first opera as music director, a new production of Verdi’s “La Traviata,” Anthony Tommasini wrote in the Times, “I expected his ‘Traviata’ to be good, but not this good.” [Read about the start of the Nézet-Séguin era at the Met.] When Mr. Van Zweden, an exacting Dutch conductor, was named the next music director of the Philharmonic, some critics questioned whether he would be as committed to new music as his predecessor, Alan Gilbert. It had not been a centerpiece of his previous job, as music director of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, which made him the best-paid conductor in America, paying him a record $5.1 million in 2013. His answer? He opened each of his first three Philharmonic programs this fall with the premiere of a commissioned work: Ashley Fure’s “Filament,” Conrad Tao’s “Everything Must Go” and Louis Andriessen’s “Agamemnon.” Mr. Tommasini praised the decision to open the van Zweden era with the experimental Fure piece as “a strong statement of artistic purpose.” [Read about Mr. van Zweden’s countdown to opening night.] Juilliard reached into the arts world for its new president: Mr. Woetzel, a former City Ballet star who was credited with injecting new life into the Vail Dance Festival as its artistic director, and who has taught as a visiting lecturer at Harvard Law School. “Each of us has the chance to seize this moment, and to create a powerful artistic voice,” he said in his first convocation speech. “And to take that artistic voice and share it. We seek to foster a growing community of these voices. Your voices. Our voices together. A community that is open, and pluralistic, and recognizes that if it isn’t, then it is lessened. A community that furthers civil discourse, and knows that arts and culture are an antidote to division.”",The New York Times
2018,The 12 Best Book Covers of 2018,"We think you can judge a year by its book covers. The year 2018 was only four days and 90 push alerts young when I abandoned all prior delusions that it could be a quieter, more nationally introspective sun cycle than 2017 had been. Subtlety and nuance might be in fashion again in some distant future, but probably not this year. Confrontation would remain the default setting. To the (trivial) extent that book covers ought to reflect the spirit of the age, this year demanded that they be confrontational if not out-and-out blunt, topically and conceptually. Stylistic subversion was for the most part off the menu. A book about jazz standards would not be confused, visually, with a book about failing democracies. A memoir would, perhaps rightfully, look precisely like an internal odyssey. A romance between a woman and a fish would be unambiguous. Several of the covers that stood out to me featured inventive variations on the human face, as if the whole of publishing altogether sought to remind anyone shopping for books that humans who are not famous still do, in fact, exist — and that they matter. It’s an idea that seemed to be gaining the tiniest bit of traction at the end of this year. Perhaps I’m still deluded, but I’m hopeful that notion will continue to gain momentum as we head into 2019.

2018,The 17 Most-Read Food Stories of 2018,"Untimely deaths and the fallout from #MeToo drew many readers. They also flocked to stories on comfort foods and creations from Canada and western New York. The deaths of Anthony Bourdain and Jonathan Gold, the continuing reverberations of the #MeToo movement throughout the restaurant world, comfort foods both savory and sweet — these were the subjects that drew the most readers to New York Times Food in 2018. Cooks in India have long used pressure cookers, so it is no surprise that they have embraced electric pressure cookers. Nearly a dozen Indian cookbooks geared toward the kitchen tool have appeared in the last year. There are more electric-pressure-cooker cookbooks for Indian food than for any other cuisine — or for keto, paleo and vegan cooking. “I grew up in India, and the pressure cooker whistles — they remind of home, warmth, delicious food lovingly prepared and served. I would miss that sweet whistle if I didn't hear it in my own kitchen. To this day, to me the whistle at the end of a long day means the comfort of good food.” Ani Annamalai, New Haven Recipes: Pressure Cooker Shrimp Biryani | Pressure Cooker Punjabi Rajma | Pressure Cooker Chicken Korma There may be no more perfectly satisfying treat than a Canadian butter tart. It is small and sweet, bracingly so, with hints of butterscotch and caramel. And each bite delivers three textures: flaky crust, chewy top, gooey center. “These are, hands down, the most divine thing I make. I am a professional baker; my repertoire is quite large, but these little tarts, made exactly as this recipe states, are one of my most requested items. Part of their charm is that they look in real life just as they look in the picture. People are definitely hesitant at first; what is this, is it pecan pie, I don’t think I’m gonna like it. But once they taste it, they devour the whole thing and reach for another. Absolute delicious.” Aviva Recipes: Butter Tarts | Butter Tart Squares Invented in the 1950s, ranch dressing has inspired fandom beyond food: Sightings include bottles of ranch-flavored soda, ranch fountains at parties, ranch tattoos and memes, even ranch-and-pizza earring sets. And then there are the ranch superfans, who pour it on uni, instant ramen, ice cream and more. “I never thought I'd read a 2,000-word story on ranch dressing to the end, but this was fascinating. Chicken wings with a ranch powder dry rub is one of the most popular items at our local pub — served with ranch dressing, of course.” Michael Regan, New Hampshire Recipes: Classic Ranch Dressing | Ranch Dressing With Fresh Herbs | Double Ranch Mozzarella Sticks Procrastibaking — the practice of baking something completely unnecessary, with the intention of avoiding “real” work — is a surprisingly common habit that has only recently acquired a name. Almost anyone who works at home and has a cookie sheet in the cupboard can try it: medical students, romance writers and freelance web designers alike. “This is absolutely brilliant, borders on the philosophical, who knew I had a peer group. But today I resisted the temptation to procrastibake bread. I remained at the computer and procrasti-YouTubed videos about blockchain. It's coming all right. Tomorrow it's back to kitchen or laundry room for some other procrasti-tangible activity.” tancredi, Italy Recipes: Juicy Orange Cake | Kitchen Sink Cookies “Dessert was put on this planet in order to surprise us,” our restaurant critic wrote. “When did it become so numbingly predictable? It is as if every chef in town had decided that the only appetizer left standing would be the iceberg wedge.” “To paraphrase Samuel Johnson: When a man is tired of ice cream, he is tired of life.” ARG, NYC In many homes the act of brining remains a sacred Thanksgiving ritual. Pulling out the cooler and mixing up the brine, with its precise, unchangeable list of aromatics, is as much a part of the holiday as a game of front-yard football. But that is changing. “LOL. I didn’t realize people had been brining turkeys for 20 years. I was still thinking about giving it a try, but never got around to it.

I tried for years to figure out what is was. Finally did and I love it. The chicken melts in your mouth. On occasion, I add capers or artichoke hearts.” jo Recipe: Chicken Francese In the great food culture wars of the 21st century, the egg-spoon skirmishes may one day be remembered as pivotal. Conflicts over this long-handled cooking tool have fostered a social-media meme, a front in the #MeToo movement and a handcrafted version that costs $250. “Obviously no one has ever been camping.” Solamente Una Voz, Marco Island, Fla. The renowned musician and composer found the music at his local Japanese restaurant to be thoughtless, so he suggested to the chef that he could take over the job of choosing it, without pay, if only so he could feel more comfortable eating there. “Like many of the readers commenting on this article, I wish that restaurants would do away with music all together. It’s not that I don’t love music — (I do) — but when dining out, I want to focus on my companions and our enjoyment of being together, which is a different activity and mind-set than listening to a concert.” Catherine Hicks, Marble Falls, Tex. Jonathan Gold, the Los Angeles Times restaurant critic whose curious, far-ranging, relentless explorations of his native city helped his readers understand dozens of cuisines and the city to understand itself, died in July. The cause was pancreatic cancer. In November, the newspaper named two critics to fill his place: Bill Addison and Patricia Escárcega. In a New York Times article last December, more than two dozen people who had worked at her restaurants described a longstanding pattern of sexual harassment and verbal abuse by Mr. Friedman. Some said she had known about his behavior, which employees said included groping them and pressuring them for sex, and did nothing to prevent it. After months of requests from The Times, Ms. Bloomfield agreed to be interviewed because she wanted to add her voice to the narrative, and start to rebuild her reputation. “I’m glad April is now at the point where’s able to process her past and attempt amends. Sadly, hers is not a story of redemption. It’s a cautionary tale — when naïvete and a desire to escape the trappings of a common life collide with greed, power, and unchecked influence.” Wendy In April, before Mario Batali faced additional allegations of sexual misconduct in New York and Boston, the celebrity chef considered his business options. He is one of many prominent men brought down by the #MeToo movement. “Instead of talking about the damage he has done to women, he is talking about the damage done to his career and reputation. Need I say more?” J House, New York When Anthony Bourdain died in June at a hotel in Comar, France. investigators ruled the death a suicide by hanging. From an investigative standpoint, the only question left was whether Mr. Bourdain, who had a history of drug use, had any such substances in his body. “As I continue to read the article holding back my tears, I remember how remarkable human being he was. I did watch so many of his shows, although I never bought any of his books. I will go and buy some of his books, to continue through my reading admiring this amazingly accomplished person.” RBR, Santa Cruz, Calif. “He identified with the grunts, portraying himself as a slinger of cheap steaks and French fries. The grunts, in turn, identified with him, not because of his contributions as a chef — who can name an Anthony Bourdain dish? — but because he told the world what the work was really like. And once he left kitchens behind for a career in travel television, he didn’t lead his camera crews on a tour of the world’s most luxurious resorts. He went to Detroit and the Bronx, Libya and Beirut.” “Maybe Bourdain’s lasting legacy will be that more people will talk more openly about mental health.""

2018,The 2018 Good Tech Awards,"The Shift The words “2018,” “good” and “tech” probably don’t seem like they belong in the same paragraph, let alone the same sentence. But stay with me here. It’s true that this was a horrible year for many of the tech industry’s biggest companies. Amazon held a nationwide beauty pageant for its new headquarters, raising hopes that the company would help transform a struggling city, then picked the two places that needed it the least. Executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter got hauled before Congress to apologize for *gestures wildly in all directions*. One of Uber’s self-driving cars killed someone. And then there was Elon Musk. But the tech sector is more than its giants. Last year, I handed out “good tech” awards to a handful of companies, nonprofit organizations and people who used technology to help others in real, tangible ways. The goal was to shine a spotlight on a few less-heralded projects that may not get front-page headlines or billions of dollars in funding, but are actually trying to fulfill the tech industry’s stated goal of improving the world. I’m continuing that tradition this year, in the spirit of reminding us that although scandals and wrongdoing in tech rightly get a lot of attention, there’s good happening elsewhere. To Zipline and Swoop Aero, for using drones to heal the sick. For years, consumer drones were hyped as a new technology that would soon fill the skies over America’s cities, delivering packages and surveilling the populace. Luckily, that hasn’t happened yet, but elsewhere, drone companies are doing real work. One of these efforts is Zipline, a start-up that uses drones to deliver blood and medicine to medical facilities in remote areas that can’t be easily reached by traditional vehicles. The company began operating in Rwanda, where it says it has made more than 8,000 deliveries, and this year expanded to Ghana. Another is Swoop Aero, an Australian drone-delivery company that partnered with Unicef this year to deliver vaccines to the remote South Pacific nation of Vanuatu, where roughly 20 percent of children do not get properly vaccinated. One nurse in the country told The New York Times that the drone deliveries “will change my life.” To Upsolve, for helping people go bankrupt. For many low-income Americans, declaring personal bankruptcy can be a painful but necessary way to get rid of exorbitant medical bills or predatory lenders. But it’s often expensive to hire a bankruptcy lawyer, and hard to navigate the maze of paperwork. Upsolve, a nonprofit organization founded by a Harvard graduate and a lawyer, built a tool that has been referred to as the “TurboTax of bankruptcy.” The software collects financial information from users, automatically fills out their forms and passes them to a lawyer who reviews them before the user submits a bankruptcy claim. In 2018, it helped users in 47 states discharge a total of more than $13 million in debt, according to Rohan Pavuluri, the company’s chief executive. To Joy Buolamwini, Timnit Gebru and Anima Anandkumar, for calling out A.I. bias. Artificial intelligence will be one of the most important areas of computer science in the coming years. It’s also one of the least diverse. Just 12 percent of A.I. researchers are women, and the number of black and Latino executives in the field is vanishingly small. Three leading A.I. researchers are trying to change that. Ms. Buolamwini, a researcher at the M.I.T. Media Lab, is the founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, an organization trying to fight what it calls the “coded gaze” of biased algorithms. This year, she and Ms. Gebru — a Google researcher and co-founder of a group called Black in A.I. — released a study that showed that three leading facial recognition algorithms were substantially worse at classifying darker faces than lighter faces, and worse at classifying women’s faces than men’s faces. The study set off alarm bells at leading tech companies, and was widely cited as evidence of the need for more diversity in the field. Separately, Ms. Anandkumar, Nvidia’s director of machine learning research and a professor at Caltech, saw that the name of the A.I. field’s marquee annual event — the Neural Information Processing Systems conference, or NIPS — had been used as fodder for sexist jokes. So she started a #ProtestNIPS campaign to change the name, and drew up a petition that gathered more than 2,000 signatures. Eventually, the conference’s board relented, and the event is now abbreviated as “NeurIPS.” It was a small gesture of inclusion that could go a long way toward making women feel more welcome in the field for years to come. To Promise, Uptrust and Clear My Record, for helping solve our prison problem. Ending mass incarceration has long been seen as a political challenge. But these three companies are trying to show that technology can help. Promise is an app built to keep people out of jail. Aimed at pretrial defendants who cannot afford to post cash bail, it creates customized care plans for each user, sends them reminders of court dates and other critical appointments and allows courts to monitor their progress. The company, which participated in the YCombinator start-up program, recently raised $3 million from investors including Jay-Z’s Roc Nation fund and First Round Capital. Another start-up, Uptrust, offers a similar text message-based system that sends personalized appointment reminders to low-income clients, and can connect them to services that make getting to court easier, such as rides or child care. The service is already up and running in a handful of states, including Baltimore County, Md., and Palm Beach County, Fla. Code for America, a nonprofit organization modeled after Teach for America, built Clear My Record, a tool that helps people with old criminal convictions get them reduced or expunged, which makes it easier for them to find housing and get jobs. This year, the team formed a partnership with George Gascón, the San Francisco district attorney, to work on a new program that automates the process of expunging marijuana-related convictions under the state’s legalization laws. The group aims to remove 250,000 convictions by the end of 2019. To workers at big tech companies, for holding their employers accountable. The most heartening trend to come out of large tech companies in 2018 was a surge in employee-led activism. Protests by regulators, shareholders and users have thus far failed to stop the worst excesses of the industry, leaving these companies’ own employees — who are expensive and hard to replace, and therefore have lots of leverage — to agitate for change from within. At Google, a group of employees went public with concerns about Project Dragonfly, a secret Google project to create a censored version of its search engine for China. Their activism resulted in a petition, which was signed by hundreds of Google employees, to demand that the company cease work on the project. Another group of employees spoke up after The Times reported on the $90 million payout made to the former Google executive Andy Rubin, who was accused of sexual misconduct. Their efforts culminated in a 20,000-employee protest walkout. Workers at Amazon and Microsoft have also spoken up for change within their companies, on issues ranging from climate change to surveillance, A.I. ethics and the decision to work with federal immigration agencies. These workers didn’t solve every problem in tech overnight, but they have created a playbook for other employee activists to follow. More important, they have finally given their executives a measure of accountability — something they proved they will badly need in 2019.",The New York Times
2018,The 25 Best Classical Music Tracks of 2018,"Listen to our favorite albums of the year, music from the 15th century to the 21st. “Doctor Atomic”; BBC Symphony Orchestra; Mr. Adams, conductor (Nonesuch) “Doctor Atomic,” an opera that may be better heard than seen, shines more than ever in this recording, conducted by its composer. Gerald Finley is still the reigning Oppenheimer, though even more commanding is Julia Bullock, who sings Kitty with restrained intensity and moving lyricism. JOSHUA BARONE “Siren Islands” (New Amsterdam) This spellbinding album may seem like companionable background music. But whenever I try to use it as the soundtrack for some dull administrative task, Ms. Aftab’s weaving of electric guitar lines, synth progressions and vocal melodies ends up commanding my undivided attention. SETH COLTER WALLS “Bach: Complete Organ Works”; Marie-Claire Alain, organ (Erato) Recorded mostly on Danish organs between 1959 and ’67, Ms. Alain’s earliest of three surveys of Bach has made its first appearance on compact disc. A revelation throughout, it is more personal than either of her more consciously authoritative sequels, letting instinct have its turn, as in the “Dorian” Fugue. DAVID ALLEN “Bach: Solo Piano Works”; Vikingur Olafsson, piano (Deutsche Grammophon) There’s a quiet fearlessness to this album, which includes off-the-beaten-path selections and offers an array of ways to consider Bach, including through transcriptions by the likes of Busoni and Rachmaninoff. In meat-and-potatoes fare, Mr. Olafsson is a master of finding and exploiting unexpected pockets of musicality. J.B. Recordings by Johnny Gandelsman (In a Circle) and Hilary Hahn (Decca) It may not feel like the world needs yet another solo Bach album, but these two are essential additions to the pile. They’re impressive for different reasons: Mr. Gandelsman’s playing is buoyant and crisp, with the dancing spirit of folk music, while Ms. Hahn’s blend of historically informed performance and old-fashioned Romanticism has preternatural clarity amid symphonic grandeur. J.B. Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra; Manfred Honeck, conductor (Reference) The most interesting and innovative Beethoven recording since these forces set down the Fifth and Seventh, this intense “Eroica” nods in the direction of tradition but sounds completely new, rethought from the ground up. Just listen as the horns break through the funeral march, at once a pained outburst of grief and a call to greater things. D.A. Krystian Zimerman, piano; Berlin Philharmonic; Simon Rattle, conductor (Deutsche Grammophon) Bernstein mingles elements of Gershwin-esque jazz into the score for his ambitious Second Symphony. But on this recording, to their credit, Mr. Zimerman and Mr. Rattle do not overdo the jazziness. In this gripping track, the jazz piano riffs sound almost like pointillist strands of atonal music. ANTHONY TOMMASINI “Illuminations”; Nicholas Phan, tenor; the Knights (Avie) In his settings of Rimbaud’s symbolist poems, Britten captured the blend of bizarre, beautiful, decadent and courtly elements. These mingled emotions enliven Mr. Phan’s singing on this recording, starting with the opening “Fanfare,” in which, in trembling voice, he declares that he alone holds the key to this savage parade (of life). A.T. Leif Ove Andsnes, pianist (Sony Classical) This superb pianist plays the four Chopin ballades magnificently. I especially admire the way he conveys the narrative sweep of the episodic First Ballade in G minor, while subtly bringing out the melancholic lyrical thread that runs through this dreamy and stormy piece. A.T. “Clusters: American Piano Explorations”; Rory Cowal, piano (New World) Thanks to a rare (and stormy) Johanna Beyer suite that gives this recording its name — and an equally rare toccata-style work by Muhal Richard Abrams — this album’s one-two opening punch is intensely strong. Like Mr. Abrams, Ms. Davis is a celebrated pianist most familiar to jazz aficionados; Mr. Cowal’s performance of the finale from her “Eight Pieces for the Vernal Equinox” balances obsessive repetition with explosive melodic movement, successfully evoking her own playing style. S.C.W. “Impermanence”; Lorelei (Sono Luminus) The calligraphic squiggles and vocal arabesques of Franco-Flemish Renaissance music come alive in the full-bodied and radiant sound of this female vocal ensemble. While it’s fun to dip in and sample, the album unfolds its full mesmerizing effect when you follow the singers on their squiggly line through music history, weaving together the ancient and the new in wondrous ways. CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIM Bruckner Orchester Linz; Dennis Russell Davies, conductor (Orange Mountain) To my ear, Mr. Glass has been most consistently rewarding over the past decade as a symphonist. His Symphony No. 11 continues a few longstanding traditions. The first movement has his characteristic quality of grave propulsion, until some writing for the low brasses exhibits an unexpected lightness of step. The use of harp in the second movement is likewise arresting — at least until some gorgeous wind melodies take prominence. S.C.W. “Contemporary Chaos Practices: Two Works for Orchestra with Soloists” (Intakt) This composer and saxophonist has been a regular in Anthony Braxton’s recent groups. On this set, Ms. Laubrock shows how thoroughly she has absorbed some of his lessons, by writing two works for orchestras stocked with talented improvisers. Even better than the solos is her writing for the larger forces — which, on “Vogelfrei,” include punchy percussion, frenzied strings and winds, an ethereal choir, and the pianist Kris Davis. (Yes, Ms. Davis again!) S.C.W. “Life”; Igor Levit, piano (Sony Classical) After the death of a friend, Mr. Levit created an album-length meditation on how music continues beyond itself, through transcriptions, recreations, variations. The recording’s profound heart is Liszt’s transmutation of Wagner, in Mr. Levit’s hands a miracle of control and consolation. ZACHARY WOOLFE MusicAeterna; Teodor Currentzis, conductor (Sony Classical) Mahler’s darkest symphony takes on destructive force in this shock-and-awe recording by Mr. Currentzis, whose cult following is only likely to widen. In the tension between discipline and impulsive violence of this first movement, you can hear a kinship with Shostakovich and the music inspired by the 20th century’s cataclysms. C.F.W. “Songs and Structures”; Miranda Cuckson, violin; Blair McMillen, piano (Bridge) Listen to the next-to-last track on this recording of recent works by Mr. Meltzer and see if you don’t want to hear the entire album. It’s from his “Kreisleriana,” brilliantly crafted yet elusive music that seems at once playful, dangerous, waltzing and jumpy. A.T. “Catalogue d’Oiseaux”; Pierre-Laurent Aimard, piano (Pentatone) True to its title, Messiaen’s two-and-a-half-hour collection of stunningly difficult piano pieces is a catalog of skittish, tart and eerily beautiful bird calls. The achievement of Mr. Aimard’s matchless recording comes through in the second piece, “The Golden Oriole.” A deceptively tranquil harmonic backdrop keeps getting interrupted by evocations of frenzied, restless and captivating bird song. A.T. Max Emanuel Cencic, countertenor; Armonia Atenea; George Petrou, conductor (Decca) Flamboyant virtuosity and a toffee-smooth voice encompassing inky low notes are the weapons of choice for this countertenor on an album of dazzling arias by Nicola Porpora, a Neapolitan opera composer and rival of Handel. Under Mr. Petrou, the period-instrument Armonia Atenea crackles with intensity and zest. C.F.W. “Hush”; Nora Fischer, voice; Marnix Dorrestein, electric guitar (Deutsche Grammophon) Ms. Fischer is a singer equally at home in the Baroque scene and the world of pop. On “Hush,” she finally gets to have her cake and eat it with buoyant arrangements of songs and arias — like this one from Purcell’s opera “The Fairy Queen” — that sparkle with wit and love. C.F.W. “Frage”; Christian Gerhaher, baritone; Gerold Huber, piano (Sony Classical) Schumann is second nature to these lifelong partners in song, as this inexhaustibly perfect recital shows. “Der Einsiedler,” a setting of Eichendorff, stands in for the whole: fastidious sensitivity; utter refinement; getting to the heart of every word and, through every word, to the heart of the song. D.A. Boston Symphony Orchestra; Andris Nelsons, conductor (Deutsche Grammophon) Mr. Nelsons’s Shostakovich cycle continues with the sprawling 11th, which moved me to near panic when I heard it live in Boston. Much of the symphony’s seismic power is preserved in this recording — especially the second movement’s explosive climax, with coldly steady snare drums that conjure relentless gunfire. J.B. “He(a)r”; Nordic Affect (Sono Luminus) “Loom” begins with a thin thread of sound that is patiently roughed up and smoothed out in ways that seem both generous and brittle, with the light seeming to enter right where the texture appears most broken. Listeners equally equipped with patience and openness will be rewarded by this quiet and wise music, written and performed by women. C.F.W. “Klavierstücke I-XI”; Sabine Liebner, piano (Wergo) Ms. Liebner doesn’t blow out the dynamic contrasts in these pieces. Instead, she allows the unrelenting chromaticism to unspool patiently. The approach pays off in “Klavierstück VI,” which becomes a meditative dreamscape, running about 15 minutes over its usual 25-minute span. S.C.W. “AEQUA”; International Contemporary Ensemble; Steven Schick, conductor (Sono Luminus) This collection of Thorvaldsdottir chamber works is a tour of vivid sound worlds nimbly navigated by members of the International Contemporary Ensemble. At the album’s heart is “Aequilibria,” a piece with rich contrast and surprising balance between spaciousness — conveyed through airy fifths — and knotty smallness. J.B. “Tenebrae Responsories”; Stile Antico (Harmonia Mundi) The singers of Stile Antico could appear on this list every year, but their account of Tomás Luis de Victoria’s motets for the Holy Week is unusually fine even for them. The simplicity with which they move through this tale of the Cross is unsparingly moving. D.A. An earlier version of this article misstated the title of a work by Schumann.

2018,The 28 Best Albums of 2018,"Genre lines continued to blur and the definition of album shifted further in another year of upheaval in pop music. Jon Pareles The interaction of human and machine has been a major theme of Janelle Monáe’s entire recording career. Her latest concept album, “Dirty Computer,” deploys funky riffs (often with Prince echoes), snappy beats and crisp pop-song forms to promise that love, polymorphous sensuality and an inclusive American spirit can conquer all, even an impending apocalypse. Meanwhile, Monáe’s full-length accompanying video — billed as an “emotion picture” — is far more dystopian. On her fifth album, Mitski hasn’t figured everything out. Her asymmetrical songs are still trying to make sense of lust, love, life as a performer and countless contradictory impulses. But she has grown ever bolder musically, moving well beyond the confines of indie rock and chamber pop to try synthesizers, disco beats, country and more, while savoring the sweep of her voice. On her larger canvas, her dilemmas just sound more immediate. Intimate confidences grow dizzying and titanic in the songs of Josiah Wise, who records as serpentwithfeet. As he sings about love at its most devotional and all-consuming, his androgynous voice arrives as a multitude — tenor and falsetto, whisper and proclamation, moan and chant — and it appears from all directions. His vocals become dialogues, colloquies, choirs, armies and ghostly wisps, all part of an endless search for connection. The songs on “12 Little Spells” have extensive intellectual superstructures. The lyrics are tied to particular body parts, while the music flaunts its jazzy chord progressions, devious melodies, odd meters and cleverly interlocking patterns. No matter; Spalding sings her complex insights with such breezy charm that the songs come across as lighthearted, even lightheaded. Contemplating the current state of the world led Neneh Cherry and her husband, Cameron McVey, to write songs that mix meditation and puckishness, global concerns and personal reflections: “It’s my politics living in a slow jam,” she sings. Four Tet’s production sets her voice amid plinking, pinging loops and subtle beats, a surreally synthetic backdrop that somehow feels homey and organic. The Spanish singer and songwriter Rosalía Vila Tobella, now 25, immersed herself in the deepest traditions of flamenco before infusing them into thoroughly contemporary pop. With her songs on “El Mal Querer” (which could translate as “Bad Desire” or “Bad Love”), produced by the electronic musician El Guincho and others, she explores passion, jealousy and betrayal while handclaps interweave with minimal trap beats and the arabesques of flamenco singing segue into Auto-Tuned quavers: age-old sentiments expressed in the present tense. To celebrate romantic and carnal bliss along with career success while trying not to sound too smug, Ariana Grande enlisted pop-factory experts — Pharrell Williams, Max Martin — to clear ample space around her voice. Elaborate yet insistently skeletal tracks let her vocals tease, swoop, push back against pressure, blossom into harmonies and bask in satisfaction. And then, less than three months after the album’s release came a postscript, a single announcing that the romance was over: “Thank U, Next.” Sophie Allison, the 21-year-old songwriter who records as Soccer Mommy, got her start with home-recorded songs, and her official debut album, “Clean,” still relies on low-fi fundamentals: spindly but sinewy guitar parts and a voice that doesn’t hide its imperfections. Her songs grapple with desire, insecurity, betrayal and self-assertion, learning from every bruised emotion. Jupiter Bokondji Ilola, the son of a Congolese diplomat who grew up in Tanzania and East Germany but returned to the strife-torn Democratic Republic of Congo, leads a band, Okwess (“food” in the Kibunda language), that draws on rhythms and languages from all around Congo. It’s a statement of unity; it’s also a trove of ideas that happens to be magnificently funky, with a different groove in every song. The electronic duo Autechre delivered a magnum opus — eight hours of music — commissioned by the online London station NTS. It’s a fully imagined artificial universe of improbable timbres and rhythms, of repetitions cracked and warped, of long waits and sudden tangents, of propulsion and suspension, of expectations set up and undermined, of menacing implications and funny noises. Brittle, fractured, pointillistic patterns lead, eventually, to weightless, sustained rapture. The final track is nearly an hour long: a reverential, euphoric haze. [See the critics’ lists of the best songs of 2018.] Jon Caramanica From the indie-rock singer-songwriter Sophie Allison, who records as Soccer Mommy, comes a ferocious howl of an album that captures the tension just as the fear of internal collapse gives way to newfound strength. These songs are damp with derision, regret and desire, but never uncertainty. The year’s most promising pure pop album is from a painstakingly detail-oriented, emotionally wrenched, melodically ambitious soul and funk savant who’s just now, a couple of years into his run in the limelight, learning how to squeeze the most arresting of sentiments from the rawest of arrangements. The pop-punk of 2018 is hip-hop, and Juice WRLD is its best brat. On this album, he’s a lost soul — a victim of others and also himself — who’s never at a loss for melody. A double album that captures all the essential Drake modes: indignation, flirtation, celebration and more indignation. No one is better at internal narrative continuity than Drake, which is why he has the ability to make an album that’s utterly current while effortlessly blending with the Drake of yesterday. The children of Young Thug are alive and thriving — beautiful, abstract singer-rappers peddling street-corner psychedelia. Lil Baby is wiry and rough-edged, while the elegant Gunna verges on new age. Lean, sinewy, blues-inflected country music from a singer with a voice that’s thick but nimble. The still beauty in her singing is impressive, but her easeful storytelling feels practically radical. Broken records for a broken year. For more than a decade, Kanye West has released albums that shifted and reframed pop culture, making bold propositions about hip-hop’s dissolving boundaries. These albums are smaller than that — plangent ruminations that demonstrated that even amid all the tumult, not all of his instincts abandoned him. Cardi B, who arrived at rapping after stints of Instagram and reality-TV fame, isn’t much beholden to tradition, or to one particular version of herself. So what’s thrilling about this album is its variety — you hear her working through who she might become in real time, a quick study already leapfrogging to the front of the class. As the Weeknd has reached for the pop stratosphere in recent years, he’s shed some of the scar tissue that made his earliest music so transfixingly unsettling. This between-albums EP demonstrates that he hasn’t lost those abrasions. Sturdy songs about love. Sturdy songs about lust. Sturdy songs about faithfulness. Sturdy songs about growing up country. And one sturdy song about how political hypocrisy and its repercussions can drown out all of those things. Listening to Pusha T rap is like watching a skyscraper get built one steel girder at a time: Every step is carefully programmed, every angle is crisp, and the sum total effect is overpowering. Club music reframed as earth art. Hardcore that pummels locally and also reaches across the aisle. Shards of glimmering industrial anarcho-soul. The ghost of the 2018 year in pop that never was.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The 3 Biggest Challenges for Tech in 2019,"How privacy, security and employee protests will shape the year ahead for Silicon Valley. Ms. Fowler is an editor in the Opinion section. If you thought 2018 was a bad year for tech, 2019 might turn out to be even worse. This year was filled with revelations about privacy, security and cyberwarfare. Next year, the consequences of those revelations will unfold. And we should be very worried about what the future holds. Privacy Is Dead In 2018, it became very clear that Americans have no control over their digital information. We discovered that our cellphones could be monitored, and many of the apps on our phones are tracking us. We found out that Facebook shared our private messages with third parties and let developers using its platform harvest and exploit our data in order to influence political elections. Our data is perpetually being gathered, leaked, exploited, breached and sold. And perhaps worse is what the future holds. We most likely aren’t aware of all the companies that hold our personal data and what they are doing with it: the social media companies that know us as well as our friends do, the financial technology companies that sell our bank account transaction data, the messaging apps that hold our private photos and texts. But 2018 was also the first year of privacy protection in Europe: The General Data Protection Regulation went into effect in May. Despite the protestations of those who complain that G.D.P.R. places an undue organizational burden on start-ups, it could return privacy to millions of people living in the European Union. But those of us in the United States have no similar privacy protections. There is no way for us to know which companies have our data, and I don’t think that will change in 2019. I’m also not very optimistic that any significant legislation will be passed, especially given the relationships between some members of Congress and Silicon Valley companies. The only people who have a chance to hold tech companies accountable and demand better protections are ordinary people like you and me. And I think that we will fail. Many of us will delete apps. We will disable as much tracking as we can on our phones. We will delete our Facebook accounts. We will delete our social media histories and old emails and text messages. But it won’t be enough because most people will not care: The trade-off between privacy and convenience will be worth it to them, because the loss of their privacy will have little to no impact on their day-to-day life. Most people will read (or perhaps ignore) the news stories about every new privacy scandal, and they will then go back to their phones. The End of Security There were some very large and frightening data breaches this year. Quora was hacked, and 100 million user accounts were compromised. Facebook was hacked, and 50 million users were affected. Google+ user information was compromised, and Facebook was hacked again, disclosing that it gave developers access to photos that users had uploaded but never posted. Then we learned that the Google+ vulnerabilities were worse than we initially knew. And then Marriott realized it had been hacked, exposing the personal data of 500 million people. The knee-jerk response this year has been to say that these companies need stronger punishments for security breaches, or that we need to regulate tech companies. This response is appropriate in cases where the breach is a result of poor security practices, as appears to have been the case in the 2017 Equifax breach. But some of this year’s breaches were different: The Marriott and Quora hacks seem to have been the work of malicious hackers, and in the case of Marriott, the hackers are reported to have been Chinese government spies. It’s not clear that these breaches were a result of poor security practices or corporate negligence. The truth is — and I say this as someone who has worked in Silicon Valley as an engineer — the security teams and security practices at Google and Facebook are among the best in the world. It’s not clear that stronger punishments or more regulation will fix the problem or prevent these kinds of data breaches from happening. Being the best in the world when it comes to security and following the best security practices have not protected these companies, and, ultimately, they have not kept our data safe. We will see more of these breaches in the coming year, at large companies, and our data will be exploited in ways we never could have dreamed of. Preventing these companies from storing our data would, ultimately, protect it, but the chances that will happen are slim to none. Instead, as these security breaches become routine, engineers and their employers will accept them as an inevitability and treat them (at least internally) as a nonevent — much the same as credit card companies and credit card users treat credit card fraud today. There’s a lot at stake. The spies from foreign governments hacking into American companies aren’t trying to destroy you, me or any specific individuals living in the United States — they are trying to destroy the country that we live in. Tech’s Anti-Government Stance Employees at tech companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft have begun to organize. In response to an employee walkout at Google, the company changed the way it enforces forced arbitration agreements in sexual harassment cases. The company also dropped out of a competition to provide cloud computing services to the Pentagon after employees protested the company’s involvement. Some of the internal protests at these companies centered on civil rights issues, such as the way that victims of sexual harassment are treated. Others, like the outcry about Google’s Project Dragonfly (a censored search engine Google was building for China), were related to freedom of expression. However, a majority of the employee protests and complaints seem to have been about government-related projects. At Salesforce, hundreds of employees signed a petition asking the company to cease working with United States Customs and Border Protection. At Microsoft, employees circulated an open letter urging the company to stop working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and also complained about the company’s bid for the Pentagon’s cloud computing contract — the very same one that Google employees pressured their employer about. And, at Amazon, employees protested the company selling its Amazon Web Services products to the United States government. It’s not entirely clear if these employees are opposed to working with the government in general, reflecting Silicon Valley’s strong libertarian leanings, or if they are only opposed to working with the government under the Trump administration. As the historian Margaret O’Mara has argued, Silicon Valley has long been in the business of war. Amazon, Google and Microsoft were selling their commercial services to (and building customized services for) the United States government long before Donald Trump took office. But I don’t recall any open letters, protests or walkouts being staged during the Obama administration. The United States is under siege from foreign governments and malicious hackers. And Silicon Valley’s products are the battlefields where the war is being fought. The Russian government influenced elections in the United States through misinformation that was spread on social media, and foreign hackers phished government officials in order to gain access to their email accounts. An investigation by Politico Magazine found that Chinese and Russian spies are working at Silicon Valley companies, where they were planted to “steal U.S. technology secrets” and to engage in “traditional political intelligence gathering, influence and perception-management operations in California.” And it’s not just professional spies who are doing the spying: The same investigation by Politico found that Chinese nationals working in Silicon Valley are often threatened by the Chinese government and coerced into providing their government with this information. The United States is engaged in cyberwarfare with China and Russia, in which tech companies are inevitably involved. Employees of these same tech companies are pushing their employers to drop contracts with the United States government. If they succeed, who is going to win the war?

2018,"The 4 ‘Attachment Styles,’ and How They Sabotage Your Work-Life Balance","Our subconscious programming — developed through our youth and on into adulthood — plays a huge role in how we survive or thrive at work. Here’s how your “attachment style” may affect your office relationships. Your better mind knows exactly how to manage your time better at work but a primal, seemingly uncontrollable urge to do the opposite overtakes you. You know you should say no when you’re asked to take on that new project, but you say yes. Or you know your boss said your report was good enough, but you work until midnight perfecting it. Or you’re just stuck — wanting to do better but unsure that trying will help — so you do nothing. If you are frustrated with your seemingly irrational behavior, the root issue may be deep subconscious programming known as your “attachment style.” Your attachment style dictates how you relate to other people, particularly in situations that trigger stress. Attachment style discussions typically arise in relation to the bond between parents and children or romantic partners, but in my work as a time management coach, I’ve seen that individuals can also “attach” differently in the workplace. Here’s how to identify your attachment style, and take control of how you manage your time. A fear of upsetting others drives individuals with an anxious preoccupied attachment style. This fear-based approach leads to counterproductive behaviors — for example, struggling with a compulsion to check email incessantly to make sure everything is “O.K.” If you operate from an anxious attachment style, you will have at least two major time management struggles. The first is that your attention will get hijacked whenever you experience a perceived “threat.” You will feel negative bias — the email from the client must be a complaint and the lack of acknowledgment from the boss means she is already looking for my replacement. Although these thoughts may be true, they likely are not. But your anxious brain jumps to negative conclusions and gets obsessed with issues until they are resolved. The second time management issue is a severe allergy to setting boundaries. The idea of saying no may terrify you. To improve your time management, you’ll need to calm your nervous system to get out of fight-or-flight mode every time something happens at work. The best calming strategies include positive self-talk and peer support. In terms of self-talk, it may sound something like “Let’s wait and see what happens” or “Everything will be O.K.” If you still feel agitated, you may need to ask for support to get clearheaded enough to move forward. That could mean addressing the situation directly with a client or colleague or talking to an outside person for reassurance. And when it comes to setting boundaries, you can start with something subtle like staying off email after you leave the office. That way you don’t need to say, “No, I can’t do this tonight.” You simply don’t know about the assignment until the next day. [Like what you’re reading? Sign up here for the Smarter Living newsletter to get stories like this (and much more!) delivered straight to your inbox every Monday morning.] Individuals with dismissive avoidant attachment at work tend to think they are smart and everyone else is stupid. Well, maybe not exactly stupid, but definitely not as smart as they are. They most likely decide what they should do and then ignore what others want. This leads to conflict and mistrust. This mistrust can lead to others attempting to micromanage and monitor them, which just makes them more annoyed and more likely to dismiss input. For those around you, your biggest time management issue is most likely that you miss deadlines and don’t do the work that they consider most important. From your perspective, the biggest time management issue tends to be working late. Long hours usually arise when you get fixated on doing a particular project really well. Or they can happen because you want to work on what you consider to be important first and then you also have to complete work for others. To make a change, you need to start by acknowledging that other people may have a point. You may not agree with their stated priorities, you may think you know better, and you may even think that the work is stupid. But if you want to achieve greater success, have people micromanage you less and work fewer hours, there will be times when you are better off listening to and doing what other people say. To make this shift, you may need to consciously work on your emotional intelligence, including recognizing that an idea different from yours is not necessarily wrong and that there is value in working harmoniously with others. “Stuck” is the best word to describe those with a fearful avoidant attachment style. They have the fear of those with anxious attachment without the confidence that they can make things right. Someone with anxious attachment would quickly open a potentially “threatening” email and reply to it as quickly as possible to avert danger. Someone with a fearful avoidant attachment style would see the email, freak out about it and then never open it. Never reading the email creates a compounding paralyzing dread. They fear bad outcomes so strongly they never discover if the email from a client was simply an F.Y.I. or a full-out tirade. They don’t trust themselves or the system, so there is an undercurrent of “why even try?” in their day-to-day work. You tend to spend most of your time in a state of being overwhelmed because you fear everything and feel very little power to do anything about your fears (much less the work that is also piling up). This leads to your trying to avoid all of it and escape, get lost in social media, try organizing and reorganizing your desk, and perpetually think about how to explain why your work isn’t done. If you fall into this pattern, you’ll need a two-prong strategy. The first involves reducing your fear response. Try some of the calming strategies we suggested for people who have an anxious attachment style, such as positive self-talk and support from colleagues or friends. Then you will need to take gentle action to get your work done. Set some goals for yourself. It may start with opening one email a day that scares you, or with working just 15 minutes on a project you have avoided for weeks — or longer. Small bits of progress where you realize you can do something and it didn’t kill you lead to greater success later. Those with a secure attachment style at work take tasks as they come, do what they can and address issues that come up easily. They work hard and do not fear saying no when they feel they need to. They know they are capable, and they are confident that others will respond well to them. You generally fare best when it comes to managing your time. You are comfortable prioritizing tasks and asking for help when you need it. You also feel comfortable setting healthy boundaries and pushing back when necessary, and you do not often engage in fear-based behavior. If you have a secure attachment style at work, you are most likely managing your time well and achieving good work-life balance. Stay secure but be aware. Regularly ask for direct feedback so if there is something that you need to work on, you can make changes. Also, if you notice something seems really off, for example a big downgrade in the quality of communication with your manager, don’t dismiss it as, “Oh, she is just stressed.” Do a quick follow-up either in person or via email, saying: “I noticed that we’re not communicating as well as in the past. Is there anything I’ve done that’s contributed to that shift?” Although attachment style is not the only factor influencing your time management, it may play a significant role, particularly if you find yourself repeatedly compelled to act against what you “know” to do. As with attachment style in your personal life, attachment style at work can vary based on situation or circumstance. In one job or with one particular person or project, you may have an anxious attachment style, and in another circumstance, you may display more secure characteristics. Wherever you find yourself, improving how you manage your time starts with identifying what kind of attachment style you have and then taking steps to address it.

2018,The 65 Best Songs of 2018,"One-off collaborations, movie soundtracks and internet upstarts provided some of the most exciting music this year. Jon Pareles In a swirl of harplike arpeggios over a stubborn beat, Matty Healy rails at hypocrisy and disinformation, complaining “Modernity has failed us,” and admits to individual ambition despite it all: a millennial’s plight. Desolate lost love haunts the verses before determined self-preservation lifts the choruses, all at a tempo so slow only a singer like Sade would dare it. Roots rock goes noir, with tolling piano and reverbed guitar, in a ballad about a lasting trauma, unnamed but inescapable. Over mournful electric-piano chords, Jorja Smith warns that in a rough neighborhood, panic can be deadly, counseling, “Don’t you run when you hear the sirens coming.” Post-breakup revenge is served cold, unforgiving and viscous in “Look What U Started,” from its skulking bass line and squishy rhythm guitar to the chilling whisper of Syd’s vocal. A perfectly calibrated power ballad, with the Lady Gaga chorus trademark of repeated syllables, does movie-musical triple duty as love song, vocal showcase and plot pivot. Far more ambitious than a movie theme has to be, and far more abrasive, “Black Panther” celebrates a broad African heritage over a track that broods, stomps and bristles. Fatouma Diawara, a Paris-based singer who grew up in Mali, sings about love for an emigrant who may never return, lacing Malian rhythms with tendrils of guitar. Over a Bo Diddley beat, Richard Thompson longs for a cleansing apocalypse, and summons it with a wailing, clawing guitar solo. With guests from Puerto Rico and Colombia over a sample of Pete Rodriguez’s 1966 boogaloo “I Like It Like That,” Cardi B flaunts Latin roots while making designer-label materialism sound like self-realization. Loops of plucked violin and layers of vocals add up to a statement of no-nonsense, matter-of-fact individualism from Brittney Parks, who records as the one-woman electronic band Sudan Archives. The vamp is insistently jaunty, the rhymes are delivered with a jokey cadence and there are melodic interludes, but the recurring subject is serious: gun violence. The indie-rock songwriters Lucy Dacus, Julien Baker and Phoebe Bridgers, collaborating as boygenius, share a not-exactly-love song that passionately questions itself. As her production taps out cross-rhythms like a flock of woodpeckers, Marie Davidson’s spoken words demand nonstop work: a gig-economy ultimatum. Loneliness and moderate depression find a tambourine-tapping equilibrium, with distant hints of the Beach Boys. [See the critics’ lists of the best albums of 2018.] Jon Caramanica With no album or even a mixtape to speak of, Bad Bunny made himself indispensable this year by way of strategic collaborations and scene-stealing, rug-pulling moments. These songs represent only a fraction of his high points, but capture the range of his influence — from the definitive Spanish-language song of the summer to getting Drake to rap in Spanish to topping the Billboard Hot 100. In a year in which Spanish-speaking artists teamed with English-speaking artists in droves hoping to make an aftermarket “Despacito,” Bad Bunny stayed his course, and the world came to him. Cutting, spare, wide-eyed, seismic. The return of 1994 R&B. Head-stomp koans for runways and back alleys alike. The sweet spot where vocalists blur into each other, and words blur into raw feeling. From “A Star Is Born,” the place where misery meets triumph. An unhinged loosie from two unbothered buddies. A stripped-bare evocation of street-corner grief. Not a plea, but an insistent statement of purpose. Spooky and unflustered tough talk. Howitzer vocals applied to the realization that not everything can be solved with Howitzer vocals. The sound of blood rushing through arteries and sweat forming at the brow. Proof that tremendous sweetness can be extracted from deep angst.

VARIETY PUZZLE — Caitlin Lovinger writes the weekend columns while I am off doing other puzzly things, so it has been a while since I’ve solved an acrostic. I had forgotten how much fun they are, and how satisfying it is to toggle back and forth from solving the clues to guessing the words from the filled-in letter patterns in the quote. My pre-New Year’s resolution is to get back into solving these, just for fun. I walked into today’s puzzle — that’s a hint, but not a spoiler — with Q’s “1982 Sydney Pollack comedy,” the classic “TOOTSIE.” Next up for me was MAE WEST’s quote, “I like restraint, if it doesn’t go too far.” ETSY was another gimme for me, as I just bought a buffet table from a furniture reseller on the site. Clue C’s BAY LEAF tripped me up; I had PARSLEY at first. And I had to run the alphabet in my head to remember that the typewriter brand in clue T was OLIVETTI.

2018,"The African Toll of the Great War, in Song and Shadows","Critic’s Pick A fiercely beautiful historical pageant by the South African artist William Kentridge commemorates a million Africans who died in World War I. Though only some of this year’s centenary commemorations have acknowledged it, the European armies fighting in the trenches comprised more than Europeans alone. World War I was also fought by African, Asian, Caribbean and Polynesian troops, who came to the Western Front by choice or conscription. Even less acknowledged is the death toll of soldiers, laborers and civilians on the African continent, whose fatalities probably exceeded one million, according to the International Encyclopedia of the First World War. From Namibia to Morocco, Cameroon to Tanzania, Africans served, fought and succumbed to violence or disease — and when it was over, the powers signing the peace treaty in Versailles gave them nothing at all. The South African artist William Kentridge has turned to this shamefully unacknowledged theater of the Great War in “The Head and the Load,” a fiercely beautiful historical pageant of music, movement and shadow play that reanimates these lost African combatants, who principally served as porters under British, French, Belgian and German command. It had its premiere this summer at Tate Modern in London, where it formed part of the British commemorations of World War I, and has come to New York for a two-week run at the Park Avenue Armory. “The Head and the Load” — its title plays on the Ghanaian proverb: “The head and the load are the troubles of the neck” — follows a number of acclaimed operas Mr. Kentridge has directed. Its hand-drawn video projections and low-tech props will be familiar to audiences who saw his high-speed “Nose” or his immense “Lulu” at the Metropolitan Opera. Yet this musical work is a more pressing, even ferocious production, with immediate relevance to today’s debates on the endurance of colonial legacies in our views of recent history. For “The Head and the Load,” Mr. Kentridge has rotated the usual orientation of bleachers in the Armory’s cavernous Drill Hall. You sit facing south, looking at a long, narrow runway for a troupe of nearly three dozen singers, dancers and musicians — led by the excellent South African actors Mncedisi Shabangu and Hamilton Dlamini, who take on multiple roles in multiple languages. (Respect, too, to the Armory’s legal team, who procured so many South African performers’ visas when the Trump administration has made clearance tougher than ever.) The performers usually appear in flat, linear formations, and cast shadows upon Mr. Kentridge’s projections of soldiers, birds, and war-scarred landscapes from Flanders to Kenya, executed on dictionary pages or on the ledgers of colonial companies. A clattering score by the composers Philip Miller and Thuthuka Sibisi (the latter serving as conductor) interweaves modernist motifs with Christian spirituals and with southern and western African modes, while a dancer in a gas mask (Sipho Seroto) keeps watch throughout. The large majority of Africans who died on the continent in World War I were porters, or “carriers,” forced to move cannons, machine guns, officers’ gramophones and even ships across thousands of inhospitable miles, removing thousands of trees through the dense jungle. Mr. Shabangu recounts the harrowing transport of British boats dragged overland from Cape Town all the way to Lake Tanganyika — contested by Britain, Belgium and Germany — by men who rarely survived the full trip. Mr. Dlamini, taking the role of a European officer, justifies his barbarity this way: “They are not men because they have no name. They are not soldiers because they have no number. You don’t call them, you count them.” “The Head and the Load” evokes these porters’ crushing, fatal labor in a long grief-stricken procession, backed by a plangent elegy from the marvelous Guinean singer and kora player N’Faly Kouyaté. The troupe marches one by one in front of Mr. Kentridge’s mucky charcoal animations, carrying cutout placards of flags, boats, gramophones and planes, as well as portrait busts of African intellectuals and an effigy of Raoul Hausmann’s “Mechanical Head,” a Dada artifact of 1919. Their real shadows intermingle with projected ones, creating an infinite funerary march of porters and matériel. Later we see malnourished men marching through the savanna, struggling to stand at attention, while Mr. Kentridge’s layered drawings unspool behind them. Intellectuals deplore the colonial burden; bloodthirsty Europeans rant that African life is cheap. One African soldier recounts his insomnia after killing a white man for the first time, though he shot down other blacks without regard. All of it is performed in a cascading blend of English, French, and German with Zulu, Xhosa, Swazi, and Swahili, not to mention high-speed nonsense verse. The to and fro of languages marks this production’s clear debt to Dada — and one of the prime virtues of “The Head and the Load” is its insistence on Africa’s place in both the European war and in European modern art. The actors recite the gibberish of Kurt Schwitters’s “Ursonate,” a monument of Dadaist writing, while Mr. Kentridge projects chopped-up maps and slapdash demarcations of the continent — as if the Cabaret Voltaire were a second Berlin Conference. The chorus imitates the whirring of air raid sirens and the rat-a-tat of machine guns, as in Hugo Ball’s sound poetry. Dancers wear giant, parabolic earpieces designed for aircraft detection; when you look at the dancers’ shadows, they bear a kinship to the bold geometry of Dogon or Bamileke masks, so key to Dada’s development in Europe. Mr. Kentridge has made frequent use of shadows, projections and processions, most recently in “More Sweetly Play the Dance,” a panoramic video seen at the Marian Goodman Gallery in London in 2015. The visual language of “The Head and the Load” heavily recalls that video work, and several projections of soldiers and battlefields echo those in his recent opera “Wozzeck,” which comes to the Met next year. Such consistency is no defect when it offers such creative potential and moral force, especially in this indignant production, which looks not only at colonial injustices but contemporary postcolonial inequalities. Increasingly, admirably, Mr. Kentridge is using his international profile as a platform for collaborations with a host of South African colleagues, who are billed as this show’s co-creators. They include the actors Mr. Dlamini and Mr. Shabangu; the choreographer Gregory Maqoma, who oversees the twitchy movements of the soldiers and porters; and the magnificent soprano Ann Masina, who transmutes Satie’s “Je Te Veux” from a love ballad into a cry for independence. Midway through “The Head and the Load,” Mr. Dlamini quotes from the great South African writer Solomon Plaatje, who wrote acidly of the African war effort: “Lest their behavior merit recognition, their deeds must not be recorded.” Yet at the conclusion of this bold exorcism, Mr. Kentridge projects a series of ledgers that intervene to fill that unrecorded history. They look bureaucratic at first, but soon you find gnomic phrases like “Freedom — We Missed That Boat Again,” alongside the names of men killed in action or struck down by pneumonia and yellow fever. They are not the Martins and Müllers engraved on thousands of memorials across Europe. These casualties of the Great War, at last recorded, are individuals named Khanyile, Diop, Mbata, Ibrahim.

2018,The Airports of the Future Have Arrived,"Two of the biggest airports in the world — Istanbul and Beijing — aim to make travel easier and faster for the passengers who use them. Air travel is growing in popularity across the world, and the global aviation system is undergoing projects big and small to keep up. “We’re forecasting that traffic will double in the next 17 years,” said Angela Gittens, director general for Airports Council International (A.C.I. World). “Millions more people will be traveling.” And those people, she said, won’t just be in places where flying is already popular. “An emerging economy now will be an advanced economy later,” Ms. Gittens said. New and expanded airports are needed to meet that demand. Istanbul, for example, has already begun opening its new airport in phases that will eventually be able to accommodate hundreds of millions of travelers a year. When it is completed, it will be the world’s largest. Beijing is set to get its own new airport up and running next year, one that will come close to rivaling Istanbul’s in size and ambition. (It was designed by the architect Zaha Hadid before she died in 2016.) The key to making both airports manageable for passengers, Ms. Gittens said, is taking advantage of technology to facilitate how people and goods pass through them. “We have to do things more efficiently. We have to have technology work more efficiently for us. We have to figure out how to process passengers, aircraft and cargo more efficiently in the air as well as on the ground,” she said. The airports’ designers agreed, and said that efficiency has to start with the buildings themselves. “We're starting to arrive at scales which were previously unimaginable for the size of these airport buildings,” said Andrew Thomas, a partner at the architectural firm Grimshaw, which designed the Istanbul airport along with the Nordic Office of Architecture and Haptic Architects. “It almost doesn't matter what you put in it if the walks are so long that people are exhausted by the time” they get to their gate. The designers of the Beijing airport agreed. “You keep it on the human scale,” said Cristiano Ceccato, an associate director and director of aviation at Zaha Hadid Architects. Ms. Gittens said that technological innovations will help passengers navigate the buildings more quickly and efficiently. “I think one of the things we can really expect is that biometrics will be used throughout the entire process. If you can avoid people having to stop and queue — stopping and queuing takes up space — if people can move, they don't need as much space,” she said. Mr. Thomas agreed that biometrics, including facial recognition technology, will likely take on a bigger role as those technologies develop, but he said other systems already exist that make airports more efficient than they used to be. For example, he said, automation is making it quicker and less stressful for most travelers to check in. “The process, as it becomes automated, becomes much more simple,” he said. Istanbul will still have check-in staff, “but they move from behind the desks and they deliver much more personal customer service.” Ms. Gittens said that kind of technology also makes airports more flexible, as multiple airlines can share the physical infrastructure more easily. Beijing’s airport is taking automated check-in even further, according to Mr. Ceccato. Normally, he said, airports have two levels: one for departures and one for arrivals. But Daxing International will have a third floor with a new format. “A purely self-processing level for domestic travelers — no ticket agents or anything,” Mr. Ceccato said. “They realized that the full service check-in that you have upstairs, most people don’t need that anymore. They just need to get on with it much like they’re taking a train. That is a big facilitation to making the travel as seamless as possible.” While Istanbul and Beijing are two of the more high-profile projects in the works right now, airports around the world are undergoing improvements to keep up with demand as well. Los Angeles International and La Guardia in New York are essentially being rebuilt (one phase of the La Guardia project opened in November), and John F. Kennedy will also be overhauled in the near future. London’s Heathrow is set to begin building a third runway, and Amsterdam is studying a similar project. In the coming years, Berlin should have a new airport that’s been under stop-and-go construction for more than a decade, and Sydney has plans for a new airport, too.

2018,The Allure of Vertical Forests,"By incorporating trees and plant life in urban architecture, the trees both assist in absorbing carbon dioxide and in producing more oxygen. Bosco Verticale in Milan, Italy, an apartment complex featuring vertical gardens by Boeri StudioCreditCreditPaolo Rosselli NEW ORLEANS — The Vertical Forest buildings of the architect and urban planner Stefano Boeri make the most of the often overlooked and profound contributions of a single tree. The Vertical Forest prototype was first constructed four years ago in Milan, Italy, where a pair of apartment buildings also housed 21,000 plants and 20 species of birds. Cities cover only about 3 percent of the Earth’s land, Mr. Boeri said during his presentation at the conference. But they are responsible for 70 percent of the world’s energy consumption and 75 percent of the carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to climate change, which threatens to significantly alter New Orleans and the Southeast, according to a federal National Climate Assessment report released last month. The beauty of incorporating more trees and plant life in urban architecture is that the trees both assist in absorbing carbon dioxide and in producing more oxygen. The process begins by selecting plants that would be suited for the environment of the city. “So we in a way design and build houses for trees,” Mr. Boeri said. Mr. Boeri has been asked about replicating the idea all over the world. “For sure we didn’t copyright it because we think there are and could be many other architects that can do better than us,” he said. For each city Mr. Boeri starts over, creating something distinct for the climate and biodiversity, embracing the chance to experiment and improve. Such efforts have already resulted in lower costs of construction, he said. He gave examples of how Vertical Forests would be different in cities in the Netherlands, France, China and Manhattan. The design proposal made for Manhattan incorporates both trees and greenhouses. If 15 of his 1,000-foot Vertical Forest buildings were constructed in the city, Mr. Boeri said, together they would have the same number of trees that are found within the 840 acres of Central Park. Vertical Forests are created for the building’s complex ecosystem to succeed in highly dense metropolitan areas. But proposals for a Forest City are also in the works in China. The various Vertical Forest-style buildings there would support an area of about 30,000 people. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations held the first World Forum on Urban Forests recently in Mantova, Italy, and 93 countries attended, Mr. Boeri said. They compared solutions and spoke about ways urban forests could be part of cities’ efforts to “stop and reverse” their positions on climate change. “We have to imagine how we could communicate the fact that you can intervene in a very efficient way,” and be optimistic about the possibilities available for stopping climate change, Mr. Boeri said, rather than only being fearful of the effects.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Alternative to Arms,"Turning Points Turning Point: In Gaza’s deadliest day since 2014, the Israeli military killed dozens of Palestinians and injured thousands more. When the Second World War ended in 1945 there were 51 member states in the United Nations. Today there are 193. Many of the new states emerged out of struggle and conflict as old empires crumbled. That cycle of political struggle continues today. The Brexit crisis may cause huge economic damage to Ireland’s economies and may even threaten the Good Friday Agreement. In Catalonia and the Basque Country, both of which seek independence from Spain, in Hong Kong and Palestine, people fight or have fought for the right to self-govern. The world is dominated by nations’ struggles to make their own laws and to decide their relationships with other nations. But for people to have control over the decisions that affect their lives, we must empower them through diplomacy, cooperation and dialogue. When governments put simple human decency and the rights of their people first as they negotiate the world’s conflicts, democracy will follow. That, however, is easier said than done, especially when the individual people responsible for upholding the law often value their own power over the common good. When I was a teenager in Belfast I realized that my peers and I were not being treated fairly. Northern Ireland was created when the British government partitioned Ireland. People were divided on sectarian lines and Catholics were deemed to be disloyal. We were denied basic rights in what was effectively an apartheid statelet. The inequality we experienced was deeply embedded in our society, to the point of being policy. Still, I thought that fixing it was only a matter of bringing it to the attention of the people in charge. Once they realized the problem they would rectify matters. I soon learned that the people in charge relied on that inequality for their power. They were unlikely to eradicate it if that would cost them their leverage, and any solution would be tempered to a degree that would keep them in charge. People who have power, or even the illusion of power, are loath to give it up. Those on the other side of this equation — the disadvantaged — include many who believe they cannot change their situation. Some are reluctant even to consider that change is possible. Some are afraid of change. Some are used to society being organized in a certain way, even when that society discriminates against them. Some are too busy surviving or living their lives to consider that things could be different. There can be no progress without political struggle, but for it to succeed, people must be empowered. They need to have a stake in society and in their communities. They have to be cherished, and their humanity has to be respected and defended. They have rights and entitlements that must be upheld and promoted. Society needs to be citizen-centered, shaped around these rights. The reality, of course, is that progressive change in society rarely comes of its own accord. It has to be engineered, negotiated for. Violence often breeds when people believe that they have been left with no alternative. And this belief can become more entrenched as states use extrajudicial and violent means to defend their interests. Annual worldwide military spending is estimated to be over $1.7 trillion today, whereas the United Nations and its related agencies spend around $30 billion annually. Conflict is fueled by poverty, economic exploitation and the desire to control water rights, oil reserves and other natural resources. Britain had fought dozens of counterinsurgency wars before it sent its soldiers to Irish streets in 1969. It had a well-established policy that saw the law, according to Brigadier Frank Kitson, as “just another weapon in the government’s arsenal … little more than a propaganda cover for the disposal of unwanted members of the public.” Irish republicans and others succeeded in shifting from conflict to peace by building an alternative to armed struggle with the Good Friday Agreement. It provides for certain rights for Northern Ireland, including the right to a referendum on whether to remain a part of Britain or to end that relationship and establish a united Ireland. The agreement emerged slowly as a result of hard work, with parties and governments eventually being prepared to take risks, and with the support of the international community. It is still very much unfinished business. In the conflict between the Spanish state and the Basque independence campaigners a similar process, closely modeled on Ireland’s, has succeeded in ending armed conflict, even though the Spanish government has not fully engaged so far. Sinn Fein leaders have often traveled to other conflict zones, including Afghanistan and Colombia, advocating the primacy of dialogue, negotiations and peace processes. I have traveled to the Middle East on several occasions, speaking to Palestinians, visiting the Gaza Strip and the West Bank and speaking to senior leaders in Israel and Palestine. Regrettably, the failure of governments to uphold international law and U.N. resolutions, and the Israeli government’s refusal to defend democratic norms and find equitable and fair compromises, has left many Palestinians living in desperate conditions, with no hope of a different, better future. As a result, the Middle East exists in a permanent state of conflict. To change this demands a genuine effort to understand what motivates, inspires and drives people to make the choices they do. The dialogue that fosters that understanding is what ultimately empowers opposing sides of a conflict to come together. Whoever described politics as the art of the possible was reducing politics to a mediocre trade. People’s expectations of their worth must be raised — not lowered. When we do that, we enable democracy to take hold in even the most dire situations. OpinionHyeonseo Lee OpinionTimothy Snyder",The New York Times
2018,The Amazon HQ2 Document We Weren’t Supposed to See,"Times Insider Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. For reporters covering Amazon, like myself, the company’s search for a second headquarters, which it called HQ2, loomed over us for more than a year. The news, in theory, could have broken at any time, and 50,000 jobs were at stake, as were likely billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies. In November we finally learned that Amazon had chosen to split its “second headquarters” in two, between Long Island City in Queens and Arlington, Va., right outside Washington. Since then, it’s been a whirlwind of public protests and quiet lobbying as the company and officials work to make their agreements a reality. To me, it’s been fascinating: a blatant display of the company’s power, good or bad depending on your perspective. That was especially apparent in an article I published last week, laying out what information cities and states gave Amazon about the work force, real estate and available tax incentives in their areas — and the value that information provides the company. It started late on Dec. 10, when the city gave J. David Goodman, my colleague on the Metro desk who’s been covering the New York side of the process, a look at several key documents the city and state gave to Amazon to be considered for HQ2. The documents were going to be made public on a city website the next morning. Two of the files drew our attention in particular. One, from last year, was New York’s first round bid, all glossy and making big promises. The second, from March, was the response to the long and confidential set of questions Amazon gave the 20 cities it had put on a short list. As we read through the documents, David and I quickly focused on the second, more detailed proposal and shot notes back and forth about what we saw. “I think the questions are very interesting!” I wrote to him. “Like Amazon asked them for the price of goods at Whole Foods, WHICH IT OWNS???” “That’s very funny,” he wrote back. He pointed out the document showed that by March, Amazon was considering only two locations in New York City — Midtown West and Long Island City — and appeared to have dropped the areas around Brooklyn Tech and Lower Manhattan that the city and state had also proposed. The documents contained a few intriguing bits like that, but no bombshells. Much of the content felt very workaday. We decided not to write a breaking news story. The next day, I went back to the city’s website to look at the document again, and the link to that particular file was gone. David asked the city what happened, and a spokeswoman told him it had been taken it down. The city should have checked with its academic partners before posting because the document included proprietary information. That piqued our interest — what secret information did Amazon get? Neither of us had downloaded the document initially (lesson learned!), but through my browser history, I could find the web address where the city had uploaded the file. And it still worked. While the city had removed a link to the document from its website, the document itself remained online. I quickly downloaded it and sent a copy to David for good measure. We talked about what to do with it and decided that while there may not have been news hidden in the details, perhaps the accumulation of data, some proprietary, that Amazon got from New York and other cities could be a story by itself. David had to cover the big City Council hearing on the project, so I took the lead from there. Reporting usually entails consulting a combination of documents and human sources, and this was no different. I had the document but felt I didn’t have the expertise to fully understand its value, so I called Joe Parilla, a fellow at the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. He’d been following the HQ2 saga for more than a year and researches economic development. What was valuable? What was unique? We spent almost an hour going through it together. I’d point out a piece of data that caught my eye, and he’d explain if it was readily available or why it could be relevant to a project like HQ2. He kept scrolling down and declaring, “Wow!” I’d laugh and ask what he found so exciting. “We are doing a project right now that, if we had access to Amazon’s database, it would make our life so much easier,” Joe told me. I interviewed some more people, including an Amazon spokesman who said the company has already used the information it got from the HQ2 process to inform other investment decisions. Providing this type of work force and real estate data to attract employers is exactly what local economic development agencies are designed to do, he argued. While the document did contain information that was proprietary, or at least rarely public, in particular around private universities, in the end it became clear that the greatest value for Amazon was that the city and state researched and compiled data from dozens of sources into one place. That even explained the original Whole Foods question — and why Amazon asked cities about the costs of avocados, milk and bread at one of its own subsidiaries, which surely it knows. “It’s like, why do the work,” Joe said, “when somebody else can do it?” The next morning, I had a poem waiting in my inbox from the Times reader Tim Torkildson, a retired clown who’s made habit of emailing limericks to reporters: The price of avocados is important to the schemes of Amazon big cheeses and their monetary dreams. And moo juice by the gallon is an algorithmic trend that corporations disregard at peril, my good friend. When whole wheat bread is pricey, then Millennials will wilt — and wash away forever like some tide-born murky silt. This is not footling research nor a whimsical pursuit; without this kind of data modern man is but a brute!",The New York Times
2018,"The Ambiguous Sexism of Marius Petipa, Ballet’s Towering Master","The cavalier expansively offers his hand in a descending arc through the air. As the ballerina places her hand in his, she steps onto point and extends one leg behind her. Welcome to ballet. This grandiloquent action, an archetypal example of ballet classicism, is a crucial transaction within supported adagio, that singularly momentous idiom: With the man’s assistance, a female dancer blooms all the more fully. What does it say to us? Logically, viewers should attend above all to that joining of hands. Here’s a formal ritual of courtship, in which the woman accepts the man, at least provisionally, as a suitor. Far more powerful, though, is how, now on point, she becomes a multidimensional work of ideal geometry, sculpturally firm and theatrically radiant. No longer entirely human, she’s now also — in line, shape and projection — transcendent. Such images abound in the work of the Franco-Russian choreographer Marius Petipa (1818-1910): You can see them in the dances he made for “Don Quixote,” “La Bayadère,” “The Sleeping Beauty,” “Swan Lake” and “Raymonda.” They confront us with a problematic but beautiful central issue of ballet: its highly ambiguous sexism. This year, his bicentennial, has brought Petipa conferences (at Harvard University, in Madrid, Moscow, Paris, St. Petersburg); new productions of his ballets in Europe and the United States; and important Petipa revivals around the world. Attention is certainly due. More is being learned about the man, his career and his creations, so central to ballet repertory today. Still, their central feature — the radical dualism he constructs between the sexes — tends to be taken for granted. The woman goes on point; the man does the partnering. The positions may not be reversed. What’s going on here? Is he serving her or controlling her? He subordinates himself to making her all the more spectacular, but which one is in charge? We can say that such behavior glorifies women — or that it falsifies them. I’m among the thousands who are disarmed by it; I’m also well aware that it’s far from the behavior I encounter anywhere today. Petipa was the chief architect of the classic ballets I’ve named. In addition, most versions of “Giselle,” “Paquita,” “Coppélia” and “Le Corsaire” contain extensive and crucial contributions by him. And, though he was too ill to make most of the original 1892 “Nutcracker,” he planned its score and scenario in detail with its composer, Tchaikovsky. It’s fair to say his work remains more widely and often performed than that of any other choreographer. George Balanchine and Frederick Ashton, the two greatest masters of ballet classicism in the 20th century, both acknowledged the vastness of their debt to him. Today’s most in-demand ballet choreographer, Alexei Ratmansky, has now devoted a large portion of his time to reviving Petipa choreography from period sources. Who are the women in these ballets? The destiny of Aurora in “The Sleeping Beauty” is controlled by others. The Sugarplum Fairy in “The Nutcracker” is just the hostess with the mostest in the Realm of Sweets. Glorious, sparkling, full of dance variety, the heartbeats of every scene in which they appear, they’re figureheads whose inner lives remain unknown. Sure, some heroines — Nikiya in “Bayadère,” Odette in “Swan Lake” — love and trust, are betrayed and suffer. But all these women, though doing far more of their ballets’ dancing, lead lives shaped by their men. Such was the late-19th century world that Petipa knew, in which few women shaped history or were allowed to create important art of their own. Still, we shouldn’t assume all 19th-century ballet was like his. The works of the Danish choreographer August Bournonville (1805-79) show men and women dancing together as equals. They sometimes even show women partnering men. Bournonville was part of a Scandinavian tradition that connects to Hans Christian Andersen’s stories and Ibsen’s plays. Petipa, a Frenchman working in Imperial Russia, made no links with Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Mussorgsky, Chekhov. Yet it was he who created enduring classics, central to ballet tradition as Bournonville’s are not. Petipa’s ballets show the powers of his powerless women. Petipa’s command of space and time is that of a master architect. Whether he’s handling women en masse or alone, he maps the stage with their geometries. He’s also a jeweler, presenting dancers’ bodies this way and that, as if holding gems up to the light, showing us how they refract it in different directions. And he surrounds his queen-bee heroines with retinues. The dances for the female corps de ballet often count for far more than any for the leading men. It’s reasonable to say that Tchaikovsky’s ballet scores — “The Sleeping Beauty,” “Swan Lake,” “The Nutcracker” — surpass Petipa’s choreography. But that misses the point. Although Tchaikovsky’s music is marvelously evocative, it’s Petipa’s stage drama that shows us what’s at stake: a society in which men honor women, support women, frame women. He makes that seem the cornerstone not only of ballet but of psychology and civilization, too. He shows us supported adagio as something that transports a hero when he envisions it (“Don Quixote,” “La Bayadère,” “The Sleeping Beauty”); something a heroine dreams about (“Raymonda”) as her shining hope; something children are shown as a peak of wonderland (“The Nutcracker”); something that happens in both courts (“Swan Lake”) and villages (“Coppélia”). Upon the foundation of this male-female negotiation, Petipa constructs the rest of almost every act — the central suite of classical dances with their solo variations, and coda, the other ensembles in various styles, the mime scenes, and more. In life, Petipa’s view of the sexes was more complex. Many female dancers in Russia were high-class courtesans, feted by generous admirers, whose gifts of jewels then adorned their costumes like trophies. At the St. Petersburg premiere of “Swan Lake,” in 1895, Petipa’s daughter Marie (1856-1930) was only a supporting dancer, yet she wore jewels estimated at tens of thousands of rubles. Like prima ballerinas, she could wield influence beyond her father’s. The first full-length biography of the choreographer, “Marius Petipa: The Emperor’s Ballet Master,” by Nadine Meisner is to be published in June (Oxford University Press). The most disturbing of its revelations is the formal complaint written in 1867 by Petipa’s wife, Maria Surovshchikova (1836-82), soon after she left him. She had been his muse, dancing the lead role (often with him as her stage partner) in ballets from 1855 to ’66. In this document, she said that during 10 years of married life, her husband assaulted her every week, “leaving consequences for my already weak health.” According to her account, these often took place before their children and servants; Maria left him after an incident in which he began to throttle her and spit at her. It seems that he was maddened by jealousy; her many admirers were more than he could bear. (The case was settled out of court. Thereafter, they led separate lives.) Though we have only her word for that complaint — and though Petipa’s ballets can’t readily be said to abuse or demean women — his temper was known to be atrocious. Will we ever understand him? For most of his life, the famous Petipa was not this one, anyway. His brother Lucien (1815-98), three years his senior, had been one of the foremost dancers in the 1840s and the male star of the original “Giselle” (1841). Lucien went on to become a choreographer of renown, working on staging the premieres of ballet music by Verdi, Wagner and others, while Marius, working in Russia, was making ballets to far less remarkable music from Pugni and Minkus. Having moved to Russia in 1847, Marius Petipa became the country’s senior ballet master by 1870. The Russian authorities, giving him resources beyond those of other nations, expected him to fill the stage with spectacle, bravura display and vast numbers of dancers. This probably turned him into an artist different from the one he would like to have been. In 1875, when Bournonville visited Russia, Petipa admitted to him that the showy irrelevances that cluttered his ballets were to satisfy the public and those in power, but against his own artistic instincts. Yet Petipa was one of history’s great survivors; he outlived all the Western ballet masters of his youth and middle age. Far more of his choreography survives, too. Thanks in large part to his legacy, ballet became internationally known as a Russian art. The lineage of Russian ballet luminaries — Pavlova, Nijinsky, Balanchine, Nureyev, Makarova, Baryshnikov — is one descended from Petipa. While many of his Russian artist contemporaries (Dostoyevsky, Repin, Mussorgsky, Tolstoy, Borodin, Rimsky-Korsakov) were pursuing a cult of Russian subject matter for Russian people, Petipa kept looking to the West, pursuing art for art’s sake. This made him something of a kindred spirit to his later composer colleagues Tchaikovsky and Glazunov; and, in due course, a precursor of the modernism of Stravinsky and Balanchine. Many of his narrative works anticipate the plotless ballets of today. The story slows or stops; the dance flowers; a Romantically classical vision of womanhood is at the center of the frame. The feminist Germaine Greer once argued that Shakespeare, in his comedy “The Taming of the Shrew,” gave to its tamed heroine Kate a final speech that’s “the greatest defense of Christian monogamy ever written.” We may claim the same for the heroines of Petipa’s wordless ballets. They live only for marriage and (even beyond their mate’s adultery and the grave) true love; yet they rule space, time, music and drama like monarchs. They’re the objects and the justification of Romantic chivalry at its most precariously sublime.",The New York Times
2018,The Anchorage Earthquake Was Terrifying. But the Damage Could’ve Been Much Worse.,"ANCHORAGE — The magnitude 7 earthquake that jolted Anchorage on Friday cracked buildings, damaged roads and buckled bridges, drawing swift comparisons to a temblor in 1964 that devastated the region and remains a dominant part of Alaskan history. But on Saturday, even amid hundreds of aftershocks, residents of this port city marveled that the damage had not been much worse. The Anchorage Fire Department responded to four structure fires as a result of the quake, according to City Hall, and two reports of structure collapse are being investigated. No deaths have been reported. It could have turned out very differently, and many thought it would. Experts said that while the quake was significantly less intense than the one in 1964, which was magnitude 9.2, its limited destruction was the result of the region’s growing smarter and much more resilient in the years since. Anchorage was much better prepared for a major earthquake; other cities may not have fared so well. The 1964 quake and the tsunami that followed killed more than 100 people, destroyed scores of homes and wiped out several small towns along the coast. It is the most powerful seismic event in the country’s history and the second-most powerful recorded globally. “We have come a long way since the 1964 earthquake,” said Joey Yang, the chairman of the civil engineering program at the University of Alaska Anchorage. “Anchorage definitely knows about the power and damage a major earthquake can cause to the infrastructure and buildings.” Developers must undergo rigorous requirements before building here, he added, particularly in some of the most seismically sensitive areas. Professor Yang is part of an earthquake commission that advises city leaders, whom he credited with taking the building review process seriously. Although the extent of the damage is still being assessed, building by building and road by road, the city on Saturday had already begun to return to normal as shopkeepers and families cleaned up the mess, grateful to have evaded catastrophe. This is not to say it was all smooth sailing. Pictures of sunken streets circulated widely on social media. Suburban commuters were stranded on Friday because of damage to major roads. Power failures continued well into Friday evening. Some people were left without shelter in below-freezing temperatures as their properties were inspected for structural damage. And significant aftershocks overnight made for restless sleep. [Read: The earthquake sent Anchorage into a panic on Friday.] The earthquake was among the strongest that longtime residents have experienced, so intense that it frightened even hardened Alaskans who know seismic activity is a fact of life here along Cook Inlet. When it struck a few miles north of Anchorage on Friday morning, panicked Alaskans around the city ducked for cover or ran outside into the chill. “The whole house was shaking, you could see the floor rolling up and down,” Anders Olmstead said. “Different rooms in my house were going in different angles. I was pretty scared. I’ve lived here my whole life. We kind of laugh off earthquakes in Alaska because you’ve been through so many, hundreds — some of them you sleep through.” Mr. Olmstead, 32, said the earthquake had knocked over his toddler daughter. He grabbed her and sheltered in place with her. He said he could hear the “joints of his house snapping” and things falling all around him. His house ended up being fine, he said. “We got very lucky.” Professor Yang said the damage around the city “was definitely less than I would expect based on the intensity of the earthquake.” He said the relative depth of the temblor, which struck nearly 30 miles below ground, helped mitigate its power. The city’s main utilities were all up and running on Saturday, said Bill Falsey, the Anchorage municipal manager. But Mr. Falsey warned that repair work to the Glenn Highway, a major thoroughfare in the region, could take a long time to complete. Mayor Ethan Berkowitz told city residents on Saturday morning that “we’re in full recovery mode” and “on the road to returning to normal.” Many businesses downtown remained closed, some marked with caution tape, awaiting safety inspectors to assess any structural damage. But in many shops, store managers were already taking stock of inventory. Families were cleaning up their homes, and building owners were meeting with engineers. Schools, according to officials, would remain closed until Tuesday. Still the shock had not quite worn off. Throughout the day, at coffee shops, at gas stations and on Facebook, residents continued to swap stories of confusion and alarm. Maddi Cassel, 21, was at her office near midtown Anchorage on Friday morning when she noticed the shaking. She thought it would be over soon, so she continued working. But the shaking grew in intensity as she was typing. Colleagues around her were exchanging worried glances and several of them ran outside. When they returned to the office, Ms. Cassel surveyed the damage. “Things were thrown off the shelves and walls and there was glass broken. Ceiling tiles had fallen out of the ceiling and there was dust from inside there,” she said. “But somehow my coffee was completely unspilled though, which was cool.”",The New York Times
2018,The Art of Bullet Journaling and the Improved To-Do List,"Self-Helped As a tween, whenever my dad wanted me to do something for him, like deposit a check or write a letter or call customer service, he’d stop mid-instruction, give me a stern look and ask, “Are you writing this down?” Imagine a 12-year-old eye roll here. To my mind, I had an airtight system in place, relying on made-up medleys with a simple beat: check, letter, call Time Warner; check, letter, call Time Warner. If this sounds like a terrible strategy: You’re right, and it rarely worked. My dad’s instincts were on point. We now know that the brain truly can’t be trusted to hold or remember more than a few thoughts at a time. That’s why I decided to pick up bullet journaling, a system created by Ryder Carroll that organizes your to-do list, your schedule and your journal in one notebook while giving you free rein to design it according to your lifestyle. It has become a social media sensation over the last few years, with more than three million related posts on Instagram alone and a dedicated following inspired to create blogs and innovations to the original system. I was drawn in by its flexibility and the beautiful spreads created by others, but in practice, I couldn’t keep up the momentum. In his new book, “The Bullet Journal Method: Track the Past, Order the Present, Design the Future,” Carroll goes back to basics, explaining the practice and his reasoning behind each element, which include an index or table of contents, a future log for upcoming events or tasks, and daily and monthly logs for more granular planning. One can create custom collections, blank pages that can take any form, even just a simple list. “It’s not about how your journal looks, it’s about how it makes you feel and how effective it is,” writes Carroll in “The Bullet Journal Method.” He clarifies ways to use the bullet journal for every step of project management: brainstorming, determining the desired outcome (he even recommends writing a mission statement at the top of the project’s collection page), defining subcollections and doing necessary research. For longer-term projects or those that contain many moving parts, like learning to cook, Carroll recommends breaking them down into sprints — “independent, self-contained projects” that can be completed within two weeks or a month — and creating collection pages to track your progress. I decided to nix the elaborate spreads and give bullet journaling another try, this time with the help of another book, “Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity,” by David Allen, which taught me to clarify and organize my tasks more effectively. “The vast majority of people have been trying to get organized by rearranging incomplete lists of unclear things,” wrote Allen in “Getting Things Done.” Most to-do lists tend to contain a mix of projects, notes and reminders, which muddles its contents and “simply remind you that you are overwhelmed.” According to Allen’s system, we should categorize information into three categories: “next actions,” which by his standards must be “descriptive of a physical behavior”; “projects,” broadly defined as anything with more than one action step; and “reference material,” such as those articles saved in your Bookmarks tab or the nail art ideas on your Pinterest board. One major challenge was reckoning with all the projects on my list. Meal prep, for instance, which I often list but rarely do, is actually a project in disguise, because it requires more than one action to be marked as complete. My subpar cooking skills require that I look up a recipe and mentally prepare for the task. Creating a grocery list and shopping for food also precede the act of cooking. By simply writing “meal prep,” I was forcing my brain to keep working to fill the space between the outcome and how to get there. “Thinking in a concentrated manner to define desired outcomes and requisite next actions is something few people feel they have to do (until they have to),” wrote Allen. According to Allen, “Once you know how to process your stuff and what to organize, you really just need to create and manage lists.” Yes, plural. Allen recommends grouping items according to the conditions under which they must be completed. It may be useful, for instance, to group errands together, so that if you’re out, you can refer to the list for other places you need to go. Similarly, if you have a regular meeting with your boss, it’s helpful to have an agenda with topics to cover. With this foundation, I returned to set up my new bullet journal. “Getting Things Done” and “The Bullet Journal Method” work well together, because the bullet journal’s flexibility allows for the type of ad hoc lists that Allen recommends. I created lists like “Calls” or “At Home” for tasks I couldn’t do anywhere else. My daily log, which is integral to the bullet journaling system and Carroll describes as “a catchall, designed to hold our thoughts until we’re ready to sort them out,” had always been my de facto to-do list in my previous bullet journaling attempts. Instead, it became a temporary holding space until these tasks, projects, ideas or reminders could be sorted into their appropriate lists or collections (or in my calendar). In an ideal world, an app would feed me tasks like a Pez candy dispenser, one-by-one and only when I have the time and energy to do them. Instead, both Allen and Carroll insist on reflection and trusting your gut. Ugh. You mean I can’t just go on autopilot? Both writers encourage engaging regularly with your tasks, projects and thoughts. “The goal is getting into the habit of checking in with yourself, asking small whys. Over time, you get better at answering these questions. You’re refining your beliefs, your values, your ability to spot your weaknesses and your strengths,” wrote Carroll. I’m still new to this, so I can’t say that I’ve experienced “mind like water” or “flow” (Allen’s words) or any other euphemism for not feeling like your mind is spilling over with thoughts and ideas. But if, as Allen wrote, “The key is to feel as good about what you’re not doing as about what you are doing at that moment,” I guess I’ve achieved a certain kind of clarity.",The New York Times
2018,The Art of Giving Advice (and Saying Goodbye),"The sweet Spot In their final column, the Dear Sugars offer insight and advice on … giving it. Cheryl Strayed: Dear readers, we have news: This will be the final Sweet Spot column. Steve and I have felt deeply privileged to answer letters from those of you who sought our advice here, but after much reflection we have decided that it’s time to shift our focus to other creative endeavors — namely, our next books. Our goodbye is not without misgiving. We’ll miss the weekly challenge of helping you navigate your emotional quagmires and deepest conflicts. But we’ve addressed so many aspects of the human condition over the course of writing this column and making the Dear Sugars podcast that, should you seek our perspective on any number of conundrums, you’ll surely find an answer in our archives. Steve Almond: As we say farewell, it’s worth looking back at how this strange and beautiful partnership began. A decade ago, I launched the advice column Dear Sugar, for the website The Rumpus, as something of a lark. The design flaw in most advice columns, I felt, was that their authors took themselves too seriously. They pretended to have all the answers, when the more honest responses to human suffering are concern and doubt. I still believe that. But the moment my friend Cheryl took over the column, I realized the flaw in my approach, which is that people write to advice columnists because they want to be taken seriously. They want permission to feel what they’re feeling, not a set of instructions for self-improvement. They want someone to bear witness to their struggle, to stand with them through it. Cheryl did this by sharing stories from her own life. She provided a model of how she found meaning within the chaos and hardship of her own past. And because she did so with such sensitivity and eloquence, thousands of people sought her counsel. In our work together on the Dear Sugars podcast, and for this column, we’ve sought to invert the standard paradigm of advice givers. We don’t pretend that we can supply the answers to the crises set out by our correspondents. What we try to do is to focus on asking the right questions, often about the unacknowledged internal conflicts that keep people locked in self-destructive cycles. In many of the letters we read, the writers already know what they need to do. What they’re looking for is permission to act on that knowledge, and sometimes a compassionate nudge. Read all the Sweet Spot columns right here. CS: And perhaps a bit of reassurance too. I think the most essential advice Steve and I have given is the simple consolation that it’s going to be O.K., even if it’s hard right now. One childhood memory that has never left me is the way it felt when my mother stroked my forehead when I was sick with a fever — that deep sense of comfort amid the misery. I think we all long for that, to be soothed when we’re suffering, to have others bear witness to our struggles, to be told we have the strength and the courage to push through. That’s what I aspire to offer those who seek my advice. It’s easy to assume that people write to strangers when they’re bewildered — and there is some of that — but far more often people write to us when deep down they already know what they should do. Our job is to say they can, they will and they must, though it won’t be easy. It’s often scary to admit we know what we need to do because setting a course of action based on that knowledge can push us outside of our comfort zones. Sometimes it’s that we need to hurt someone’s feelings by ending a relationship, or make ourselves vulnerable by taking a risk, or endure the discomfort of a conflict or a confession, or let go of an idea we used to have about who we are so we can replace it with a truer one. We often resist doing those things because they’re difficult and painful, but over and over again, in response to a wide range of questions, Steve and I have landed upon one value: To live a content and evolved life, you must trust your clarity and act upon it. Again and again we’ve said it’s not only O.K. to listen to the deepest voice within us that knows — it’s essential. In the long run you’ll be miserable if you don’t. SA: That’s easy for us to say, and much harder to put into practice. Too often, especially in moments of crisis, we can’t find clarity. We distrust ourselves. We engineer situations that allow us to remain loyal to the sorrows of our childhood. That, too, is a part of the human arrangement. People resist change. They have trouble forgiving themselves and forgiving those around them. Cheryl and I are under no illusion that a few kind and considered words can undo patterns years in the making. This is why we so often advise people to seek out support groups, therapists and hotlines. The gravest danger to the wounded heart is an isolating silence. We also recommend that people look to literature for solace and guidance, which is what we always do in times of tribulation. As Cheryl intuited long ago, people learn more from stories than lectures, because stories are how we pluck meaning from the rush of experience. The letters we receive — in which people tell their own stories — are themselves healing documents. It has been a profound honor to read them. It takes courage to examine the inner life and to ask for help. It’s also been an honor, and a pure joy, to work with Cheryl, to be in conversation with such a brilliant mind and an intrepid heart. Most of what I know about giving advice, I’ve learned from her. I’ll miss working with you, my friend. CS: I suppose I can’t have expected I’d make it through this final column without crying, so thank you for that, Steve. I was honored when you asked me to take over the Dear Sugar column all those years ago because I’d long been a fan of your writing. But my admiration and love for you has only grown as we’ve worked together writing this column and making the Dear Sugars podcast. I’m in awe of your deep intelligence and compassion. And even though this is our last column, I’ll forever be seeking your advice. As for you, dear readers (and listeners), I know I’m speaking for both of us when I say how grateful we are that you shared your stories, your secrets and your struggles with us. We learned a lot from you. By way of helping you ponder your problems, we’ve been inevitably required to grapple with our a few of our own. Steve and I are often asked if it’s emotionally burdensome to be on the receiving end of so much despair and sorrow, but we’ve found the opposite to be true. To offer words of consolation, encouragement and (we hope) illumination is to do something that brings comfort, even when we can’t provide the cure. It’s cool hands on hot foreheads. Love in action. Our mothers would be proud.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Art of the Imaginary Deal,"On trade, Trump is a rebel without a clue Opinion Columnist Are we going to have a full-blown trade war with China, and maybe the rest of the world? Nobody knows — because it all depends on the whims of one man. And Tariff Man is ignorant, volatile and delusional. Why do I say that it’s all about one man? After all, after the 2016 U.S. election and the Brexit vote in Britain, there was a lot of talk about a broad popular backlash against globalization. Over the past two years, however, it has become clear that this backlash was both smaller and shallower than advertised. Where, after all, is the major constituency supporting Donald Trump’s tariffs and threats to exit international agreements? Big business hates the prospect of a trade war, and stocks plunge whenever that prospect becomes more likely. Labor hasn’t rallied behind Trumpist protectionism either. Meanwhile, the percentage of Americans believing that foreign trade is good for the economy is near a record high. Even those who criticize trade seem to be motivated by loyalty to Trump, not by deep policy convictions: During the 2016 campaign self-identified Republicans swung wildly from the view that trade agreements are good to the view that they’re bad, then swung back again once Trump seemed to be negotiating agreements of his own. (We have always been in a trade war with Eastasia.) But if there’s no strong constituency for protectionism, why are we teetering on the brink of a trade war? Blame U.S. trade law. Once upon a time, Congress used to write detailed tariff bills that were stuffed full of giveaways to special interests, with destructive effects on both the economy and American diplomacy. So in the 1930s F.D.R. established a new system in which the executive branch negotiates trade deals with other countries, and Congress simply votes these deals up or down. The U.S. system then became the template for global negotiations that culminated in the creation of the World Trade Organization. The creators of the U.S. trade policy system realized, however, that it couldn’t be too rigid or it would shatter in times of stress; there had to be ways to relieve pressure when necessary. So trade law gives the executive the right to impose tariffs without new legislation under certain circumstances, mainly to protect national security, to retaliate against unfair foreign practices, or to give industries facing sudden surges in foreign competition time to adjust. In other words, U.S. trade law gives the president a lot of discretionary power over trade, as part of a system that curbs the destructive influence of corrupt, irresponsible members of Congress. And that setup worked very well for more than 80 years. Unfortunately, it wasn’t intended to handle the problem of a corrupt, irresponsible president. Trump is pretty much all alone in lusting for a trade war, but he has virtually dictatorial authority over trade. What’s he doing with that power? He’s trying to negotiate deals. Unfortunately, he really, really doesn’t know what he’s doing. On trade, he’s a rebel without a clue. Even as he declared himself Tariff Man, Trump revealed that he doesn’t understand how tariffs work. No, they aren’t taxes on foreigners, they’re taxes on our own consumers. When trying to make deals, he seems to care only about whether he can claim a “win,” not about substance. He has been touting the “U.S. Mexico Canada Trade Agreement” as a repudiation of NAFTA, when it’s actually just a fairly minor modification. (Nancy Pelosi calls it “the trade agreement formerly known as Prince.”) Most important, his inability to do international diplomacy, which we’ve seen on many fronts, carries over to trade talks. Remember, he claimed to have “solved” the North Korean nuclear crisis, but Kim Jong-un is still expanding his ballistic missile capacity. Well, last weekend he claimed to have reached a major trade understanding with China; but as J.P. Morgan soon reported in a note to its clients, his claims “seem if not completely fabricated then grossly exaggerated.” Markets plunged earlier this week as investors realized that they’d been had. As I said, business really doesn’t want a trade war. Let’s be clear: China is not a good actor in the world economy. It engages in real misbehavior, especially with regard to intellectual property: The Chinese essentially rip off technology. So there is a case for toughening our stance on trade. But that toughening should be undertaken in concert with other nations that also suffer from Chinese misbehavior, and it should have clear objectives. The last person you want to play hardball here is someone who doesn’t grasp the basics of trade policy, who directs his aggressiveness at everyone — tariffs on Canadian aluminum to protect our national security? Really? — and who can’t even give an honest account of what went down in a meeting. Unfortunately, that’s the person who’s now in charge, and it’s hard to see how he can be restrained. So the future of world trade, with all it implies for the world economy, now hinges largely on Donald Trump’s mental processes. That is not a comforting thought.

2018,The Battle for Power in Wisconsin Seems Bound for Court. It’s Only Going to Get Uglier.,"Wisconsin’s judiciary, officially nonpartisan, has been marred in recent years by political intrigue, divisive elections and even accusations of one judge placing another in a chokehold. Now it may decide the fate of the outgoing governor’s new laws to limit the power of his successor. “There will be a challenge, no doubt,” Gov. Scott Walker said a few days before he signed bills expanding the power of legislative Republicans he teamed up with over the last decade. “They’ve challenged just about everything we or lawmakers have done.” The threat of litigation has rarely dissuaded Mr. Walker, a Republican who reshaped Wisconsin in his conservative image and who signed the power-shifting measures on Friday afternoon as one of his final acts in office. The judiciary has upheld several of Mr. Walker’s signature policies in recent years, despite challenges from the left. And as Mr. Walker predicted, liberal groups quickly vowed legal action on the new legislation. “This is a shameful attack on our democracy by politicians who will do anything to hold onto power,” said Eric H. Holder Jr., an attorney general under President Barack Obama who leads one of the groups that has promised a court fight. In a statement, Mr. Holder called the new laws “grossly partisan” and “deeply undemocratic.” After Democrats won top posts in a state that had been controlled over the last eight years by Republicans, Wisconsin is at the center of a bitter national debate over political norms, the transfer of power between parties and the roles of the executive and legislative branches. A similar power struggle in North Carolina, after a Democratic governor won election in 2016, set off a court battle, and the fate of Wisconsin’s new laws seems destined for that as well. The courts have played a central role in a larger ideological split that has unfolded across the state — which both Mr. Obama and President Trump carried and where its two United States senators, Ron Johnson, a Republican, and Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, could not be more different. With conservatives holding a one-vote majority, the State Supreme Court has also been at the forefront of a pattern Democrats say they have grown tired of: Republicans pass right-leaning policies despite protests, Mr. Walker signs them, and the judiciary upholds them, even if a local judge first expresses skepticism. (Mr. Walker’s opponents have had somewhat better luck in federal courts, where Mr. Holder’s group said it intends to act.) “They’re acting as a rubber stamp,” Matthew Rothschild, executive director of the liberal Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, said of the State Supreme Court. He called the judiciary “a crucial lever of power for Republicans” that had allowed the “Walker wrecking crew” to advance its policies. The court’s ideological divide is clear, but many conservatives in the state reject the rubber-stamp argument. “I don’t think it’s fair to say that so-called liberal judges will always vote for what Democrats want or so-called conservative judges will always vote for what Republicans want,” said Rick Esenberg, a lawyer who is president of the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, a conservative group that supported several of the measures Mr. Walker signed Friday. One example: The Wisconsin Supreme Court this year sided with Tony Evers, the state schools superintendent who is now the governor-elect, when he wanted to hire outside lawyers for a lawsuit. Mr. Evers, who narrowly defeated Mr. Walker in November, is a Democrat. Still, Mr. Walker has repeatedly received friendly rulings from the state’s highest court. And he has expressed confidence that the new measures will ultimately pass legal muster, even if a local judge in a liberal city like Madison strikes some of them down for a time. In 2014, State Supreme Court justices validated limits on public sector unions that were Mr. Walker’s signature policy and made him a national figure in the Republican Party. That same year, the court upheld a voter identification law. And in 2015, justices ordered the end to an investigation of whether Mr. Walker’s campaign had illegally coordinated with conservative groups. “The Supreme Court has been there for Walker every step of the way,” said Scot Ross, the executive director of the One Wisconsin Institute, a liberal organization that along with Mr. Holder’s group promised to challenge some of the provisions signed Friday. Mr. Esenberg offered a different explanation for that series of court outcomes: “I don’t think the challenges to any of those laws were particularly strong.” The three laws Mr. Walker signed Friday include a grab bag of provisions ranging from the niche (Mr. Evers would need legislative approval to ban guns at the Capitol) to the expansive (Republican lawmakers could intervene in lawsuits and block more administrative rules). The laws also curbed the authority of the new Democratic attorney general, further codified voter identification and Medicaid work requirements and restricted early voting to two weeks. Both Mr. Evers and Josh Kaul, the incoming attorney general, have raised the possibility of suing, but neither had announced lawsuits as of Saturday morning. Mr. Ross’s group successfully challenged a previous limit to early voting in the federal courts, and Mr. Ross said he was optimistic that the same judge would block the new restriction on the timing of early voting. Most of the other provisions signed by Mr. Walker appeared to be matters for state judges to decide. That was seen as a roadblock for liberals, who remain in the minority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court despite flipping a conservative-held seat this year in a hard-fought election. Still, Democrats said they have reason for some optimism. Two court seats are up for the election in the next year-and-a-half — one held by a liberal, another by a conservative. If left-wing jurists were to win both races, the court could look different by the time it hears appeals to Mr. Walker’s new laws.",The New York Times
2018,The Beginning Was a Blur; the Ending May Be Unforgettable,"On College Football WEST POINT, N.Y. — Nearly four years later, Kenneth Brinson is still awed with the memory of his first moments at the United States Military Academy. He was herded into Eisenhower Hall along with the rest of the soon-to-be-plebes. He was welcomed briefly by a member West Point’s military command and told of his mission. Then an upper-class cadet stepped forward. “You have 90 seconds to say goodbye,” he directed. By the time Brinson scrambled to give his mother, Lucretia, a farewell hug, he was four minutes into 47 months of becoming — hopefully — a second lieutenant in the United States Army. By the end of that June day, Brinson had a buzz cut and a rhythm for precision marching. “They call it inculcating you with West Point values,” he said of those first hours at the academy, “and it was like — bam! — you start right now.” By the end of the summer, Brinson knew how to handle a weapon, the importance of the chain of command and, most important, that he was where he was supposed to be. Some classmates fell out; others were run down physically and drowning in their academics. Not Brinson. By the end of his first semester, he was at the top of his class. He was even hopeful about the prospects for Army football. He and his teammates had finished 2-10 that first season and had lost to archrival Navy for a 14th consecutive year, but Brinson saw better days ahead. “We were a young team, and I knew how hard we were working,” said Brinson, now a 6-foot-2, 245-pound senior linebacker preparing for Saturday, which will be his fourth Army-Navy game. “We were putting in the extra time, and we liked each other. I thought we were going to be very good.” [Read: The longstanding tradition of Army, Navy and Air Force cadets abducting one another’s mascots before big football games.] Brinson was right. He and a senior-laden team have reversed two decades of frustration to help return a proud Black Knights program to the national college football conversation. Army heads into its 119th meeting with Navy with a record of 9-2 and a chance to beat the Midshipmen for a third year in a row. The Black Knights accepted an invitation to the Armed Forces Bowl to play Houston (8-3). Even better, Army has returned to the national rankings for the first time since 1996: It is No. 22 in the current Associated Press poll and No. 25 in the USA Today coaches poll. For the past four years, Brinson has been near the middle of it all as a leader on a defense that ranks 11th nationally and is the primary beneficiary of Army’s ground-chewing, clock-eating offense. Brinson’s most impressive statistics may have come off the field: He excels in the classroom — he has maintained a 3.96 grade point average in chemical engineering and hopes to attend medical school — and even in his other sport. (He may have only two football games remaining in his Army career, but his track and field days will continue in the spring. Brinson is a thrower: shot put, discus and hammer.) “He is different from anyone I’ve ever had,” Army Coach Jeff Monken said. “He excels at a high level at everything he does, not only because he is talented and really bright, but he stays focused on what is in front of him.” Monken saw the same things Brinson did throughout that 2-10 finish in 2015: a group of freshmen who bought into the second-year coach’s mantra that “winning is hard,” but if you put the extra time in on the little things — film, fundamentals, focus — it gets easier. Even with 21 freshmen starting, seven of Army’s 10 losses that season were by 7 points or less. Two came on last-second field goals. The next year, Army went 8-5 and ended a 14-game losing streak against Navy with a 21-17 victory that both Brinson and Monken say was nothing less than cathartic. “Indescribable,” Brinson said of “singing second,” the privilege that lets the game’s victors sing their alma mater along with the Corps of Cadets and Army officers and troops at the game. “There was so much talk about the streak,” Monken said. “It was hard not to feel the weight of that on our shoulders. The team felt such a responsibility to put an end to it.” Last year, Army dispatched Navy, 14-13, and then won a shootout with San Diego State, 42-35, in the Armed Forces Bowl to finish 10-3. Neither Brinson nor Monken is looking past a Navy team in a rivalry that members of each military institution say transcends records or bowl invitations. “One game changes everything,” said Navy Coach Ken Niumatalolo, whose Midshipmen are 3-9. “We have amnesia when it comes to what’s happened in the past.” But this Army team did take Oklahoma, a college football playoff team, to overtime in Norman, Okla., earlier this season before losing, 28-21. A win over Navy and Houston would give Army 11 victories for the first time in its history. “I’d like the seniors to have that legacy to leave for the guys following them, and to the chance to be able to say they went 3-1 in this series,” Monken said. And Brinson? He wants to win, too, but lately he has found himself appreciating the people who have helped him succeed. He will have longer than 90 seconds to say goodbye. One mission may be nearing an end, he said, but another awaits. “My support system here has been great — in the corps, the classroom and my coaches and teammates,” Brinson said. “I’ve been trying to tell all those people that. There’s a million things I’m going to miss about it, but it is time to move on. It’s that time.”",The New York Times
2018,The Best Advice During a Year on the Road (So Far),"Jada Yuan, our 52 Places Traveler, has spent the past eight months on the road, crisscrossing the planet, from Los Cabos, Mexico, to Tasmania and dozens of places in between. Here’s some advice she got along the way. Like any globe-trotter, Jada has learned a lot of lessons on how to travel — the easy way, the hard way and, occasionally, in a different language. She’s also been given advice from fellow travelers, proud natives, and followers and fans across social media. Here’s a look at some of the best advice Jada has received from readers and some of the best advice she’s shared right back. You can also read all of her dispatches so far, and follow her travels on Instagram and Twitter. Before her trip to the Rogue River in Oregon, Jada asked Twitter followers what she couldn’t miss in the area. Followers responded with recommendations for caramels, road trips, hikes and sausages. She followed the advice of many, and also had her own recommendations. “When you do eat, though, make sure it involves blue cheese,” Jada said of her time in Oregon. The creamery she went to was recommended by a Twitter user, Katie D.: “Rogue Creamery has won awards for that moldy goodness, and a farm stand on its dairy in Grants Pass served a grilled cheese sandwich made of Oregon blue cheese, a type of mild Cheddar called TouVelle, and honey, on locally made white bread basted with grape seed oil, that I’d commemorate in song if I could.” “Even more indelible was Jasper’s Café in Medford, a roadside burger joint near the airport,” Jada wrote. The cafe was another recommendation from Katie D. “I craved it every day I was in Oregon — and was nearly late to my flight getting another one on the way out.” For many, the 52 Places traveler position is a dream job. For Jada, that dream, while not always totally dreamy, is a daily reality. And in that reality, you sometimes land in a hotel where there’s ice cream for breakfast. In Prague, she tweeted the following: Some readers had a few things to say about ice cream. In Cincinnati, the consensus was clear: Go to Graeter’s, they said. And get the blackberry chip — in a pretzel cone. And when someone suggests a chocolate factory, never, ever, say no. It goes without saying that when you’re traveling the world for a year, there will be some high highs and low lows. When Jada’s car was stuck in the mud on a remote beach in São Tomé — with no cell service, to boot — the following happened: “This,” her guide, Juliano, said, “is just part of the São Tomé culture; no one would ever leave anyone stranded.” In Lucerne, Switzerland, Jada faced a different kind of crisis: a lost bag with her laptop inside. “My hotel desk clerk said not to worry; Swiss people return things they find,” she writes in this Instagram caption. The next morning, she woke up to a direct message on Twitter from a man named Anton. “Hi Jada Yuan, please contact me if you lost something,” he wrote. Anton was in Jada’s hotel lobby — with her bag — 10 minutes later. A few months later in Fiji, Jada was tasked with voting in the U.S. midterm elections from the South Pacific, about 8,000 miles away. She credits a team of locals — from hotel staff to newfound friends — for helping her ballot make it back to New York City. In June, Jada answered many questions about her packing strategy. “Blogs, travel writers, foreign correspondent friends, and flight attendants all gave me great advice, but the past five months of hopscotching through climates and national borders have been figuring out what works for me, with trial — and a ton of error,” she writes. She shared a handful of her own tips and her biggest concern: “What happens when I get my period?” she asked. Tampons — and Duane Reades — aren’t everywhere, and that includes the African bush: Because why have a neck pillow when you could have an animal neck pillow, as spotted in the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International airport? While traveling in Bolivia, Jada ate at Gustu, a restaurant in La Paz, Bolivia. Perhaps the most important advice in a restaurant comes from the chef. In this case, the advice was: Eat it. Jada held the hand of the co-head chef, Marsia Taha Mohamed, while taking a bite of a queen ant taco. “Smoky and crunchy,” she wrote. “This Gustu tasting menu had at least 3 other proteins I’ve never tried (oxtails, beef hearts, and alligator ceviche). I won’t eat any of them again, but once seemed worth it.” Nothing against chefs, but bus drivers also have some good advice (if unintentional): Follow NY Times Travel on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

2018,The Best Art Books of 2018,"The Times’s art critics select some of their favorite art books and books related to art of the year. CreditCreditEric Helgas for The New York Times From a catalog that sheds new light on black models of mid-19th-century French painting to a collection of mid-1980s art criticism by the novelist and playwright Gary Indiana, the best art books of the past year provided a balm for turbulent times. Below, the New York Times’s art critics choose some of their favorites. — Nicole Herrington, Weekend Arts editor The histories of art are always in motion if you look hard enough. This year it didn’t take much looking to see waves being made by several books and catalogs that delved deeper into familiar areas or pioneered new ones, adding some euphoria to our blighted moment. ‘BETWEEN WORLDS: THE ART OF BILL TRAYLOR’ By Leslie Umberger (Smithsonian American Art Museum in association with Princeton University Press). The most thrilling book of the year is the catalog to the Smithsonian American Art Museum’s great Traylor exhibition. (On view in Washington, D.C., through March 17.) Starting with a rigorous introduction by the artist Kerry James Marshall, the book combines the formidable research and lively writing of the show’s curator, Ms. Umberger, and it does more than detail as never before the achievement of this singular artist, who was born a slave. It also sets a new art-historical standard, undermining the romantic myth of the outsider as unknowable miracle worker by examining Traylor’s achievement in stunning detail. Moving from the lives of his enslaved parents to the posthumous success of his art, she demonstrates how Traylor’s elegant images distill not only form but also the realities of black life in the South. (Read the exhibition review.) ‘HILMA AF KLINT: PAINTINGS FOR THE FUTURE’ Edited by Tracey Bashkoff (Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum). The catalog to this extraordinary exhibition at the Guggenheim (running through April 23) similarly fleshes out the Swedish artist Hilma af Klint (1862-1944). Academically-trained but also mystically-inclined, af Klint is now considered the first European to make the abstract paintings of early Modernism. She did so several years before the male artists usually credited for its invention, with a boldness of scale and color that would be matched only by the Abstract Expressionists several decades later. In words and pictures this volume follows af Klint as she considers abstraction’s many possibilities. (Read the exhibition review.) ‘POSING MODERNITY: THE BLACK MODEL FROM MANET AND MATISSE TO TODAY’ By Denise Murrell (Yale University Press in association with the Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Art Gallery, Columbia University). Two decades ago, few areas of art history seemed as exhausted, if not overstudied as late-19th-century French painting. But new ideas and approaches change everything. Thus we have “Posing Modernity” — the catalog to the exhibition (through Feb. 10) at the Mariam and Ira D. Wallach Art Gallery — both by Ms. Murrell. She delves into the black models who posed for Parisian painters; the black women depicted by the artists of the Harlem Renaissance; and the black body as a subject for contemporary artists, some of them black women themselves. The dots are connected in a new way. (Read the exhibition review.) ‘HAIRY WHO? 1966-1969’ Edited by Thea Liberty Nichols, Mark Pascale and Ann Goldstein (the Art Institute of Chicago). With its quizzical title, this substantial catalog, like its exhibition (through Jan. 6) at the Art Institute of Chicago, sorts out who was and was not Hairy Who, those six subversive Chicago artists who exhibited together under its rubric for four short years mostly at the Hyde Park Art Center. Led by Karl Wirsum and Jim Nutt, they wreaked havoc with various norms of art, society and gallery presentation. As their ranks expanded to include Roger Brown, Christina Ramberg and Ed Paschke, their cohort became known as the Chicago Imagists and the rest is finally, after an unconscionable delay, beginning to be history. ‘NINTH STREET WOMEN: LEE KRASNER, ELAINE DE KOONING, GRACE HARTIGAN, JOAN MITCHELL AND HELEN FRANKENTHALER: FIVE PAINTERS AND THE MOVEMENT THAT CHANGED MODERN ART’ By Mary Gabriel (Little, Brown and Company). At nearly 1,000 pages, Ms. Gabriel’s book teems with details that are almost always fascinating even when not essential. It resembles five biographies woven together against a background populated mostly by men: Abstract Expressionist painters, critics, dealers and curators. But these five women, intermittently friends, persisted and, each in her own way, triumphed. Their combined narrative has an inspiring force and some nugget of information on nearly every page. (Read the book review.) ‘THE COLLECTOR: THE STORY OF SERGEI SHCHUKIN AND HIS LOST MASTERPIECES’ By Natalya Semenova with André Delocque; translated by Anthony Roberts (Yale University Press). The French avant-garde paintings assembled by the Russian collector Sergei Shchukin in the early 1900s were exhibited in the West, specifically Paris, for the first time two years ago. Now comes the complex story of Shchukin as an alternately fearless and anxious collector; a successful textile merchant; and a doting husband and father. It is recounted by Ms. Semenova, a longtime Shchukin scholar, with Mr. Delocque, the collector’s grandson. Both collector and collection survived the Russian Revolution, but not together. The book shows the interiors of Shchukin’s Moscow palace lined with paintings (by van Gogh, Gauguin, Matisse and Picasso) whose vivid (digitalized) colors against the grisaille rooms still shock. ‘FLASH: THE MAKING OF WEEGEE THE FAMOUS’ By Christopher Bonanos (Henry Holt & Company). By current standards, the street photographer Arthur Fellig, better known as Weegee, might be considered a kind of performance artist: elbowing his way to the front of the more sensational scenes of New York night life, snapping pictures in his indelible noir style and developing them in the trunk of his car — so as to rush his product to the dailies ahead of the pack. His ambition, self-invention and neuroses are all detailed in this sharp biography by Mr. Bonanos, who clearly admires the artist, sees the unsavory aspects of the man and knows old New York as well as anyone too young to have lived through it. (Read the book review.) ‘GOODBYE TO TENTH STREET: A NOVEL’ By Irving Sandler (Pleasure Boat Studio). Anyone drawn to the postwar art scene that centered on Manhattan’s East 10th Street should read the last book of Mr. Sandler, the art historian and critic extraordinaire who died in June. He was there in the late 1950s and early ’60s taking notes while the Abstract Expressionists made history, and he became known for his meticulous accounts of their saga. But here he offers a roman à clef filled with the unverified gossip, overheard conversations, and rumors of nooners and backbiting that were unsuitable to fact-based history (though a few historical figures occupy the margins). The tale — from charged studio visits to nasty exchanges at the Cedar Bar — has its own sad, sordid, unsurprising truth. ‘RICHARD PRINCE: HIGH TIMES’ Edited by Richard Prince (Gagosian). This eccentric volume is a kind of artist’s book/self-portrait masquerading as an exhibition catalog. Like its show, it is unusually revealing, providing well-rounded views of a complex artist who generally aims to irritate and frequently succeeds. It not only reflects Mr. Prince’s talents for drawing and painting, but also other activities that feed his consummately American art as editor, writer, connoisseur of postwar music and literature and collector of ’60s ephemera. The book contains facsimiles of such items, like a postcard that Jimi Hendrix sent to his own father while touring England. (Read the exhibition review.) It was a rough year in the real world: demagoguery, xenophobia, racial violence, killer weather, left-on-left slugfests, internet blah-blah-blah. These books helped me to sort things out and change things up. ‘AGENTS OF FAITH: VOTIVE OBJECTS IN TIME AND PLACE’ Edited by Ittai Weinryb (Bard Graduate Center Gallery, New York). One of the great gifts of global consciousness has been to remind Western secular culture that some art has power beyond the aesthetic. And that power is what this book, the catalog for a show at Bard Graduate Center Gallery in Manhattan (through Jan. 6), is about. It brings together objects of spiritual significance from Africa, Asia, Latin America, medieval Europe and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington. Each item was designed to seal a vow, ask for help or give thanks for an answered prayer. Together they demonstrate that art is alive and interactive. A second remarkable book, also new this year, “Heaven on Earth: Painting and the Life to Come” by the veteran art historian T. J. Clark (Thames & Hudson), makes a similar point about art’s transformative pull. You don’t have to be religious to get it. You just have to have faith in the force of belief. ‘WHITEWALLING: ART, RACE & PROTEST IN 3 ACTS’ By Aruna D’Souza (Badlands Unlimited). This year we were increasingly being told, by some on both the political right and the political left, that identity politics is a Problem, the cause of the divisiveness of the times. So what are we supposed to do? Gather at our local diner and chat our troubles away? And why is that not a realistic solution? Because if you’re nonwhite (and/or female, and/or do not subscribe to conventional gender distinctions) the price of accommodation is too steep, in terms of safety, sanity and economics. That is the point of this trenchant book, written in response to the heated debate over an appropriated image — and history — of blackness in the last Whitney Biennial. (Read the book review.) ‘DECODING MIMBRES PAINTING: ANCIENT CERAMICS OF THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST’ By Tony Berlant and Evan Maurer (DelMonico Books). Centuries ago, Native American people in the Mimbres Valley of New Mexico produced fantastic pottery painted with human and animal forms and what appear to be geometric patterns. For a 2018 exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the artist Tony Berlant and the art historian Evan Maurer, took a long, imaginative look at these patterns and concluded that they aren’t abstract at all. They depict real things: hallucinogenic flowering plants and a species of moth known to pollinate them. Suddenly, a ritual-intensive culture comes to life, and a trippy art is trippier than we ever guessed. The curatorial sleuth work, illustrated with fabulous Mimbres bowls, is detailed in the show’s magical catalog. ‘GARY INDIANA: VILE DAYS: THE VILLAGE VOICE ART COLUMNS 1985-1988’ (Semiotext(e)). In the mid-1980s, the New York novelist and playwright Gary Indiana assumed a short but potent stint as senior art critic for The Village Voice, at a time — “one brief, scuzzy moment” he calls it — when the art market was boiling over and the AIDS epidemic was at full throttle. He brought to criticism a sardonic eye and a slicing voice, and held the art world’s feet to the fire in a way nobody else did. I read him faithfully during those years, and was glad to read him again in scuzzy 2018. ‘LINA BO BARDI’ By Zeuler R.M. de A. Lima (Yale University Press). One problem with being a die-hard starchitecture fan is that you sometimes have to go a distance to see work of a designer you love — all the way to São Paulo, Brazil, in the case of the revolutionary Lina Bo Bardi. But it’s worth every mile to experience her 1950 hilltop Glass House; her Pompeia factory-turned-public leisure center; and her monumental São Paulo Museum of Art with its “crystal easel” installation. Alternatively, you can now stay home and get a wide-angle view of the Bo Bardi herself in a fine 2013 critical biography being released in paperback this winter. She’s a slippery subject; but her impulse to punch holes in confining walls of all kinds was emphatic and deep-seated, and is more than welcome right now. ‘CURATORIAL ACTIVISM: TOWARDS AN ETHICS OF CURATING’ By Maura Reilly (Thames & Hudson). Parlous political times call for out-of-the-box museum thinking, which is what Ms. Reilly both documents and demands in this how-to handbook for lining up art and real life. To this end, Ms. Reilly, founding curator of the Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum, revisits key exhibitions of contemporary art, from 1976 to the present, that have tackled issues of race, class, sexuality and gender, and plots a path to a future of institutional truth-telling. ‘BRUCE NAUMAN: DISAPPEARING ACTS’ By Kathy Halbreich, et al. (The Museum of Modern Art). One of the year’s outstanding museum shows came with a superb book. The show’s lead curator, Ms. Halbreich, as is her custom, brings an involved, probing, personal tone to the catalog’s anchoring essay. Other contributions by artists (Ralph Lemon, Glenn Ligon, Rachel Harrison) and art historians (Suzanne Hudson, Liz Kotz, Catherine Lord) demonstrate the breadth and depth of Mr. Nauman’s continuing reach, and reveal a moral subtlety and tenderness in his art, that have not always been acknowledged in past assessments. (Read the exhibition review.) ‘DEANA LAWSON: AN APERTURE MONOGRAPH’ With an essay by Zadie Smith (Aperture). The photographer Deana Lawson is one of a growing number of contemporary artists intent on positioning the black body where it has rarely been welcome before, namely in the mainstream of contemporary art. In a visual version of creative nonfiction, she places people she barely knows in domestic settings that she arranged like stage sets. Her sitters seem to be at home, but something’s off. You sense hidden dramas waiting to unfold; tensions ticking away. This brilliant book of 40 photographs is a group portrait of a new version of difference she is discovering and inventing. (Read an article about the artist.) ‘WE SHALL OVERCOME: PRESS PHOTOGRAPHS OF NASHVILLE DURING THE CIVIL RIGHTS ERA’ Edited by Kathryn E. Delmez, with a foreword by Representative John Lewis (Frist Art Museum in association with Vanderbilt University Press, Nashville). In the 1960s, Birmingham, Ala., and Memphis became known as landmark sites in the civil rights struggle. Nashville, some 200 miles from both cities and home to the historically black Fisk University, had its struggles too, less widely broadcast but scrupulously recorded by the local press. This book, the catalog of an exhibition at Frist Art Museum in Nashville, captures a decade of everyday bravery and trauma as recorded in photographs, drawn from city archives, by Nashville photojournalists. (Read an Opinion piece about the exhibition.) ‘MURALS OF TIBET’ By Thomas Laird, et al. (Taschen). The big splurge. In the 1970s, while still in his teens, the American photographer and writer Thomas C. Laird first traveled to the Himalayas. He settled in Kathmandu, Nepal, and eventually went on to Tibet, where he made life-size digital photographs of centuries-old mural cycles in Buddhist monasteries. The photographs have been reproduced in a jumbo-size Collector’s Edition of 998 copies, each of which includes six fold-outs of complete murals and comes with a 528-page guide and a bookstand designed by the Pritzker Prize-winning architect Shigeru Ban. Price for a total, staggering ensemble: $12,000. I can’t begin to think what the Buddha might say about such extravagance, but His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama has given it his blessing, personally signing each copy of the Collector’s Edition. Keeping up with art worldwide means taking a lot of flights; reading books, at least, is less carbon-intensive. This year the publications that impressed me most came from Italy and Poland, South Africa and East Asia; all testify to how art can surmount borders when politicians seem determined to fortify them. ‘MASAHISA FUKASE’ Edited by Tomo Kosuga (Éditions Xavier Barral). A virtuoso of obsession and abandonment, Fukase was one of the signal photographers of postwar Japan. This 400-page volume introduces English-speaking audiences to Fukase’s art — from grainy Tokyo reportage and witty staged family portraits to his magnum opus, “Ravens,” an otherworldly conjuring of black birds and snow haunted by the memory of his ex-wife and his childhood in northern Japan. In 1992, a blitzed Fukase fell down the stairs of his favorite Tokyo bar; he lapsed into a coma and never recovered. Until his death in 2012 his photos were largely inaccessible, and this book is still missing some important works, as Fukase’s ex-wife refused to provide necessary image rights. Even so, it’s a landmark — a first step, though not the last, in the rediscovery of one of the greatest artists of the 20th century. (Read more about this and some of the year’s other best photography books.) ‘GIUSEPPE PENONE: THE INNER LIFE OF FORMS’ Edited by Carlos Basualdo (Gagosian). This box set, as unpretentiously refined as the Arte Povera artist’s sculptures, comprises a book of essays (by the archaeologist Salvatore Settis, the curator Emily Braun, and others) and a dozen stapled pamphlets that each highlight a theme or series. The pamphlet “Trees” includes captivating sketches and studio views for Mr. Penone’s large sculptures of trunks stripped to their heartwood; the one featuring “Reversing One’s Eyes,” his 1970 photograph of himself wearing mirrored contact lenses, also includes forgotten alternate versions and freshly translated poems. As hopes for climate preservation grow fainter, I find myself ever more attached to Mr. Penone’s art; this publication is an evidence locker of how nature and the man-made became indistinct. ‘THE LOVE OF PAINTING: GENEALOGY OF A SUCCESS MEDIUM’ By Isabelle Graw (Sternberg Press). For too long, the response to the provocation that painting “died” in the 1960s was nonengagement: of course painting is alive and well, so why bother with a proper rebuttal? It’s time that we defend painting explicitly, with as much theoretical force as the skeptics — as Ms. Graw, the co-founder of Germany’s venerable magazine Texte zur Kunst, does in this winning book. The essays here, on artists from Manet to the young New Yorker Avery Singer, propose that paintings convey “vitalistic fantasies,” or imagined impressions of their creators; interviews with Jutta Koether, Wade Guyton and Charline von Heyl further her argument for painting’s lifelikeness. What emerges is a validation that, in Ms. Graw’s words, “painting and conceptual art are not, as was once assumed, polar opposites; rather, they are directly related to each other.” ‘ATLAS OF BRUTALIST ARCHITECTURE’ Edited by Virginia McLeod and Clare Churly (Phaidon). As hulking and imposing as the buildings it surveys, this book weighs seven and a half pounds, and its cover is flecked with abrasive sandpaper. It collates images of more than 850 concrete buildings from the 1960s onward, stretching past Brutalism’s monuments — Paul Rudolph’s headquarters for the Yale architecture school, the Barbican apartments in London — to massive concrete buildings from West Africa to Southeast Asia. Newcomers will discover the global influence of brutalism, that final age of civic architectural ambition; true believers can use it to prepare years of concrete-coated vacations. (Book me a suite at Marcel Breuer’s Alpine ski resort!) ‘ZANELE MUHOLI: SOMNYAMA NGONYAMA, HAIL THE DARK LIONESS’ By Zanele Muholi and Renée Mussai (Aperture). The South African photographer — or “visual activist,” to use the artist’s own term — was still quite young when they won global recognition for “Faces and Phases,” their series of portraits of black lesbians and transgender people. (The artist uses gender-neutral pronouns.) Since then Zanele Muholi has turned the camera the other way, and this lush book gathers years of self-portraits, shot in black-and-white and at such high contrast that their skin takes on the sheen of obsidian. (Bravo to the printers at Ofset Yapimevi in Istanbul, who have reproduced these photographs with stunning tonal richness.) Often the artist drapes their clothes or hair with everyday props, from clothespins to paper clips, yet these photographs are never comic; they are ferociously impressive affirmations of an artist determined to speak with no limits. (Read a review of the book.) ‘RENÉ D’HARNONCOURT AND THE ART OF INSTALLATION’ By Michelle Elligott (The Museum of Modern Art). MoMA’s second director, who served from 1949 to 1967, was also one of its boldest exhibition designers — and his interests stretched well beyond modern art. This enlightening archival volume revives more than a dozen of d’Harnoncourt’s exhibitions, including “Timeless Aspects of Modern Art” (1948-49), in which a Romanesque crucifix and an Egyptian fertility goddess appeared under spotlights in darkened galleries; “The Art of the Asmat” (1962), which showcased New Guinean sculpture in a temporary pavilion in MoMA’s sculpture garden; and a renowned 1967 Picasso sculpture show, where the artist’s busts sat on piles of bricks. Installation shots appear here with d’Harnoncourt’s hand-drawn floor plans and directorial doodles, not to mention some tough reviews from The Times. ‘THE CHIAROSCURO WOODCUT IN RENAISSANCE ITALY’ By Naoko Takahatake (Los Angeles County Museum of Art/DelMonico Books). In Venice five centuries ago, the artist Ugo da Carpi codified a new printmaking technique: If you coated two or more woodblocks with lighter and darker inks, and then stamped them on a single sheet, you could create arresting multicolored prints with uncommon depths. More than 100 such chiaroscuro prints, including ones after Raphael, Titian and Parmigianino, were on view earlier this year at LACMA and are at the National Gallery of Art in Washington through Jan. 20 — and in the show’s catalog, Ms. Takahatake shows step-by-step how Italian artists made these rich prints. This is an authoritative volume, and a handsome one too, laid out with spare elegance by Green Dragon Office of Los Angeles and printed on caress-inviting matte stock. ‘CHINESE MOVIE MAGAZINES: FROM CHARLIE CHAPLIN TO CHAIRMAN MAO 1921-1951’ By Paul Fonoroff (University of California Press). An engrossing book assembles hundreds of covers from independent cinema publications — some as ambitious as Cahiers du Cinéma but most as dishy as Confidential — that emerged in movie-loving China between the 1920s and the first years of Communism. Silent-era movie magazines made use of painted covers and radically inventive Chinese typography, while wartime magazines promoted both patriotic pictures and escapist schmaltz. Shanghai’s megastars Butterfly Wu and Ruan Lingyu appear on dozens of front pages, but one other cover girl suggests what’s to come: Jiang Qing, the actress later known as Madame Mao. ‘FLIGHTS’ By Olga Tokarczuk (Riverhead). The best novel I read this year — a centuries-spanning constellation of lives spent in transit — is also a museum world tour. Ms. Tokarczuk, Poland’s most celebrated living writer, examines her themes of motion and stasis both in art institutions, including the Louvre and St. Petersburg’s Kunstkamera, as well as at anatomical museums like the Mütter Museum in Philadelphia, where the remains of the sick and the dead float in formaldehyde. “Fluidity, mobility, illusoriness — these are precisely the qualities that make us civilized,” Ms. Tokarczuk writes. One proof of that is how many of us are now on the move in the service of art. (Read an article about the author.)

2018,The Best Baking Cookbooks of 2018,"Life is hard enough. Baking doesn’t have to be. Our three favorite books inspire but don’t intimidate. A good cookbook is one in which a handful of recipes excite you. You dog-ear a few pages and slide the book onto your shelf. Maybe you’ll return to it later, and maybe you won’t. (You probably won’t.) A great cookbook, on the other hand, practically shimmers with possibilities. You begin to dog-ear the pages, but stop halfway through because what’s the point of doing that to an entire book? You go directly to the kitchen and bake. The three best baking cookbooks published this year land squarely in the latter camp. The recipes and photography are inspirational but not at all intimidating, and while there are new ideas and fun flavor combinations, absent are the 16-page treatises on how to construct a towering croquembouche or make croissants from scratch. Life is hard enough. Baking doesn’t have to be. Leading the pack is “Sister Pie: The Recipes and Stories of a Big-Hearted Bakery in Detroit” (Lorena Jones Books, $25) by Lisa Ludwinski, who worked at the bakeries Milk Bar and Four and Twenty Blackbirds before opening her own in Detroit. She has written a book with 45 adventurous pie recipes, like blueberry plum balsamic, toasted marshmallow butterscotch and malted lime. I know my way around a cake pan, but pie crusts often vex me. Following Ms. Ludwinski’s detailed though easy-to-follow instructions for making a crust (two full pages for the recipe and several more dedicated to rolling, crimping and blind baking) rewarded me with my best pie crust yet. With it, I made Sister Pie’s signature buttery and rich maple pie, sort of a Yankee’s answer to the South’s chess pie. The crust was flaky and tender, even on the bottom. Pie is the focus, but the book includes many other enticing recipes, like rose-pistachio shortbread, buttered corn scones, peanut butter-smoked paprika cookies and paczki, Polish-style doughnuts. Another star this season is “Modern Baking: Cakes, Cookies and Everything in Between” (HarperCollins, $40) by Donna Hay, a popular Australian cookbook author and magazine publisher. The jaw-dropping photography is reason enough to buy this 400-page doorstop, but its 250-plus recipes more than follow through. Ms. Hay understands that she’s writing for the busy home cook: Her introduction is mercifully short, and most of her recipes are a half-page or less, so you can get right to it. One of my favorites is her salted dark chocolate layer cake with milk chocolate ganache. It sounds fancy, but it’s a shockingly simple two-bowl affair that skips combining the wet and dry ingredients first — you just dump everything into a bowl and stir. I was dubious, but it yielded a tender, sophisticated cake that I know I’ll make over and over again. Her caramel popcorn, salted almond and malt cookies were another surprise hit. Next on my list are the cardamom-pistachio caramels, and come summer you’ll find me making the blackberry-elderflower pie, which has a layer of pistachios nestled between the filling and the crust. If there is one sticking point, it’s that some of Ms. Hay’s recipes call for ingredients like double cream that are not easy to find in the United States, and she provides no substitutes. (For pouring cream, heavy cream works fine, and for superfine sugar, granulated will often do). Most items can be found online or at specialty markets, and most of the book translates well, but it would be nice to see her books fully adapted for the American home baker. For the baker looking for a sure thing with every turn of the page, there’s “Food52 Genius Desserts: 100 Recipes That Will Change the Way You Bake,” (Ten Speed, $35), a collection of recipes compiled by Kristen Miglore, the creative director of the website Food52. Each recipe is a game changer using an unusual ingredient or a new technique. I loved the food writer Charlotte Druckman’s crunchy-salty-sweet cacio e pepe shortbread (really more of a cocktail snack), which I’m looking forward to nibbling with a glass of something bubbly. And sure to grace many holiday cookie plates this year are the dessert doyenne Dorie Greenspan’s famous World Peace Cookies, a slice-and-bake treat that Ms. Miglore describes as “a little bit French chocolate sablé and a little bit American chocolate chip.” But the recipe that really bowled me over was the chef Einat Admony’s easy baklava, which calls for rolling up the nut filling in the phyllo and slicing it into discs as you would cinnamon rolls, then baking and drizzling the slices with cardamom-rosewater-honey syrup. Like traditional baklava, they are shatteringly crisp, gooey and sweet in all the right places, but much less work. Two cookbooks that deserve honorable mentions this year are “All About Cake” by Christina Tosi with Courtney McBroom (Clarkson Potter, $35) and “Rose’s Baking Basics: 100 Essential Recipes, With More Than 600 Step-by-Step Photos” by Rose Levy Beranbaum (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $35). Ms. Tosi’s latest shows readers how to make Milk Bar’s whimsical cakes at home. In addition to her famous layer cakes and cake truffles, she offers several variations on her Crock-Pot cake (the orange Creamsicle version was a big hit at my house) and a recipe for a microwave chocolate mug cake that’s surprisingly delicious. Her recipes are more of a project than those in the other books listed here, but they’re not hard. They just take more time. “Rose’s Baking Basics” features classic recipes accompanied by the meticulous details that have become Ms. Beranbaum’s trademark. I love the “mise en place” section of her recipes that prompt cooks to do the things I always forget to do, like remove the butter and eggs from the refrigerator 30 minutes in advance so they can come to room temperature. If you’re a nervous new baker looking for guaranteed results or an old hat looking to tidy up your techniques, her book will become a well-used addition in your collection. You don’t need a lot of fancy equipment or a ton of experience to get the most out of these books — just a simple desire to get into the kitchen and bake something beautiful and delicious. Bonus points if you get a good Instagram photo out of the deal.

2018,The Best Classical Music of 2018,"In a year of beginnings, the Jaap van Zweden era started at the New York Philharmonic, and the 92-year-old composer Gyorgy Kurtag’s first opera had its premiere. Read all about it, and listen to some of our favorite artists. anthony tommasini We depend on the composers and performers we admire to keep enriching us. But it is even more exciting when great artists surprise us, as several did for me during an exceptional year in music. When the New York Philharmonic chose Mr. van Zweden as its music director, the orchestra went for a maestro known for powerful accounts of repertory staples. His commitment to contemporary music seemed less certain. As if in defiant reply, he opened each of his first three Philharmonic programs this fall with the premiere of a commissioned work. Mr. van Zweden began with a boldly unconventional piece by a young American: Ashley’s Fure’s dark, strange, exploratory “Filament” for orchestra, three instrumental soloists and a chorus that moves around the space. For almost 15 minutes, David Geffen Hall was turned into a haunting aural environment through Ms. Fure’s mystical, atmospheric music, by turns dreamy and dangerous. The following week, Mr. van Zweden led Conrad Tao’s “Everything Must Go,” written as a curtain-raiser for Bruckner’s sprawling Eighth Symphony. Combining seriousness and youthful abandon, Mr. Tao grappled with Bruckner’s symphony in his restless piece. A Dutch modernist master, Louis Andriessen, provided the third premiere, “Agamemnon,” a teeming, raucous, strangely alluring 20-minute score. In another encouraging sign, Mr. van Zweden introduced and hosted two contemporary music initiatives, presenting Mr. Tao in an eclectic “Nightcap” program at the Kaplan Penthouse, and Mr. Andriessen in a substantive “Sound On” concert at Jazz at Lincoln Center. What’s still open to question, actually, is Mr. van Zweden’s approach to the staples that are supposedly his specialties. My reactions have been mixed, at best, to his accounts of that Bruckner symphony and other works including Stravinsky’s “Rite of Spring” and Debussy’s “La Mer.” It was a gamble for this soprano to sing the touchstone title role of Puccini’s “Tosca” for the first time ever this spring at the Metropolitan Opera. But she knew what she was doing. From her first entrance, Ms. Netrebko was every bit Puccini’s passionate, vulnerable and charismatic heroine, a renowned prima donna in 1800 Rome. She captured every nuance of the music and Tosca’s volatile emotions with rapturous, tender, fierce singing. She was just as riveting at the Met this fall in the title role of Verdi’s “Aida.” The Met’s general manager, Peter Gelb, should follow her around with contracts in hand. I expected beautiful Chopin from this young Russian pianist, a brilliant virtuoso with poetic sensibilities, in two programs early this year that were part of his Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall. But I was impressed by his formidable playing of nine daunting 20th-century works in the ambitious concert with which he ended his series. Called “Decades,” the program offered Mr. Trifonov’s personal survey of the century, with works by Berg, Prokofiev, Bartok, Copland, Messiaen, Ligeti, Stockhausen and more. We are used to watching him play challenging concertos and études effortlessly. But on this night, Mr. Trifonov let us see him sweat. Since its premiere in 2012, the opera “Written on Skin,” by this British composer and the librettist Martin Crimp, has been produced around the world and acclaimed as one of the most important operas of our time. Could the team do it again? Yes, as they proved in May with the premiere of “Lessons in Love and Violence” at the Royal Opera House in London. Mining the relationship of Edward II and his courier Piers Gaveston, this disturbingly tragic opera offers an object lesson in what can transpire when an absolute ruler conflates his personal desires with the identity of his suffering nation. Mr. Benjamin’s score, though unabashedly modernist, was beguiling and mysterious. In 2011, a 19-year-old Army private named Danny Chen killed himself at an outpost in Afghanistan after suffering months of vicious hazing and racist taunts. Three years later, this composer and the playwright David Henry Hwang turned the harrowing story into a 60-minute chamber opera. Taking a risk, they expanded the piece into a full two-hour work, “An American Soldier,” which had its premiere this summer at Opera Theater of St. Louis. This inventive and searing opera could not have been more relevant in an America riven by issues of race, war and bullying. The opera shifts between scenes in which the ghost of Pvt. Chen witnesses the trial of his sergeant for negligent homicide, and flashbacks from his teenage life: hanging out with friends in New York’s Chinatown, making dinner with his mother in the kitchen, arriving for basic training full of patriotism and zeal. For all its orchestral and choral lushness, this composer’s 2000 opera “L’Amour de Loin” has an intimate quality. Her latest opera, “Only the Sound Remains,” which had its American premiere last month at Lincoln Center’s White Light Festival, manages almost the opposite: The genuinely intimate work — for two singers, a dancer, a background vocal quartet and chamber ensemble — gathers full-scale musical richness and powerful thematic resonance. Based on two Japanese Noh plays, one about a young monk transfixed by the ghost of a dead man he prays for, the other about a fisherman who finds the feather mantle of a moon spirit, proved subtly riveting and wondrously spiritual in an imaginative, simple Peter Sellars production. zachary woolfe These are the concerts and operas (and a couple of films) that have stuck with me through months filled to overflowing with music. They run the gamut — Verdi and Julius Eastman, Bach and Ashley Fure — but all shared that mixture of confidence and adventurousness that defines a memorable performance. This young Georgian mezzo-soprano had been daringly grim in “Carmen” and sensuous in “Prince Igor” in recent seasons at the Metropolitan Opera, but I was still unprepared for her overwhelming portrayal of Azucena in Verdi’s “Il Trovatore” in January, sung with bel canto elegance and startling authority. She brought warmth, fear and eloquence back to a character that can often be merely blunt, then followed up the feat in September, conjuring a seductive yet implacable Amneris in Verdi’s “Aida.” (As far as staged opera, just Patricia Racette’s sensitive, richly rueful Elle in “La Voix Humaine,” at Opera Philadelphia in September, has stayed with me so strongly.) The return of the vital, stormy music of the composer Julius Eastman, who died in obscurity in 1990, has been an inspiring story in recent years. His resurgence took a major step forward with this festival, organized in January and February by the artist Tiona Nekkia McClodden, Dustin Hurt of the Philadelphia arts organization Bowerbird, and the Kitchen in Chelsea. It included a revival of the jeweled “Femenine” and a clangorous, intense evening of Eastman’s moody works for multiple pianos. One of our most essential singers arrived for a rare New York recital in February at Zankel Hall. It was a quietly shattering yet deeply satisfying evening, a study in aging, nostalgia and death pursued through ripe Respighi songs, autumnal Nadia Boulanger, changeable early Britten, wryly pained Poulenc. (And, as encores, exquisitely shaped Frescobaldi and an almost murmured Habanera from “Carmen.”) No program notes, no speeches from the stage: She treated her audience like adults, sharing an intimacy charged with mystery. Few pleasures could equal the spectacle of this masterly musician playing all six of Bach’s suites for solo cello in a space where the composer worked, St. Nicholas Church in Leipzig, Germany. Given on a September evening with honesty, straightforwardness and lack of exaggeration, the music was milked for neither laughter nor tears, with a tone like wire coated in silk. Mr. Ma’s final three suites, in particular, radiated visionary focus and fervor. (For instrumental recitals, only Yuja Wang’s unnerving program of Rachmaninoff, Scriabin and Prokofiev at Carnegie Hall in May could match it.) The centennial, last year, of the birth of the composer Lou Harrison was celebrated in April and May by a choreographer who’s always relished his smilingly ritualistic music, rhythmic yet relaxed. In the memorably intimate environs of his Dance Center, Mr. Morris — who sat in on percussion with the small, excellent musical ensemble — put on a program of works that culminated in the sweeping, enigmatic primordial society of “Grand Duo.” Delicious quirks abound at this annual weekend-long event in an eccentric valley east of Santa Barbara, Calif. Each year a different artist organizes the festival; this June brought the earnest, raucous violinist Patricia Kopatchinskaja, who dived into organizing and performing alike with gusto. She corralled the JACK Quartet into performances of sumptuous serenity; early-morning Morton Feldman followed late-night John Luther Adams. And she persuaded Markus Hinterhäuser, the pianist who runs the Salzburg Festival, to join her in duets by the reclusive Russian composer Galina Ustvolskaya; he then played alone the hourlong cycle of Ustvolskaya’s six piano sonatas, a dumbfounding achievement of concentration and dignity. A re-encounter that demanded a re-evaluation. I had remembered John Adams’s 2005 opera about the Manhattan Project as stolid and overlong. But in a pared-down production by Peter Sellars (also the work’s librettist) this summer at Santa Fe Opera — an enormous sphere hung above a bare stage — it was lean and surreal, alternating lush, ominous sensuality and pummeling intensity. A superb cast led by Ryan McKinny and Julia Bullock was conducted, with an instinct for tension, by Matthew Aucoin. A one-two punch this year brought this young composer firmly into the New York musical spotlight. First, at Lincoln Center’s Mostly Mozart Festival in the summer, “The Force of Things,” the glacial, scary “opera for objects” she created with her brother, the architect Adam Fure, used harrowing softness — even inaudibility — to evoke the permeating anxiety of our mounting ecological crisis. Then, at the concert that opened Jaap van Zweden’s tenure as music director of the New York Philharmonic, came “Filament,” a slyly ominous drone of a fanfare. Brooding on the impossibility of the American dream, Missy Mazzoli and Royce Vavrek’s tense, creepy new opera, which came to the Miller Theater at Columbia University in September, shows the fracturing of a homestead family suffering on the brutal Nebraska plains. The setting is the middle of the 19th century, but the lessons — about prosperity, virility, patriotism and cycles of violence — are crushingly contemporary. And Ms. Mazzoli’s score, for just a dozen or so players, is a landscape of shimmering aridity. An era ended with the November premiere, after many false hopes over the past decade, of this opera by the 92-year-old Hungarian master Gyorgy Kurtag at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan. A series of scenes and monologues extracted from the Beckett play “Endgame,” it is a work of utterly assured starkness — confident and patient. The music seems to wrap around and subtly trail off the words; the lucid orchestra is neither bullying nor reticent, producing an atmosphere of gnomic, melancholy beauty. It is, like its Beckett source, tender, transparent, unsentimental and unsparing. The year ended with the release of two essential documents of two of the 20th century’s greatest divas. “Maria by Callas” is an impressionistic, melancholy portrait — primarily a self-portrait, heavy on candid, little-read letters — of a meteoric rise and agonizing decline. “Amazing Grace” is a sweatily veristic immersion in the recording of Aretha Franklin’s 1972 gospel album — with choir, in front of amazed, raucous audiences in an intimate Los Angeles church. We hear Callas sing “Ah! non credea” from Bellini’s “La Sonnambula,” rapt in hurt. We hear Franklin close with “Never Grow Old,” her tone focused, her phrasing transcendently free. The passing details that bring these giants to human life are what catch your heart: Aretha clasping the Rev. James Cleveland’s hand behind her back while she sings; a jokey glance from Callas as she walks backstage. “Maria by Callas” is crushing; “Amazing Grace,” a teeming potluck of virtuosity and heart. joshua barone The 21-year-old Daniil Trifonov arrived at Lincoln Center in 2012 with a dazzling yet nuanced account of Prokofiev’s Third Piano Concerto. Igor Levit, shortly after his 27th birthday in 2014, fearlessly played Beethoven’s late piano sonatas at the Park Avenue Armory with maturity beyond his years. In those New York debuts, Mr. Trifonov and Mr. Levit already showed the makings of greatness. But they truly blossomed this year with performances — onstage and in the recording studio — that surpassed their past achievements and brought their artistry to thrilling heights. Mr. Trifonov concluded his Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall in May with “Decades,” a survey of 20th-century piano music and a departure from the Romantic repertory that made him famous. I won’t forget Stockhausen’s “Klavierstück IX”: Mr. Trifonov hunched over, sweat dripping from his long hair, hands hesitating ever so slightly before landing, confidently, on the keyboard with a mighty chord. It was the first time I’d ever seen him struggle, and the moment I realized he was capable of much more than showy war horse concertos. This fall, Mr. Levit followed a three-disc album of variations by Bach, Beethoven and Rzewski with “Life,” a meditative yet sweeping response to the death of his best friend. (He played much of it in an outstanding recital at Carnegie’s Zankel Hall in October.) His recording of Wagner’s “Solemn March to the Holy Grail” from “Parsifal,” as transcribed by Liszt, is one the most hauntingly sublime tracks of the year. This is the type of searching album you would expect of a musician late in his career; Mr. Levit is just 31. And apparently still aiming higher: By November, he was back in the studio. seth colter walls The Wet Ink Ensemble celebrated its 20th anniversary this year. That checks out: Wet Ink is an extremely well-drilled contemporary music group. That doesn’t happen overnight. But the idea of two decades is a little strange. It makes this group seem older than its music-making does. I don’t know of a classical ensemble with a more joyously hard-edge, go-for-broke attack than that required by the pianist and composer Eric Wubbels’s “Auditory Scene Analysis, Part One.” This first track from one of Wet Ink’s 2018 albums requires complex handoffs of melody between different instrumentalists, long blasts of white noise and some sumptuously Dionysian playing from the rhythm section. Mr. Wubbels is one of seven directors of Wet Ink. Other performers in the group include the composer-saxophonist Alex Mincek (who made The New York Times’s best classical recordings list in 2017), as well as the violinist Josh Modney (whose triple-disc set “Engage” was another highlight of 2018). Then there is the best-known composer in the ensemble, the soprano Kate Soper, whose charming and invigorating opera-slash-humanities lecture “Ipsa Dixit” arrived at the Miller Theater at Columbia University this fall, as well as on a new album from New World Records. It can start to seem a little unfair to the rest of the contemporary classical scene to put albums by this crew in every year-end list. On the 20th anniversary of their founding, perhaps it’s enough to call them the best band of 2018.",The New York Times
2018,The Best TV Shows and Movies New to Netflix Canada in January,"Every month, Netflix Canada adds a new batch of TV shows and movies to its library. Here are the titles we think are most interesting for January, broken down by release date. Netflix occasionally changes schedules without giving notice. ‘Adrift’Starts streaming: Jan. 1 Advertised as a kind of “Titanic” in miniature — a seafaring romance about sun-kissed young people confronted by mortal catastrophe — “Adrift” didn’t get the respect (or the box office success) it deserved. Working loosely from the true story of two sailors, played here by Shailene Woodley and Sam Claflin, whose yacht gets stranded in the Pacific after a hurricane, the director Baltasar Kormákur (“Everest”) handles the love story with refreshing earnestness and the catastrophe with gripping stylistic brio. The film also benefits from an elegant structural conceit, running parallel timelines between the events leading up to the disaster and its aftermath. — ‘Loving’Starts streaming: Jan. 1 Richard and Mildred Loving were the plaintiffs in Loving v. Virginia, the 1967 United States Supreme Court decision that struck down existing state laws prohibiting interracial marriage. With “Loving,” the writer-director Jeff Nichols emphasizes the quiet persistence of the couple’s relationship as the authorities continue to harass, arrest and eventually drive them away from their home in rural Virginia. For this reason, the Lovings are excellent plaintiffs in the case — and photogenic, too, garnering national attention in a Life magazine profile. But “Loving,” anchored by Ruth Negga and Joel Edgerton’s powerful lead performances, reveals the private authenticity of a bond made public with great reluctance.— ‘A Quiet Place’Starts streaming: Jan. 2 Like every other genre in the blockbuster age, studio horror films have had to amplify in scale in order to make a big impression. So it’s a relief that “A Quiet Place” has a certain amount of discipline and restraint baked into its premise. In the post-apocalyptic world of the film, an infestation of aliens has wiped out most of humanity. Those who remain have to stay quiet, because these deadly creatures have an extreme sensitivity to sound. The director John Krasinski, best known as Jim from “The Office,” also co-stars with Emily Blunt as parents trying to shepherd their three children to safety, which becomes even more of a challenge with a baby on the way.— ‘Bring It On’Starts streaming: Jan. 2 Netflix is adding “Bring It On” and four of the film’s five direct-to-video sequels — whither “Bring It On: Worldwide Cheersmack”? — but the original 2000 comedy remains the only necessary viewing in this cheer-i-verse. Kirsten Dunst and Eliza Dushku play off each other beautifully as mismatched cheerleaders trying to lead their squad back to competition glory, and the director Peyton Reed scores laughs at the absurdities of the sport, especially in a sequence in which a choreographer introduces the girls to “spirit fingers.” “Bring It On” also squeezes in a substantive critique of cultural appropriation, turning on a routine stolen from a mostly black squad from Compton.— ‘The Bourne Ultimatum’Starts streaming: Jan. 2 On the same day Netflix is making nearly all the “Bring It On” movies available, the service is also releasing four of the five Jason Bourne movies, which are much more bingeworthy. (Missing is the most recent entry, “Jason Bourne.”) The Bourne series has positioned itself as a more with-it James Bond, stripping away the glamour and camp of 007 in favor of a grittier engagement with today’s threats of mass surveillance and stateless violence. “The Bourne Ultimatum,” the third and best of the series, follows Bourne (Matt Damon) as he discovers a secret C.I.A. black-ops mission to use agents like himself to carry out assassinations.— ‘Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened’Starts streaming: Jan. 18 Promoted as a high-end musical event, the inaugural Fyre Festival was scheduled over two weekends on the Bahamian island of Great Exuma, where attendees would indulge in modern food and luxury beachside geodesic domes while enjoying performances by the headliner and co-founder, Ja Rule, and other guests. Then on opening weekend in late April 2017, reports started flooding social media of missing luggage, a tent city with dirt floors, sandwiches of white bread and processed cheese, and an absence of staff on the scene. The botched festival and its fallout — which landed the organizer Billy McFarland a six-year prison sentence and a $26 million fine for wire fraud — are covered in this hotly anticipated documentary by Chris Smith, the director of “American Movie.”— ‘Girl’Starts streaming: Jan. 18 This Belgian drama about a transgender girl (Victor Polster) who wants to be a ballerina was praised as a powerful coming-of-age story and won the Camera d’Or for best first feature at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, where it picked up mostly rave reviews. The film has since drawn heavy criticism from trans and queer writers who objected to its treatment of the subject, noting the absence of trans participants on either side of the camera, as well as its treatment of hormone replacement therapy. “Girl” and the controversy surrounding it will reach a wider audience with its Netflix premiere.— ‘Ant-Man and the Wasp’Starts streaming: Jan. 29 Ant-Man is the Marvel superhero for those who have a more casual relationship to the Marvel Cinematic Universe — or perhaps a more whimsical conception of what a superhero should be. The first “Ant-Man” reflected some of the disarray behind the scenes: The film started with the director Edgar Wright and ended with the director Peyton Reed co-authoring a rewrite and hustling the film to production. “Ant-Man and the Wasp” is more confident and more fun than its predecessor, with Paul Rudd reprising his role as the wisecracking, diminutive super-dad and teaming up with Evangeline Lilly’s Wasp for a quantum-level adventure. Though Ant-Man didn’t appear in the most recent “Avengers” movie, his connection to the MCU leads to one of Marvel’s better post-credits sequences.— ‘Incredibles 2’Starts streaming: Jan. 30 The “Toy Story” series excepted, Pixar tends to stick to formula in its franchise sequels. “Incredibles 2” is no exception, not quite repeating the whiz-bang dynamics of the original, but still picking up at the exact moment the last one left off. Yet the further adventures of Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl and their three gifted children prove to be a durable conceit, like watching a two-hour block of quality serialized television. And the little differences matter, like Elastigirl’s more expansive role as the rejuvenated face of the superhero class and the chaos created by baby Jack-Jack’s unharnessed talents. The company could stand to play it a little less safe next time, though.— ‘Sex Education’Starts streaming: Jan. 11 With Amazon Prime successfully harvesting British TV talent for edgy, breakout comedies like “Fleabag” and “Catastrophe,” Netflix is taking its shot with “Sex Education,” the creator Laurie Nunn’s sweet-and-sour show about life as the virginal teenage son of a sex therapist. Asa Butterfield stars as Otis, an awkward teenager who may lack experience, but has absorbed a lot of information from his mother, played by Gillian Anderson, who’s always been candid about the birds and the bees. Otis and his best friend Maeve (Emma Mackey) take on the bizarre initiative to open up a sex clinic for their peers.— ‘Titans’Starts streaming: Jan. 11 As the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been shrinking on Netflix, most recently with the surprise cancellation of “Daredevil,” the service has to find other ways to fill the superhero void. To that end, it has picked up “Titans,” the first original series produced for DC Universe, and a more straight-faced treatment of Robin and his outcast superhero team than the popular animated franchise “Teen Titans Go!” After his estrangement from Batman, Dick Grayson/Robin (Brenton Thwaites) steps out of his sidekick role to assemble a unit of young crimefighters, including Raven (Teagan Croft), the daughter of a demon; Starfire (Anna Diop), an amnesiac alien; and Beast Boy (Ryan Potter), a shape-shifter who takes the form of animals.— ‘Carmen Sandiego’Starts streaming: Jan. 18 Children of the early 1990s remember “Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?” as a whimsical game show about geography, with each episode turning on “junior detectives” tracking the location of Carmen Sandiego, its animated master thief, and other related rogues. The new Netflix revival, entirely animated and without the game-show component, features the voice of Gina Rodriguez as Carmen, who’s been conceived as a Robin Hood type who steals from a nefarious organization called VILE and returns the money to its victims. The authorities assigned to track her down fail to appreciate her altruism.— ‘Conversations With a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes’Starts streaming: Jan. 24 True crime series are neck and neck with baking shows as Netflix staples, but there’s reason to believe that “Conversations With a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes” could stand out from the pack. The X factor is the director Joe Berlinger, a documentary veteran whose “Paradise Lost” movies, about three teenagers convicted of triple murder in West Memphis, Ark., drew national attention to the case and helped reverse the verdict on appeal. Berlinger is working on a Ted Bundy biopic, but in the meantime, he’s releasing this four-episode series around Bundy’s death row interviews as a primer.— ‘Black Earth Rising’Starts streaming: Jan. 25 A coproduction of BBC Two and Netflix, the creator Hugo Blick’s eight-episode series premiered to near-universal acclaim in Britain in September, with the bulk of the praise going to Blick’s sharp criticism of neocolonialism in Africa and Michaela Coel’s performance as Kate Ashby, a legal investigator who prosecutes a warlord over the use of child soldiers. John Goodman appears in the pivotal role of an American barrister living in England, but it’s Coel who commands the most attention as a former Rwandan orphan who wrestles with past trauma as she takes over her adoptive mother’s case against an African militia leader. The personal stakes are both help and hindrance: Ashby is strongly motivated to seek justice before the International Criminal Court, but forced to revisit the genocidal past she left behind.— ‘Kingdom’Starts streaming: Jan. 25 The ascendence of South Korea as a source of large-scale genre entertainment, in particular horror films, continues with Kim Seong-hun’s zombie series, which introduces the walking dead into the royal intrigue of the Joseon dynasty. The kingdom in “Kingdom” is already plagued by corruption and starvation when a mysterious virus breaks out among the populace, turning those affected into dead-eyed, flesh-hungry immortal beings — including the king himself. That leaves the crown prince to stop the disease from spreading and get to the conspiratorial roots of the problem.—Also of interest: “Across the Universe” (Jan. 1), “Black Hawk Down” (Jan. 1), “My Best Friend’s Wedding” (Jan. 1), “The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants” (Jan. 1), “And Breathe Normally” (Jan. 4), “Lionheart” (Jan. 4), “Solo: A Star Wars Story” (Jan. 9), “The Last Laugh” (Jan. 11), “Grace and Frankie”: Season 5 (Jan. 18), “Trigger Warning With Killer Mike” (Jan. 18), and “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt”: Season 4, Part 2 (Jan. 25).",The New York Times
2018,"The Best Movies and TV Shows New to Netflix, Amazon and More in December","Watching is The New York Times’s TV and film recommendation website. Sign up for our thrice-weekly newsletter here. The holidays can be a stressful time, even in the best of families. So in this month’s roundup, we’ve looked for the most soothing and crowd-pleasing TV series and movies coming to the major streaming services in December, with special favor bestowed upon anything nostalgic or mouthwatering. Below are the most interesting of what we’ve found, followed by a roundup of all the best new titles in all genres. (Streaming services occasionally change schedules without giving notice.) ‘Dave’Starts streaming: Dec. 1, on HBO. What if you suddenly had a chance to be the president? It happens to an ordinary man named Dave Kovic (a versatile Kevin Kline) — but only because of his uncanny resemblance to Bill Mitchell, the actual U.S. President (also Kline). When Mitchell has a medical emergency, Dave finds himself in the Oval Office. Naturally, high jinks ensue. (It’s particularly satisfying to watch him balance the budget). A fun romp for political junkies on both sides of the aisle. ‘Groundhog Day’Starts streaming: Dec. 1, on Amazon. Despite being set in early February, “Groundhog Day” is an existential holiday movie in the same vein as “A Christmas Carol” or “It’s a Wonderful Life”: A smug protagonist is compelled to rethink his mortal sojourn — how he has spent his days, how he has treated people — and to realize the error of his ways. Here, the case study is condescending TV weatherman Phil Connors (a wonderfully grouchy Bill Murray) who makes an annual trek to cover the big Groundhog Day festival in Punxsutawney, Penn. — only to find himself mysteriously condemned to relive the day over and over again. Is he in purgatory? A makeshift parallel universe? He doesn’t know and can’t escape, so he learns to make the best of it, ultimately connecting with his fellow human beings (including WrestleMania fan Michael Shannon). Like Phil’s day, this movie becomes better with endless repeat viewings. [Here is The New York Times’s list of the best movies on Netflix right now.] ‘The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’ Season 2Starts streaming: Dec. 5, on Amazon. Now that “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” has won eight Emmy Awards, what next? How about Paris and the Catskills? Midge Maisel (Rachel Brosnahan at full sparkle) and her efforts to break into stand-up comedy in the late 1950s are still central, but the show’s world has opened up, along with new opportunities for ensemble players. Some of the best moments are meticulously choreographed set pieces in which cameras and characters glide around each other, with dialogue overlapping. Rarely have scenes of people lugging furniture into a vacation cottage, or answering calls in the switchboard room, been so fascinating to watch. Midge still gets the wittiest rat-a-tat banter, of course, but now she has lots of highly entertaining help. Dizzying and delightful. ‘Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle’Starts streaming: Dec. 7, on Netflix. The director and motion-capture master Andy Serkis’s take on “The Jungle Book” is for those who prefer their anthropomorphized animals to look like they actually live in a jungle — in other words, less cute and cuddly and more scruffy and muddy. Adopted by wolves, Mowgli (Rohan Chand) struggles with his precarious place in the pack; if he can’t keep up, he will be cast out. But might this wild child be able to adapt to the human world? A colonial hunter (Matthew Rhys) takes Mowgli under his wing, and Mowgli is befriended by a village woman (Freida Pinto) during Holi festivities. As Mowgli straddles the two worlds — belonging to both and to neither — the story turns dark. And no one, animal or human, gets off easy. Major plus: the stellar voice work by Benedict Cumberbatch (as the tiger Shere Khan) and Christian Bale (as the panther Bagheera). ‘Nailed It! Holiday!’ Starts streaming: Dec. 7, on Netflix. Some baking shows you watch to marvel at the artistry, but not “Nailed It!” This American series is for the barely-able-to-bake set, people who consider it a win if their pathetic attempt at patisserie resembles anything in the vicinity of say, a cake pop, a doughnut or an elaborate exercise in excess fondant. (Seriously, what is the deal with fondant, “Nailed It!”?) These holiday episodes are a mad chef’s laboratory for dreidel-shaped cake pops, polar animal confections and edible nativity scenes. “This baby Jesus is the most delicious baby I’ve ever eaten,” host Nicole Byer quips at one point. And later: “I can’t wait to eat Santa.” OK, maybe you can. ‘Chilling Adventures of Sabrina: A Midwinter’s Tale’Starts streaming: Dec. 14, on Netflix. You thought witches didn’t celebrate the holidays? What is a Christmas tree if not a holdover from the pagan practice of keeping a Yule tree (and burning a Yule log) to ward off spirits during the darkest time of the year? In this particular winter solstice, Sabrina is more interested in welcoming spirits to the Spellman home, and in this special — which is nearly a stand-alone episode, occurring after the events of Season 1 — Sabrina conducts a séance, Susie moonlights as an elf for a store-based Santa and Madam Satan enjoys a gingerbread house. True, those gingerbread cookies look suspiciously like Sabrina and her two aunts, but … nothing to see here, right? ‘Roma’ Starts streaming: Dec. 14, on Netflix. In the beginning, there are only splashes of water rushing across stone tiles, then receding. Eventually we realize we are watching Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio, in her first role), a live-in domestic worker for a middle-class family in Mexico City, scrub the household driveway. The movie, shot in gorgeous black-and-white, is a moving, semi-autobiographical interpretation of the Oscar-winning director Alfonso Cuarón’s own childhood in the 1970s. Cleo is modeled after his family’s live-in housekeeper, Liboria Rodriguez, and Cuarón imagines the world through her eyes, noting, with intimate deal, the conflicted status of servants who are both quasi-family members and, inevitably, perpetual outsiders. A must-see. ‘Isle of Dogs’Starts streaming: Dec. 22, on HBO. The story of a boy and his dog, basically. But since this is a Wes Anderson film, and it’s made in painstaking stop-motion animation, there’s a bit more to it than that. The boy is Atari (voiced by Koyu Rankin), and he’s on a mission to rescue his loyal canine Spots (Liev Schreiber) from Trash Island, where the dogs of Megasaki have been quarantined by a cat-loving, dog-phobic mayor (Kunichi Nomura, who co-wrote the script). Anderson’s whimsy is relentless as always, but depending on your reading of its usage, the movie is either a sincere tribute to, or plunders, Japanese art, cinema and music. On another level, it’s also a parable about bigotry, propaganda, the rise of authoritarian regimes and the need, everywhere and always, for compassion. ‘Watership Down’Starts streaming: Dec. 25, on Netflix. If the 1978 animated adaptation of Richard Adams’s novel left you with emotional scars as a child, be assured that this limited series is a gentler viewing. Which isn’t to say there’s no danger or pain involved as a group of refugee rabbits set out in search of a new home when one of their own, the nervous Fiver (voiced by Nicholas Hoult), has visions of “something bad” coming. Something bad is always coming for rabbits, of course — they are preyed-upon creatures, after all — but the destruction of their natural world forces them to confront their concept of mortality and to reassess established power structures, as well as the price they are willing to pay for peace. It’s easy to love these little guys and girls (there are more female rabbits this time around) and as we spend more time with Fiver, his brother Hazel (voiced by James McAvoy) and their pal Bigwig (John Boyega), we become invested in their fates. Prepare yourself for the usual “Watership” waterworks. ‘Breakfast at Tiffany’s’ Starts streaming: Dec. 27, on Hulu. Audrey Hepburn’s Holly Golightly is vividly remembered for her sleek dawn-of-the-sixties styles — the little black dress, the big sunglasses, the jaunty cigarette holder. In Blake Edwards’s celebrated movie version of Truman Capote’s novella, she still casts a spell, and not just over the men passing through her breezy New York life — has the city ever seemed more emblematic? — but over us, too. (Just skip over Mickey Rooney’s offensive caricature of a Japanese landlord — Edwards should have.)

2018,Opinion | The Best New Year’s Eve Party Is in Seat 17A,"Get on a plane. It will make the passage of time that much more palatable. Ms. Schaap is a writer. When the clock struck midnight at the Oakland Coliseum on Jan. 1, 1990, I should’ve known that it would all go downhill from there for my future New Year’s Eves. I was at a Grateful Dead concert. I’d scored a “miracle”— that’s Deadhead for a freebie ticket, often bestowed in the 11th hour. The band played “Dark Star” (they almost never played “Dark Star”). I was happy that the ’80s were finally over; any nostalgic notions that it was a kind and gentle decade are deeply misguided. And the main thing is, I was young. Why lament the passage of time rather than celebrate it when you’ve got all the time in the world stretched out ahead of you? What 18-year-old has the foresight to have foresight? My New Year’s Eve memories from the decade that followed are fragmentary and faintly rotten, like milk just starting to sour. There were awkward parties I squirmed out of before I had to stand around a TV pretending that watching people in parkas watching a ball is entertainment. There was the time a swaying stranger on the subway threw up much too close to my feet for comfort. Yet I persisted in the performance of forced merriment demanded of us by this bully of a holiday — until I went to another concert, one that featured a former punk idol whose dissolution and incoherence made for a disheartening, not-fun-at-all spectacle, followed by a long wait for a taxi in frigid weather in hopes of quelling the possibility of anyone barfing near my boots on the subway again. No taxi came, but I sure felt that hypothermia would. I took a vow: I would never go out on New Year’s Eve again. Not long after I made that promise to myself, the man I would later marry moved in with me. He was a great cook, and didn’t like crowds, so small dinner parties at home were exactly his speed for New Year’s Eve, and that suited me fine. It became our tradition to spend most of the week between Christmas and New Year’s Eve making cassoulet, that excellent bean casserole of southwestern France. We submitted duck legs to nice confit baths, cured slabs of pork belly, sometimes even made sausage; we went for it. Finally, on the night itself, we ate it in the company of a few friends with equally robust appetites, whom we shooed out of our small apartment as soon after midnight as politeness permitted, and as gently as we could. Seven years after we married, cancer killed my husband. Of course there could be no more New Year’s Eve cassoulet after that — not because I couldn’t cook it by myself, but because, well, I couldn’t cook it by myself. With its promise of new beginnings, fresh starts, all that, New Year’s Eve is supposed to feel auspicious and meaningful. We bind our desires to a square on the calendar, even though we understand how arbitrary that is, even though we know better. Healthy or sick, wealthy or poor, wedded or widowed — we are expected to get out there and revel, even when the last thing many of us want is to mark that time is passing so obviously and so ruthlessly. And no matter how low key my approach to the holiday had become, there seemed to be no way to subvert it altogether. Then, a couple of years ago, work required me to be in England in early January. As I looked at flights from New York to London, I noticed that if I left two days sooner than I’d intended, the price dropped substantially. That, I assumed, was because flying two days earlier would mean flying on New Year’s Eve. “Who flies on New Year’s Eve?” an automatic impulse made me ask myself, with an implicit “when they should be out celebrating” trailing close behind. But as soon as I shook off the dandruff of cultural conditioning, I knew exactly what sort of person would fly — and alone, no less — on New Year’s Eve: me. That’s who. I embraced the scheme, as though, like some kind of strategic mastermind, I’d planned it that way all along. Flying on New Year’s Eve provided a ready excuse to turn down invitations (or to feel fine if I didn’t get any). I also didn’t mind saving a couple of hundred bucks. Plus, I’d heard a rumor that the airlines serve Champagne, gratis, to their New Year’s Eve guests. Although I can’t presume to understand what dwelled in the hearts and minds of my fellow passengers, they struck me as kindred spirits: No one showed any sign of caring that it was New Year’s Eve. I saw not one sparkly hat. Zero noisemakers. Not a single fleck of confetti. We were quietly united in our not-celebration. I really liked those people. That complimentary Champagne rumor? Not true — at least in my coach-class experience. I went ahead and splurged on a glass, not as a concession to the holiday but just to treat myself: Champagne always tastes better on a regular, no-occasion Thursday than it does on an anniversary, right? It was cold and fizzy and delicious, and it paired perfectly with the small bag of potato chips the flight attendant tossed on my tray (at least that was free). But the flight also gave me something much better than that: In a way, it made New Year’s Eve cease to exist. If it’s past midnight at your destination, but not yet at home, and who even knows what time zone you’re in, anyway — is it really the end of the year at all? And does it matter? And hey, what is time? Up in the air, New Year’s Eve turns into an elegant, existential riddle. And by the time I touched down at Heathrow, 2017 already felt like old news, which was exactly what I wanted. Luckily, I get to do it again this year because of another work trip, and I can’t wait not to celebrate. But as much as I wish I could, I can’t afford to fly away from New Year’s Eve every year. If you can swing it, and if you feel as I do about the holiday, I encourage you to let yourself off the hook this way some day. Just don’t make it a resolution — that’s exactly the kind of pressure you don’t need.

2018,The Best Photo Books of 2018,"A photo book is a stubbornly old-fashioned technology. It allows for some experimentation, with scale, paper and color, but it is ultimately a sequence of photographs printed on paper and bound into a portable volume. In a time of a torrential flow of online photographs and omnipresent video, such material simplicity is almost quaint. But a form invented in the mid-19th century remains one of the most vivid ways of conveying the power of images. I think about my “year-end” list of photo books all through the year, poring over publishers’ catalogs. I’m sent many books and buy many others. I sift through hundreds of volumes. Each book is finally chosen on its own merits. This is not a list of “relevant” or “important” books. I care only for photo books that work, photo books that have somehow merged form and content to create a third thing, full of its own life, vital and resonant. Here are 10 that hit that mark for me in 2018. In “Upstate Girls,” her nine-year record of interlinked families in Troy, N.Y., Brenda Ann Kenneally is not so much a fly on the wall as a bee in a hive. Her intimacy with the young women at the center of the project is total. She’s there for their pregnancies, their breakups, their addictions, their intractable anomie. In depicting at great length and with meticulous attention the harried, messy lives of this set of ordinary Americans, Kenneally shows us tough realities of intergenerational trauma that are typically ignored or mischaracterized. Regan Arts., 432 pages, images throughout. In the spring of 2008, John Gossage took a road trip in coastal England and Wales, visiting a number of out-of-the-way places, including Caerau, a Welsh mining town. The trip was partly a homage: Robert Frank went to Caerau in 1953 and made socially engaged photographs, including a celebrated one of a soot-covered miner named Ben James. The title of Gossage’s book notwithstanding, not only does he not depict Ben James; he does not even seem particularly interested in evoking him or the social crises Frank photographed more than half a century before. Gossage instead wants to insist that there’s always more happening in a photograph than its putative subject, that a photograph is always in the first place a record of an optical experience. He photographs fences, cars, signs, weeds and his travel companion, the photographer Martin Parr. “Looking Up Ben James,” with its black-and-white images gorgeously printed in large format, is an oblique delight from beginning to end. Steidl, 192 pages, 128 images. Gordon Parks (1912–2006) is such a solid and worthy photographer of the American experience that you can miss just how canny, wise and intimate his work is. “The New Tide,” published to accompany a major (and currently ongoing) exhibition at the National Gallery of Art, does him justice. In great detail, we are taken through Parks’s first decade of independent work, and see how he evolved from portraiture and fashion to the social documentary for which he became widely celebrated. It’s a pleasure to see how, even in the early work, Parks’s eye is unerring. A 1942 picture, for instance, is accompanied by the following caption: “Washington, D.C. Young boy standing in the doorway of home on Seaton Road in the northwest section. His leg was cut off by a streetcar while he was playing in the street.” It’s a sad narrative, compressed and poignant, but what echoes in the mind is the photo itself, the way the one-legged boy’s body seems to rhyme with that of a girl sitting on a stoop across the street. The catalog is as accomplished for the photographs it reprints as it is for its many fine essays on Parks, including those by Maurice Berger, Sarah Lewis, Deborah Willis and Philip Brookman, which contextualize Parks with the writers who mattered to him, Langston Hughes and Richard Wright among them. National Gallery of Art/ The Gordon Parks Foundation/ Steidl, 352 pages, 166 images. Inspired by the dazzling new possibilities of photography, the botany enthusiast Anna Atkins (1799-1871) set out to record as many British algae as she could lay her hands on, using Sir John Herschel’s recently discovered cyanotype technique. (Cyanotype, also known as blueprint, is a kind of contact printing made with iron salts.) The resulting publication, “Photographs of British Algae: Cyanotype Impressions,” issued in a limited edition with handwritten text in 1843, is considered to be the first photo book. “Sun Gardens” is a reissue and expanded edition of a 1985 publication on Atkins by Larry J. Schaaf and Hans P. Kraus, now with additional contributions by Joshua Chuang, Emily Walz and Mike Ware. It is a strong work of photography scholarship that sets Atkins’s work in its historical context and presents her delicate photograms with unshowy fidelity in a handsome volume. The New York Public Library/ Prestel, 216 pages, 229 images. Beauty indicts. If beauty exists, then why isn’t everything beautiful? If something is truly beautiful, how could its beauty have been missed? There is something particularly interrogative about the kind of beauty apparent throughout Deana Lawson’s monographic first book. Her portraits are lush, intense and grand. But their grandeur is of an unusual kind: These are portraits of black people, in cluttered domestic interiors or Edenic outdoor settings, clothed or nude, carrying on the business of being alive and fabulous. Lawson’s feeling for how pattern, emotion and implied history intersect is as expert as a master painter’s. Her subjects, mostly strangers she persuaded to pose for her, in locations from the United States to Jamaica to Ethiopia, are here made immortal. The accompanying essay, by Zadie Smith, is a big plus. Aperture, 104 pages, 40 images. Guido Guidi (b. 1941), one of the leading lights of modern Italian photography, has since the 1970s recorded his country’s postindustrial landscape. “Per Strada” (“on the roads”) presents, in three volumes, his 14- year (1980–1994) investigation of public space and infrastructure on and around the Via Emilia, the ancient road that connects Milan to the Adriatic Sea. Guidi’s eye is rigorous and subtle, and “Per Strada” is an education in seeing and composition. It is in conversation not only with the work of such notable contemporaries as Luigi Ghirri, Stephen Shore and John Gossage, but also with the great mathematically minded innovators of early Italian Renaissance painting: Fra Angelico, Paolo Ucello and Piero della Francesca. MACK, 464 pages, 286 images. Places that are frequently photographed become nearly impossible to photograph interestingly. Do we really need another book “about” India? If the book in question is as vivid and genuinely generous as Nick Sethi’s “Khichdi (Kitchari),” then the answer is yes. Over a period of 10 years, Sethi traveled in India, developing along the way a distinct approach to the country’s bewildering diversity. Sure, India is rowdy and colorful, but Sethi’s work couldn’t be further from the banalities those features usually inspire. The book is printed on high-gloss paper, in bright and occasionally lurid colors, and it is a cascade of images of contemporary street life, full of cheap goods, high-tech devices, the faces of humans, murals, religious artifacts, the tools of work and visual evidence of a wide spectrum of gender performance. “Khichdi (Kitchari)” is named for the lentil-based soup eaten in all parts of the country. Sethi’s book, like that soup, is made of many parts and holds together very well. Dashwood Books, 432 pages, 846 images. In photo after photo, Rosalind Fox Solomon (b. 1930) captures a reality that few even observe. How does she do it? Her practice has taken her to many countries, but “Liberty Theater,” her latest book, focuses her roving, unsentimental eye firmly on the United States. The photos, like Diane Arbus’s, are discomfiting. But while Arbus sought out odd people or situations, Fox Solomon’s oddities are elsewhere: in her special ability to register tiny interstitial moments. Her crisp, precise photos — some of them are portraits, others seem to be caught on the fly — pin her subjects in situations of inadvertency, when their faces and bodies are between one attitude and another. This tonal ambiguity sets fire to the putatively binary content before us: black or white, young or old, rich or poor, sick or healthy. She somehow catches everyone in between. Here is the flawed nation, one strange facial expression at a time, without a trace of smugness or parody. MACK, 96 pages, 77 images. “The Land in Between” is the catalog of Ursula Schulz-Dornburg’s retrospective exhibition of the same name presented at the Städel Museum in Frankfurt in the summer of 2018, and it conveys very well what made that exhibition among the best I saw this year. Schulz-Dornburg, born in Berlin 80 years ago, has over the decades created a varied body of work is motivated by a consistent imaginative quest: how to photograph landscapes in political transition. There are all kinds of obvious ways of going about this, but Schulz-Dornburg has largely deployed her efforts in idiosyncratic locales, mostly in the Middle East and in the former Soviet countries. She has photographed in Syria, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Russia. She has photographed borders and deserts. One memorable series was about Armenian bus stops, photographed directly so that they begin to resemble modernist sculpture. Another was on the marsh Arabs in Iraq in the 1980s; the fragile, intricate structures she photographed would soon be permanently lost to political upheavals and war. But like that of all serious artists, her work was more than how it can be described: a keen political intelligence combined with a poet’s feeling for light, stone, form and shimmering horizons. MACK, 254 pages, 177 images. “The Castle,” named for Kafka’s 1926 novel of bureaucratic nightmare, is a series of images about a 21st-century horror: the limbo faced by refugees who have traveled from the Middle East and Central Asia toward Europe. Over several years, the Irish photographer Richard Mosse visited refugee camps in Lebanon, Turkey, Greece, Germany and elsewhere and witnessed firsthand the squalor and despair of the migrants temporarily housed in them. Using a military grade thermal video camera and stitching together hundreds of stills through a meticulous process, Mosse has created a contemporary sublime. The cameras sense infrared radiation, recording localized areas of heat in white, contrasting them with the cooler background. The effect is striking, like observing the world in negative. The technique allows Mosse to photograph the victims of our society’s policies without making them identifiable and potentially exposing them to reprisals. We see tents, shacks, trees, putrid pools, cubicles, hillocks and the telltale bright shapes indicating human bodies; abject life, life as it ought not be. “The Castle” is white hot with the accumulated dismay of this confounding moment, a masterwork that ought to grieve and shame us collectively. MACK, 232 pages, 28 double gatefolds.",The New York Times
2018,The Best Poetry of 2018,"One of the problems with picking the best poetry books in a given year is that poems — unlike, say, chapters in a novel — are often judged apart from the works in which they appear. For example, “Directive” is one of Robert Frost’s two or three greatest poems, but it was first published in his 1947 collection “Steeple Bush,” which is otherwise generously laden with cornpone. So how good is “Steeple Bush,” then? Can a single astonishing ingredient redeem an otherwise unremarkable dish? By the same token, should a collection that is consistently accomplished (but no more than that) be considered more worthy than an uneven book with a few genuinely arresting pages? When we’re evaluating books of poems, a great deal depends on which noun — books or poems — we think should be stressed. Fortunately, good poems, like good people, do tend to congregate. Below are 10 poetry collections published since January that are worthwhile regardless of whether you’re looking for a memorable book, a memorable poem or a memorable book of memorable poems. In keeping with Times policy, this list contains no relatives, close friends, students, colleagues and so forth. I’ve also generally favored books that seem worthy of more attention than they’ve received thus far. HUMAN HOURS, by Catherine Barnett. (Graywolf, paper, $16.) Barnett’s third collection is a fast-paced but unflappable tour of hotels, airports, college drop-offs, gynecologists’ offices and the cafes of Lower Manhattan — as Barnett puts it, “The mind, yes, is always moving.” But the moments of stillness in “Human Hours” are equally compelling. Consider “The Skin of the Face Is That Which Stays Most Naked, Most Destitute” (the line is from the philosopher Emanuel Levinas): “But it’s in perfectly fine shape, the face in the mirror said — / When I first acquired you, yes, ok, years ago / on a lark, and you were just something to wear then, / to the store, or the park, not alone in the dark.” THE POPOL VUH, translated by Michael Bazzett. (Milkweed, paper, $16.) The Popol Vuh is a free-verse translation of a Mayan origin narrative that we know only because it was copied by a Franciscan friar in the early 18th century. (The original manuscript was lost, and was presumably a transcription of stories that were usually told, not read — making the Popol Vuh, as Bazzett puts it in his deft introduction, “the copy of an echo.”) For nonscholars, the first test of any translation is simply whether it’s pleasurable to read, and Bazzett’s limpid, smoothly paced version is more than satisfying on that score. And it’s a good thing to be reminded, perhaps especially now, and perhaps especially by a text originating in Guatemala, that “However many nations / live in the world today, / however many countless people, / they all had but one dawn.” YEARS, MONTHS, AND DAYS, by Amanda Jernigan. (Biblioasis, paper, $14.95.) Jernigan’s book is tiny — it comes in at only 50 postcard-size pages, with many of those pages containing just nine or 10 words. It’s also a highly unusual project: a quasi translation of Mennonite hymns into lyrics that are half prayer, half reflected secular yearning (Jernigan is not herself religious). The book is carried by Jernigan’s obvious respect for her sponsoring material and by her superb ear, as in this calmly devastating slant rhyme: come to thinkhow well a coffincomes at lastto fit a person DARK WOODS, by Richard Sanger. (Biblioasis, paper, $14.95.) The rueful, lucid, deliberately casual poems in “Dark Woods” can surprise you with their tenderness, but also with their prickly intelligence. In “Artichoke,” we’re presented with the familiar “Handsome knob, armadillo, hand-grenade / of army green, armour-plated petals,” but things quickly take a turn: “Here your lot is to keep it in, / to remain tight-lipped and celibate, / nodding your bald pate wisely at the rumour / of pleasures you shall never taste— / the pleasures we have to drag out of you.” WADE IN THE WATER, by Tracy K. Smith. (Graywolf, $24.) Smith’s fourth book is the strongest and most wide-ranging she’s written. Many readers will be drawn to the series of poems here composed from the letters and statements of African-American soldiers in the Civil War and their dependents. This work is admirable, but it would be a mistake to overlook Smith’s growing command of the domestic poem, which presents unique and subtle challenges that are easy to underestimate. Here’s Smith on a 4½-year-old: She’s like an islandMade of rock, with one lone tree on topOf the only mountain. She’s like the soleIncongruous goat tethered to the tree,Smiling almost as you approach, scrapingThe ground with its horns, and then — Lickety split — lurching hard, daringThe rope to snap. A MEMORY OF THE FUTURE, by Elizabeth Spires. (Norton, $26.95.) The spare, sly lines in “A Memory of the Future” are a reminder that the game of a poem is sometimes better advanced by underplaying. In “Pome,” for instance, Spires toys with the word “pome” (“Common as an apple. Or / more rare. A quince or pear”), allowing seemingly throwaway internal rhymes to quietly reinforce the connection the reader automatically makes between “pome” and “poem” (“What to do? What to do? / I could give it to you”). This sets up a conclusion that is a quiet showcase in tone management: O I remember days…Climbing the branches of a treeripe and heavy with pomes.Taking whatever I wanted.There were always enough then.Always enough. LIKE, by A. E. Stallings. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $24.) Stallings is widely admired for her formal agility and classical expertise (she’s translated Lucretius and Hesiod). In “Like,” her fourth book of poems, we get the rhyming wit one expects from Stallings, although in the best poems here that wit is attractively darkened by experience in a place that is, to take Stallings slightly out of context, “Deep in the woods where things escape their names.” Consider the end of “The Stain”: What they suspectThe stain will know,The stain recordsWhat you forget. If you wear it,It will show;If you wash it,It will set. TRANSACTION HISTORIES, by Donna Stonecipher. (University of Iowa, paper, $19.95.) The prospect of a book filled with prose poems is admittedly better than the prospect of a book filled with thumbtacks, but not by much. So it is greatly to Stonecipher’s credit that “Transaction Histories” is a delight: a mordant yet romantic survey of art, love, hunger and plastic owls in which seemingly unrelated observations are meticulously knit together to form a resonant whole. The method here is generally to put a figure or phrase in play — for example, a little girl who “turned out to have just one wish for her tenth birthday: an entire box of fortune cookies to herself” — and then to move immediately away from it, only to return again later in an altered context that forms the poetic equivalent of a chord (several pages later, the girl and her fortune cookies return as a counterpoint to a man who “felt most at home in airports”). BLOOD LABORS, by Daniel Tobin. (Four Way, paper, $15.95.) Tobin has written smartly on Irish poets like Seamus Heaney, and that connection emerges to appealing effect in the robust, formally dexterous writing in “Blood Labors.” Particularly notable here is the multipart poem “Downstream,” which comments on a series of surrealist paintings by Eleanor Spiess-Ferris and becomes a kind of hypnotic, deeply strange creation saga. Here’s the beginning of the section titled “River”: “When I rose from the river I was still / The river, and in my red hair flamed / The encircling wheels, wheels within wheels, / By which the very air around me moved.” HEY, MARFA, by Jeffrey Yang. (Graywolf, paper, $20.) Yang’s third book of poems is an ode to the past and present of, yes, Marfa — the West Texas town with a population of roughly 2,000 and a reputation in the art world that exceeds those of most state capitals. Yang collaborates here with the artist Rackstraw Downes, and the elegant precision of Downes’s paintings and drawings of an electrical substation is nicely matched by Yang’s playfully exacting lines: “Gray day faraway water-tower potentiometer / enclosed by a series of right-angle triangles, guy- / line hypotenuse cables lengthening to anchor / pole.…”",The New York Times
2018,The Best Recipe for Christmas Eve,"What to Cook Good morning. Gabrielle Hamilton has the single-best idea for a Christmas Eve feed I’ve ever considered, and it’s the subject of her latest “Eat” column for The Times: a caviar sandwich (above) on buttered white toast, with scallion crème fraîche and chopped hard-boiled eggs. It’s a “luscious and haute, lowbrow sandwich,” Gabrielle told us. “All at once a little messy and a little decadent and a little modest. As my father would cheerfully say, ‘Diamonds and burlap!’ ” I love diamonds and burlap. You can get the white bread at the supermarket with all the other ingredients save the caviar. For which, if you’re in New York City, you might visit Russ & Daughters on the Lower East Side. They close their doors at 6 p.m. today. (They open tomorrow at 9 a.m. for Christmas.) Make that sandwich wherever you live, if you can. (Dirk’s Fish and Gourmet Shop in Chicago is open until 7. And I think Absolute Caviar in Los Angeles is as well? Google it in your town!) “Be sure to lay on the eggs, the caviar, the chives with as much generous abandon as you can muster,” Gabrielle says. “An ounce of good caviar from a reputable source is going to run some 50 bucks at least. If you can swing it, one more spoonful, one more schmear — then all the better.” You don’t want to do much more than that on a night such as this. And that’s true whether or not tomorrow you’ll hail the birth of the incarnate Deity, as Charles Wesley put it. Christmas Eve is weird whatever your denomination, though I suppose an argument may be made for Noche Buena as pretty fun. If you can’t manage caviar, just order a pizza and listen to Truman Capote’s “A Christmas Memory,” from the original 1959 recording of the yarn. It has much the same effect.

2018,Opinion | The Big Phish,"Turning Points Turning Point: Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm, harvested private information from more than 50 million Facebook profiles without the social network alerting users. We have long ago come to terms with the trade-off that to participate in social media, we must first give up our privacy. We sacrifice vital parts of our personal data so that we may amplify our voice, stroke our ego and connect with a virtual tribe. Turning Points asked the writer Maggie Shen King to explore a data-driven dystopia, and she responded with a piece of flash fiction. Sofie could not understand why the bidding stopped a week ago. Her database of 87 million Facebook records was the weapon of the century. Its cache of personal information made spear phishing child’s play. A pre-emptive bid should have ended her auction before it even began. She checked her countdown clock — 5 minutes 39 seconds. Auctions were, of course, all about the last seconds. She hadn’t a doubt she’d lured all the right players to her party, so why was the bid stuck at half of where it should be? Her stomach would not stop churning. She pinched her wrist and held her breath. These records were hers. She was the one smart enough to grab them before Cambridge Analytica blew up and kicked her to the curb. What she was doing was no different than what her employer had done to Facebook and what Facebook had done to their users. And had those users not valued the serendipitous reconnections with high school boyfriends, the ego strokes from bragging about their expensive vacations and their little child prodigies and a public forum in which to harangue their elected officials, they would not have put their private information out there. Facebook users understood that they had to give away a part of themselves for easy connections and the much-coveted limelight. Sofie tore off a hangnail with her teeth. She had become her father. She’d thumbed her nose at his poker dens and bookie operation, signed her name to a boatload of student loans and declared independence. But after Cambridge Analytica gave her the boot without so much as a kind word or her last paycheck, she finally understood that money bought self-respect. Without self-respect, she was nothing. She returned to her auction site on the dark web. Still no action. Her reserve price had surfaced the four whales. Would she be showing weakness or, worse, desperation sending them a reminder? No, she was in charge, and she would demonstrate that with a final prod, a do-it-or-lose-forever stick-in-the-eye. Above all else, her bidders could not abide losing. Nor could they afford to. She began with Saeed, her Iranian contact. Micro-targeted spear phishing would be much more potent than the SQL injection and DDoS attacks they had used to cripple American banking websites. Her database would provide a rash of entry points for their malware to take down Saudi oil fields. Salâam alaikum. Our auction ends in 4 minutes. Just between us, the Chinese are coming in with a billion at the close. I’d rather you win AND stick it to the American infidels by paying me with their hostage ransom money. Are you going to let their crippling sanctions and the Israeli destruction of your priceless centrifuges go unanswered? She waited for a reply, but heard just the drumming of her own heart. She moved on to Pak, her North Korean connection. Their Reconnaissance General Bureau was at least 5,000 hackers strong and adept at brute force cyberattacks. Their email hack of Sony Pictures for the lampooning of their supreme leader had devastated the company. With Sofie’s database, they could take down more financial institutions and military agencies, keep themselves on the world stage and finance their feeble economy at the same time. 정식여보세요. Billion dollar bid just came in from your neighbor. Show your rivals you are no laughingstock. Long live North Korean strength, unpredictability and wily intelligence! Her laptop pinged. She pumped her fist: Her two messages were just opened. Three minutes and counting. Sofie forged ahead and considered how best to rile Misha. He represented a coalition that included the Russian government, wealthy oligarchs and criminal gangs. Should she emphasize the financial gain possible with the pairing of her database and the massive storehouse of credit card information that their mafia had already amassed? The opportunity to disrupt Western military, electrical and banking infrastructures? The ability to misinform, divide and reshape Western opinions? She went for the highest stake. Приве́т. Auction for the weapon of the century is ending. The Chinese have sent in a kill bid. I’m obligated to take it, but hey, I make the rules. I’d prefer my database be used to change elections and blackmail hypocritical, holier-than-thou American politicians. And smarmy British toadies. And German rats. You have 90 seconds to win this. With less than 2 minutes left, she considered ignoring Lao Da. The Chinese had ticked her off with two insultingly low “fill-or-kill” bids and then threatened to walk away. They returned each time though, unabashed. They had more resources than all of the other bidders combined and were above spear phishing for petty gains. By combining Sofie’s database with the 22 million U.S. Office of Personnel Management files in their possession, they could steal intellectual properties and military secrets at will for their industrial and state-owned operations. The Russians have come to play with a cool billion. Can you do better??? You have 30 seconds to enter your final bid. Watching her clock tick down, Sofie dug the tip of her father’s lucky Montblanc — the one he reserved for his second set of books — into her thigh. She smiled picturing him tossing his apartment for it and cursing her. At 00:30, her message box began to ding. She was right. Auctions happened in the last seconds. Her body went limp with relief. $525 million final bid, $530 million, $505 million and $509 million. The bastards were colluding. Not only did they disregard her billion-dollar threat, their bids were obscenely close. Someone had unlocked the multilayer state-of-the-art security on her site and contacted their rivals. Of course they did. She was dealing with the best hackers in the world. Sofie’s head pounded with rage. She should invalidate the auction and start over. The thought depressed her. It had taken her nearly a year to disguise her identity, set up her site, get the word out, vet all the players and create an airtight verification process. Moreover, portions of her data were time sensitive. By colluding, they would all get her database, so why shouldn’t they each pay her price? They had invalidated the auction. A new game was in play. A corner of her lip crooked upward as Sofie crafted her message. She congratulated each player for winning the auction at their submitted bid and enclosed an OAuth token — good for 1 minute only — that would unlock the encryption keys to her database upon the transfer of funds. One way or another, she would get her billion dollars. OpinionTim Berners-Lee OpinionHito Steyerl Opinion",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Big Question: Have We Left Something Important Behind?,"Turning Points This is an article from Turning Points, a magazine that explores what critical moments from this year might mean for the year ahead. As modern life moves forward, has our society left something important behind? Can it, or should it, be retrieved? We asked the thinkers, artists and opinion leaders below for their thoughts. Daniel Libeskind Society has forgotten an idea that had accompanied humanity from time immemorial: utopia. The notion that there is a new and better world to strive for and dream about has largely disappeared from our all too skeptical, one might even say cynical, society. There are plenty of dystopias to give us nightmares, but a world without a utopia may be a world not worth living in; utopia is to our notion of history as the speed of light is to the cosmos. It forms the horizon of possibilities necessary for orientation to the world. Without an imaginative search for a better society we are bound to flounder in confused expediency. Because the ideologies of the past century have been largely discredited as false utopias, we are bereft of the notion of a better future. Whether the idea of a utopia ever returns will depend on our spirit, our faith in what is to come. Yet who are we to make demands of the spirit, which will wander as it will? Daniel Libeskind is a Polish-American architect, artist, professor and set designer. Julia Alvarez Remember remembering? Remember how we use to learn things by heart? Whole poems we could recite, the phone numbers of all our friends and our relatives besides? Remember how we used to have to remember directions to a place, including interesting detours we could take that had started out as a mistake? We had to remember what we needed, because we couldn’t just call home if we forgot. Remember when we had to remember what people looked like without looking them up, when we couldn’t consign the most important things in life to someone else’s hard drive? Remember how we committed the important things to memory, where they were locked up for life? Everything inside us, without strings attached? Remember, oh, remember, the small, shy animal that would come out of the thicket of thinking when we sat quietly by, without a thing to do in this world, nothing pinging or vibrating or alerting us otherwise? And we would muse and mull over things. Remember musing? Without remembering, how will our past speak to our future? How will we even remember if we have left something important behind, and if so, where to go to find it? Julia Alvarez is the author of poetry collections, novels and books for young readers. Her most recent books are “Where Do They Go?,” “A Wedding in Haiti” and “The Woman I Kept to Myself.” Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy He always peeled his apples slowly, deliberately, pausing to adjust the volume on his transistor radio as we sat around the kitchen table. “This is the six o’clock news …” the presenter would say, and my grandfather would smile. My grandmother, busily cooking behind us, would inevitably sit down and pour herself a drink from a Johnnie Walker whiskey bottle, which, since prohibition was declared in Pakistan years before, held only water. Then the stories would begin, almost invariably with my grandfather describing the sweet mangoes he used to steal from his neighbor’s trees. My grandmother would tell of the resistance movement she had joined before the partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947. Two grandchildren, sitting transfixed, biting into their slices of apple. Those afternoons at the kitchen table, and the stories we listened to, shaped the way we saw the world. We had the luxury of time and the desire to share it with each other. Today, my daughters have gadgets, and their calendars are full of activities. There is no time for sliced apples or stories. There is very little time to be a child.

Ray Kurzweil In the next three decades natural and artificial intelligence will become one; we will live indefinitely, and become a billion times more intelligent. In this era of accelerating technologies, poverty, disease, resource scarcity, illiteracy and violence are declining. In the past 20 years global poverty has decreased by more than 50 percent. In the past 200 years we have doubled our life expectancy. These are but two examples of the remarkable advancements we have made as modern life moves forward, with comparable progress in extending education, providing sanitation and instilling democracy worldwide. At the core of these trends lies the steady and constant doubling of the price-performance ratio and capacity of information technologies — technologies that are a thousand times more powerful than they were years ago and will be a million times more powerful 20 years from now. As medicine, agriculture, energy and manufacturing become forms of information technology, we will see radical transformation in all aspects of our lives, including our health, food, clothing, housing and work. The future is better than you think. So, rather than look back at what society may have left behind, I look forward to the future in which our species breaks the shackles of its genetic legacy and achieves inconceivable heights of intelligence, material progress and longevity. Ray Kurzweil is an American author, computer scientist, inventor and futurist. Danielle Allen We have largely quit intentionally cultivating democratic knowledge — the knowledge, skills and capacities that civic actors need to sustain healthy democracies. According to the Education Commission of the States, in the mid-20th century, American high school graduates took three separate courses in democracy, civics and government, and “civics was woven throughout the K-12 curriculum.” Now civic education typically consists of only a single-semester course in government or civics in the 40 states where such a requirement exists. The results of our disinvestment in civic education appear stark. According to political scientists Roberto Foa and Yascha Mounk, only about 30 percent of millennials consider it “essential” to live in a democracy, while 72 percent of those born before World War II do. We can, and should, reverse this. Last June, my home state, Massachusetts, passed new state educational standards, introducing a yearlong civics course for eighth-graders and increasing the focus on civics elsewhere in the curriculum. We can rebuild civic education state by state. Of course, civic education without improvements in how our political institutions function won’t solve the problem, but without a citizenry who knows how to operate democratic institutions, and why we might want them, we won’t be able to rescue our democracy. Danielle Allen is a classicist and political scientist. She is a professor at Harvard University and the author of “Cuz: The Life and Times of Michael A.” Jacob Soll Sophistication used to be valued, both as a way of looking at the world and a means of living in it. Now, as our affairs become dizzyingly complex and depressingly straightforward, it is getting lost. It’s odd and it’s troubling. We are losing our grasp of the general concept that things are complicated, and that deep knowledge — civic, cultural, political — is a perfect old tool for the challenges of a new world. Just within the Western tradition, Machiavelli, Castiglione, Bacon, Hobbes, Cavendish, Montesquieu, Wollstonecraft and, yes, Ben Franklin, not to mention most of the great novelists and scientists, all called for it. So did the great composers and painters. And then we’ve lost our social sophistication, from elegance and manners to great conversation and the very essential need for high irony. These things were once central to politics too. One didn’t need to be rich to have these qualities. I had a socially sophisticated barber when I was a kid. Greta Garbo and Cary Grant made sophistication a democratic trait; it was all about nuance and seeing the many shades of our world. Jane Austen and Honoré de Balzac knew it, too. Frederick Douglass saw that to make the case for freedom, he would have to master language in all of its nuances. This is a paradox and a challenge in the age of artificial intelligence and Twitter. If we cannot rediscover humane sophistication — a learned and elegant folly — we will lack the fine analytical blade of deep understanding. Jacob Soll is a professor of philosophy, history and accounting at the University of Southern California. Alexia Webster From my very first visit, I fell madly in love with the Mediterranean. Every five years or so, when my family could afford it, we would trek across the hemisphere, leaving behind the dry, icy Johannesburg winter to visit my grandparents in their village on a little island in Greece. The sea was a realm of magic, an otherworldly kingdom where the octopuses danced in slow motion and pink coral and sea urchins lined the rocks like strange little houses in an underwater village. Years have passed since my first visits, and though the hills are still lit up by the light of the Milky Way and the thick hum of cicadas fills the air, my underwater kingdom has been raided, and the Mediterranean lies almost barren. Now in the summer months, tourists like me arrive in big ferries, while yachts fill the bay and slick boats that look like spaceships shine their bright underwater spotlights into the empty sea below. Staring into these waters that my ancestors once explored, I hope, with all the heart of a little girl, that there is a secret, hidden corner where the creatures of my childhood are hiding, waiting it out until we turn off the lights. Alexia Webster is a documentary photographer and visual artist from South Africa. Claire Ptak From the way I formulate recipes to how I created the space that became my bakery cafe in East London, I look to the past while continuously moving forward. I took the idea of the quaint European cake shop and modernized the experience, but my work is a synthesis of what is now and of the work of those who came before me. We are constantly building on the past, polishing it, re-creating it. Recipes are perfect examples of this. Passed down from generation to generation, they are annotated by each baker who uses them. When I designed the wedding cake for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle last spring, we left behind the tradition of a fruit cake, opting instead for lemon and elderflower, flavors that embody the ethos of this moment: seasonality and sustainability. The royal family’s beautifully crafted gilt cake stands had been used countless times over many years, developing a burnished quality that I consider to be more beautiful than something new and perfect. And the many hands that have held them make them intrinsically more beautiful. I’d like to think our society appreciates this nuance. Something old. Something new. Claire Ptak is a baker and pastry chef. She owns Violet Cakes in London and is the author of “The Violet Bakery Cookbook.” Richard McGuire In general I like to think that we gain something for everything we lose. On the New York City subway yesterday I counted 30 people in the car, and all but one were staring at their devices. Some were also plugged into their headphones. I suddenly saw the same scene as though looking back on it from the future; the handheld devices looked old-fashioned and clumsy, as if everyone were carrying an oxygen tank. I’m sure these devices will become surgically implanted some day. It’s just a matter of time. I admit that I’m addicted, like millions of others. I feel naked without my device. I feel desperate when it’s misplaced. I confess: I like having an extension for my brain when I can’t remember a fact. Would I want that device implanted? I don’t think so. What we have gained in access to information, we have lost in terms of our time. Every email, every text, every call expects an instant response. Social media and round-the-clock news delivery demand our constant attention. One way I have found to get some time back is simply by slowing things down through meditation. Taking a few moments for myself. Unplugging from the hive. Richard McGuire is an American artist, musician and author. His new book is “Richard McGuire Art for the Street 1978-82.” Witold Rybczynski Until fairly recently, it was taken for granted that the important buildings in our cities should be built to last a long time. Unlike consumer goods, architecture was for the long haul. That meant durable materials, of course, but it also meant durable ideas; both were required to withstand the test of time. No more. Globalization, branding and the celebrity architect phenomenon have changed all that. Buildings have become more like blockbuster movies; instead of the long haul, they celebrate the immediate, the here and now and up-to-the-minute. It’s all very exciting, for today. But what about tomorrow? Once the novelty wears off, what’s left? Will old buildings be like Hula Hoops and pet rocks; yesterday’s fads? Will they simply be discarded, like old cell phones? Will the only alternatives available to an older building be modernization — “freshening up,” in developer’s parlance — or demolition? If architecture continues down this road, it will sacrifice one of its most precious functions: providing a living connection to the past, to people who were like us, and yet not like us. Witold Rybczynski is a Canadian-American architect, professor and writer. He is the Martin and Margy Meyerson Professor Emeritus of Urbanism at the University of Pennsylvania. Ben Katchor When I attended Brooklyn College in the early 1970s, tuition was free. Since I lived at home, my only expenses were books, lunch money and the bus fare to and from school. I spent my time studying art and literature with the feeling that I was embarking on a lifetime endeavor of the utmost importance. Unlike the local delicatessen, where I ate my lunch every day, the college didn’t hand me a bill after my classes, or after the hours that I spent in the college library. On winter evenings, it felt like the light emanating from the classroom windows was a result of the intellectual activity going on within. As with the street lamps that lit my way back home, that energy was provided by the taxpayer, for the safety of the citizens of Brooklyn. In recent years I’ve had the opportunity to teach at private colleges in the United States and European schools run by the state. The students who aren’t paying customers approach their work with a serenity that’s not possible with the sound of a tuition meter running in the background. In an economy where the very idea of needing a “job” to be deserving of a guaranteed basic income is questioned, it’s obvious that interested citizens should again be invited to study, and teach, in tuition-free universities supported by the state. Ben Katchor is an American cartoonist and illustrator best known for his critically acclaimed comic strip “Julius Knipl, Real Estate Photographer.” Marta Vieira da Silva The words I grew up hearing are still constantly being told to girls around the world: Sports are not for you. When they reach adolescence, the pressure on young women to conform to a certain kind of femininity makes it even harder for them to occupy public spaces, develop their sense of autonomy and play. When a girl is not allowed to practice a sport, she is denied a precious tool to develop skills transferable to several other areas of her life: confidence, leadership, discipline, resilience, team spirit and respect for diversity. I usually say to girls: Believe in yourself, because if you don’t, no one else will. However, it is also true that with the right investments by sports institutions, in both the public and private sectors, the path for girls to achieve their full potential won’t be as difficult as it was for me. We need more women in decision-making positions in sports governing bodies, better policies for women athletes and more opportunities for girls to play sports, wherever they are in the world. We cannot say humanity has truly moved forward until we level the playing field for women and girls, in every area where they have the potential to excel. Marta Vieira da Silva plays for the Orlando Pride and the Brazilian Women’s National Soccer Team. She was named FIFA World Player of the Year six times, and is a United Nations goodwill ambassador for women and girls in sport. Emily Thompson Within a decade of the telephone’s invention, someone whose name is lost to history made the first obscene phone call. The new technology, miraculously enabling conversation unlimited by physical proximity, engendered behavior that was unhampered by social norms, which had always prevented most people from saying such nasty things face to face. A few years later, the first telephone booths appeared. These boxes further dislocated the devices, acoustically and visually, allowing each user to inhabit an imaginary space shared only with the person at the other end of the line. But this space was really nowhere, neither here nor there, and it amplified the antisocial nature of the telephone call. Weird things happen in phone booths; rules don’t apply. Clark Kent transformed himself into Superman. Who knows what Scott Pruitt might have gotten up to? Today, in choosing to be on our phones all the time, everyplace, we have imprisoned ourselves within virtual phone booths that perpetually disconnect us from our surroundings. No longer present in the place where we actually are, we become social zombies, faces lit gruesomely from below by the bluish light of our screens. We behave in ways that fail to acknowledge the people around us. Too many behave obscenely. Let’s reclaim our context and reconnect to our surroundings, in ways that elicit the better angels of our nature. Superman was only able to fight for truth and justice by emerging from his booth and engaging with the city. Be a superhero. Turn off your phone, look up at the people around you, and smile.

2018,The Biggest Fake News in Fashion,"Unbuttoned Untangling the origins of a myth repeated so often that no one thought to question it. Over and over again, in articles and conferences and interviews, authoritative industry members declare it with absolute certainty. It appears as gospel in outlets as varied as Fast Company and The Guardian. It played a prominent part in a feature-length documentary. What is it? The definitive, and damning, pronouncement that the fashion industry is the second most polluting industry in the world. It’s so shocking, so catchy and so easy to believe. There’s only one problem. “It is not factually true,” said Jason Kibbey, the chief executive of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition. At the close of a year when lies and so-called alternative facts have dominated the conversation; when “misinformation” was chosen as the word of the year by Dictionary.com; and when the reduction of difficult issues to the most tweet-able black-and-white assertions has distorted perception, it’s time to put an end to this particular eco-myth once and for all. Only then can we really grapple with the actual problem in all its complicated, multifaceted reality. There is no question that there are major issues around sustainability and clothes. That fashion brands bear enormous responsibility for carbon emissions and chemical runoff and landfill gluts in different parts of the world. That mea culpas are absolutely merited. There is no question that designers and executives need to think systematically about their place in the natural and human supply chain, and how they can do the least harm. And there’s no question that it is simpler and more attention grabbing to call yourself out for being the second greatest polluter in the world than to label the textile dyeing and finishing industry “the No. 1 polluter of clean water (after agriculture),” as a report in the journal Natural Science did in 2012. But wait, that’s more than just fashion; it could include home wares and bedding, among other things. How, then, to parse fashion’s share of that and what it could mean? There is no credible, verifiable source that will accept responsibility for the whole “second biggest” idea. To trace the claim back to its origin is to play a game of telephone, hopping from link to link to quotation and never arriving. Which is perhaps why most of the people who first popularized the claim have finally started, with somewhat less fanfare, to try to take it back. An article on the OneGreenPlanet site, for example, asserts that “the $3 trillion fashion industry is the second most polluting industry, just behind oil,” and then links to a piece on the EcoWatch site, which then quotes Eileen Fisher, the designer who made sustainability part of the platform for her namesake brand and who has been given awards for her work in this space. When queried, Ms. Fisher said she believed she originally got her information from “The True Cost,” a 2015 film by Andrew Morgan, and that she believed it was also discussed by the Glasgow Caledonian Fair Fashion Center. When Cara Smyth, the vice president of Glasgow Caledonian New York College, was asked, she also said she thought the claim derived from the film. But when I asked Mr. Morgan, the director, where he got the fact back in 2015, he referred me to the organizers of the Copenhagen Fashion Summit, a conference on sustainable fashion, started in 2008. (I have been a speaker at the event.) Jonas Eder-Hansen, the public affairs director of the Global Fashion Agenda, a forum on sustainability issues and fashion, which grew out of the Copenhagen Fashion Summit, said he believed the original fact, oft repeated by Eva Kruse, the founder of G.F.A., had come from a report from the Deloitte consulting firm. That report surfaced in Denmark around 2012 but has since disappeared; when contacted, Deloitte was unclear about the identity of the report. “I had my moment of fear that it came from me,” said Linda Greer, a former senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “About a decade ago, I was looking at industries that polluted in China, and fashion came up in regards to water. But it really depends what you are looking at.” That is in part why Ms. Fisher has recently started to recant. “I’ve been trying to stop saying it because my team has been saying internally that we can’t confirm it,” she said. “I think it’s been about six months.” The Copenhagen Fashion Summit founders have also been backpedaling, shifting “to more vague statements like ‘one of the most resource-intensive industries,’” Mr. Eder-Hansen said. In 2017, the G.F.A. published a report called the Pulse of Fashion that read, right at the beginning: “In fact, there is a lack of reliable facts to guide action. It is not enough to respond to unsubstantiated statements such as ‘The global fashion industry is the second most polluting industry in the world.’ Data and agreed-upon links between cause and effect are what spark ideas, create conviction, and sponsor action.” “But we still hear it,” Mr. Eder-Hansen said. And each time they hear it, he said, “we try to say it’s not accurate.” Alden Wicker, a journalist and the founder of the Ecocult blog, and one of the first to try to debunk the claim in a 2017 article on Racked, has been doing the same thing. “I went on an emailing spree a month ago, emailing the first 10 websites that came up when I Googled ‘fashion is the second most polluting industry.’” Ms. Wicker said. “One person responded.” Does it really matter if this exaggeration still stands? After all, as Ms. Greer said, “whether it’s No. 2 or No. 5, the point is not totally bogus.” If extremeness is what propels necessary action, does the end justify the means? Or does this push us further down the slippery slope of alternative facts on which we are currently sliding? “We need some drama, otherwise we’re just going down on the Titanic,” Ms. Fisher said. Then she sighed. “But untruths are not O.K.” The problem being, Mr. Eder-Hansen said, “we lose our credibility if we go around spreading hearsay, which is why having accurate data is so important.” Mr. Kibbey said that the sheer scale of “second largest” also tends to mask the need for more granular data-gathering efforts — efforts that are key to quantifying fashion’s impact in order to come up with ways to ameliorate it. “I wish it would disappear,” he said. The truth is, we should have suspected from the beginning that this was too pat a formulation. The fashion industry is full of intricate, sometimes impossible-to-trace supply chains, and the data is too sparse to come up with a number like that. So why did so many people fall for it, and why haven’t the denials penetrated? In part, for the same reason that so many people fall other untruths: the gorgeous simplicity of the accusation; the way it plays into all the prejudices that exist around an industry often associated with indulgence and the culture of disposability; the way it pushes all the right buttons. “Fashion is a consumer-facing industry,” Ms. Greer said. “Cement and steel have two of the largest industrial carbon footprints, but most people don’t buy steel and cement.” They can’t relate. And unlike many of the distortions floating around in social media, this one didn’t arise from malice aforethought, or result from anyone trying to perpetrate a scam or manipulate reality. It very likely comes from a good place: a desire to wake a global industry to the need to do better. That is partly why, “whenever someone says it at a panel or conference, it’s nearly impossible to challenge them,” Ms. Wicker said. If you do, she added, you are “accused of negativity, or of apologizing for the fashion industry.” Yet what we do know should be bad enough on its own. Consider the following: Nearly three-fifths of all clothing ends up in incinerators or landfills within a year of being produced. More than 8 percent of global greenhouse-gas emissions are produced by the apparel and footwear industries. And, around 20 to 25 percent of globally produced chemical compounds are utilized in the textile-finishing industry. That’s pretty damning, as well as sourced. The first two pieces of data come from reports by McKinsey and Qantis; Ms. Greer passed on the third, via a textbook called the “Handbook of Textile Effluent Remediation,” edited by Mohd Yusuf. Although admittedly, if you’re trying to capture the public imagination, that title could use a little work.",The New York Times
2018,The Books We Read to Help Us Understand Racism,"Race/Related is a weekly newsletter focused on identity and culture, with provocative stories from around The Times. The year has nearly come to an end, which means it’s a good time for reflection and to catch up on some reading. The bevy of black male writers pictured above are celebrated in a new cover story by T Magazine. What’s interesting about the feature is how it uses America’s current obsession with black male authors to raise questions about the visibility of their female peers. To mitigate this tension, the men in the piece were asked to recommend their favorite black American female author. In recent weeks, you have sent me some worthy recommendations as well. Edward Ball’s “Slaves in the Family,” about the author’s slave-owner ancestors, appeared in multiple letters. “He was so forthright in his concrete attempts to make amends for his family’s slave-trading history,” wrote Phoebe Grigg of San Francisco. “A lot of my unformed feelings were identified and smoked out, and I am much the better for it.” Frances Araujo recommended Countee Cullen, a Harlem Renaissance poet, whose work exposed her to race for the first time. “It’s short and brutal. And I, a little white girl, have never forgotten the chill of sadness,” she wrote. She also mentioned “Silver Pennies,” a collection of poems for young boys and girls by Blanche Jennings Thompson. Priya Arora, a colleague, said “Bengali Harlem” by Vivek Bald has been important to her as a South Asian American. “Learning about immigration patterns of minorities has been helpful for me in understanding both my roots and how interconnected our struggles against systemic oppression are,” she wrote. [For more coverage of race, sign up here to have our Race/Related newsletter delivered weekly to your inbox.] And finally, “Makes Me Wanna Holler,” by Nathan McCall, struck one reader, who asked to remain nameless, “like a baseball bat.” The book is a scathing memoir, reviewed by The New York Times in 1994, about the pervasiveness of racism, even in unassuming places. I’d like to add to this list Claudia Rankine’s “Citizen,” a poetic examination of whiteness, “The Warmth of Other Suns,” an epic tale of the Great Migration by former Times correspondent Isabel Wilkerson, and “The Race Beat,” by Gene Roberts and Hank Klibanoff, about how journalists across the United States covered the civil rights movement. As for news this week, Silicon Valley took a lot of heat — again. I talked to Mark S. Luckie, a former Facebook employee who, shortly before he left the company in November, wrote and circulated a memo about why he believes Facebook fails its black employees and black users. Mr. Luckie, 35, told me that he wrote the memo because he didn’t want to be a black employee who experienced the negative environment at Facebook without speaking up about it. And in a new report from The Times, black employees at Tesla opened up about threats, humiliation and a culture of exclusion at the automaker. I’m curious to see what either company does to address this criticism. Here’s hoping it’ll be for the best.

Brexit Threatens to Make It Real.,"Britain’s exit from the European Union threatens to disrupt trade and potentially reinvigorate conflict between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Lawrence McNamee, a dairy farmer outside Letterkenny, near the border with Northern Ireland. The return of a hard border “would be devastating,” he says.CreditCreditPaulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York Times LETTERKENNY, Ireland — The cows stand oblivious in the relentless drizzle, seemingly untroubled by their proximity to the border. But the farmer spreading grain for his heifers feels the demarcation with deep unease. It is a barrier that risks separating him from feed and fertilizer. Lawrence McNamee’s dairy farm sits just inside the Republic of Ireland, on a lush patch of County Donegal. The port for ships bearing feed and fertilizer lies just up the road, yet it is on the other side of the line in Northern Ireland, part of the United Kingdom. For the past 20 years, the border has existed on paper alone. Britain and the Republic of Ireland are both members of the European Union and its common marketplace. So people, goods and livestock can come and go as they please, traversing the mostly invisible line without tariffs or bureaucratic hindrance. But Britain’s looming exit from the European bloc, known widely as Brexit, threatens to make the old border real again — a factor that has long collided with any prospect of a smooth divorce. Mr. McNamee could wind up paying steep tariffs for feed and fertilizers. He could find it difficult to bring in veterinarians from the other side of the border. “It’s in the lap of the Gods at the moment,” he says. So, it happens, is the very outcome of Brexit as a March deadline approaches — and the increasingly imaginable prospect that Britain could crash out of Europe absent a settlement, yielding chaos. So is the political survival of Britain’s prime minister, Theresa May, and the wildly unpopular Brexit deal she forged with Europe. So is her nation’s future relationship with the Continent. All of these questions remain maddeningly uncertain, in large part because no one has managed to solve the vexing issue of the Irish border. Ever since Britain stunned the world in June 2016 with a referendum setting Brexit in motion, the future of the Irish border has hovered over the proceedings as the single most intractable problem and the element most liable to yield disaster. How can Britain leave Europe without enforcing the demarcation? Yet a hard border could reignite the hostilities that long plagued communities on both sides. It could impede vibrant trade across the border, which has fostered peace. For the last three decades of the 20th century, the border was militarized. Northern Ireland was besieged with conflict between predominantly Catholic communities that favored joining the Republic and largely Protestant loyalists of the British crown. People along the border were accustomed to violence and fear. The Troubles, as this period was known, officially ended with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. Among the provisions of the truce was a shared understanding that people and goods must be allowed to move freely across the border. Trade would become a source of cross-border cooperation that would lift fortunes. Last year, Northern Ireland and the Republic traded goods worth more than 3.2 billion euros (about $3.6 billion), according to official figures. The Republic sends meat, pharmaceuticals and whiskey north. Northern Ireland sends large volumes of dairy products, live animals and animal feed. From where Mr. McNamee sits — at the kitchen table in the farmhouse where he was born and raised — the return of a hard border would put all of this progress at risk. “It would be devastating,” he says. At 47, he thinks back to the fear of his youth: the bombings, people disappearing, British soldiers demanding identification at checkpoints, the paramilitary groups sowing terror. A border could produce fresh sources of grievance, damage trade and create checkpoints that would beckon as targets for attack. “It would be a real backward step,” Mr. McNamee says. “Back to the Dark Ages.” Leaders on both sides of the divide have vowed to avoid such an outcome. The border is but a line on the map, one that twists and meanders for more than 300 miles, like an indecisive river. The Republic has promised to maintain it that way, drawing the vociferous support of Europe. The agreement Mrs. May struck with Europe has been engineered to avoid disrupting trade or reigniting tensions. It would eliminate the need for a hard border by guaranteeing that Northern Ireland would remain in an existing customs union with Europe until a formal trade deal is negotiated. But hard-core proponents of Brexit in Mrs. May’s own governing Conservative Party have assailed that arrangement as a form of vassalage, arguing that it could keep Britain stuck in the European orbit indefinitely. Earlier this month, as Mrs. May absorbed the reality that her deal was doomed in Parliament, she abruptly scrapped a vote. Members of her party then sought to topple her with a no-confidence vote. She survived, securing protection against further challenge for another year. But the Brexit conundrum remained, with especially broad divergence over the Irish border. Mrs. May’s deal seems unlikely to ever win passage, and Europe has ruled out sweetening the terms. And the calendar advances toward March 29, the day that Britain is supposed to leave. In the event of a no-deal Brexit, trade would be governed by the rules of the World Trade Organization. That would mean tariffs reaching as high as 64 percent on dairy and other agricultural products, discouraging business. In that event, economic growth in the Republic of Ireland could be cut in half, according to a recent report from the Economic and Social Research Institute, a think tank in Dublin. The Bank of England recently warned that a no-deal Brexit could plunge Britain into the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. For all of Ireland, a chaotic Brexit would almost certainly create other barriers to trade, like sanitary inspections and health regulations. In short, it could require checks and procedures that would look and feel like a border. Kieran Kennedy grimaces at such talk. Forty years ago, when he was 16, he started working at O’neills, a sporting goods manufacturer in the Northern Ireland border town of Strabane. He drew the least appealing assignment: driving a van loaded with finished wares from the factory to a distribution hub in Letterkenny, on the other side of the border. The journey was only 12 miles, yet it typically took three hours. First, he had to submit to an inspection and fill out forms at a British customs clearing station. Then he had to drive another 100 yards to a British Army checkpoint. There, he recalls, soldiers frequently harassed him, viewing him — a young Catholic — as a potential militant. Half a mile down the road, he reached customs for the Republic of Ireland, and then carried on to the warehouse. Today, Mr. Kennedy has risen to become the managing director of O’neills, and the same drive is completed in 20 minutes. The soldiers are gone. Violence and fear have mostly dissipated. Yet the authorities in London have conjured a way to put this progress at risk. “If there’s a border,” he says, “it would be an absolute disaster for us.” Roughly half of the 700 workers at the O’neills plant in Strabane live on the other side of the border. If checkpoints emerge, it could interfere with their commutes. The company ships yarn from Asia to the port in Dublin, then trucks it across the border to be spun into fabric in Strabane. The fabric gets trucked back over the border to be dyed at a plant in Dublin. Some of the material comes back to Strabane, where workers cut and sew it into uniforms for rugby, Gaelic football and cricket teams. Making some products involves eight separate border crossings, Mr. Kennedy says. On a recent trip to Brussels, European Union officials assured him that the border would not return. Many analysts assume Europe and Britain will find a finesse that avoids a border, even if they fail to complete a Brexit deal. “A hard border is unlikely, even in the event of a no-deal Brexit,” says Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, a risk consultancy based in London. “Flexibility is likely to present itself.” But Mrs. May is intent on limiting immigration, something Britain can do only by leaving the European marketplace, which requires free movement of people. Europe is adamant that Britain not be allowed to leave the bloc and keep the benefits of membership: It should not be able to sell its wares unhampered into the Republic while breaching European rules. “There will need to be checks,” Mr. Rahman said. “The question is how onerous, and where those checks take place.” For people in Ireland, history offers little comfort, teaching time and again that policies hatched in England tend to play out here with ill effect. Many see Brexit as the latest in a long string of indignities, a reckless bit of political histrionics that again puts Ireland in the cross hairs. “Those politicians in London, they don’t give one dirt about Ireland,” says Willie McKeever, a retired woodcutter who lives in a pro-Republican neighborhood in the Northern Ireland city of Londonderry, where a 1968 police crackdown on protesters marked the beginning of The Troubles. “It could start up again.”",The New York Times
2018,The Brain Fog of Menopause,"Personal Health ‘Menopause-related cognitive impairment happens to women in their 40s and 50s, women in the prime of life who suddenly have the rug pulled out from under them,’ an expert says. Dr. Gayatri Devi’s patient, a 55-year-old former headmistress, had good reason to be distraught. The woman had a yearlong history of progressive memory loss and behavioral problems and was referred to Dr. Devi, a neurologist, with a possible diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia. As Dr. Devi recounted in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology, the woman’s once prodigious memory had seriously deteriorated and she’d become increasingly irritable. She had difficulty organizing tasks, keeping track of belongings, setting goals, making plans and seeing them through. Yet the results of medical and neurological tests and brain scans were normal. Noting that the woman had gone through menopause a year earlier, Dr. Devi traced her symptoms to the decline in estrogen stimulation of the brain that occurs in all women at menopause with varying effects. Some are more sensitive to falling estrogen levels than others. With a likely diagnosis of menopause-related cognitive impairment, the doctor prescribed hormone-replacement therapy. Within 15 months, the woman’s behavioral symptoms had disappeared and her learning ability and memory were back to normal. She was able to complete a demanding graduate program and assume a new leadership position in education. This woman’s case was admittedly extreme, but Dr. Devi told me that “60 percent of women go through menopause-related cognitive impairment” that, when serious enough to be brought to medical attention, is too often misdiagnosed as “mild cognitive impairment,” a precursor to dementia. Menopause-related cognitive symptoms are very similar to “chemo brain,” a common complaint among women treated for breast cancer and in some men treated for prostate cancer. Treatment of both diseases often results in an abrupt drop in estrogen levels. People with so-called brain fog following cancer treatment “have trouble with short-term memory, multitasking, coming up with words and putting cogent thoughts together,” said Dr. Devi, an attending neurologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York and clinical professor of neurology at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn. “Menopause-related cognitive impairment happens to women in their 40s and 50s, women in the prime of life who suddenly have the rug pulled out from under them,” she said. Yet, she believes, the correct diagnosis is missed more often than not. “Women with menopause-related cognitive impairment are afraid they’re developing some form of dementia, but if they go to a memory disorder specialist, they may not get the right diagnosis,” Dr. Devi said in an interview. Internists may check for thyroid disease, a vitamin deficiency or infection, but rarely connect the woman’s menstrual history to her cognitive symptoms, she said. Dr. Devi chose to publish her report in the obstetric journal because many women in midlife use their gynecologist as their primary care physician “and I want them to know this condition exists and often responds to short-term treatment with estrogen to tide the brain over.” In an accompanying editorial, Pauline M. Maki, a professor of psychiatry and psychology at the University of Illinois at Chicago, noted that “not only do women more frequently report cognitive difficulties as they transition from premenopause to perimenopause to postmenopause, but they also perform more poorly on standardized neuropsychological tests, particularly tests of verbal memory, aspects of executive function, and processing speed.” Women often describe these deficits as “brain fog,” and they and their doctors may blame the sleep deprivation associated with hot flashes and night sweats, which are definitely “taxing to the brain,” Dr. Maki said. But while these common menopausal symptoms can add to the severity of memory problems, they are not the primary cause of cognitive issues in these women, she said. A six-year study of 1,903 women who were at midlife found that menopause-related symptoms like depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance and hot flashes did not account for declines in memory, learning and how fast the brain processes information during the menopause transition. “The most helpful thing we can do is to normalize these experiences for women who are transitioning through the menopause and let them know that women’s brains are sensitive to fluctuating levels of estrogen, both in terms of cognitive ability and mood,” Dr. Maki said. In fact, symptoms similar to those in menopausal women affect many women premenstrually, when there is a short-lived drop in circulating estrogen. But unlike a normal menstrual cycle, the transition through menopause is gradual and typically takes months and sometimes years, making it harder to recognize its link to cognitive problems. Estrogen levels usually start to decline around age 45, but a woman may not become postmenopausal until age 50 or later, when menstrual bleeding stops for at least a year and very little estrogen is released by her ovaries. The other critically important fact that all women transitioning through menopause should know is that the brain and mood effects are temporary, said Dr. Gail A. Greendale, a specialist in geriatrics and women’s health at the David Geffen School of Medicine and the University of California, Los Angeles. The postmenopausal brain, it seems, adjusts to having little or no estrogen on board. In a study Dr. Greendale directed that followed 2,362 women for four years, declines in memory and learning ability that characterized their transition through menopause rebounded postmenopausally, “suggesting that menopause transition-related cognitive difficulties may be time-limited,” she and colleagues concluded. “The brain fog when women’s brains seem not to be hitting on all eight cylinders is temporary,” Dr. Greendale said in an interview. “During the menopause transition, a woman’s brain may feel a little off, a little muddy, but when the transition passes, the clouds clear and the fog lifts. Sometimes all a woman needs to know is that this too shall pass.” However, for women unwilling or unable to ride out the transition, Dr. Maki said treatment options, in addition to hormone replacement, include following a Mediterranean diet, brisk walking and minimizing alcohol consumption. Those who can safely take estrogen should know that participants in the Women’s Health Initiative, a large government study of postmenopausal women, who were randomized to take hormone replacements starting in their 50s had a lower mortality rate and were less likely to die of Alzheimer’s disease during an 18-year follow-up. In 2015, the North American Menopause Society reviewed nonhormonal treatments for hot flashes, several of which may also relieve cognitive symptoms. One is a low dose of the antidepressant paroxetine (Paxil). Another is gabapentin, an anticonvulsant and pain reliever that hooks onto estrogen receptors in the brain. The critical message, Dr. Maki said, is that menopause-related cognitive issues “need not compromise a woman’s quality of life,” though women may have to be proactive for the condition to be properly diagnosed and treated.",The New York Times
2018,The Bullet Lodged in His Knee. Then the Injuries Really Began. ,"trilobites In an unusual medical case, a bullet left in the knee of a patient for 14 years led to joint damage and lead poisoning. The 46-year-old man showed up at hospital emergency room in Chicago, complaining that his left knee hurt. The X-rays above showed why. Fourteen years earlier, he’d been shot in the knee. That’s the image on the left. The bullet was not removed, and over the years his knee had ground it into tiny pieces, as shown on the right. The fragments got into the tissue that lines the knee, irritating the joint. The bullet also gave him a delayed form of lead poisoning. Dr. Michael Schindlbeck, an emergency medicine specialist at the hospital, had never seen such an injury. The New England Journal of Medicine published the X-rays and a brief case description on Wednesday. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] The patient — a chronic alcoholic who performed poorly on a cognitive test — was given intravenous treatments to absorb the lead in his body. Doctors operated to remove the lining of his knee containing the bullet fragments. But the man eventually disappeared. The last time the doctors saw him was in August. Why was the bullet left in the first place? Leaving bullets in place “is actually more the norm than the exception” for trauma surgeons, Dr. Schindlbeck said. The real problem with bullets is the holes they leave behind. Trying to remove a bullet can make the wound still worse. “Aggressively seeking and removing bullets in the operating room is more appropriate for Hollywood drama than practical medicine,” Dr. Schindlbeck said. One exception to that rule is a bullet lodged in a large joint like the knee. Then removal is mostly routine. Or ought to be.",The New York Times

2018,The Canadian Stories That Moved Us in 2018,"Canada Letter Before the Canada Letter takes a year-end break, the three of us who cover Canada for The Times wanted to look back on the stories that most affected us this year. The newsletter will be back on Jan. 5. Until then, best wishes for the holidays. ______ I spent a lot of time driving around Saskatchewan this year, including a trip that retraced the route of the ill-fated bus carrying the Humboldt Broncos. Even in winter or late spring, the vastness of the prairies offers an exotic sort of beauty. Part of that is an overwhelming sense of isolation. Farming is large scale in Saskatchewan. Traffic is scarce. [Want the Canada Letter in your inbox every week? Sign up here.] Countering that isolation, however, is the powerful sense of community the world saw in Humboldt following the crash. We all learned that the Broncos are one of the ties that bind the town. The arena’s capacity of 1,854 people means that there’s a seat for every 2.6 of the town’s residents. But Humboldt isn’t just hockey. Its churches and community halls are just as vibrant and were, even at a time of immense tragedy, as warm and welcoming to those in grief, and to strangers like me. Many players among the 16 killed in the bus crash came from throughout Canada, mostly the West. In the towns the Broncos’ bus passed through, there were few doors without a hockey stick beside them as a memorial. Every restaurant and shop I visited solicited donations. At the crash site, drivers stopped to say silent prayers, leave something on the impromptu memorial or simply try to understand what went wrong. We still don’t know exactly what happened, although the upcoming trial of a truck driver may shed some light. Eight months later, one Bronco remains in hospital. But in September, the team again moved to billets in Humboldt, and took to the ice for the first time since the tragic events of the spring. —Ian Austen ______ There are several moments that stand out for me in 2018: Olympian Ross Rebagliati rolling his fourth joint a few hours into my smoke-filled interview with him. Filmmaker Xavier Dolan talking to me for nearly eight hours straight about his life and childhood and inviting me to his house to watch a cut of his new film. Rushing to Toronto in April to cover a van attack that killed 10 people and, chillingly, appeared to be motivated by hostility toward women. But the story that perhaps stands out the most was covering the sentencing hearing of Alexandre Bissonnette, the 28-year-old political science student who killed six people at a mosque in Quebec City in a January 2017 rampage. I had barely arrived back in Canada after 28 years abroad when I was sent to Quebec City to cover the hearing. Sitting in a hulking court house, and seeing Mr. Bissonnette, a waiflike figure, handcuffed behind a glass enclosure in a crowded courtroom, was hard to get out of my mind. As was seeing his father, a lawyer, looking heartbroken and averting my gaze in the hallway during a break. These things aren’t supposed to happen in liberal Canada. Or so I had thought. It emerged during the hearing that Mr. Bissonnette decided to act after learning of a well-publicized tweet by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, inviting refugees to Canada. He had also developed an obsession with Donald Trump, the far right, mass killers and Muslims. The story was a stark reminder to me that even Canada has a dark underbelly — that the forces of populism can percolate here, sometimes with lethal consequences. —Dan Bilefsky ______ I will never forget the afternoon and evening I spent with Jihan earlier this year. She is a Yazidi woman from Kocho, a town in northern Iraq that ISIS militants attacked in August 2014. She was separated from her family and fiancé and sold — so many times, she can’t remember — as a sex slave. While being held in an underground prison, she tattooed the names of her loved ones across her chest, arms and hands, using a sewing needle, soot and the breast milk of a fellow captive. They are the first things you notice about her — both forlorn love letters and fiery acts of resistance. Jihan is among the few victims of ISIS taken in by Canada. She arrived in June 2017 with her sister Munifa, and was settled by the Calgary Catholic Immigration Society into a residence along a street in southwest Calgary. Together with her Yazidi neighbors, she invited me to dinner. We ate rice, chicken and fresh tomatoes sitting on a colorful cloth laid out on the floor. That meal seemed such a profound act of kindness and generosity, given the brutality they’d endured. The next afternoon, Jihan posed for photos in an empty classroom. As we were leaving, I heard a thud behind me. She had dropped to the floor. At first, I thought she was having a seizure. But as it soon became clear, she was reliving an attack. Psychiatrists diagnosed her with conversion disorder, a rare diagnosis that is relatively common among Yazidi survivors of ISIS. I was shaken to see Jihan in that state. I also marveled at her resilience — how she came to school each day to learn English and try to start a new life in this strange country, rather than give in to sorrow and hatred. You might pass Jihan on a downtown street in Calgary, and not guess what she’s lived through. She is a warrior. —Catherine Porter ______ This week’s Trans Canada and Around the Times highlights were compiled by Lindsey Wiebe, the Canada audience growth editor. —Canadian shoppers are an important source of business for American towns along the northern border.

2018,The Canadians Detained in China: An Ex-Diplomat and a Daring ‘Fixer’,"MONTREAL — One was a self-fashioned fixer in North Korea who had met that country’s enigmatic leader, Kim Jong-un, and drank Long Island iced teas with him on his private yacht. The other was an experienced diplomat and Sinophile who had spent years investigating sensitive subjects like the human rights of minority groups in China. Both the entrepreneur, Michael Spavor, and the former diplomat, Michael Kovrig, have been detained in China, after spending decades living and working in authoritarian states. Now, they have found themselves in the center of a perilous geopolitical battle, Canadian pawns in a larger contest between two of the world’s biggest superpowers, China and the United States. On Friday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said their detainment was unacceptable, and warned that Canada was getting ensnared in a dust-up between the United States and China. The two countries are in the midst of a trade war, and the tensions have been increased by the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, a top executive of the Chinese technology company Huawei, in Vancouver on Dec. 1, on suspicions of violating American sanctions against Iran. She is awaiting an extradition hearing. “This is one of the situations you get in when the two largest economies in the world, China and the United States, start picking a fight with each other,” Mr. Trudeau told the news channel Citytv in Toronto. “The escalating trade war between them is going to have all sorts of unintended consequences on Canada, and potentially on the entire global economy. So we’re very worried about that.” Senior Canadian officials said Canada’s ambassador to China, John McCallum, had been granted access to Mr. Kovrig on Friday. They said the aim of the “consular visit” was to assess the well-being of a Canadian citizen, clarify the nature of the detention and provide a communication link with his family. They declined to comment on Mr. Kovrig’s condition or whereabouts. Canada’s foreign ministry said it was pressing Chinese authorities for access to Mr. Spavor. On Friday, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland and Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan held talks in Washington with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary James Mattis, including a discussion on securing the release of the two Canadians. Michael Kovrig, a native of Toronto who was living in Hong Kong at the time of his detainment, was working as a senior adviser for the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based research organization. A former Canadian diplomat, he had taken a leave from the ministry two years ago, and no longer enjoyed diplomatic immunity. Friends called him an affable “nerd,” and said he loved swing and ballroom dancing. A former journalist, he spoke Mandarin and Hungarian, noting on his LinkedIn page that he had “worked in 20 countries and traveled through more than 50.” But his line of work also made him vulnerable, experts on China said. Guy Saint-Jacques, a former Canadian ambassador to China who was Mr. Kovrig’s boss when he was first secretary at the embassy in Beijing, said Mr. Kovrig’s job had involved gathering information on sensitive subjects, like Taiwan and minority groups, subjects that would have attracted the scrutiny of the Chinese authorities. “The Chinese would’ve been waiting for the right moment to spring,” he said. “The Meng case provided them the perfect opportunity.” He said Mr. Kovrig was likely being subjected to psychological pressure, detained in a room with the lights left on 24 hours a day. He said China’s accusation that the crisis group was operating illegally in China could be a precursor to filing espionage charges. Joanna Chiu, deputy bureau chief in Vancouver for The Toronto Star and a friend of Mr. Kovrig, said that, as a foreigner and former high-level diplomat, he would have been aware that he was being monitored, but that he was not the paranoid type. “Working in China you just assume everything can be accessed by the Chinese government,” she said, noting that Mr. Kovrig was about six feet tall, and stood out in China. Richard Atwood, chief of policy at the crisis group, said Mr. Kovrig was working on a report on China’s relations with North Korea at the time of his detainment. He stressed that Mr. Kovrig had nothing whatsoever to do with the Huawei case. He said Mr. Kovrig frequently traveled to Beijing and was a regular guest on Chinese media. “We are very worried for his well-being and his security,” he said. Michael Spavor, the other detained Canadian, is a daring adventurer known for his high-level contacts in North Korea. A self-described consultant, he was based in the Chinese city of Dandong, bordering North Korea, and ran a cultural organization that promotes trips there. He had also lived in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, teaching at a school run by a Canadian nongovernmental organization. In 2013, Mr. Spavor helped facilitate a high-profile visit to North Korea by Dennis Rodman, the former N.B.A. star. He told the Reuters news agency last year that arranging the trip had been “the most amazing experience I’ve had in my life.” His link with the country’s leader, Mr. Kim, was such a point of pride that he used a photograph of the two laughing and shaking hands as a profile picture on social media. Based in China, Canada and Britain, Mr. Spavor’s company, Paektu Cultural Exchange facilitates sport, culture, tourism and business exchanges with North Korea and touts its ability to connect foreign investors with high-level contacts there. Yet in his Reuters interview he characterized his involvement in the country as outside the parameters of politics. “For me, encouraging these sports engagement events, these nonpolitical friendship interactions, promoting these kind of events can show people that Americans and Koreans can get along very well,” he said. On its Facebook page, Paektu has invited people to a New Years celebration trip in Pyongyang. It also offered tours there in which travelers can ride a trolley bus.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Case Against Meritocracy,"An aristocracy that can’t admit it. Opinion Columnist This week I briefly trended on Twitter — a bracing experience for any columnist, because it means that you’ve done your job of provocation a little bit too well. In my particular case the provocation was a column about the phenomenon of George H.W. Bush nostalgia, which I suggested reflected a general nostalgia for some of the aristocratic virtues of the old WASP establishment, and a disappointment with the meritocracy that has risen in its place. This argument was read by certain readers (and a few social media non-readers) as a paean to white privilege, even a brief for white supremacy. In these misreadings, there was an assumption that to praise, in any way, the elite that predated the modern meritocracy is to reject racial diversity, minority and female advancement, in favor of permanent white rule. That’s not my view. Rather I think ideals of diversity and meritocracy are two different ways of shaping an elite, which can advance together but which are just as often separable, or even in tension with each other. And I would separate them. I think it was a good and necessary thing that the American upper class diversified, and that more African-Americans and Jews and Catholics (like myself) and women now share privileges and powers once reserved for Protestant white men. [This week on “The Argument” podcast, listen to Ross debate his nostalgia for WASPs with editorial board member Mara Gay.] But I think that same upper class was unwise to abandon an aristocratic self-conception in favor of a meritocratic one. On the evidence we have, the meritocratic ideal ends up being just as undemocratic as the old emphasis on inheritance and tradition, and it forges an elite that has an aristocracy’s vices (privilege, insularity, arrogance) without the sense of duty, self-restraint and noblesse oblige that WASPs at their best displayed. Here it’s important to stress that a WASP was not just any white Protestant or upper-crust American of the pre-1960s past. The term properly refers to a specific kind of American elite, mostly from the Northeast, mostly high-church Protestants, concentrated in a few cities (Boston, Philadelphia, New York, plus some Midwestern and Californian outposts), generally associated with the Republican Party (with occasional defectors like F.D.R.), who dominated a particular set of fields (academia, finance, foreign policy) and shared the code of service and piety and manners that defined the elder Bush’s career. The WASPs were distinct from other white elites — including the planter class that ruled the South, the regional elites that emerged as the frontier moved westward, the immigrant tycoons who challenged WASP power in the East. Their importance rested, to borrow from a WASP acquaintance’s email this week, on being “primus inter pares” — first among equals, with a particular kind of power in a particular set of institutions, and an ability to set a tone for the American upper class that was adopted by other groups when they ascended. And ascend they often did, because the older American system was both hierarchical and permeable, with room for actual merit even without a meritocratic organizing theory. Those advancing groups included non-Anglo-Saxons, and eventually non-Protestants and non-whites. In the middle of the 20th century, you could find elite Catholics who imitated WASPishness — think of William F. Buckley Jr. or the Kennedys. You could even find WASPish African-Americans: The oldest summer colony for black Americans, and not coincidentally a place where the somewhat WASPy Barack Obama liked to hang out in the summer, sits on the shores of the WASP isle of Martha’s Vineyard. These imitations existed in the shadow of racial apartheid and residual anti-Catholicism. But their example suggested that an aristocratic spirit was transferable to a more diverse elite, that there could be Catholic and African-American and Jewish aristocrats — like, say, the family that has long stewarded this newspaper — who could adopt the WASP establishment’s upper-class virtues without the ethnic and religious chauvinism. But then the WASPs themselves decided to dissolve their own aristocracy, and transform their once-Protestant universities into a secular mass-opportunity system — a more democratic way of education, in which anyone with enough talent could climb the ladder, and personal achievement and technical expertise would be prized above all else. This was meritocracy, the system that we now take for granted. And for several reasons it didn’t work as planned. First, meritocracy segregates talent rather than dispersing it. By plucking the highest achievers from all over the country and encouraging them to cluster together in the same few cities, it robs localities of their potential leaders — so that instead of an Eastern establishment negotiating with overlapping groups of regional elites (or with working-class or ethnic leaders), you have a mass upper class segregated from demoralized peripheries. Second, the meritocratic elite inevitably tends back toward aristocracy, because any definition of “merit” you choose will be easier for the children of these self-segregated meritocrats to achieve. But even as it restratifies society, the meritocratic order also insists that everything its high-achievers have is justly earned. “He was born on third base and thought he hit a triple,” Ann Richards famously quipped of George H.W. Bush; well, the typical meritocrat is born on third base, hustles home, and gets praised as if he just hit a grand slam. This spirit discourages inherited responsibility and cultural stewardship; it brushes away the disciplines of duty; it makes the past seem irrelevant, because everyone is supposed to come from the same nowhere and rule based on technique alone. As a consequence, meritocrats are often educated to be bad leaders, and bad people, in a very specific way — a way of arrogant intelligence unmoored from historical experience, ambition untempered by self-sacrifice. The way of the “best and the brightest” at the dawn of the technocratic era and the “smartest guys in the room” decades later, the way of the arsonists of late-2000s Wall Street and the “move fast and break things” culture of Silicon Valley. Or even to some extent the way of Donald Trump, who is white and technically a Protestant but not, not any kind of WASP, combining instead the worst of meritocratic self-deception (the rich kid with a Wharton degree posturing as a self-made man) and the worst of the populist reaction that it summons up. Diversity, despite what many liberals want to think, does not provide a solution to this problem. A diverse elite may be good in its own right, as a matter of justice and representation. But nothing about being a woman or a minority makes you immune to meritocracy’s ruthless solipsism. Just ask Elizabeth Holmes or the slipping-from-grace Sheryl Sandberg, exceptions to the Silicon Valley boys’ club whose trajectories prove the meritocratic rule. Which is why it’s worth looking backward and forward at the same time as we contemplate what’s wrong with our elite. I don’t want to bring back the WASPs; if I had the magic wand to conjure a different elite, it would be a multiracial, multilingual Catholic aristocracy ruling from Quebec to Chile. (Hey, you asked.) But I do want to raise the possibility that an aristocracy that knows itself to be one might be more clearsighted and effective than an aristocracy that doesn’t, and that the WASPs had at least one clear advantage over their presently-floundering successors: They knew who and what they were.

2018,The Case for Creative Play in a Digital Age,"The Checkup A new statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics advises parents of young children to go for high-quality traditional toys rather than elaborate digital ones. All the excesses of my own childhood are, of course, available on eBay, priced for the vintage market. There are the accessories for the 1960s Thingmaker, from Mattel, with its metal molds to be poured full of plastigoop (I can smell it now) and cooked to a nice soft solid texture on the square little electrical stove, then lifted out of the mold with a pin and assembled into Creepy Crawlers or Creeple People. I saw a vintage 1965 Thingmaker available for a mere $25, but full sets run to a couple of hundred dollars. I don’t know if you’ll actually be able to find Chop Suey, a 1967 board game in which a bowl is filled with small plastic food items, and you have to pick them out with (wait for it) chopsticks as the bowl spins. Culturally insensitive, perhaps, but very good for learning how to handle chopsticks; in the interests of defeating my brother in the contest for slippery little pieces of plastic, I developed reliable skills that have served me well. Let’s not even talk about Barbie and her dream house. Most evocative of all for me, there on eBay are the 1960s vintage Easy-Bake Ovens, and as I look at the photo, a jingle starts to play insistently in my brain: “Be a Betty Crocker baker, make a Betty Crocker cake, in your Betty Crocker Easy-Bake oven!” The American Academy of Pediatrics recently issued a statement on toys, advising parents of young children (from birth to school age) to go for high-quality “traditional” (that is, physical) toys rather than elaborate digital ones. It discusses the cognitive and developmental advantages of toys that give children scope for imagination and invention and, above all, toys that encourage play that brings parents and children together. Dr. Aleeya Healey, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Albany Medical College who was a co-author of the A.A.P. statement, said that the most essential message for parents was the importance of relationships in the lives of young children. “The less bells and whistles a toy comes with, the more it lends itself to creative play and imaginative play,” she said. “The more the toy can do on its own, the more distraction it lends itself to.” As a parent and as a pediatrician, I love this idea; children need manipulative toys, blocks and puzzles that let them practice with their hands and their brains, they need props for imagination and for interaction, books that will be read aloud over and over, space and scope to invent stories and act them out. The statement emphasizes that toys don’t need to be expensive, any more than they need to be fancy. (Every toddler knows that the best toys are the cabinet full of pots and pans or the big cardboard box that something else came in.) And yet, as they get older, children are as susceptible to marketing as I was, and they crave toys parents might regard as having dubious value like unicorns that poop glitter, Call of Duty Black Ops 4, or new outfits — known as skins — for their Fortnite avatars. Nowadays, however, the concern is not only marketing, but also increasingly sophisticated electronic toys, which substitute virtual interactions for the human interactions that are developmentally essential for children. [Read Wirecutter’s recommendations of gifts for children.] Dr. Alan Mendelsohn, an associate professor of pediatrics at New York University School of Medicine who was a co-author of the A.A.P. statement, said that there is a great deal of overlap between screens and toys now, and “parents are getting all of these messages about how screens and tablets and mobile devices and laptops are the thing that’s going to help their children to learn and become advanced in their development.” In fact, he said, there is plenty of evidence that screens can cause problems if they interfere with parents and children playing together, and it’s that playing together that matters most, both while the children are young and as they grow. “Spending some time playing with your child or reading with your child builds the relationship,” he said. “It helps them as things get more complicated in later childhood and adolescence.” [Read our guide on How to Raise a Reader.] As children get older, of course, they start to demand whatever bells and whistles are on offer. Those vintage Easy-Bake oven ads showed children — well, girls — producing spectacular spreads of layer cakes and cookies from the device, as Mother exclaimed in admiration. It was party time and the oven was the star. “Parents want to please their children, and children have very strong wishes, some a result of messaging,” Dr. Mendelsohn said. “I would recommend that parents strike a balance between trying to find toys that would make their child happy, but at the same time find toys that are going to be positive for the child” and might lead to parents and children spending time together. [Read more about the importance of play and learning through playtime.] When I was seduced by the Easy-Bake oven commercials, my mother said, of course, that any time I wanted to bake cookies, the family oven was at my disposal. My parents said, of course, that the things I baked would not look like the pictures on TV. My father said, of course, that they were only trying to sell me something. None of this mattered to me. I knew what it would take to change my life and get the party started, and it was the only thing I wanted, and ultimately, inevitably, when my 8th or 9th birthday came around, my parents bought me the Easy-Bake oven. You mixed a little packet of cake mix and poured it into a little tin pan and then you waited for the “cake” — which was the size of a large cookie — to bake over a light bulb. It took a while, as I recall, and when it was done … well, you know the story. You know the moral. My mother tried hard to simulate pleased surprise when the cakelets were displayed, but the oven was soon abandoned. I know that someone is reading this with profoundly fond nostalgia, remembering the joy of baking with her own plastic oven, recalling happy doll parties and extravagant midnight feasts. One person’s ill-advised toy is another’s golden childhood memory. Sometimes the memories are preceded by the toy crushes and cravings that put certain toys at the top of children’s wish lists. Yes, some of it is marketing, but even there, children respond idiosyncratically. I wasn’t a particularly domestic child, heaven knows, and I never begged for anything else that could remotely have been considered a homemaking or cooking toy. One of the universals of play has always been imitation and approximation. The imitation baking that was depicted on the TV ads was so attractive that it trumped the real thing: I wanted the pretend oven, even though the real one was on offer. But in fact I would have had more fun doing real cooking — under parental supervision — or serving elaborate imaginary feasts to imaginary royal visitors, or to dolls or stuffed animals. “Imaginative play is where the magic happens,” Dr. Healey said.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Case for a Mixed Economy,"Maybe not everything should be privatized. Opinion Columnist A mind is a terrible thing to lose, especially if the mind in question is president of the United States. But I feel like taking a break from that subject. So let’s talk about something completely different, and probably irrelevant. I’ve had several interviews lately in which I was asked whether capitalism had reached a dead end, and needed to be replaced with something else. I’m never sure what the interviewers have in mind; neither, I suspect, do they. I don’t think they’re talking about central planning, which everyone considers discredited. And I haven’t seen even an implausible proposal for a decentralized system that doesn’t rely on price incentives and self-interest – i.e., a market economy with private property, which most people would consider capitalism. So maybe I’m being dense or lacking in imagination, but it seems to be that the choice is still between markets and some kind of public ownership, maybe with some decentralization of control, but still more or less what we used to mean by socialism. And everyone either thinks of socialism as discredited, or pins the label on stuff – like social insurance programs – that isn’t what we used to mean by the word. But I’ve been wondering, exactly how discredited is socialism, really? True, nobody now imagines that what the world needs is the second coming of Gosplan. But have we really established that markets are the best way to do everything? Should everything be done by the private sector? I don’t think so. In fact, there are some areas, like education, where the public sector clearly does better in most cases, and others, like health care, in which the case for private enterprise is very weak. Add such sectors up, and they’re quite big. In other words, while Communism failed, there’s still a pretty good case for a mixed economy – and public ownership/control could be a significant, although not majority, component of that mix. My back of the envelope says that given what we know about economic performance, you could imagine running a fairly efficient economy that is only 2/3 capitalist, 1/3 publicly owned – i.e., sort-of-kind-of socialist. I arrive at that number by looking at employment data. What we see right away is that even now, with all the privatization etc. that has taken place, government at various levels employs about 15 percent of the work force – roughly half in education, another big chunk in health care, and then a combination of public services and administration. Looking at private sector employment, we find that another 15 percent of the work force is employed in education, health, and social assistance. Now, a large part of that employment is paid for by public money – think Medicare dollars spent at private hospitals. Much of the rest is paid for by private insurers, which exist in their current role only thanks to large tax subsidies and regulation. And there’s no reason to think the private sector does these things better than the public. Private insurers don’t obviously provide a service that couldn’t be provided, probably more cheaply, by national health insurance. Private hospitals aren’t obviously either better or more efficient than public. For-profit education is actually a disaster area. So you could imagine an economy in which the bulk of education, health, and social assistance currently in the private sector became public, with most people at least as well off as they are now. Then there are other private activities that could plausibly be public. Utilities are heavily regulated, and in some cases are publicly owned already. Private health insurance directly employs hundreds of thousands of people, with doubtful social purpose. And I’m sure I’m missing a few others. By and large, other areas like retail trade or manufacturing don’t seem suitable for public ownership – but even there you could see some cases. Elizabeth Warren is suggesting public manufacture of generic drugs, which isn’t at all a stupid idea. Put all of this together, and as I said, you could see an economy working well with something like 1/3 public ownership. Now, this wouldn’t satisfy people who hate capitalism. In fact, it wouldn’t even live up to the old slogan about government controlling the economy’s “commanding heights.” This would be more like government running the boiler in the basement. Also, I see zero chance of any of this happening in my working lifetime. But I do think it’s worth trying to think a bit beyond our current paradigm, which says that anything you could call socialist has been an utter failure. Maybe not so much?

2018,"The Champions League Group Stage Is Over. So, What Did We Learn?","ON SOCCER A familiar lineup of teams, from a familiar list of countries, found their way to the knockout stages, though not all of them were impressive along the way. MANCHESTER, England — Now, as far as José Mourinho is concerned, the Champions League can begin. The Manchester United manager has always regarded the three months of the group phase as little more than a glorified preliminary round. The real action, he feels, “starts in February.” On this, Mourinho’s bombast is not misplaced. Increasingly, the opening salvos of Europe’s most exclusive club tournament feel like a procession. This most recent edition is a case in point: A familiar lineup of teams, from a familiar list of countries, have qualified for the last 16. Going into the final round of group games, the favorites were in so little jeopardy that Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Atlético Madrid and Juventus were all able to advance without a victory. Only when the knockout stages start in 2019 will their credentials truly be examined; only when they meet will the competition ignite. What, then, can be gleaned from the last 12 weeks or so, if anything? Are there any signs to discern or runes to read? Have we all just been wasting our time? Real Madrid made it despite losing its talisman, sacking its manager and somehow twice losing to CSKA Moscow. Bayern Munich made it despite indulging in a crisis so profound halfway through that its preening potentates had to call a news conference to rail against a “disrespectful” news media. Both, indeed, did more than make it: Both won their groups. So, too, did Barcelona, the only one of the trio of perennial Champions League favorites to have come close to impressing in the group stage. Same old, same old: Between them, Real, Bayern and Barcelona account for eight of the last 10 winners. And they are all in position again. Or so it seems. Group stage form is rarely a reliable guide to eventual success — Real, in particular, has an uncanny ability to discover not just a new gear but an entirely different engine when the knockout rounds start — but it is obvious that all three are not at the peak of their powers. Those two defeats to CSKA aside, Real’s European form has provided an escape from their domestic travails. Bayern wallows nine points behind Borussia Dortmund at the summit of the Bundesliga. Barcelona has wobbled, occasionally, too. All three are at, or near, to the end of a cycle; Real and Bayern, certainly, are contemplating comprehensive overhauls this summer regardless of how the season turns out. All of which means that those clubs who have labored in their shadows for a decade have a mouthwatering opportunity: Atlético Madrid and Juventus, each with two losses in the final in the last six years, certainly, but also the supercharged pretenders to the throne: Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain. For both clubs, the Champions League is the Holy Grail — if not for their fans, then certainly for their soft-power-seeking owners. This is the trophy they have spent billions to acquire, the ultimate proof of their transformative power. It is why P.S.G. made Neymar the most expensive player in history, and Kylian Mbappé the second; it is why City designed a whole club just for Pep Guardiola. Until now, the expertise and experience of Real, Barcelona and Bayern has kept them at arm’s reach. With their strength waning, this is the moment of opportunity for the arrivistes, and they may never have a better one. This could be the end of an era, or it may just be a lacuna. At some point, the old guard will roar back. This is not the year to miss out. Borussia Dortmund’s impossibly young squad has a verve and a fearlessness that has caught the eye, but it is the restoration of Ajax, under Erik ten Hag, that stirs the soul. He has built his team around two superstars-in-waiting, Matthijs de Ligt and Frenkie de Jong. This will, in all likelihood, be their last Champions League campaign in those famous old jerseys. Enjoy them while you can. Lionel Messi has won the Champions League four times. He was part of the Barcelona squad — though not, in the end, part of the team — that triumphed in Paris in 2006; in Barcelona’s victories in 2009, 2011 and 2015, he was at the heart of everything. There is as much time and energy dedicated to assessing Messi’s frame of mind as was once expended on reading the latest machinations behind the high walls of the Kremlin, but what has become abundantly clear this season is that he has decided that is not nearly enough. Messi’s form this year has been imperious. Quite what is driving it depends, to an extent, on who you ask. Some would suggest he felt slighted at finishing fifth in the voting for the Ballon d’Or earlier this month, losing out to Luka Modric, just as he did in FIFA’s rival The Best award. Fans never know quite how seriously to take those prizes. Traditionally, they are additional trinkets rather than genuine ambitions. The voting methods tend to be flawed in some way; the annual publication of the voting lists for FIFA’s version tend to underscore the fact that politics comes, for some, above sporting merit. Players, though, take them very seriously; their sheen has only been increased by the fervor with which Messi and his great rival, Cristiano Ronaldo, have tried to accumulate them. Securing a fifth Champions League — which would bring him level with Ronaldo — seems to be an even more potent motivating factor for Messi. He may have come to terms with the idea that he is unlikely to win a World Cup with Argentina; if he is to burnish his legend yet further, it will have to be in Europe. Four is not a bad haul, but arguably the finest player of all time may feel he warrants more. Barcelona seemed set fair to make the final, at least, last year, only to come unstuck against Roma in the quarterfinal. The previous season, Juventus tore Messi’s team to shreds in Turin. He is playing like a man determined not to fall to the same fate again. Red Star Belgrade’s 2-0 win against Liverpool not only left Group C on a knife-edge but reminded, briefly, the greedy, self-regarding leagues of western Europe of the dangers that used to — and still can — lurk in the east, the peril that made this competition special in the first place. There were higher-quality games, more-dramatic games, more-beautiful games, but none meant quite so much. As part of the endless appeasement of Europe’s biggest, most powerful clubs, UEFA agreed that — from this season onward — each of Europe’s big four leagues would be guaranteed four places in the Champions League’s group stages. No longer would the team that finished fourth in the Premier League, Serie A, La Liga or the Bundesliga be subjected to the indignity of actually having to qualify for a tournament: They would all have automatic access to the most lucrative stage of the competition. Aleksander Ceferin, UEFA’s president, had been given little choice but to make the concession. Every time the Champions League television rights are due for renegotiation, the elite clubs of England, Spain, Italy and Germany threaten to walk away from the competition and set up their own tournament unless they are given a greater slice of the broadcast revenue and more special treatment. This was the latest demand. Ceferin was clear, though, that this was his line in the sand: He would go no further, whatever the next threat. He would not — as the major leagues had suggested — reduce the competition to 24 teams. UEFA, he felt, had already succumbed enough. The country that benefited most, without question, was Italy. Serie A, under the competition’s previous provisions, had just three places, full stop, one of which was dependent on a successful qualifier. Now, Juventus, A.S. Roma, Napoli and Internazionale would all be parachuted straight into the group stage. It is hard to argue that it has entirely earned that status. England sent four teams to the last 16; Germany and Spain three apiece. Italy has only two: Juventus and Roma. There are mitigating circumstances. Napoli can rightly feel that the draw for the group stage was unkind, pairing Carlo Ancelotti’s team with both P.S.G. and Liverpool; Inter, seeded in the lowest tier of teams, was always likely to face an uphill struggle. And the margins of failure were fine, too. It is not difficult to imagine a world in which four Italian teams made it, and only two from England: Napoli would have qualified at Liverpool’s expense had Arkadiusz Milik managed to evade the sprawling limbs of goalkeeper Alisson Becker in the dying seconds at Anfield; a single goal — either for Inter or Barcelona — would have sent Inter through, rather than Tottenham. It is still, though, an unfortunately timed blow for Serie A. Ceferin may see it differently, of course. Perhaps the major nations should have to earn special dispensation, rather than simply having it handed to them. F.C. Porto won its group with ease — dropping just two points on the way — but will still be the plum opponent for any of the heavyweights reduced to runner-up status. Liverpool beat Sérgio Conceicão’s team, 5-0, in northern Portugal in last year’s last Round of 16; Porto will be determined to ensure there is no repeat, if only for personal dignity, but Manchester United, Liverpool, Atlético Madrid and the rest will be hoping for a February visit to the banks of the Douro. Real Madrid’s legacy is apparent in Paris, where Neymar, all $252 million of him, carries the hopes of a club and at least one nation. It is there in Turin, where Cristiano Ronaldo is heralded as the man to break the club’s curse. It is there, too, in Manchester, though its form contorted and its message altered, where Pep Guardiola is supposed to be the savior. Across Europe, elite clubs have spent huge amounts of time and even greater amounts of money to try to crack soccer’s code. They draw up complex recruitment strategies and hire impeccably qualified data analysts. Teams of scouts pore over footage of opponents, probing for weaknesses; medical staff swab players’ mouths every morning, trying to determine the precise level of hydration they require that day. Soccer has become obsessed — rightly, in large part — with process; it operates — rightly, in large part — under the belief that the most marginal of gains could be significant, that by being smarter than their opponents they can be more successful. They do all that stuff at Real Madrid, too, but they see the game rather differently. Real Madrid stands at odds with the sport’s zeitgeist. To Florentino Pérez, the club’s president, soccer is much more simple than that. It is, at heart, a game of individuals. If you have the best ones, then you win. At the very highest level, his peers seem to have decided he is right. P.S.G. bought Neymar to be their superstar, their game-breaker, because being smarter was not quick enough. No club in Europe has been cleverer these last few years than Juventus, but even it could not turn down the chance to sign Ronaldo. At Manchester City, the savior complex attaches to the coach, the man who oversees all of those systems, rather than the players who benefit from them: to Guardiola, the shortcut to a place among the true elite. All three shone in bursts in the group stage, and all three will be expected to do more than that once the knockout games come. Neymar left Barcelona to emerge from Messi’s shadow. Ronaldo left Real Madrid because the club felt he belonged to the past, not the future — and he disagreed. Guardiola has not won a Champions League since 2011; seven years is too long for the finest coach of his generation. Now is the time for them to prove they were worth the money, and the belief. Diego Simeone’s Atlético Madrid might have been ripped to shreds by a reinvigorated Borussia Dortmund, and it might have closed its group stage campaign with a dispiriting draw at Club Brugge, but it still presents a uniquely physical, exacting challenge. The fact it cannot face another Spanish team, or Dortmund, in the last 16 means that either Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain, Juventus, Bayern Munich or Porto will draw the short straw.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Chart That Shows the Price Tag for Trump’s Obamacare Sabotage,"If you’re middle class and looking for insurance through the health law, chances are you’re paying a penalty courtesy of the G.O.P. Mr. Gaba is a health care analyst and the founder and editor of the website ACAsignups.net. The Affordable Care Act is still in effect, and the 2019 open enrollment period just ended for most Americans. The recent ruling by a Texas judge declaring the act invalid doesn’t change that. But the Trump administration and Republicans are still undermining the health law. People who earn too much to qualify for financial assistance for policies purchased through the A.C.A.’s health insurance exchanges or directly from insurers — five million now enrolled, including three to four million enrolled off-exchange — will pay for that sabotage in higher premiums. (Another nearly five million are uninsured and priced out of the market.) In the graphic below, I estimate how much more these unsubsidized enrollees will have to lay out in 2019 than they would have if not for the Trump administration’s actions. Its sabotage efforts in 2018 included cutting off subsidy reimbursement payments for low-income enrollees (the cost of which insurers pass along to unsubsidized consumers), slashing the marketing budget by 90 percent and gouging the outreach-assistance budget by 40 percent. Next year will have those plus the repeal of the individual mandate and the expansion of non-Obamacare-compliant policies that don’t include the law’s patient protections. These moves siphon off healthy enrollees, damaging the A.C.A. “risk pool,” so that its customers tend to be sicker and more expensive to carriers. In setting their premiums, many insurers specifically point to these actions as reasons for rate increases. The estimates below are based in part on 2019 rate filings by insurance carriers in each state and modeled in part on estimates by the Urban Institute. Nationally, I estimate an average impact of $49 per month — or nearly $580 per year — for each unsubsidized enrollee. It hits people living in Trump-voting states especially hard.

2018,Opinion | The Christmas Time Capsule,"Every year when the decorations come down from the attic, time goes both ways at once. Contributing Opinion Writer NASHVILLE — It would be fair to call my home décor aesthetic the opposite of a Pottery Barn catalog. In theory, I would love to live in a Pottery Barn catalog, but in practice, I’m too much of a pack rat to be comfortable among spare furnishings in rich earth tones. Our house looks like an ongoing estate sale. Every tabletop is jammed with family photos. Every windowsill is a miniature stage for cicada carapaces and crinoid fossils, tiny superheroes left over from our sons’ childhood, antique buttons, earrings without mates, watches without bands. The refrigerator door is wallpapered edge to edge with photos from old friends’ Christmas cards; the doors of our kitchen cabinets are covered with notices for art shows long since closed. Even the drawings taped to the walls of my home office go back so far that several of them are signed in the mirror writing our youngest child used before he got to kindergarten and learned to flip the letters to face the proper way. That child is now a sophomore in college. All day long I’m surrounded by reminders of nearly a quarter-century in this house. Who I am and who I’ve been, and who everyone else I love has been — it’s all laid out before me like a life-size version of a fourth-grade social studies diorama. Then the Christmas boxes come down from the attic, and time extends backward even further, beyond this house, and forward to a future in which the broadest outlines are already clear though the details are still unknown. Getting down the Christmas decorations is always a reminder of eternity, that unfamiliar space where past and present and future exist simultaneously — a space I can enter, even figuratively, only at Christmastime. Here is the ornament in the shape of a baseball player from my husband’s boyhood years. Here is the little felt-covered drum my mother helped me make from a paper-towel roll. Here are the blown-egg ornaments my high school Secret Santa left in my locker and the gold-and-silver Benson & Hedges box a college friend hung on the tree in my first college apartment. Here are the metal lapel pins that proved I’d paid for admission at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the only “decorations” I could scrounge up when I was in graduate school. Here are the twisted-tin icicles my husband and I bought at a craft fair the year before we got married, already looking ahead to our own first tree. Here’s the little marionette Santa my mother-in-law won as a door prize at a Parkinson’s support group just before what turned out to be her last Christmas. Most precious of all are the homemade ornaments from my children’s preschool years: messy, often unrecognizable figures — is that an archangel or Medusa? Rudolph or Popsicle-stick conceptual art? We hang them on the tree every year, ugly as some of them indisputably are. They remind my husband and me of that brief time in our family’s life when there was still someone at home small enough to jump up and down, clapping with glee, when the Christmas tree lights came on for the first time, even if it was only a test and the lights were spread out across the floor or still tangled together at the bottom of a cardboard box. Other boxes hold the stockings my mother needlepointed, one for each boy. The Coke-bottle Santas my mother-in-law bought at the gift shop in her tiny hometown, also one for each boy. The tie-quilted Christmas tree for the front door that came from the annual bazaar at the country church where my mother grew up. The nativity set my grandmother’s best friend made for her in a backyard studio — each year a new camel or wise man or shepherd or donkey, till the set was complete. The angel my great-grandmother crocheted of white string and starched into a stand-alone shape that allows the angel to balance in place at the top of the tree. Last year when I packed up the Christmas decorations, I set aside our oldest son’s homemade ornaments in a separate box. He is on his own now, and I know the day is coming when he will have his own tree to decorate, his own holiday traditions to establish. He didn’t put up a tree this year, so his father and I are still keeping them safe, but we are also ready for whatever comes next. For now those ornaments are back in their old familiar places, hanging alongside all the other reminders that the people who are gone from us are never truly gone, that the little boys hopping up and down with excitement are still somewhere inside the grown men who can set that homely angel in her place at the top of the tree without even straining to reach.

2018,Opinion | The Chuck and Nancy and Donald Show,"If Tuesday’s Oval Office meeting is any indication, it’s going to be a rough two years. Ms. Cottle is a member of the editorial board. Talk about gripping political theater. President Trump’s televised sit-down with Democratic congressional leaders in the Oval Office on Tuesday was fast-paced, spicy and even occasionally edifying — though perhaps not in the way its participants intended. Topic A was Mr. Trump’s cherished border wall and, more specifically, whether he really intends to shut down parts of the government next week if Congress doesn’t give him the $5 billion in funding he’s demanding. Starting out, Mr. Trump tried to keep things “friendly,” by his terms at least: He spouted his usual folderol about the indispensability of a wall; he spun scary fictions about hordes of terrorists, criminals and — in a slightly fresher twist — contagion-carrying migrants swarming the southern border; he mansplained to Nancy Pelosi, the once and future speaker of the House, how the legislative process works; he shrugged off multiple jabs at his habitual dishonesty by Ms. Pelosi and her Senate counterpart, Chuck Schumer; and, as usual, he cheerfully ignored his vice president, Mike Pence, who spent the entirety of the 15-plus-minute confab doing his best impression of a throw pillow. “See! We get along!” the president enthused after his Democratic guests agreed that border security is important. But after being gigged by Mr. Schumer about having repeatedly threatened a shutdown, Mr. Trump couldn’t resist going all Tough Guy for the cameras. He sat up extra straight, gave his suit jacket that who’s-your-daddy? snap he so loves, and thrust his chin at the Senate leader: “You know what? You want to put that on my — I’ll take it!” he challenged. “If we don’t get what we want — one way or the other, whether it’s through you, through a military, through anything you want to call — I will shut down the government, absolutely... And I’ll tell you what, I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck.” And with that, the president moved to wrap up the discussion, leaving Chuck, Nancy and everyone else to marvel at the weirdness of what had just transpired — and, just as important, what it all means. Short answer: Whatever happens with the funding standoff, the next two years of divided government promise to be a freak show of finger-pointing and point-scoring and people talking over and past one another with no hope of, or even much interest in, engaging the other side. While entertaining, this also risks taking the level of dysfunction to new depths likely to further erode public faith in government — no small feat considering that the public already holds the government in lower esteem than your average war criminal. Indeed, if Tuesday’s preview was any indication, Mr. Trump will spend the rest of his term talking smack, patronizing and tweaking congressional Democrats, and playing ever more wildly to his base, even as Democrats express growing frustration about their inability to have a rational conversation with a president who lives — with apologies to Mr. Rogers — in his own Neighborhood of Make-Believe. Both Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer looked alternately bemused and exasperated by their visit, and both pleaded that the negotiations were best conducted in private. At one point, Mr. Trump scolded Ms. Pelosi: “But it’s not bad, Nancy. It’s called transparency.” This sent the House leader into a flustered effort to insist that you cannot have “transparency” when the parties involved aren’t operating with the same set of facts. “Let us have a conversation where we don’t have to contradict in public the statistics that you put forth,” she urged later in the conversation. The data Mr. Trump turned to “are not factual” she said. “We have to have an evidence-based conversation.” Translation: The only thing Ms. Pelosi considered transparent about this encounter was Mr. Trump’s dishonesty. Now, maybe relations will be better behind the scenes, when there’s less impetus to grandstand or score points. (While Mr. Trump was the one in full diva mode, Mr. Schumer fired off a couple of good zingers.) Maybe progress can happen here and there, on select issues. (Criminal justice reform?) But, as far as public encounters go, don’t look for anything more productive any time soon. After the meeting, Ms. Pelosi was less restrained, reportedly offering this piquant assessment to her conference colleagues: “It was so wild. It goes to show you: You get into a tinkle contest with a skunk, you get tinkle all over you.” As for the issue of wall funding, the Democratic leader was even more cutting: “It’s like a manhood thing with him — as if manhood can be associated with him,” she said. “This wall thing.” Buckle up, people. With or without a shutdown, things promise to get even bumpier. Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.",The New York Times
2018,The Church Settled Sexual Abuse Cases Against This Priest. Why Is He Still Saying Mass?,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] MIDDLETOWN, N.Y. — The Rev. Donald G. Timone, cloaked in the purple and gold robes of Advent, led the procession down the central aisle of St. Joseph’s Church here on the first Sunday of December. Celebrating the 11:30 a.m. Mass, he preached of the need to open one’s heart to Jesus in these days before Christmas. “He understands we are not perfect,” he said, “but he will not give up on us.” But Father Timone, by the Roman Catholic Church’s own apparent standards, should not be presiding at the altar. Two settlements were paid by the Archdiocese of New York for substantiated allegations that Father Timone had sexually abused teenage boys he was counseling, one of whom committed suicide after what his widow said was a decades-long struggle with what had happened to him. As the clergy abuse scandal roils the Catholic Church, dioceses across the country have been under tremendous pressure to prove that they have brought accountability to how they handle the issue of child sexual abuse. The crisis was highlighted again on Wednesday, when the Illinois attorney general said in a scathing report that the Catholic Church in Illinois had withheld the names of at least 500 priests accused of sexual abuse of minors. The Illinois attorney general contended that Catholic dioceses in the state often seemed to find ways to avoid substantiating claims of sexual abuse, saying that the dioceses were incapable of investigating themselves. The case of Father Timone seems to indicate similar failings in how the Archdiocese of New York handles sexual assault accusations. The New York archdiocese is essentially allowing Father Timone to continue serving as a priest because of a bureaucratic technicality — a position that seems to fly in the face of the pledge by Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, the archbishop of the New York Archdiocese, to aggressively handle sexual abuse accusations. The archdiocese maintains that Father Timone has been allowed to remain because the church itself did not rule on his fitness; that judgment was made by a separate, church-sponsored panel, the Independent Reconciliation and Compensation Program. The settlements were paid in 2017 through that program, which Cardinal Dolan established the previous year to provide closure and a measure of justice to victims of sexual abuse by priests. The archdiocese has its own internal process for substantiating abuse claims. And though it initially suspended Father Timone and investigated an allegation lodged against him in 2002, its review board did not substantiate the accusation at the time, the spokesman for the archdiocese, Joseph Zwilling, said last week. Responding to questions from The New York Times, Mr. Zwilling added that the case had now been reopened to determine if Father Timone should be removed from the ministry, but that he would not be suspended during that investigation. Father Timone did not return repeated calls and emails for comment. Advocates for clergy sexual abuse victims said the archdiocese’s explanation amounted to a dodge. They were shocked by how openly Father Timone has continued to function as a priest. “It is a staggering violation of the bishops’ zero-tolerance provision,” said Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of BishopAccountability.org, which tracks clergy abuse. “It is deeply irresponsible of Cardinal Dolan. It is brazen and it is a disservice.” The cardinal has taken steps to show he is moving to address the issue of abuse in the church. In the face of a civil investigation by the New York attorney general, he appointed a former federal judge to review the archdiocese’s policies on abuse this year. It was his review board that substantiated decades-old abuse allegations against former Cardinal Theodore E. McCarrick last summer, leading to the downfall of one of the nation’s most powerful prelates. Still, he has declined to release a full list of accused priests as other bishops have. “I, for one, don’t exactly see why we should, because the names are already out there,” he said in September. Victims’ rights groups have disputed that claim. Through it all, Father Timone, 84, has continued to preside at Masses, teach college students in California and work with Courage, an international Catholic ministry that counsels people with same-sex attractions to refrain from homosexual sex, which the Catholic Church considers contrary to natural law. And in 2013, after protests over a speech about same-sex attraction that Father Timone was to give at a Bronx high school, Cardinal Dolan personally praised Father Timone in an op-ed in The Daily News. The cardinal, who is the ex officio chairman of Courage International’s episcopal board, wrote that Father Timone was “a remarkably gentle and holy man.” On Dec. 2, Father Timone warmly greeted parishioners before Mass in Middletown, and afterward sat in a pew chatting and offering advice. There was no hint of scandal. Martin Suchy, a parishioner, was shocked when told that the archdiocese had paid for a sexual abuse settlement regarding accusations against Father Timone. So was another parishioner, Clarisse, who asked to be identified only by her first name. “There is no way,” she said, her eyes filling with tears. “That’s an unjust accusation.” The widow of one of Father Timone’s accusers, Susan Cassinelli-Murphy, 63, said she was particularly upset after hearing that the priest had offered Mass that morning. “I don’t think he gets it,” she said. “I feel like saying: ‘Are you serious? Couldn’t you apologize to him?’” Father Timone started his career as a high school teacher and priest in the Bronx and several upstate parishes, including St. Joseph’s Church in Millbrook, N.Y., where he met Timothy P. Murphy as a young man. Mr. Murphy, his widow, Ms. Cassinelli-Murphy, recalled, was the second son in a large Catholic family. He was an altar boy who as a teen became a rebel, popular with classmates and girls, but uninterested in studying. His mother asked Father Timone to take the boy under his wing, she said. The priest began taking Tim on trips in 1967, when he was 13 or 14, according to a police report that Mr. Murphy filed in 2002 with the Dutchess County district attorney. The outings including going to Bash Bish Falls, a secluded park where they would swim in the nude, he told the police. A few times, Father Timone asked him to stay overnight at his residence, the report stated. Father Timone would dry him off after he took a shower and then put powder on his body or ask him to exercise. Sometimes, he asked Tim to lie on his bed, and rubbed ointment on his thighs, legs and buttocks and massaged him. Once, the report said, he used a vibrating massager. “This man was obsessed with nudity, and I became a toy for his pleasure without really understanding what was happening,” Mr. Murphy wrote in his 2006 memoir, “From Crack to the Cross: A Journey of Hope,” in which he referred to Father Timone as Father X. He added that Father X kept T-shirts in boys sizes in his dresser and would ask him to wear one without underwear, “because the shirt was long.” During these encounters, Father Timone would also show him pictures of women’s vaginas and breasts, “in an attempt to instill in him the distorted belief that women’s bodies were disgusting and dirty,” Ms. Cassinelli-Murphy said in her statement to the compensation panel. She said the abuse had made Mr. Murphy phobic of sexual intimacy, a common impact of child sexual abuse. The abuse lasted until 1970, the police report said. After high school, Mr. Murphy found success as a manager in the restaurant industry, but drug and alcohol addictions repeatedly derailed him. In 2000, he was sentenced in Florida to a drug-rehabilitation program in prison after a series of drunken-driving convictions. While there, he said he had a spiritual awakening, becoming a born-again Christian. Shortly afterward, he recounted in his memoir, a counselor encouraged him to report the abuse that had happened three decades earlier. [How 10 New York City Catholics dealt with their internal struggles over recent sexual abuse allegations.] In 2003, after Mr. Murphy had gone to the police, the archdiocese sent its attorney and Msgr. Desmond O’Connor to meet with him, according to his attorney, Donald D. Brown Jr. The archdiocese did not challenge Mr. Murphy’s claims at the time, Mr. Brown said last week, and archdiocesan officials offered Mr. Murphy therapy. “They were candid with us; they were apologetic to us,” Mr. Brown said. “They confirmed that there were other children in the same time frame that made similar complaints against Timone.” Mr. Murphy testified later that year before a 12-member archdiocesan review board in Manhattan. Ms. Cassinelli-Murphy recalled of that day: “When he came out, he said, ‘I really believe they believed me.’ ” In 2015, Mr. Murphy committed suicide at age 61. When, in 2016, the reconciliation program reached out to Mr. Brown inviting Mr. Murphy to submit a claim, his widow submitted one on his behalf. Ms. Cassinelli-Murphy produced documentary evidence to The Times that she had received a six-figure settlement in May 2017. It was within what lawyers say is the typical range for the program of between $100,000 to $500,000. Mr. Murphy is not the only person who has received a settlement from the reconciliation program over allegations of abuse by Father Timone. A man in his 60s, who asked not to be identified, said last week that he had also reported sexual abuse by Father Timone to the archdiocese in 2002. He said he did not hear back about the allegation until 2016, when he was invited to submit a claim to the reconciliation program, as were all clergy abuse victims known to the archdiocese. It awarded him $150,000 in March 2017. He showed a copy of the check to The Times signed by Kenneth R. Feinberg, the administrator of the compensation program. The man explained how in 1972 his parents sent him to see Father Timone for counseling after being kicked out of a Catholic high school. He said he had been sexually assaulted by a different clergy member there, but never told his parents. Last week, he recalled of his sessions with Father Timone: “He used to have me come over to the residence and make me take a shower,” he said. “Then he would dry you off and fondle you.” In his filing to the compensation program, the man wrote that the archdiocese sent Monsignor O’Connor, then the director of priest personnel for the archdiocese, to St. Joseph’s Church in Millbrook in the late spring of 2002 to interview people who may have been abused by Father Timone. “They interviewed us all,” the man said. “This kind of situation when you are a child ruins your life, it does,” he added. “I am speaking from experience.” Monsignor O’Connor declined to comment, referring all questions to the archdiocese. Mr. Brown said he was told in 2003 that Father Timone had been removed from his duties, and sent to a place where they send offending priests. No legal action could be taken because of New York’s statute of limitations on child sex abuse. “We assumed he was on his way to being defrocked,” Mr. Brown said. He was shocked, he said, to hear that the archdiocese now says it did not substantiate Mr. Murphy’s allegations. “They are playing fast and loose with the truth on this,” Mr. Brown said. Mr. Zwilling said last week that Father Timone had never been sent to a treatment facility for abusive priests. He also said that there was “only one allegation” at the time that Mr. Murphy reported his claims, despite the testimony of the other victim. He said he could not comment about other settlements by the Independent Reconciliation and Compensation Program. Though it is church policy to immediately suspend any employee who has been accused of abuse of a minor, Mr. Zwilling said Father Timone will continue to work as the case is reopened because he had already been suspended during the original 2002 investigation. Advocates for abuse victims said that did not make sense, adding that the case showed why law enforcement needs to investigate how the Catholic Church handles abuse cases. “As a basic child protection premise, it would seem that if you have a substantiated claim against a living, working priest, that individual should be isolated,” said Michael Reck, an attorney working with many victims in the archdiocese. Rev. Leo Fisher, the chaplain of the Hudson Valley chapter of Courage, said last week that Father Timone remained active with the chapter “informally,” counseling Courage members and their families. A spokeswoman for Courage said that he had not been an official chaplain for about 10 years. Parishioners at St. Joseph’s said in December that Father Timone divides his time between New York and California. When in New York, he lives at the rectory of St. Joseph’s on Cottage Street, where he is officially a priest in residence, and presides at Masses during the week and on weekends. In California, he celebrates Mass at the Church of the Nativity in Rancho Santa Fe, and was scheduled to do so as recently as last Sunday. He also teaches at John Paul the Great Catholic University, in Escondido, Calif.; this winter he is scheduled to lead a theology capstone independent study class. In the final decade of his life, Mr. Murphy himself became a therapist and counseled others, trying to find the meaning in his own suffering. But it was not enough to allay his pain. “I have been unsuccessful at this thing called life,” he wrote in his suicide note to his wife on Jan. 8, 2015. “I need to go home to Jesus, if He’ll have me.” An earlier version of this article misstated the street address of the St. Joseph’s Church rectory in Middletown, N.Y. It is on Cottage Street, not College Avenue.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Corporate Donors Behind a Republican Power Grab,"Walgreens and other major companies are key supporters of the Wisconsin legislators now trying to undermine democracy. Opinion Columnist Walgreens portrays itself as the friendly neighborhood drugstore. It gives flu shots to children, helps communities after storms, donates to charity — and makes feel-good advertisements trumpeting its various good deeds. But Walgreens also has a tougher side, one you won’t see in those ads. To protect a tax break, the company has allied itself with Wisconsin’s brutally partisan Republican Party. That party is now in the midst of a power grab, stripping authority from Wisconsin’s governor and attorney general solely because Republicans lost those offices last month. The power grab comes after years of extreme gerrymandering, which lets Republicans dominate the legislature despite Wisconsin being a closely divided state. Wisconsin’s Republicans really are trying to undo democracy. When I asked Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt — the political scientists who wrote the recent book “How Democracies Die” — about the situation, they agreed that the Wisconsin power grab was the sort of move their book describes. If it continues, it can lead to the breakdown of a political system. [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] So you might think that an organization that claims to care about community values would speak up. But Walgreens has not. Neither have other corporate supporters of Wisconsin Republicans, like Microsoft, Dr Pepper Snapple, J.P. Morgan Chase or Humana. It’s yet another example — alongside soaring C.E.O. pay and stagnant worker wages — of corporations abdicating the leadership role they once played in America. The story of Walgreens and Wisconsin has its roots in a decade-old court case. In 2008, the State Supreme Court ruled in favor of an aggressive tax strategy by the company, in a case known as Walgreens v. City of Madison. When calculating the property taxes it owed, Walgreens used an artificially low valuation of its stores. It did not pay taxes based on the actual value of those stores, as reflected by their purchase price and rent. Instead, it took into account the value of vacant stores nearby. The court ruling allowed this “dark-store” practice — by Walgreens and other retailers — costing cities and towns millions upon millions of tax dollars. The resulting budget shortfalls, local officials point out, have caused taxes on families and small businesses to rise more in Wisconsin than in neighboring Minnesota. The Walgreens loophole is deeply unpopular, based on the results of a nonbinding ballot initiative across Wisconsin. And last year, a bipartisan group of state legislators began a push to change the law. But then, somewhat mysteriously, the effort died. The legislature’s Republican leaders — including Robin Vos, the Assembly speaker, and Scott Fitzgerald, the Senate majority leader — appeared to play a crucial role in the demise of that measure. A few weeks later, Walgreens donated $1,000 to Vos. Over the summer, it donated another $6,000 to the Committee to Elect a Republican Senate. A couple of weeks before Election Day, the company gave $1,000 to Fitzgerald. These donations weren’t simply a matter of spreading money around. Walgreens did not donate to state-level Democrats this year, as it has in the past. The sums here may not be enormous. But neither are the budgets for local campaigns. Even more important is the message that Walgreens is sending to politicians: We don’t care if you undermine democracy, so long as we get to keep our tax break. “It would be healthier for companies to spend a little more time thinking about the meaning of these donations,” as Judd Legum, author of the political newsletter Popular Information, told me. “Right now, it’s all transactional.” In recent months, Legum’s reporting has caused Facebook, Google, Walmart, Major League Baseball and others to ask for the return of donations to politicians whose values the companies were not comfortable defending. So far, Walgreens has not been willing to do the same in Wisconsin. I asked the company last week what it thought about the recent events in Wisconsin, and it ducked the question. But Phil Caruso, a Walgreens spokesman, told me the company was “in the process of evaluating” the situation. The silence of major companies is disappointing because they could actually make a difference. Republican politicians care about the opinions of their corporate backers. If corporate America refuses to speak up, these attacks on democracy will become more common. The one in Wisconsin follows a similar power grab in North Carolina two years ago. And Michigan Republicans are now trying to execute their own version. In Ohio and Missouri, there are less blatant — but still alarming — attempts to overturn the will of the voters. I realize that being able to operate in a well-functioning democracy doesn’t bring the same obvious bottom-line benefits as, say, a tax break. But our corporate leaders are making a big mistake if they decide that democracy doesn’t matter.

2019,The Cases Against Netanyahu and a Decision to Indict,"JERUSALEM — After an investigation of more than two years, Israel’s attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, announced Thursday that he planned to indict Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Mr. Netanyahu, who denies any wrongdoing and says he is being persecuted by Israel’s left, is entitled to a hearing before an indictment is formally issued. But if he fails to persuade Mr. Mandelblit to back down, he would become the first sitting prime minister in Israel to face criminal prosecution. [Read here about the decision to charge the prime minister.] Here is a summary of the allegations against Mr. Netanyahu, as well as the charges Mr. Mandelblit is pursuing and his reasoning for doing so. It is based on documents released Thursday by the Ministry of Justice. THE PLAYERS Arnon Milchan, the Hollywood producer; James Packer, an Australian billionaire. THE QUID Expensive cigars, jewelry and pink Champagne flowed abundantly into the prime minister’s official Jerusalem residence, sometimes at his or his wife’s request, but always with the compliments of Mr. Milchan or Mr. Packer, whom Mr. Milchan enlisted to share the cost of the gifts. The value of the gifts came to hundreds of thousands of dollars. THE QUO Mr. Netanyahu promoted the extension of a 10-year tax exemption to expatriate Israelis returning to the country, which could benefit Mr. Milchan financially. The Finance Ministry blocked the legislation, saying it was against the national interest and fiscally unsound. Mr. Packer is not accused of receiving anything in return for his gifts to the Netanyahus. THE DECISION Mr. Netanyahu should be charged with fraud and breach of trust. Because it was impossible to prove that the gifts were given to Mr. Netanyahu because of his position, the case does not meet the threshold for bribery. THE PLAYERS Arnon Mozes, the publisher of Yediot Ahronot, a leading Israeli daily newspaper; Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas casino magnate, a devoted supporter of Mr. Netanyahu’s and the financial backer of Israel Hayom, a rival paper; Ari Harow, Mr. Netanyahu’s former chief of staff, who turned state’s evidence. THE QUID Mr. Netanyahu discussed with Mr. Mozes the possibility of using his influence with Mr. Adelson, and perhaps of advancing legislation, to curb the circulation of Israel Hayom, which has long been seen as slavishly promoting Mr. Netanyahu’s interests. THE QUO In return, Yediot Ahronot would treat Mr. Netanyahu and his family more favorably and “help him succeed in upcoming elections,” according to Mr. Mandelblit. THE CATCH The trade was discussed, including on phone calls recorded by Mr. Harow, but was never consummated. THE DECISION Mr. Netanyahu should be charged with fraud and breach of trust. The evidence did not sufficiently prove that he had “requested or made a bribe,” but he “violated the duty of trust owed to the public.” Mr. Mozes should be charged with bribery. THE PLAYERS Shaul Elovitch, a media tycoon and friend of Mr. Netanyahu’s; Shlomo Filber, the director-general of the communications ministry under Mr. Netanyahu; and Nir Hefetz, the Netanyahu family’s public relations adviser. Mr. Filber and Mr. Hefetz became government witnesses. THE QUID While serving as prime minister, Mr. Netanyahu also held the post of communications minister from 2014 to 2017. Mr. Elovitch, who had long shared ownership of the Yes satellite network with Bezeq, Israel’s biggest telecommunications company, bought a controlling stake in Bezeq in 2010. Heavily in debt, he arranged for Bezeq to buy Yes in 2015 for several times more than independent valuations showed Yes was worth. The communications ministry under Mr. Netanyahu aided several of Mr. Elovitch’s moves, effectively helping him reap tens of millions of dollars. The police said they had seized about $32 million in ill-gotten gains. THE QUO Bezeq also owns Walla, one of Israel’s leading news sites. At the direction of Mr. Elovitch and Mr. Hefetz, Walla consistently provided gauzy coverage of Mr. Netanyahu and his wife, suppressing or softening critical reports, padding inconsequential items with flattering photographs and acceding to hundreds of the couple’s demands. The demands increased around the 2013 and 2015 elections and during coverage of scandals involving the Netanyahus. THE DECISION Mr. Netanyahu should be charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Mr. Elovitch should face prosecution for bribery, obstruction of justice, money laundering and a securities violation. Though Mr. Netanyahu’s wife, Sara, was “very involved in the demands” of Walla, there was insufficient evidence that she knew what official action was being provided in return, so she should not face charges. The state attorney believed Mrs. Netanyahu should also face bribery charges.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Cost of Telling a #MeToo Story in Australia,"Why Yael Stone is terrified to talk about Geoffrey Rush. Ms. Weiss is a writer and editor for the Opinion section. Yael Stone is scared. We are in New York City, at a ramen place near her apartment in Astoria, Queens, and Ms. Stone, who stars in “Orange Is the New Black,” has barely touched her soup. She tells me she hasn’t been sleeping for the better part of a year. It’s not just her 6-month-old baby who’s keeping her up, but her decision to come forward for the first time and speak to me about her experiences with Geoffrey Rush, one of the most powerful actors in her native Australia. Most women who go public with #MeToo stories are fearful for obvious reasons. There is the pain of reliving traumatic experiences. There is the rage of not being believed. And there is sometimes the discomfort of admitting, as Ms. Stone readily does, that she didn’t say “no” and at times even encouraged some of his behavior. She did so, she says, out of fear of offending a mentor and friend. But Ms. Stone isn’t just afraid of the emotional consequences of talking about her allegations against Mr. Rush, her onetime hero, including that he danced naked in front of her in their dressing room, used a mirror to watch her while she showered and sent her occasionally erotic text messages while she was 25 years old and starring opposite Mr. Rush, then 59, on stage in “The Diary of a Madman” in 2010 and 2011. She is worried that Australia’s defamation laws will drag her into a legal and financial quagmire. In the United States, the legal burden is on the person who claims to have been defamed: He or she must prove that the allegations are false. In Australia, in the area of libel law, it’s the opposite. The burden is on the publisher to prove that the allegations against the plaintiff are true. In addition, public figures who sue for libel in the United States must prove that the publisher acted with reckless disregard of the truth, even if the statements prove false. Mr. Rush said in a statement that Ms. Stone’s allegations “are incorrect and in some instances have been taken completely out of context.” But, he added, “clearly Yael has been upset on occasion by the spirited enthusiasm I generally bring to my work. I sincerely and deeply regret if I have caused her any distress. This, most certainly, has never been my intention.” Geoffrey Rush responds to Yael Stone’s allegations. “I know I have truth on my side,” Ms. Stone told me during a phone call last week. And yet, “you can see in all of my communications with you that there’s an element of terror.” The same power dynamics present in #MeToo stories, she said, “are reflected in a legal system that favors the person with a good deal more money and a good deal more influence and power.” Australia’s defamation laws help explain why the #MeToo movement, while managing to take down some of the most powerful men in the entertainment and media industry in the United States, has not taken off there. “Australia is the only Western democracy without an explicit constitutional protection for freedom of speech,” Matt Collins, a defamation lawyer and the president of the Victorian Bar, told me. “People say that Sydney is the libel capital of the world,” he added. The upshot: Not only is it easier for a plaintiff to win a defamation suit in Australia, but people are far less likely to blow the whistle on misconduct, knowing what the legal (and therefore financial) consequences might be. Indeed, if a law firm had not volunteered to represent Ms. Stone pro bono, she said, there is no way she would have been able to come forward. But that financial support goes only so far. Crucially, if the actress is sued and loses, she will be personally responsible for the damages. That Ms. Stone is willing to take such a risk indicates how strongly she feels about the matter. “I think the fact that she’s speaking about this now is incredibly courageous,” said Brenna Hobson, who was the general manager of the company that produced “Diary of a Madman” and has known Mr. Rush for more than two decades. “The use of defamation cases against women with sexual harassment complaints is having a huge chilling effect,” said Kate Jenkins, the Australian government’s sex discrimination commissioner. “Women I speak to all over the country are absolutely adamant that they cannot complain because it risks absolutely everything for them.” An Australian filmmaker named Sophie Mathisen put it more bluntly: “The question in our current context is not, Do you want to come forward and speak on behalf of other women? The question is, Do you want to come forward and set yourself on fire publicly?” For the past year in Australia, the particular woman on fire has been an actress named Eryn Jean Norvill — someone who never wanted to come forward at all. In late 2017, two front-page articles in The Daily Telegraph reported on Geoffrey Rush’s “inappropriate behavior” during a 2015-16 production of “King Lear” by the Sydney Theater Company. The paper, which memorably dubbed Mr. Rush “King Leer,” didn’t name the young actress who claimed he had harassed her. Mr. Rush adamantly denied the allegation and accused the paper of making “false, pejorative and demeaning claims.” He sued the publisher, Rupert Murdoch’s Nationwide News, and the articles were removed from the paper’s website. When Nationwide News submitted its defense, it identified the actress as Ms. Norvill, who played Cordelia opposite Mr. Rush, and her name became a matter of public record. And so for the past several months, Ms. Norvill has been in the headlines as a leading witness in the case, despite the fact that she had complained to the theater company about Mr. Rush’s behavior informally and confidentially. “What mattered to The Daily Telegraph here was their front page. She didn’t matter,” David Marr, a journalist for The Guardian, told me. Still, we have learned much from Ms. Norvill’s testimony. She said that she felt variously “trapped,” “frightened,” “shocked” and “confused” during the play’s run. She claimed Mr. Rush “deliberately” touched her breast onstage, sent her suggestive text messages, called her “yummy” and more. “I was at the bottom of the rung in terms of hierarchy and Geoffrey was definitely at the top,” she told the court. “I wanted to be a part of his world and we were also playing father and daughter. I felt as though if I was to speak or reprimand his behavior, I would jeopardize the relationship, that tenderness, the closeness that is needed in those two roles.” “I had the least power,” she said. “What was I supposed to do?” For most Americans, Geoffrey Rush is the guy who teaches Colin Firth not to stutter in “The King’s Speech.” In Australia, he is a theater-industry kingpin, capable of making a career. He was long the president of the Australian equivalent of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and he was named Australian of the Year in 2012. Yael Stone worshiped him. She said, “He has managed to draw a long bow between his training at Lecoq as a clown all the way through to understanding the internal workings of someone like David Helfgott, for which he won the Academy Award for ‘Shine.’” Even now, she calls him a “national treasure.” In 2010, Ms. Stone was offered the role of a lifetime: to play opposite Mr. Rush in “The Diary of a Madman,” to run first in Sydney and then at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York. “It was the biggest break I had ever had,” she said. “This wasn’t a steppingstone. It was a leap across the river.” But things were “weird” from the start of their intensive two-week rehearsal process. Ms. Stone confided in a number of family members and friends who were close to her at the time, and several of them told me in interviews that they remembered many details of her account. Three people who worked on the play also confirmed many aspects of her story. First there were the texts. They were both affectionate and flirtatious, flowery and yet occasionally vulgar, and would come until the wee hours of the night. Ms. Stone showed a number to me but asked me not to quote from them. Part of her discomfort is probably because, as she put it, she “enthusiastically and willingly” bantered back. “I was so flattered that someone like that would spend their time texting me into the very early hours of the morning,” she said. “Gradually the text messages became more sexual in nature, but always encased in this very highfalutin intellectual language.” “I’m embarrassed by the ways I participated,” Ms. Stone told me. “I certainly wouldn’t engage as the person I am now in the way I did when I was 25.” It wasn’t just the texts. There were, she says, “strange intimacies in the dressing room.” Sometimes he would ask her to remove his contact lenses, say, or take off his sweaty costume at intermission. When she would sleep between matinee and evening performances in the cramped space underneath their makeup desks he would join her uninvited. Then there was the day he held a mirror above her shower. The shared dressing room had two shower cubicles next to each other. After the show one evening, Ms. Stone said, “I remember I looked up to see there was a small shaving mirror over the top of the partition between the showers and he was using it to look down at my naked body. I believe that it was meant with a playful intention, but the effect was that I felt there was nowhere for me to feel safe and unobserved.” “I saw it,” another person who worked on the play and asked to remain anonymous told me about the mirror incident. “It was very close quarters and I had a direct view of the showers. After the show that night, I heard Yael scream and tell him to stop.” “I certainly talked about it with Yael afterward. It was one instance of her feeling psychologically and physically intimidated by him,” the person said. Ms. Stone herself does not remember screaming. Indeed, she laughed at the idea that she would have risked upsetting Mr. Rush in any way. “I said some words to the effect of, ‘Bugger off, Geoffrey.’ I was walking a very delicate line where I needed to manage these uncomfortable moments but never, never offend him.” “There was no part of my brain considering speaking to anyone in any official capacity. This was a huge star,” she said. “What were they going to do? Fire Geoffrey and keep me?” Ms. Hobson, the general manager, said the play’s director, Neil Armfield, knew that something had transpired. “What I did know at the time was that Neil Armfield had spoken to Geoffrey about not walking in on Yael in the shower,” she told me from Scotland. Mr. Armfield says he knew nothing of that particular incident, but wrote in a response to me, “I was aware that Yael had felt some discomfort in sharing the dressing room with Geoffrey. I offered that Yael should move to another dressing room but my memory is that she declined.” A similar dynamic played out, Ms. Stone said, when Mr. Rush danced before her in a “playful, clownish manner” while he was “totally naked” one evening while she was removing her makeup. She found a way to respond with “an attitude of, ‘Oh, you’re a very naughty boy.’” “I didn’t want him to think I was no fun, that I was one of those people who couldn’t take a joke,” Ms. Stone said. A person who witnessed the incident recalled, as Ms. Stone did, that it straddled a familiar line. “It was, I suppose, again that line between comical and obscene,” the person said. When, later, at an awards show connected to the play Mr. Rush touched Ms. Stone’s back “in a very sensual manner” that was “unwanted and sustained” — a significant enough violation that he wrote to her and apologized the next day, calling it “uncalled-for but had to” — she made nothing of it. In a year of Hollywood horror stories, Ms. Stone’s experience does not rank among the worst. But it took its toll. “My level of anxiety was very high,” she said. She told the man she was dating at the time that she was scared to go out with Mr. Rush after the show “because I was nervous about what was expected of me.” Others noticed Ms. Stone’s anxiety. “The play for me was tainted with a certain discomfort because of the dynamic between Geoffrey and Yael — not knowing what exactly was going on or how to respond,” said another person who worked on the show and asked not to be named. Ms. Stone has been keeping a diary since she was 12, and her entries from the time confirm her memories. On Jan. 21, 2011, she wrote of a “new friend who fascinates and delights me (with equal parts revulsion and horror).” By February, she had written, “I’ve never hated acting so much.” Last month, nearly a year since Mr. Rush filed suit against Nationwide News, the court finished hearing arguments in the defamation case. The judge is supposed to deliver his decision in the new year. Back when the case began, Ms. Stone said she “swore I would never come forward. My intention was to keep it private.” Instead of going public, Ms. Stone wrote the actor an email on December 11, 2017. Subject line: “Challenging times.” The email is self-aware and generous. “I’m sure that this moment is extremely challenging and my thoughts these last few weeks have come to you many times. I hope you are ok. I worry about you, about Jane and the kids,” it begins, and then goes on to tell him that she was made uncomfortable by him during the play. “In the name of years of friendship I wanted to share with you what I have always been afraid to say,” she wrote. “I hope it’s possible for you to receive this in the spirit that it is meant. With a view toward healing.” She never heard back. Now, she said, “I feel a responsibility to speak, but I know it will cost me friendships.” She hates the idea of hurting a mentor, someone who even helped her get a visa to work in the United States by writing a letter on her behalf. “If Geoffrey had written back and said I’m sorry and offered to work with me to inspire positive change in our industry, it may have transformed both of our lives for the better,” she said. “I despair that I am now in this situation.” And yet, Ms. Stone adds, “I do believe it’s a matter of significance to the public.” “I also understand it might be confusing and look strange that I maintained a friendship with someone for so long who treated me in a way that made me feel uncomfortable. But there is the reality of professional influence and the reality of a complicated friendship, which ultimately was corroded by a sexual dynamic. But it was still a friendship.” Ms. Stone remains sympathetic to Mr. Rush, in a way. “The current system is built around the very famous and talented such that there is a lot of yes. There is not a lot of no. And that can encourage certain behaviors and that can happen incrementally over time to the point where a person may have not heard the word no in a long time. And it might not be their fault,” she said. “We need compassion for that confusion.” Again and again, she returned in our conversations to the themes of compassion and change. “The possibility of redemption must always be on the table,” she said. “Not all #MeToo stories are the same. Each dynamic is different. For some, a criminal process is essential. In my case, I’m not interested in punishment. I am looking to change my industry and to work toward healing and growth.” That healing, however, is only possible when the truth is recognized — when inappropriate behavior is not waved away because the rehearsal room is somehow unique as a “place of play and experiment,” as the director, Mr. Armfield, said on Australia’s “Q and A” television program in October. Some things are straightforward. “I’ve been in that particular dressing room in Sydney on many occasions with many wonderfully talented actors and many wonderfully talented clowns,” Ms. Stone told me. “And people have made me belly laugh till I couldn’t breathe. Never once has someone needed to show me their penis to do that.” Want more Australia coverage and discussion?

2018,Opinion | The Cowardly Face of Authoritarianism,"Turning Points Turning Point: China removes presidential term limits. First we see the face. The face of America’s Donald Trump, or Hungary’s Viktor Orban, or Russia’s Vladimir Putin, or Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the face of men who wish to transform democracies into personality cults. The face is the oldest mark of leadership, the mark that works for clan or tribe. If we see only the face, we are not thinking about policies or politics; instead, we are accepting the new regime and its rules. However, a democracy is about the people, not a single mythicized person. People need truth, which a cult of personality destroys. Theories of democracy, from the ancient Greeks through the Enlightenment to today, take for granted that the world around us yields to understanding. We pursue the facts alongside our fellow citizens. But in a cult of personality, truth is replaced by belief, and we believe what the leader wishes us to believe. The face replaces the mind. The transition from democracy to personality cult begins with a leader who is willing to lie all the time, in order to discredit the truth as such. The transition is complete when people can no longer distinguish between truth and feeling. The cult of personality functions the same everywhere; it rests on the inaccurate notion that the face somehow represents the nation. Cults of personality make us feel rather than think. In particular, they make us feel that the first question of politics is “Who are we, and who are they?” rather than “What is the world like, and what can we do about it?” Once we accept that politics is about “us and them,” we feel like we know who “we” are, since we feel that we know who “they” are. In fact, we know nothing, since we have accepted fear and anxiety — animal emotions — as the basis of politics. We have been played. The authoritarians of today tell medium-size lies. These refer only superficially to experiences; they draw us deep into a cave of emotion. If we believe that Barack Obama is a Muslim born in Africa (an American lie with Russian support), or that Hillary Clinton is a pedophile pimp (a Russian lie with American support), we are not actually thinking; we are giving way to sexual and physical fear. These medium-size lies are not quite the big lies of the totalitarians, although Mr. Orban’s attacks on George Soros as the leader of a Jewish conspiracy come rather close. They are, however, big enough that they help to disable the factual world. Once we accept these lies, we open ourselves up to believing a whole raft of other untruths, or at least suspect that there are other, vaster conspiracies. The face of the leader becomes, as a result, a flag, an arbitrary marker of “us” and “them.” The internet and social media are helping us to see politics in this binary way. We imagine that we make choices as we sit in front of our computers, but the choices are, in fact, framed for us by algorithms that learn what will keep us online. Our online activity teaches machines that the most effective stimuli are negative: fear and anxiety. As social media becomes political instruction, we prime ourselves for politicians who reproduce the same binary: What makes us afraid and what makes us feel secure? Who are they and who are we? A cult of personality used to require monuments; now it requires memes. Social media consumes the public imagination like the giant statues of tyrants from former times consumed public space. But as those monuments remind us, tyrants always die. The empty heterosexual posturing, the shirtless photo ops, the misogyny and indifference to the female experience, the anti-gay campaigns, are designed to hide one basic fact: A cult of personality is sterile. It cannot reproduce itself. The cult of personality is the worship of something temporary. It is thus confusion and, at bottom, cowardice: The leader cannot contemplate the fact that he will die and be replaced, and citizens abet the illusion by forgetting that they share responsibility for the future. The cult of personality blunts the ability to keep a country going. When we accept a cult of personality, we are not only yielding our right to choose leaders but also dulling the skills and weakening the institutions that would allow us to do so in the future. As we move away from democracy, we forget its purpose: to give us all a future. A cult of personality says that one person is always right; so after his death comes chaos. Democracy says that we all make mistakes, but that we get a chance, every so often, to correct ourselves. Democracy is the courageous way to have a country. A cult of personality is a cowardly way of destroying one. OpinionAlisa Ganieva OpinionRoger Cohen",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Dangers of Calling ‘Mission Accomplished’ in Syria,"The Islamic State has been degraded, but not defeated. Despite what President Trump said, our mission is not complete. Mr. Geltzer and Mr. Costa served as senior directors for counterterrorism under President Trump and President Obama. The United States is at risk of another “Mission Accomplished” moment. On Wednesday, President Trump declared by tweet, “We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump presidency.” President Trump is right that the United States has made tremendous progress against the Islamic State, and we’ve been honored to support that mission from the White House across two administrations as senior counterterrorism officials. But the Islamic State has not been “defeated” — and our mission in Syria has not been fully accomplished. The recent Christmas market terrorist attack in Strasbourg, France, that left five dead and at least a dozen injured serves as an all-too-vivid reminder that the threat posed by the Islamic State persists. With the attacker dead, the Islamic State has now claimed the attack as its own. Thankfully, these types of jihadist terrorist attacks in the West have become notably rarer and smaller in scale than they were even just three years ago, when horrific attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., cast a pall over the 2015 holiday season. There’s been remarkable progress against the Islamic State in those three years, but perhaps the hardest part is yet to come: addressing the remnants of the group’s core in Iraq and Syria. Indeed, for all of the counterterrorism successes the United States has achieved since Sept. 11 — and there have been many — we’ve yet to figure out fully how to turn the corner from degrading groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State to actually defeating them. Failing to do so can prove deadly: It was, after all, the seemingly dying embers of Al Qaeda in Iraq that rose from the ashes to become the Islamic State and control a territory the size of Britain. Ultimately, it’s vital to remember that groups like the Islamic State and Al Qaeda think of themselves as sublime movements, and thus their ideologues are convinced that they went to war to fulfill divine obligations, making setbacks merely temporary — with remnants sure to carry on the fight. So, as we look to 2019, it’s important to stay focused on landing a body blow against the Islamic State’s remnants in Iraq and Syria. That includes eradicating the last vestiges of the group’s network of fighters, supporting resurgent governance in the areas the group once held, developing sustainable intelligence sources and law enforcement options for the group’s terrorist network, and increasing the pressure against the group in what remains a virtual safe haven: the internet. Defeating the Islamic State, at least in Iraq and Syria, begins with eradicating the group’s remaining fighters. (Its fighters elsewhere, such as in Libya and West Africa, will pose a considerable challenge for the foreseeable future, even as important American counterterrorism efforts against them continue.) Finding and targeting the Islamic State’s fighters is a considerable challenge, as they’ve largely been driven into an area of Syria where United States intelligence collection may have fewer inroads, where our main partners on the ground — the Syrian Kurds — have chosen not to follow, and where some local refuge may be available. The areas successfully cleared of the Islamic State demand continued attention, too. It’s the absence and inadequacies of local governance that often allow terrorists to carve out a foothold in the first place; and the deadly civil war consuming Syria threatens to leave large swaths of the country effectively ungoverned. Working with international partners to provide the resources, training and diplomatic support needed for at least a bare minimum of governance to take root — a Sunni alternative to the horrific brand of governance offered by the Islamic State — is an urgent priority not just for counterterrorism but also for humanitarian reasons. And cutting such resources at this juncture is a dangerous recipe for a resurgent terrorist threat that plays into the Islamic State’s own narratives that only it is capable of governing, as the group indeed tried to do for a time. The Islamic State has already adapted to its shrinking territorial control by putting in place an underground network that, from the shadows, can inflict destabilizing violence in Syria and Iraq, and potentially throughout the region. This is the same retreat from terrorist insurgency to terrorist network that we saw from Al Qaeda in Iraq; and it demands building U.S., Iraqi, and other partners’ intelligence capabilities to penetrate this network by disrupting its attacks, seizing funds, and detaining those sustaining the network. Even with diminished territorial holdings, the Islamic State will still be able to radicalize and mobilize followers so long as the group retains a virtual safe haven online. Leading technology companies have stepped up their efforts to contest terrorists’ presence on their platforms, but terrorist groups have adapted, altering their content and regenerating accounts in ways that challenge the companies’ approaches and that connect with would-be followers just long enough to shift those followers into end-to-end encrypted chats to avoid detection. The United States must lead the way by sharing, to the maximum extent classification permits, the latest information on terrorist trends and tactics online with companies so they can use new and emerging tools to contest terrorists’ online foothold. Stripping the Islamic State of territory and even fighters is not the same as achieving the group’s defeat. Forced from one redoubt, it will reappear in other territories, potentially even in less detectable — but more lethal — forms. It’s not the time to end the mission, lest we soon find ourselves facing a resurgent adversary. Joshua A. Geltzer, the executive director and visiting professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection and a fellow at New America, was the senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council from 2015 to 2017. Christopher P. Costa, the executive director of the International Spy Museum and a former career intelligence officer, was special assistant to the president and senior director for counterterrorism at council from 2017 to 2018.

2018,Opinion | The Dangers of Doing Favors for Donald Trump ,"The president is often unable or unwilling to spot the difference between a favor and a crooked scheme. Mr. Hettena is the author of “Trump/Russia: A Definitive History.” The other day, a White House reporter asked the president if Michael Cohen was, as President Trump put it, “a weak person and not a very smart person,” then why had he hired him? “Because a long time ago, he did me a favor,” Mr. Trump replied. Mr. Trump didn’t say what the favor entailed, but a pair of Mr. Cohen’s sentencing memos released by federal prosecutors late last week reveal that the door to Mr. Trump’s office opened in 2007. The condo board at Trump World Tower in Manhattan, where Mr. Cohen lived, tried to remove the Trump name from the building. Mr. Cohen intervened, got the entire board thrown out, and was soon earning a $500,000 salary at Trump Tower. One of the keys to success in Mr. Trump’s life has been collecting deposits in a bank of favors. “Do me a favor” is one of his favorite lines, with the promise of good things to follow. For some, the good things never materialize. But failure to play this game can land you a spot on Mr. Trump’s enemies list. For example, Mr. Trump nursed a long-held grudge against Mario Cuomo, because the former New York governor failed to grant him an unspecified “perfectly legal and appropriate favor.” The problem for Mr. Trump is that he is unable or unwilling to spot the difference between a favor and a crooked scheme. And that goes a long way toward explaining why he has surrounded himself with people in trouble with the law and why his presidency is in the grip of intensifying federal investigations. Mr. Cohen knew Mr. Trump liked favors: Before he walked through the door at Trump Tower, he had already done his future boss another favor. Mr. Cohen, his family and a former business partner invested more than $17 million in Trump properties in the 2000s. Back then, when Mr. Cohen and his money were assets to be courted, Mr. Trump took a more sanguine view of him. “Michael Cohen has a great insight into the real-estate market,” Mr. Trump told The New York Post, adding, “in short, he’s a very smart person.” Two former federal officials told me (though Mr. Cohen denied this) that information they collected from Russian sources indicated that Mr. Cohen had been hired by Mr. Trump as a favor to Mr. Cohen’s father-in-law, Fima Shusterman, a Ukrainian émigré who has a 1993 conviction for a crime related to money laundering. Mr. Shusterman, who owned at least four New York taxi companies, set his son-in-law up in the yellow cab business. In the Southern District sentencing memo, prosecutors said that Mr. Cohen turned that into a very lucrative business. It’s telling that prosecutors in Manhattan did not sign a cooperation agreement with Mr. Cohen in part because he specifically refused to answer questions about past criminal conduct. President Trump himself made a cryptic reference to Mr. Shusterman’s ties to unknown sources of wealth when he wrote on Twitter, after Mr. Cohen’s guilty plea to charges of lying to Congress, that his former lawyer “makes up stories to get a great and already reduced deal for himself, and get his wife and father-in-law (who has the money?) off Scott Free.” Russians have long been doing favors for Mr. Trump. In the 1980s, a Russian criminal named David Bogatin bought five Trump Tower apartments with $6 million in laundered funds. In the 1990s, the Russian Mafia favored the Atlantic City Taj Mahal, in part, because of the casino’s lax money laundering controls. The Trump SoHo in Lower Manhattan, unveiled in 2006 on Mr. Trump’s reality TV show, “The Apprentice,” was reportedly developed with the help of an alleged gangster from the former Soviet Union. Another favor, one involving Russia, is what landed Mr. Cohen at the center of Robert Mueller’s investigation. As Mr. Cohen knew, Mr. Trump had long sought — going back to the mid-1980s — to put his name on a building in Moscow. It’s no coincidence that the deal for Trump’s long-denied Moscow tower started to come together after he announced his run for the White House. Mr. Mueller’s sentencing memorandum notes that in November 2015, Mr. Cohen was approached by a Russian who claimed to be a “trusted person” who offered the campaign “political synergy” with Russia and repeatedly proposed a meeting between Mr. Trump and Vladimir Putin. Such a meeting, Mr. Cohen was told, would have a “phenomenal” impact “not only in political but in a business dimension as well.” Mr. Cohen passed because he was working with his old friend — and a business associate of Mr. Trump’s — Felix Sater, a Russian immigrant and convicted felon (he pleaded guilty in a stock-manipulation scheme) with deep ties to Russia. The two old friends sought to put together a deal for a Moscow tower that would reportedly have included a $50 million penthouse set aside for Russia’s president. The involvement of Russian government officials in the project suggests the Kremlin had a notion that the tower was the shiny bauble that Russia could use to draw Mr. Trump into a compromising position. Mr. Putin, a former K.G.B. lieutenant colonel skilled in the art of manipulation, certainly seems to understand that Mr. Trump’s world runs on favors. After all, the Russian president did Mr. Trump the biggest favor of them all. Mr. Putin turned his intelligence services into a virtual extension of the Trump campaign, hacking emails out of the Democratic Party’s computer networks. That, together with the finely tuned, voluminous social messaging pumped out by internet trolls in St. Petersburg, Russia, may have tipped the scales in a close election. President Trump, too, has done Mr. Putin many favors. He has questioned the value of the NATO alliance. He has hardly uttered a word critical of Mr. Putin. His administration has repeatedly delayed the imposition of tough sanctions on the aluminum tycoon Oleg Deripaska, as it did again last week. Most important, Mr. Trump has done nothing to stop Russia from wreaking havoc on American elections, as members of his own administration have made clear in recent days. This gets to the very heart of Mr. Mueller’s investigation. What else is collusion but an exchange of favors? The question is whether this exchange of favors involves more than Mr. Trump’s natural inclination toward the authoritarian Russian ruler. By providing what prosecutors described as useful information on Russia-related matters he learned from Trump Organization executives, Mr. Cohen, a man who once said he would take a bullet for Mr. Trump, is turning favors into betrayal to help investigators understand exactly what his boss promised Russia in return.

2018,Opinion | The Deadly Soul of a New Machine,"Bots, artificial intelligence and social media algorithms are shaping the fate of humanity at a startling pace. At what point is control lost and the creations take over? How about now? Contributing Opinion Writer Try to imagine the last 11 minutes of Lion Air Flight 610 in October. The plane is a new machine, Boeing’s sleek and intelligent 737 Max 8, fitted with an advanced electronic brain. After takeoff, this cyberpilot senses that something is wrong with the angle of ascent and starts to force the jetliner down. A tug of war follows between men and computer, at 450 miles an hour — the human pilots trying to right the downward plunge, the automatic pilot taking it back from them. The bot wins. The jetliner crashes into the Java Sea. All 189 onboard are killed. And here’s the most agonizing part: The killer was supposed to save lives. It was a smart computer designed to protect a gravity-defiance machine from error. It lacks judgment and intuition, precisely because those human traits can sometimes be fatal in guiding an aerodynamic tube through the sky. We still don’t know the exact reason the pilots of that fatal flight couldn’t disable the smart system and return to manual control. It looks as if the sensors were off, instigating the downward spiral. A report by the Federal Aviation Administration in 2013 found that 60 percent of accidents over a decade were linked to confusion between pilots and automated systems. But it’s not too much of a reach to see Flight 610 as representative of the hinge in history we’ve arrived at — with the bots, the artificial intelligence and the social media algorithms now shaping the fate of humanity at a startling pace. Like the correction system in the 737, these inventions are designed to make life easier and safer — or at least more profitable for the owners. And they do, for the most part. The overall idea is to outsource certain human functions, the drudgery and things prone to faulty judgment, while retaining master control. The question is: At what point is control lost and the creations take over? How about now? It was exactly 200 years ago that Mary Shelley published a story of a monster who is still very much with us. Her book “Frankenstein” is about the consequences of man playing God. You can see permutations of the monster, a not-unsympathetic patchwork of human parts, in characters like Dolores, the host who rebels in the television series “Westworld.” Shelley’s concerns were raised at the peak of the Industrial Revolution, when the Western world was transformed from sleepy agricultural societies into a frenetic age of factories, machines and overcrowded cities. All the helpful inventions also produced mass dislocation, life-killing pollution, child labor and — as per the invention of the cotton gin in the American South — an expansion of human enslavement. Today we are close to creating a human brain inside a computer — an entirely new species. In his book “Sapiens,” Yuval Noah Harari takes us through a mostly upbeat tour of humanity since the cognitive revolution of 70,000 years ago. At the end of the book — our time — he warns about the new being, the cyborg now taking shape in a lab near you. The C.E.O. of Microsoft, Satya Nadella, hit a similar cautionary note at the company’s recent annual shareholder meeting. Big Tech, he said, should be asking “not what computers can do, but what they should do.” It’s the “can do” part that should scare you. Facebook, once all puppies, baby pictures and high school reunion updates, is a monster of misinformation. And Facebook’s creator is more clueless than Dr. Frankenstein about the dangers of what he has unleashed on the world. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s C.E.O., has glibly assured us that building advanced artificial intelligence systems will root out the hate speech, lies and propaganda passed among the two billion active users of Facebook. But fake news — whether gossip shared by family members or the toxic kind spread by Russians in basements — is the mother’s milk of Facebook. The A.I. may only make it easier for mass manipulation. In that sense, Facebook is headed for its own crash into the sea. Driverless cars will soon be available for ride-sharing in the United States. If they can reduce the carnage on the roads — more than 70 million people killed and four billion injured worldwide since the dawn of the auto age — this will be a good thing. Except that this year a bot-car killed a woman in a crosswalk in Arizona, and others have been slower than humans to react. There shouldn’t be any rush — except from the profit drivers at the ride-sharing companies — to hand over the steering wheel to a driver without a heartbeat. It’s not Luddite to see the be-careful-what-you-wish-for lesson from Mary Shelley’s era to our own, at the cusp of an age of technological totalitarianism. Nor is it Luddite to ask for more screening, more ethical considerations, more projections of what can go wrong, as we surrender judgment, reason and oversight to our soulless creations. As haunting as those final moments inside the cockpit of Flight 610 were, it’s equally haunting to grasp the full meaning of what happened: The system overrode the humans and killed everyone.

2018,The Defiance of Mariah’s Lambs,"Mariah Carey means Christmas to most of us, and much more to some of us. It’s that time of year again: The lights are strung, the pines are dying indoors under the weight of shiny balls, the Starbucks mint mocha is flowing, and Mariah Carey is on heavy rotation. No matter what is happening in her career — the tribulations, the tours, the headline-grabbing performance mishaps — Ms. Carey is wildly relevant for at least one of every 12 months, thanks to the enduring popularity of her holiday recordings, particularly “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” which will be celebrating its 25th anniversary in 2019. There are, of course, plenty of die-hard fans for whom Ms. Carey is not merely an end-of-year highlight but a singer-songwriter for all seasons. This year, Ms. Carey debuted a new Las Vegas revue, and, to celebrate, a group of 36 “lambs,” mostly in their 30s and 40s, boarded a party bus and cruised the Vegas strip for about three hours. On it, they loudly sang selections from Ms. Carey’s catalog. Many were deep cuts. They call themselves “lambs” after the schticky term of endearment Ms. Carey used liberally in the early 2000s, including in voice messages she used to leave for her fans on her website. The flock on this particular evening was racially diverse and split fairly evenly by gender, united in difference by an unyielding interest in Ms. Carey, through all the states of her career. The party was what's known as a “Lambover Event,” a gathering of super fans first organized by Nick Fletcher, 34, and Sam Mirza, 37, after Ms. Carey’s 2014 Christmas shows at New York’s Beacon Theater. These events exist as a kind multi-city support group for enthusiasts of Ms. Carey, Mr. Fletcher said. He called the gatherings “reparative.” Claire Luke, a 30-year-old who has worked as a consultant for the World Bank, similarly described Ms. Carey’s work as “the business of saving lives.” Ms. Luke rewarded the diva’s work handsomely in return by purchasing multiple tickets close to the stage for three July performances of Ms. Carey’s residency, called “The Butterfly Returns” (it returns in February). Ms. Luke estimated that she has seen Ms. Carey 30 to 40 times in concert and has spent a cumulative $60,000 in tickets and merchandise. Fans like Ms. Luke routinely pay $1,000 for a brief encounter and photo opportunity with Ms. Carey after her concerts. It does add up. Ms. Carey’s devoted followers take her artistry very seriously. Sometimes they demand others do, too — it was the fan-organized hashtag #JusticeForGlitter that, in November, briefly catapulted the soundtrack to the notorious 2001 flop “Glitter” to No. 1 on the iTunes Top Albums chart a mere 17 years late. A similar plan has circulated to propel Ms. Carey’s perennial earworm “All I Want for Christmas Is You” to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart this year. (It would be her 19th song to reach the summit, and as of press time, it had hit No. 6.) It’s easy to rhapsodize about Ms. Carey’s most recognizable musical trait, that honey-coated voice, capable of contours that previously did not seem humanly possible. But in conversations with more than a dozen self-identified lambs, it was her songwriting that was most consistently cited as her defining feature. Few other divas of virtuosic voice and glamorous affect have been so involved in the writing of their own music — a point that Ms. Carey has made many times herself since releasing her self-titled debut in 1990. She has been credited for writing or co-writing every original song she has sung, which together represent an idiosyncratic contemporary R&B catalog unwavering in its commitment to the singer’s proclivity for five-cent words (“unclouded,” “incandescent” and “nonchalant” among them). Her vast body of work covers virtually every thinkable micro-facet of love’s trajectory, from preliminary crushes to euphoric beginnings to sexual bliss to the despondency of finality. And then there is her consistent theme of the importance of prevailing — the songs about making it through the rain, of learning that a hero lies in you. The inspirational nature of her message positions her as a shepherd for her lambs. “The artist is living the lyric,” said Mr. Fletcher, referencing the aspects of Ms. Carey’s biography — her biracial identity, fraught upbringing, high-profile couplings and splits, and unhappy marriage to Tommy Mottola, the boss of her first label, Columbia, whom she married in 1993 and separated from in 1997 — that are reflected in her work. “She wrote ‘Make It Happen,’ and she makes it happen,” Mr. Fletcher said. The lambs’ investment in the arc of Ms. Carey’s life and art echoes that of the fandoms surrounding her ’90s contemporaries who are regarded as “confessional” women singer-songwriters, like Tori Amos and Ani DiFranco. But because of the genre in which Ms. Carey works, and perhaps because she wields her divadom by mostly just standing onstage without an instrument in her hand, she is rarely grouped with them. “In today’s world, it’s kind of cool to hate on Mariah Carey,” said Sam Alvarez, an 18-year-old student in the U.K. who has uploaded to YouTube more than 1,600 thematically organized clip compilations of Ms. Carey in concert and interviews since 2014. “I hope with my videos that a lot of people can be introduced to how much of a great artist she is.” Not everyone thinks it’s cool to hate on Ms. Carey — her spare and subdued 15th full-length studio album, “Caution,” received some of the most ecstatic raves of her career upon its November release. But her newfound status as a critic’s darling hasn’t translated into record sales — “Caution” yielded no hits on the Billboard Hot 100. In the album’s third week on the Billboard 200, it was down to No. 163. At the same time, her 24-year-old holiday album, “Merry Christmas” was at No. 15. Often, it seems Ms. Carey’s flubs are more scrutinized in the press than her music. Two narratives about her have dominated coverage in recent years. One is that she’s losing her voice, or has lost it, or is hiding the loss of it. The other is that she’s a hot mess. For instance, the opening night of “The Butterfly Returns” lasted for almost two hours and spanned 25 years of material. Over her live band, the singer’s voice fluttered like her butterfly mascot. She growled with a tenacity that would put her Jack Russell terrier to shame. But only a few seconds of the show were reported in the press, and those were gaffes. One occurred when a box she was sitting on tipped over and she reached down to steady herself with the hand she was using to hold her microphone. The music continued uninterrupted, betraying Ms. Carey’s momentary lip-syncing. The other flub occurred when Ms. Carey’s 7-year-old son, Moroccan Scott Cannon, briefly thrust a plastic bag over his head during an onstage cameo. Stories that seek to define Ms. Carey by her mistakes, not her gifts, harken back to those about her winded, strained live performance at the 2014 Rockefeller Center Christmas tree lighting (“Remember when Mariah Carey could sing? Most millennials probably can’t,” began Deadspin’s post, which netted almost 4 million clicks), or her sound issues-plagued nonperformance in Times Square on New Year’s Eve 2016, or her virtually inert choreography onstage to her hit “Honey” in 2017. “She is a prisoner of her own success,” said Jordan Miller, the owner and operator of BreatheHeavy.com, a pop music website focused on contemporary divas. “At the end of the day, her singing a flawless rendition of one of her songs isn’t going to attract as much traffic as, ‘Oh, Mariah Carey dropped the mic and you got to check this video out.’” While a mediocre night for Ms. Carey is better than what at least 99 percent of the world’s population can do at its best, the singer’s vocals have undeniably changed in recent years. Witnessing her miss notes can feel like watching the road give out from Wile E. Coyote as he chases the Roadrunner off a cliff. Ms. Carey has discussed her voice issues in the press, but rarely. (Her representatives declined several interview requests from The Times.) She has largely attributed whatever difficulties she has performing to growths on her vocal folds (she has said she’s had them all her life), in addition to the amount of rest she gets. “Deterioration is going to happen to all singers, particularly those who have a great deal of athleticism that they’re doing with their voices,” said Justin Stoney, the founder and president of the school New York Vocal Coaching. “What it appears to be is she is trying to still sing as though she were 23 years old.” Ms. Carey does not acknowledge her birthday, referring to it instead as her “anniversary.” Her exact age, per Wikipedia, is unknown because “sources differ” — she is either 48 or 49. “Every female singer goes through some changes hormonally in their voice that requires some attention in terms of learning how to adapt to it,” said Melissa Cross, a vocal coach in New York who is perhaps best known for the instructional DVD “The Zen of Screaming.” “The high notes don’t disappear, but they become thicker. You get more meat and less sauce.” “I think her talent is still 100 percent,” said Ms. Cross, who added that she thought other vocal coaches’ negative assessments in the press of Ms. Carey’s ability have been “absolutely shameful.” Her birthday is but one subject the generally tight-lipped Ms. Carey doesn’t tend to discuss in public. That made her revelation in People magazine earlier this year all the more surprising: She said she had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2001, the same year she had been hospitalized for what was either a breakdown or extreme exhaustion a few weeks before the release of “Glitter.” Ms. Carey told People that “for a long time” she had been “working and working and working” as a result of what she thought was severe insomnia. “It turns out that I was experiencing a form of mania,” she said. Ms. Carey also said she had just experienced the “hardest couple of years” she’d gone through. She has weathered a broken-off engagement to the billionaire James Packer, a little-watched, widely mocked reality show on E!, and the end of a close relationship with her manager, Stella Bulochnikov. After working together for nearly three years, Ms. Carey fired Ms. Bulochnikov in the fall of 2017. Ms. Bulochnikov, in turn, filed a lawsuit in April 2018 that listed sexual harassment among its allegations. Many stars would have spent a year in retreat after that. Instead, she is set to return to her Vegas residency in February, and will, as well, embark on a national tour to support “Caution.” Working for almost 30 years in the industry seems to have had little impact on her drive and work ethic. Ms. Carey has long played the unlikely champion. She is a complete and utter success, and yet an eternal underdog — even when she’s onstage. In 2018, she epitomizes what it is to be one’s own greatest competition. “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” then, is the perfect solution for this dilemma. It is past glory whose time has yet to pass, an endlessly returning reminder of her greatness — truly a gift that keeps on giving.",The New York Times
2018,The Delicious Diversity of Australian Christmas Cooking,"Australia Fare Our critic explores the reasons for eating steamed pudding and other cold-weather dishes during the sweltering summer. In the lead-up to Christmas 2012, while living in Los Angeles, I set my heart on plum pudding. For once, I was going to eat the hot steamed dessert in the winter (admittedly a warm winter), when it made sense, rather than in Australia’s sweltering summer. Australia has adopted plum pudding, like so many things, from the British — and frosty British Christmases are perfect for a hot dessert. Plum pudding, for the sadly uninitiated, is a delicious steamed caky pudding made with the least delicious-sounding collection of ingredients (and no plums): bread crumbs, raisins, candied citrus peel, beef fat. Traditional recipes have you mix all this together and hang it in a cloth for a month, and then steam it, soak it in booze and light it on fire. It’s fantastic, I promise! The greatest obstacle to making plum pudding in the United States is suet, a key ingredient. Suet — hard beef fat found around the animal’s kidneys — is not so easy to come by in Los Angeles, it turns out. Now that I’m back living in Australia, suet is easy to come by, but the idea of eating plum pudding in this heat seems insane. Australian holiday cooking is full of these kinds of contradictions: traditions borrowed from different climates, where the December feast is designed as respite from the long, cold winter. But Christmas here also includes wonderful divergences from conventional European cooking — some that acquiesce to our December heat, and some that spring from our diversity. Victor Liong, the chef and an owner of Lee Ho Fook in Melbourne, enjoys the variety of holiday parties one might experience over a few years in Australia. “I have celebrated with many different friends,” Mr. Liong wrote in an email. “The parties have ranged from lobster rolls and plum pudding with magnums of Champagne with my Polish business partner’s family, to a Sri Lankan and Indian curry buffet with a glazed ham as a centerpiece at my best friend’s mum’s house, to a Lebanese backyard shawarma barbecue party where we had Street’s Viennetta ice-cream cake for dessert and drank really old port.” Mr. Liong’s Chinese-Malaysian-Australian family has also adopted the British-Australian Boxing Day, the day-after-Christmas celebration when extended families get together. His family grills satays on that holiday: “Mum and my two sisters skewer chicken, lamb, beef, gizzards, livers and hearts and marinate them quite traditionally in a Malaysian-style satay spice, and the boys set up the charcoal and grill it,” Mr. Liong wrote. They prepare a late lunch, served with pressed rice, peanut sauce, chunks of cucumber and red onion. “It gets quite competitive: My brother, Arthur, is the reigning satay-eating champion.” Ben Shewry, the chef and owner of Attica, in Melbourne, said his own family traditions were typical of Australian Christmases in that “as with most mainstream things in this part of the world, they are both confusing (mostly from a climate perspective) and based on immigration.” There is ham and stuffing on Mr. Shewry’s Christmas table and, “like most Australian households, a lot of shellfish.” But the main attraction is lasagna, which became his family’s special-occasion meal not thanks to any Italian heritage but because his “Canadian grandmother loved Garfield,” the gluttonous comic-strip cat. In a reversal of my suet-in-L. A. problem, Palisa Anderson — an owner of Chat Thai, Boon Cafe in Sydney and Boon Luck Farm in Northern New South Wales — remembers trekking through the streets of snowy London, trying to find passion fruit for a Christmas Pavlova. Ms. Anderson lived in London, New York and Tokyo over the years, before returning to Sydney, and the one Australian Christmas institution she couldn’t relinquish was the summer Pavlova, a staple on many holiday tables. In Tokyo she discovered a delightful alternative to a seasonal tart summer fruit: yuzu. These days she grows yuzu on Boon Luck Farm, and it’s become a regular part of her Pavlova recipe. Ms. Anderson also recalls Australian family Christmases that had influences from all over the map. “My aunt’s Norwegian husband used to always bring the turkey that no one ever ate,” she said. “The next day my mother would use it for a stir-fry that her Chinese-Thai housekeeper used to make for her family growing up, with dark soy sauce and lots of ginger.” These days Boon Cafe is open on Christmas, serving its regular menu of fiery Thai food and one important addition. Brent Templeton, the restaurant’s pastry chef, is a New Zealander who married a Sri Lankan woman, and he makes a Sri Lankan version of Christmas fruit cake, which has a distinctive tropical note from the addition of pineapple. Another Australian carrying on antipodean customs in Los Angeles is the chef Curtis Stone. “Christmas is a big beach day in Oz,” Mr. Stone said. “We’ll start the day with our feet in the sand, and then get back to the house to feast. The first course is typically a grand spread of seafood, and I maintain that tradition whether I go back to Australia or stay in Los Angeles.” The cold seafood platter is common across the country for many families. There may be some Southern Italian influence there from the Christmas Eve Feast of the Seven Fishes, but the custom also undoubtedly stems from the weather and the fact that Christmas is often a beachy holiday for Australians. My recent Australian Christmases have been spent at the beach with my father and stepmother. There is a ham, and some sliced turkey breast, but the main attraction of the day is platters of chilled prawns and oysters, washed down with lots of very cold Champagne. Plum pudding? It’s been way too hot. This year, maybe a yuzu Pavlova. [64 Festive Recipes for an Australian Christmas] Do you have a suggestion for Besha Rodell?

2018,The Dementia Heist,"Ties We had to trick my mother into the memory care center. The doctors called it “therapeutic lying.” Hiding with my older sister in her S.U.V., I’m nauseated. We’re committing a heinous crime. Twenty feet away, I see a paramedic escort my silver-haired mother into the memory care center, a nursing home for patients with dementia and Alzheimer’s. We’ve tricked Mom into coming here because she’s not safe living alone. Moments before, we set up her room with photos and labeled her clothing. Nurses recommended we stay out of sight. I feel like the worst daughter. But according to doctors and social workers, we’re doing the most caring thing. Even as a child, my relationship with my mother was volatile. I constantly navigated her unpredictable emotions. To encourage positivity, I complimented her cooking, dressed like her mini-me, and parroted her disdain for our unassimilated Russian relatives. Good moods meant she’d share apple slices over a Doris Day movie, fry me blueberry blintzes, or help me fashion opera gloves from bubble bath while sitting next to me in the tub. Bad moods meant an endless cycle of slaps, me prostrating myself and her forgiving. I always knew that my mother had had a hard life. As a girl in Russia, she watched her father bleed out after Nazis bombed the local railway station. At 27, she fell from a train, shattering her kneecap and almost dying from gangrene. She’d dreamed of becoming a singer, but instead married my father, an old bachelor and “the only man who’d marry a cripple,” my grandma said. In 1964, they abandoned everything with little money to immigrate to the United States. Although I understood the source of my mother’s bitterness and inflexibility, our difficulties persisted. As an adult, I moved 1,700 miles away and visited annually to limit strife. Unlike my sister who understood that peace required diplomacy, I stood my ground, hoping it would yield my mother’s respect. On one visit, we saw “La La Land,” and I refused to agree with her that the film was boring. My mother threatened permanent silence, declaring that I was no longer her daughter. I countered by waiting weeks to call. I fantasized that someday we’d stop fighting and have a closer relationship, but then came the dementia. My sister, who lived nearby, kept me updated. First, my mother forgot the word “dog.” Then she got lost on the way home from the grocery store. There were hallucinations of flashing lights at 2 a.m. and strangers in her bedroom. Eventually Mom, a talented cook, stopped eating and dropped 20 pounds in a month. Her refrigerator was bare except for a wall of empty butter boxes she’d taped shut. Two doctors diagnosed dementia and recommended 24-hour care, which she rejected. She’d fallen several times, couldn’t write a check or drive. My sister silently drove her to physicians, paid bills, bought groceries and took the blame for my mother’s deteriorating mind. Then Mom called the police on her new caregiver, a gentle Polish woman who she claimed broke into her apartment. My sister worked hard to enable her to stay at home, but she was constantly getting demanding and confused phone calls from Mom during her workday. She couldn’t juggle my mother’s multiplying needs with her family. Our choices were to let her die alone from starvation or trick her into memory care. Days later, my sister and I toured memory care centers. One smelled of urine and industrial cleaner with wheelchair-bound, despondent seniors. At $100,000 a year, it was one of the nicer places. They sent us home with a pecan pie to seal the deal. We found a better facility with a B&B vibe and patient staff members who gave lots of hugs. My sister signed a 40-page contract making her liable if Mom injured another resident or destroyed property. We negotiated her level of care because bathing assistance bumped up the monthly price by $1,000. It felt like buying a car instead of caring for the woman who spoon-fed me chicken soup when I was sick. Next, we needed to get my mother into the center. We had her admitted to the hospital, blaming her high blood pressure. Then, we said the doctor wanted her to go to physical rehab. Professionals call it “therapeutic lying” because honesty can increase dementia patients’ anxiety. In the hospital, I tried to feed her a bite of babka, but she had time-traveled to the Battle of Kursk. She was 14 years old, crouching behind a bush as a German fighter plane gunned down fleeing children. It was frightening but affirmed our conviction that this move was necessary. Once she was in memory care, we couldn’t contact her for an agonizing 10 days to help her adapt. But we got reports: Mom wouldn’t sleep in her room, parking herself in the lobby all night. She refused to eat. We worried that if she kept starving herself, she’d be sent to a more depressing, regular nursing home. Then, she refused medication, claiming the pills were making her “lose her memory.” The staff hid meds in her food, but she resisted her glaucoma drops, risking blindness. When I visited, she was belligerent, insisting I take her back to her condo. I was flooded with conflicting emotions. As our family Napoleon, my mother always forced her way. Now she was destroying her health to compel us to take her home. Seeing her in this fragile state, I wanted to give in. But I’d have to close the small business my husband and I built over 14 years and move home. I’d have to check on her every half-hour to ensure she didn’t fall. I’d have to bathe her, force-feed her food and meds and absorb her ire. A better person would make this sacrifice. Three weeks later, we visited to celebrate my mother’s 89th birthday. We ate cake at a courtyard table beside a classic convertible. She complained that everyone there was crazy, so we changed topics — another strategy for dealing with dementia patients. My husband mentioned our wedding. “You got married?” she said, “Congratulations! I’m so happy for you!” I wanted to correct her, reminding her that she had walked me down the aisle 14 years prior. Instead, I stroked her hand. My eyes got wet. Wrong and right were one and the same. This next chapter of her life would be painful. My only hope was that she’d become enveloped in a pleasant memory. My mother’s face lit up and she laughed. She kissed me and held my husband’s bearded face in her hands. “You married such a nice man!” “I did,” I said. As I hugged my mother goodbye, I wished we could live in this moment forever.

2018,Opinion | The Democrats’ Best Response to Republican Power Grabs,"The best option goes beyond retaliation or restraint. Mr. Levy is a professor of political theory at McGill University. In Michigan and Wisconsin, lame duck Republican-majority legislatures are enacting laws to limit the powers of incoming Democratic governors. Two years ago in North Carolina, the same happened. These moves are particularly striking examples of recent aggressive Republican procedural hardball. Whatever the right rules are for the separation of powers, they should apply to both parties and not be changed opportunistically. Democrats are exploring the possibility of legal challenges to those maneuvers. But party leaders face a more difficult, and perhaps more consequential, problem: Should they go tit-for-tat and escalate procedural shenanigans, rules-stretching and rules-breaking? Or should they strive, leading by good example, to maintain a system of norms that have provided political stability in the hopes that a more moderate, reasonable Republican Party will re-emerge? Both strategies come with serious risks: Retaliating in kind could aggravate already deep polarization and wreck what’s left of our political norms. Restraint, on the other hand, would establish new norms that establish electoral disadvantages for Democrats and embolden Republicans. There is a better option, and it also happens to be the best option. Democrats can use the Republican hardball against them by weaving together the Michigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina cases into a larger story to take to voters in 2020: the indictment of Republican attacks on democracy accompanied by an aggressive reform agenda for strengthening constitutional norms and democratic procedures. Normally voters don’t care about procedural questions. One state and complaint at a time, they’re unlikely to remember or understand sharp dealing from two years before. If one party goes to the electorate complaining about the other’s behavior, it’s usually met with a shrug that all politicians cheat. But a very clear narrative or popular revulsion — or both — can change that. Examples are found in the Progressive Era around the turn of the 20th century and again in the immediate aftermath of Watergate, when procedural reform gained traction, for better or for worse, and both term limits and campaign finance reform had moments of widespread popular enthusiasm. There’s good reason to think that the next two years offer the opportunity to create such a corruption narrative and to take advantage of what’s likely to be growing revulsion. President Trump’s administration has made this job easier: The midterm election results showed that its scandals and disgrace have already focused voters’ attention. That’s not the time for retaliation and escalation. It’s the time offer prescriptions for rebuilding the rules that accompany a diagnosis that helps voters make sense of how badly wrong things have gone. Democrats can try to punish Republicans at the ballot box by trying to strengthen rather than weaken democratic norms. The obvious place to begin is with the White House itself. Proposals to require presidential candidates to disclose their tax returns, give teeth to the Emoluments Clause, strengthen anti-nepotism rules that should keep unqualified family members out of sensitive offices, extend conflict-of-interest rules to include the president, and turn blind trust norms into binding rules won’t be hard to understand under Mr. Trump. They will reinforce voters’ distrust of the president while also offering ways to prevent his abuses from becoming standard practice. Republican procedural abuses at the state level precede the Trump administration, but they can fairly be connected to it. Most important is disenfranchisement. Democrats should emphasize the sustained nationwide Republican effort to limit access to the ballot and offer proposals to restore the Voting Rights Act, end felon disenfranchisement, undo restrictive voter identification rules, ease registration, protect early voting and ensure that voting places are more widely and evenly distributed. Not only has Mr. Trump been on the wrong side of those issues, encouraging state crackdowns on imagined millions of noncitizen voters; but voting restrictions in narrowly won Midwestern states got him closer to the White House in the first place. The package of reforms that the incoming House Democratic majority intends to introduce as its symbolic first bill, H.R. 1, contains some of these ideas mixed in with others that I think will muddy the message, but it's the right kind of beginning. Other proposals, from statehood for the District of Columbia to gerrymandering reform, then make sense as part of the same effort to strengthen representation and fair democratic practice. This is also the best approach for Democrats in the short term because they’re not in a strong position to retaliate even if an angry activist base wants them to. Despite some losses last month, Republicans remain in control of more governor’s seats and more state legislatures. More important, making things worse right now really is the wrong thing to do. If Democrats follow a course of unrestrained but legal tactics, we could find ourselves embroiled in even more severe dysfunction and a constitutional crisis. Tit for tat is sometimes necessary to enforce norms, but escalation in an already seriously polarized environment is dangerous. If Democrats can offer a unifying indictment tying Republican attacks on democratic norms to Trump administration abuses, along with a coherent package of serious proposals to restore procedural fairness, voters will have a way of making sense of new examples of Republican sharp dealing. Proposals to shorten lame duck legislative sessions and to constrain their authority, for example, would reinforce the idea that Republicans have been the party of procedural abuses and unfairness while still setting forth a good neutral rule. This is the alternative to doing nothing or making things worse: seek to punish Republicans in 2020 by offering a vision of how to make things better. Jacob T.

2018,Opinion | The Desert Should Not Be a Death Sentence,"The government knows the southwestern border is dangerous for migrants — and wants it that way. Ms. Orlovsky-Schnitzler is a staff member with No More Deaths/No Más Muertes. TUCSON — The desert borderlands of the Southwest are a death trap for migrants. In the summer, the temperature can rise past 115 degrees, and in the winter it can drop below freezing. Water is scarce; shade is almost nonexistent. Some 8,000 people attempting to enter the United States have died in this region since the 1990s. Their shoes, empty water jugs and abandoned rosaries litter the landscape. Volunteers from our organization, No More Deaths/No Más Muertes, hike year-round along remote trails in the Arizona section of the Sonoran Desert, which spans Arizona, California and northwestern Mexico. We leave water, food, blankets and other basic necessities along the desert’s migration corridors. But the federal government is trying to make our humanitarian aid criminal. Eleven months ago, a longtime volunteer with us, Scott Warren, was arrested in the small border town of Ajo, Ariz., for having provided food, water and shelter to two undocumented people. He was charged with two federal counts of harboring and one count of conspiracy to harbor. If convicted at his trial, which begins next month in Federal District Court in Tucson, he will face up to 20 years in prison. The harboring charge against Mr. Warren is part of a long-term government strategy to send a dangerous message: Humanitarian aid to migrants is a crime. The government has tried all sorts of maneuvers to prosecute good Samaritans in the desert — from charging our volunteers with harboring and transporting to issuing misdemeanors for “abandoning personal property” in a wildlife refuge (by leaving gallons of water for migrants) and using restricted roads without a permit. These legal actions against our volunteers are just one component of a wider movement against undocumented people in the United States. The deployment of active-duty troops to the border, widespread family separations and increasingly violent rhetoric from the Trump administration are all churning wheels in an apparatus of policies intended to make crossing the border a death sentence. In the past decade, migrant deaths have risen even as attempted crossings have decreased, because the militarized border pushes people into the desert’s most remote regions. It is impossible to carry enough water to survive even a two- or three-day trek through the barren reaches of the Sonoran. Without help, migrants die painful, cruel deaths — often alone, delirious with fatigue, hunger and thirst. The government knows just how deadly the conditions along our southern border are. In 1994, the Clinton administration initiated the strategy of “Prevention Through Deterrence,” sealing off urban entry points into the country and instituting new checkpoints along major routes farther north. Border towns gained military-grade infrastructure: sensors, barbed wire and a big increase in Border Patrol agents. Policymakers didn’t bother outfitting the entire length of the border with a wall because they knew that parts of the terrain were so harsh that people would die trying to cross them. The desert became a weapon — a formidable expanse that swallowed crossers whole. Before I moved to Arizona to join relief efforts, I had little sense of how unforgiving the desert is. The first time I hiked out with other volunteers to leave supplies, I was stunned by how endless the sky and earth felt. But I soon began to see each part of the landscape within the context of a migrant’s journey: The underbrush was thorny, the creatures poisonous, and the silence of the wide emptiness eerie. Ajo, where Mr. Warren was arrested, is 43 miles from the border — a long journey to make in such brutal conditions. Opponents of immigration contend that providing water and aid encourages migrants to make dangerous border crossings (a claim without evidence), but we know that people will continue to risk their lives to come to the United States so long as they feel unsafe in their home countries. Humanitarians give water to people who are dehydrated and food to people who are starving, regardless of their background or paperwork. To continue to do our work, we need Americans to call the United States attorney’s office in Tucson and make clear that humanitarian aid is not a crime. And in the days and months to come, we ask people to get involved in the sanctuary movement, as there is not a place in the United States untouched by the border crisis. There are many ways to engage in compassionate sanctuary work locally — from petitioning city councils to pass legislation welcoming migrant communities to joining rapid-response squads mobilizing against deportations. Aid groups should be allowed to operate without government harassment and prosecution. Aid workers should have access to public lands so long as they remain active migration corridors. Documents are not a prerequisite for human kindness. Everyone has a right to food, water and safe passage.

2018,"The Director James Wan: If ‘Aquaman’ Doesn’t Work, Blame Me","“Aquaman” is an improbable movie, which in many ways makes James Wan the ideal person to direct it. The latest chapter in the Warner Bros. series based on DC comic book superheroes, “Aquaman” provides an origin story for this much-maligned undersea adventurer (played by Jason Momoa of “Game of Thrones”) as he teams up with Mera (Amber Heard) against the nefarious Orm (Patrick Wilson) for control of Atlantis. When it opens on Dec. 21, the kaleidoscopic and willfully offbeat “Aquaman” will find itself bearing the weight of the larger DC franchise, which continues to be perceived as an also-ran to Marvel. Aside from “Wonder Woman,” the series has struggled to find an entry that’s excited audiences and critics, even as it rakes in millions of dollars. Wan, 41, a spirited, quick-talking filmmaker with a plume of reddish-purple dye in his hair, is used to being an underdog. Born in Malaysia and raised in Australia, he found early success with his genre-redefining 2004 horror feature, “Saw.” But he struggled for years to find a worthy follow-up before re-establishing himself with hit supernatural thrillers like “Insidious” and “The Conjuring.” That led him to mainstream Hollywood blockbusters like “Furious 7” (the seventh entry in the “Fast & Furious” series) and finally to “Aquaman.” On a recent visit to New York, Wan spoke about the unusual trajectory that brought him to Atlantis and the unexpected pressure now on the film. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. Aquaman is a well-known superhero, if not a widely respected one. His powers — swimming fast, talking to fish — surely paled next to Superman’s. Was he important to you, growing up? I did grow up reading comic books, but his books weren’t the ones I read. Later, as I got older, it became apparent that people out there were making fun of him. Sure, he was somewhat disrespected and made the joke of the superhero world. But I always found him endearing. How did the movie first become a possibility for you? Having made “The Conjuring,” I was part of the Warner Bros. family, and I knew they were doing their DC thing. I spoke with Kevin Tsujihara [the Warner Bros. chairman and chief executive] at a premiere and I said, “I’m interested in the properties that you have at DC.” A few months later, I was in a general meeting with DC and they floated two properties that didn’t have filmmakers on board: the Flash and Aquaman. Why did you choose Aquaman? I felt the Flash had been done before. It had been on TV twice at that point. The one that had not been done was Aquaman. I realized, wow, his character resides in this crazy, big world, and I could do something very interesting with it. I look up to people like Spielberg, Cameron, Lucas, John Carpenter. I’m a fan of genre filmmaking, naturally. So I thought I could make “Aquaman” a genre film, meaning a horror monster movie. DC basically said, yes, you can make Aquaman versus sea monsters if that’s what you want. How were you selected to direct “Furious 7”? Was that an important step in being considered for other big-budget projects like “Aquaman”? Believe me, “Furious 7” was difficult to make, if not the toughest of my career. But that movie really allowed people to look at me as a more complete filmmaker. “The Conjuring” hadn’t come out yet, but Chris Morgan, the producer-writer of the “Fast & Furious” franchise at the time, had seen “The Conjuring” and he loved it. Around that point, Justin Lin was finishing “Fast & Furious 6,” and I think he just needed a break. He wasn’t going to come back to do “7.” So they were kind of scrambling. I talked about what I wanted to bring from my horror filmmaking into the “Fast & Furious” world. By that, I meant I wanted to create suspenseful, tension-filled set pieces. And they were excited with what I had to say. You broke through professionally with the original “Saw” movie, which seems like every filmmaker’s dream. But what happened next? “Saw” exploded in a big way and created this big, big franchise. But then I couldn’t seem to get out from under its shadow. I only directed the first one, but my name became synonymous with “Saw” and therefore all the negative connotations — I became the father of torture porn. I went off and did “Dead Silence” and “Death Sentence,” two movies that worked hard to break away from the image of “Saw” and ultimately did not work, from a commercial standpoint. That was two strikes against my name and I’m thinking, am I in director’s jail? All the projects that were coming my way were just copycat projects that weren’t special for me. And so, I just held out. Then my buddy Leigh Whannell and I just thought, screw all this. Let’s go back to our low-budget filmmaking roots. That was when we made “Insidious.” Were there any lessons from this frustrating period? I learned what it means to be artistic and commercial at the same time. It made me very aware of the projects I need to do. It needs to be artistically fulfilling, but it needs to have commerciality as well. I’m always walking that tightrope: I know I need to make a movie that works financially, because in Hollywood, that’s how you get your next film. “Aquaman” is obviously a piece of a larger franchise. Did you still feel you were able to put your stamp on it? It’s pretty crazy. For as big a movie as “Aquaman” is, I could not have had more freedom. I had all the big tools and the budget to paint on a really big canvas, but with the freedom I had on, let’s say, “Saw” or “Insidious.” So if the movie works, or doesn’t work, I have no one to blame but myself. Did you have any say in the casting of Jason Momoa and Amber Heard, who were introduced in previous DC movies? Even though Zack [Snyder] was making “Justice League,” I was kept in the loop by DC and Warner Bros., and they really wanted my input into the two leads. The great thing about casting Jason is, any jokey perception that people have of Aquaman goes right out the window. He completely nullifies any disrespect that people have for this character. Everybody knows how tough and strong Jason Momoa is. I wanted to show people the more lighthearted side of him, the goofy side of him. I worked very hard to pull it out of him, and Jason would be the first to say that I took him out of his comfort zones, quite a few times. [Laughs] It’s no secret that, though they were commercially successful, DC films like “Justice League,” “Suicide Squad” and “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” were creative and critical disappointments. Did that response affect your approach to “Aquaman”? I was definitely aware of that. The irony is, I picked “Aquaman” because I thought, here’s a superhero I can make that is fully under the radar. No one’s going to [care] about this film. I can just do whatever I want. Make it easy with no pressure. Fast-forward to three years later and now there’s a massive spotlight on it. So, to answer your question, obviously there was a sense of pressure. But I try not to let any of that cloud my vision for the film. I just plow ahead and continue to make the movie I wanted to make. So creating an underwater universe that’s vivid and multicolored, that’s not a response to the drab, darker palettes of previous DC movies? If people go back and watch “Furious 7,” they’ll see how bright and colorful that movie is. Beautiful blue skies, beautiful beaches. People associate me, primarily, with my horror films, and they expect a darker look than “Aquaman.” That serves a narrative that people are trying to get at as well, like I’m reacting to the criticism of these films. My biggest inspiration is actually from the comic book. The comic book is just full of magical creatures and weird and wonderful worlds, and the only way to do an “Aquaman” movie justice is to pay homage to the 70 years’ worth of source material. There are many scenes that take place entirely underwater, which creates lots of challenges for you. How did you film these sequences? There really aren’t a lot of visual cues from existing films to pull from. That was exciting for me, because I get to create a new world. In terms of the technicality of it: It was a pain. The actors would be suited up in their costumes, and placed inside these really awkward, uncomfortable rigs. Then visual effects would come in and add the flowing hair, the floating costumes and capes, and then paint in the entire world. A simple scene of two people talking underwater would just take days and days to shoot. Looking ahead to other DC movies like “Shazam!,” “Wonder Woman 1984” and “Birds of Prey,” what’s your sense of where Warner Bros. wants to take the franchise next? I don’t know what the bigger picture is. But I think it’s really cool to take chances with the lesser-known characters and story lines. It’s good if all the other films have their own flavor, so they don’t force them to feel the same. So you don’t necessarily want a role in steering the larger DC movie operations? It’s taken me so long just to finish this movie. [Laughs] I don’t want to think about somebody else’s movie at this point. I just want to survive this one. You’re one of very few nonwhite directors who’s been able to make a studio movie at this scale. What’s needed to ensure that other filmmakers from diverse backgrounds get these opportunities? I think the willingness to take chances on different kinds of films and filmmakers. I never thought, for the life of me, that I would ever see a movie like “Crazy Rich Asians,” where the cast is Asian, and for the movie to do well and be well received, it’s incredible. It starts at the top, the willingness to reach out to these filmmakers and take chances. I get it — when you’re making a movie that’s really big and expensive, they want filmmakers that have proven track records. But there’s really no excuses for not looking at more diverse filmmakers.",The New York Times
2018,The Duck That Came In From the Cold,"City Kitchen For a succulent winter meal, steam duck legs, then roast them and serve with a crunchy, spicy persimmon salad. It was cold and rainy as I wandered the market the other day — “nice weather for ducks,” as the old saying goes. I know it refers to damp meteorological conditions, but somehow that phrase always makes me a little hungry. As fate would have it, Hudson Valley Duck Farm was selling its wares just a few feet away. I walked away with six fat moulard duck legs in my shopping bag. The moulard is a cross between the Muscovy and Pekin varieties, with legs that are perfect for braising, which is what I intended to do. Until I changed my mind. Maybe it was the fetchingly diminutive daikon radishes at the next stand, or the frilly cilantro. The duck was suddenly headed in a Chinese direction. Some Chinese cookbooks recommend steaming duck before roasting it to crisp the skin. It is a good technique to master. Steaming yields moist, tender duck, and it provides bonus ingredients to save for later: the liquid left in the steaming pot contains a fair amount of rendered duck fat and a small amount of concentrated duck broth. The two will separate when refrigerated. I seasoned the legs with a blend of toasted Sichuan pepper and salt and left them to cure for a few hours before cooking. Many pasta pots, mine included, come with a steaming basket insert. A few crushed cinnamon sticks and star anise pods in the basket would perfume the duck as it steamed. It’s worth mixing up a batch of fragrant, flavorful Sichuan-pepper salt, both for this recipe and to keep on hand for all-purpose seasoning. (If you can’t find Sichuan peppercorns in a store, online spice merchants will have them.) Sichuan pepper, unlike black pepper, is not spicy; it is pungent, floral and tingling, and makes almost anything taste better. (Try it with roasted chicken.) To make it, toast Sichuan peppercorns and flaky salt in a dry skillet over medium heat, then grind them to a coarse powder. Before roasting the duck legs, I whisked up a simple glaze for them, with soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil and a bit of the fermented spicy bean paste doubanjiang. I wanted a bright, juicy salad of winter fruits to accompany the duck. Persimmons, oranges and pomegranate tossed with daikon, Serrano chile, lime juice, ginger and sesame oil provided a kicky contrast to the crisp-roasted duck. (Be sure to use Fuyu persimmons, which can be eaten unripe. The long, pointy Hachiya persimmon must be completely ripe to be palatable.) As we sat down to dinner, it was still drizzling outside. Perfect weather for duck, without a doubt. Recipe: Sesame-Glazed Duck Legs With Spicy Persimmon Salad Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

2018,The Early Days of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe,"El Espace This week in El Espace: black beauty bloggers, wellness tips “for the culture” and more. El Espace is a column dedicated to news and culture relevant to Latinx communities. Expect politics, arts, analysis, personal essays and more. ¿Lo mejor? It’ll be in Spanish and English, so you can forward it to your tía, your primo Lalo or anyone else (read: everyone). The other day, Jeff Roth, an editor at the Times in charge of our photo archives, came across some never-published images of the founders of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe on Manhattan’s Lower East Side. The subjects sought to build a creative, social space in the city for Puerto Ricans, where patrons could bear witness to what the writer David Vidal called “a new, intensely cathartic poetry that was born on New York City's streets.” The cafe is frequently packed on Friday nights. Outside, long lines of people wait to get into the weekly spoken word competitions, and many of the young faces in the audience and onstage are black or brown. For many spoken word performers of color — especially those of Latinx and black descent — the Nuyorican Poets Cafe is what the Comedy Cellar has been for stand-up comics: a place to cut their teeth and test the resonance of their work in front of a live audience. It’s come a long way from its humble beginnings in a poet’s living room. In the early 1970s, Miguel Algarín, born in Puerto Rico but raised on the Lower East Side, began inviting other Nuyorican poets to his apartment on East Sixth Street for readings and performances. Algarín and his contemporaries, including Miguel Piñero, Pedro Pietri and Lucky CienFuegos, were part of a growing artistic scene in what was then a primarily Puerto Rican neighborhood, drawing on their identities and daily struggles for their work. The salon quickly outgrew Algarín’s living room, so he and a few other artists began renting an Irish bar down the street to fit more people. In 1981, they bought their current building on East Third Street and, after a lengthy renovation process, formally opened it to the public in 1990 as a space for Nuyorican poets to experiment and hone their craft. The photos, taken in 1976 by Paul Hosefros, show the excitement of the nascent collective as it expanded into its first storefront. “Many of the founding artists and those who gravitated toward the group in the early days were informed by and active in a version of poetry that was much less academic, much less literary, much less elitist than many of the incarnations of poetry that existed in the ’60s and ’70s,” said Daniel Gallant, the cafe’s executive director, adding that even in its earliest days, it produced “poetry that evolved into and through injections of music, movement, theater, film and collaborative experience.” That multidisciplinary, experimental spirit lives on today, and a number of award-winning one-person theatrical shows have evolved from spoken word performances developed there. Sarah Jones’s 2005 show “Bridge and Tunnel,” which won a Tony Award, and Elaine del Valle’s 2014 “Brownsville Bred” are standouts. The Dominican-American poet Elizabeth Acevedo, who won the 2018 National Book Award for Young People’s Fiction, said she gave her first performance at the cafe when she was 15 and was only vaguely aware of “this important poetry place downtown.” “I did a rap song,” said Acevedo, now 30. “I knew music. I knew bolero songs and church songs and hip-hop. That was my origin.” Caridad De La Luz, a Nuyorican poet who first performed at the club in 1996 and now hosts the Monday night Open Mics, also said she had only performed music (mostly Mary J. Blige covers on her college campus) before arriving at Nuyorican. The cafe expanded her view of what a poem could be. “Poetry was just something you wrote in journals for therapy,” she said. “Then when you got to the Nuyorican it was like, ‘Oh there’s a mic, there’s a stage, there’s an audience that wants to hear these things.’ Out came the journal.” Acevedo said there’s a sense of “walking into a lineage” of other Latinx spoken word performers at the cafe. “Even as the poets get younger, you feel that there’s something being passed down,” she said. She recalled learning about “declamación,” a cousin of spoken word poetry that is performed in the Caribbean and throughout Latin America. “What we name spoken word or slam or esto y lo otro, we have had names for,” she said. The magic of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe was how it blended old-world and new, Acevedo said. It was “this space that, yes, was in conversation with hip-hop. Yes, was in conversation with the beat poets. But was also in conversation with something that was inherently Puerto Rican, inherently Caribbean, inherently Latinx.” BLACK GIRLS LOVE A SMOKEY EYE, TOO What if none of the YouTube beauty bloggers creating tutorials had black skin like you? Well, you turn the camera on yourself. THE IMMIGRANTS WHO WORKED FOR TRUMP Victorina Morales, an undocumented immigrant who worked at the Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey for more than five years, says she wasn’t the only who didn’t have papers. “The housekeeping supervisor frequently made remarks about the employees’ vulnerable legal status when critiquing their work, she said, sometimes calling them ‘stupid illegal immigrants’ with less intelligence than a dog,” wrote Miriam Jordan.

2018,"The Earth’s Shell Has Cracked, and We’re Drifting on the Pieces ","basics Plate tectonics helped make our planet stable and habitable. But the slow shifting of continents is still a mysterious process. The theory of plate tectonics is one of the great scientific advances of our age, right up there with Darwin’s theory of evolution and Einstein’s theory of relativity. The idea that Earth’s outer shell is broken up into giant puzzle pieces, or plates, all gliding atop a kind of conveyor belt of hot, weak rock — here rising up from the underlying mantle, there plunging back into it — explains much about the structure and behavior of our home planet: the mountains and ocean canyons, the earthquakes and volcanoes, the very composition of the air we breathe. Yet success is no guarantee against a midlife crisis, and so it is that half a century after the basic mechanisms of plate tectonics were first elucidated, geologists are confronting surprising gaps in their understanding of a concept that is truly the bedrock of their profession. They are sparring over when, exactly, the whole movable plate system began. Is it nearly as ancient as the planet itself — that is, roughly 4.5 billion years old — or a youthful one billion years, or somewhere in between? They are asking what caused the shell to crack apart in the first place, and how the industrious recycling of Earth’s crust began. They are comparing Earth with its sister planet, Venus. The two worlds are roughly the same size and built of similar rocky material, yet Earth has plate tectonics and Venus does not. Scientists want to know why. “In the 1960s and 70s, when people came up with the notion of plate tectonics, they didn’t think about what it was like in the distant past,” said Jun Korenaga, a geophysicist at Yale University. “People were so busy trying to prove plate tectonics by looking at the present situation, or were caught up applying the concept to problems in their own field. The origin issue is a much more recent debate.” Researchers also are exploring the link between plate tectonics and the evolution of complex life. Fortuitously timed continental collisions and mountain smackdowns may well have supplied crucial nutrients at key moments of biological inventiveness, like the legendary Cambrian explosion of 500 million years ago, when the ancestors of modern life-forms appeared. “The connection between deep Earth processes and Earth surface biology hasn’t been thought about too clearly in the past, but that’s changing fast,” said Aubrey Zerkle, a geochemist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. It’s increasingly obvious that “you need plate tectonics to sustain life,” Dr. Zerkle added. “If there wasn’t a way of recycling material between mantle and crust, all these elements that are crucial to life, like carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and oxygen, would get tied up in rocks and stay there.” The origin and implications of plate tectonics were the subject of a recent meeting and themed issue of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. Researchers said that pinning down when and how Earth’s vivid geological machinations arose will do more than flesh out our understanding of our home base. The answers could well guide our search for life and habitable planets beyond the solar system. Robert Stern, a geoscientist at the University of Texas at Dallas, argues that if we’re looking for another planet to colonize, we want to avoid ones with signs of plate tectonic activity. Those are the places where life is likely to have evolved beyond the “single cell or worm stage, and we don’t want to fight another technological civilization for their planet.” The idea that continents are not fixed but rather peregrinate around the globe dates back several centuries, when mapmakers began noticing the complementarity of various land masses — for example, the way the northeast bulge of South America looks as though it could fit snugly in the cupped palm of the southwest coast of Africa. But it wasn’t until the mid-twentieth century that the generic notion of “continental drift” was transformed into a full-bodied theory, complete with evidence of a subterranean engine driving these continental odysseys. Geologists determined that Earth’s outer layer is broken into eight or nine large segments and five or six smaller ones, a mix of relatively thin, dense oceanic plates riding low and thicker, lighter continental plates bobbing high. At large fissures on the ocean floor, melting rock from the underlying mantle rises up, adding to the oceanic plates. At other fracture points in the crust, oceanic plates are diving back inside, or subducting, their mass devoured in the mantle’s hot belly. The high-riding continental plates are likewise jostled by the magmatic activity below, skating around at an average pace of one or two inches a year, sometimes crashing together to form, say, the Himalayan mountain chain, or pulling apart at Africa’s Great Rift Valley. All this convective bubbling up and recycling between crust and mantle, this creative destruction and reconstruction of parts — “tectonic” comes from the Greek word for build — is Earth’s way of following the second law of thermodynamics. The movement shakes off into the frigidity of space the vast internal heat that the planet has stored since its violent formation. And while shifting, crumbling plates may seem inherently unreliable, a poor foundation on which to raise a family, the end result is a surprising degree of stability. “Plate tectonics is a relatively benign way for Earth to lose heat,” said Peter Cawood, an Earth scientist at Monash University in Australia. “You get what are catastrophic events in localized areas, in earthquakes and tsunamis,” he added. “But the mechanism allows Earth to maintain a stabler and more benign environment overall.” Unfortunately for geologists, the very nature of plate tectonics obscures its biography. Oceanic crust, where the telltale mantle exchange zones are located, is recycled through the upwelling and subducting pipeline every 200 million years or so, which means hard evidence of tectonic origins was destroyed long ago. Continental crust is older, and rocks dating back more than 4 billion years have been identified in places like Jack Hills, Australia. But continental plates float above the subductive fray, revealing little of the system’s origins. Nevertheless, geoscientists are doing their best with extant rocks, models and laboratory experiments to sketch out possible tectonic timelines. Dr. Korenaga and his colleagues have proposed that plate tectonics began very early, right after Earth’s crust solidified from its initial magmatic state. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] “That is when the conditions would have been easiest for plate tectonics to get started,” he said. At that point, he said, most of the water on Earth — delivered by comets — would still be on the surface, with little of it having found its way into the mantle. The heat convecting up through the mantle would exert a stronger force on dry rocks than on rocks that were lubricated. At the same time, the surface water would make it easier for the hot, twisting rocks beneath to crack the surface lid apart, rather as a sprinkling of water from the faucet eases the task of popping ice cubes from a tray. The cracking open of the surface lid, Dr. Korenaga said, is key to getting the all-mighty subduction engine started. With subduction established, water, like oceanic crust, would cycle between Earth’s surface and mantle. On the opposite end of the origins debate is Dr. Stern, who argues that plate tectonics is a mere billion years old or less, and that Earth spent its first 3.5 billion years with a simple “single lid” as its outer shell: a crust riddled with volcanoes and other means of heat ventilation, but no moving plates, no subduction, no recycling between inside and out. As evidence of the youthfulness of the plate regimen, Dr. Stern points to two classes of rocks: ophiolites and blueschist. Ophiolites are pieces of oceanic crust atop bits of underlying mantle that have made their way onto land and thus have escaped the relentless recycling of oceanic crust. Recent research has shown that ophiolites are not just any slice of oceanic crust, Dr. Stern said, but rather were formed by the forces of subduction. Similarly, blueschists are rocks that are fashioned under very high pressure but low temperatures, and “the only place you can do that is in a subduction zone,” Dr. Stern said. Nearly all ophiolites are less than a billion years old, he added, while the most ancient blueschists, found in China, are just 800 million years old. No ophiolites, no blueschists, no evidence of subduction or plate tectonics. Most geologists opt for a middle ground. “Science is a democratic process,” said Michael Brown, a geologist at the University of Maryland and an editor of the themed issue, “and the prevailing view is that Earth started to exhibit behaviors that look like plate tectonics 2.5 to 3 billion years ago.” Significantly, that chronology decouples plate tectonics from the origin of life on Earth: evidence of the earliest single-celled organisms dates back more than 3.6 billion years. Nevertheless, scientists view plate tectonics as vital to the sustained evolution of that primordial life. Plate tectonic activity did not just help to stabilize Earth’s heat management system. The movement kept a steady supply of water shuttling between mantle and crust, rather than gradually evaporating from the surface. It blocked the dangerous buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by sucking excess carbon from the ocean and subducting it underground. It shook up mountains and pulverized rocks, freeing up essential minerals and nutrients like phosphorus, oxygen and nitrogen for use in the growing carnival of life. Dr. Zerkle discerns a link between geological and biological high drama: “It’s been suggested that time periods of supercontinental cycles — when small continents smash together to make large supercontinents, and those supercontinents then rip apart into smaller continents again — could have put large pulses of nutrients into the biosphere and allowed organisms to really take off.” Plate tectonics also built the right playing fields for Darwinian games. “Think about what drives evolution,” Dr. Stern said. “It’s isolation and competition. You need to break continents and continental shelves apart, and separate one ocean from another, for speciation to occur.” Life is always falling apart, on the rocks — and a good thing, too.",The New York Times
2018,The Economy Faces Big Risks in 2019. Markets Are Only Now Facing Up to Them.,"One question people might be asking is, what took so long? After another week of exceptional volatility on Wall Street that has pummeled stock portfolios, there are two closely related questions worth asking. First, why is this happening when the economy is so strong? The November jobs numbers released Friday showed the unemployment rate remains at a rock-bottom 3.7 percent amid healthy job creation, just the latest piece of economic data to come in relatively strong. Second, what took so long? Why are markets just now recognizing the risks the economy faces in 2019, which have been obvious for months to anyone paying attention? The forces driving the recent swings — which have resulted in an 8 percent drop in the S&P 500 over the last two months, with some teeth-rattling ups and downs for stocks, bonds and major commodities along the way — are not anything new. First, three years’ worth of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve are finally starting to pinch interest-rate-sensitive sectors, particularly housing, the auto industry and companies with heavy debt loads. After years in which the economy has become heavily tilted toward industries that depend on low interest rates, a potentially painful rebalancing is underway. Second, investors worry that the trade war between the United States and China could start to pinch corporate earnings and economic activity more than it has to date. But that conflict has been building throughout 2018. Third, the tax cut that has lifted corporate earnings and economic growth in 2018 won’t be repeated in 2019, meaning a harder slog for companies seeking higher profits. Growth will slow unless companies develop ways to extract greater productivity from their (increasingly hard to find) work force, which would be great for long-term economic prospects, but isn’t the kind of thing you want to count on. So the answer to the first question, of why markets have become so turbulent when the economy is strong, is the simpler one. Markets look forward, and the risks looking forward seem increasingly ominous even as everything continues to go swimmingly, especially in the labor market, as 2018 nears its end. The second question is a little harder. All of these major risk factors have been openly discussed among economists and the financial press for the last year. The consensus economic projections of Fed officials published one year ago show that they expected the economy to grow 2.5 percent in 2018 and 2.1 percent in 2019. If anything, they were too pessimistic about 2018, which now looks likely to be north of 3 percent. But slower growth in 2019 and 2020 has been expected among mainstream economic forecasters ever since the tax legislation took shape a year ago. “Nothing in economics and markets happens in a straight line or without lags and feedback effects,” said Blu Putnam, chief economist at the CME Group. “There are some big headwinds all coming from events in 2018 that we know about, but whose impacts are yet to be fully felt or appreciated.” And knowing something bad will probably happen is not the same as knowing when. It evidently took another confusing series of developments in economic diplomacy between the United States and China for it to become clear. “Most economists are good at analyzing fundamentals, but they know better than to forecast direction and timing in the same sentence,” Mr. Putnam said. Part of the agita on financial markets in the last few weeks has come from fears that the Fed has been underestimating these risks, and is dead set on raising interest rates several more times next year even as the economy is still trying to adjust to the early rounds of increases. Those fears have eased some as Fed officials have signaled open-mindedness and flexibility about the path ahead in the last few days. But a tricky period for the Fed is only beginning. The optimistic case for 2019 is that a rebalancing of the economy is underway that will create both losers (interest-rate-sensitive industries and those that rely heavily on trade with China) and winners (everybody else). The risk is that this handoff doesn’t happen as smoothly as an economic textbook might predict. There are always frictions that can leave certain regions and certain workers in a bad spot for extended periods. This episode, for example, could turn out to have similarities to what we’ve called the mini-recession of 2014 to 2016. The underlying causes are a bit different, but then, as now, prices of oil and agricultural commodities fell sharply, and makers of equipment that supply those industries saw plummeting business. It hit those sectors hard and dragged down overall growth, even if many people not in those industries didn’t notice it was happening. The tricky thing for the Fed is that it must set its policies for the whole of the United States; it can’t set one interest rate for the service sector in big coastal cities and another for farm equipment makers in Iowa. With the unemployment rate at its lowest level since 1969 and average hourly earnings starting to rise a bit more rapidly, all the traditional signals point to continued interest rate increases being justified. So what markets have right is that this is shaping up to be a perilous time for the economy, in which bad luck or bad policy could easily create a major slowdown or recession. And that’s the case no matter how strong things look at the end of 2018, or how long it’s taken markets to reckon with that reality.",The New York Times
2018,The Ecstasy and the Agony of Being a Grandmother ,"Rites of passage Becoming a grandmother was joyful and thrilling, but it was tempered by a stinging knowledge: that my grandchild’s life would unspool into a string of birthdays I will not live to see. I was in the delivery room when my first grandchild was born. It was a gift from my daughter to be invited in at all — I know I can be overbearing sometimes — and I cherished the invitation like a rare and precious gem. During the long night of my daughter’s labor, I was so afraid of interfering that I hardly dared breathe (or, more to the point, hardly dared catnap, since apparently I snore). I knew what not to do — “No touching! No talking!” was my daughter’s request of both her husband and me when we first got to the hospital — but I wasn’t sure what exactly I should do. I felt grateful to have been asked to join them, and scared that I would somehow screw it up. Things got better after my daughter got an epidural and returned to her normal engaging self. Now it was O.K. to talk, though I still avoided touching, even though I longed to give her a few hugs. Childbirth is all about the woman in labor, obviously, and those of us in attendance are just bit players in the main event. But I felt awkward in that setting, more awkward than I’d expected, since usually I’m quite at ease with my daughter and son-in-law. I knew they wanted me there primarily as an extra set of eyes and ears, a sort of no-cost doula. My daughter had seen me in action when my mother was hospitalized, and she knew I could be a fierce patient advocate if she needed one. But what was my role when things were going fine? I found myself wrestling with my own uncertainty, trying hard to remain unobtrusive, straining for the right balance between being invisible and turning into a mother lion. At 7:47 on a cloudy morning in June, the baby finally arrived. Strangely, I wasn’t bowled over by starry-eyed, new-grandma love. What was wrong with me? Instead I felt guilt at the sight of the baby’s smooshed-up nose, worried that it was going to be the one obvious component of my legacy. And I felt hurt, too, as the baby was cleaned up and passed from mother to father to mother again for skin-to-skin bonding time. So many glowing smiles, and there I stood — having been so quiet, so supportive, so tired for 12 long hours — as it slowly dawned on me that no one was going to offer the baby to me, and I wasn’t going to find a way to ask. O.K., so I wasn’t flooded with the right emotions there in the delivery room. O.K., so I didn’t get the bedside cuddling I had hoped for. Deal with it, I told myself; this adventure isn’t about you. What I was privileged enough to witness was something wonderful: the birth of a family, as two young people I adored took on the mantle of parenthood together, with a perfect mixture of gravity and glee. I left quietly without ever having touched the baby — or, for that matter, without ever having touched the new mother, who was distracted by a loony nurse encouraging her to urinate in her bed (“It will feel good to let it all out”). I was relieved that it was over and that the baby was healthy. Yet I felt unfinished. In the late afternoon I returned to the hospital with my husband, and fell in love at last. That’s when my son-in-law handed me my bundled-up granddaughter, who was of course beautiful and who had a perfectly delightful nose. Now, three years later, I realize that the delivery room experience was a metaphor for grandmothering itself: the thrill of being invited inside, the delight of watching your children become parents, tempered by the sense of being kept at arm’s length as the new family starts to unfold. That’s the bitter truth of grandmothering: This is your last unfolding. As your children and grandchildren spin off, they must spin away, too, so they can continue long after you’re gone. Even as you get to watch them, right up close, you’re always outside with your nose against the glass — and you’re increasingly aware of how much of their story will take place without you. I’d been waiting for that glimpse in the delivery room for what felt like a long time. As my 60s approached, I kept being gobsmacked by grandbaby lust. I wanted to hold a baby — not just any baby, but one with whom I could feel the primal connection I had once felt holding my own two girls. I wanted the sight, smell and heft of a baby in my arms; I wanted a little one to come to know me, trust me and seek me out for comfort; I wanted a child to give shape and purpose to my days. I wasn’t alone in this longing. A whole generation of strong, accomplished baby boom women were feeling something similar, or at least that’s how it seemed from my own privileged corner of the world. But why do we feel this way? Are we longing to get back to our own youth, when not only were our babies bundles of infinite possibilities, but we ourselves were, too? Is our longing more altruistic, a hope for our children to know the deep joy that comes from being a parent? Are we just bored and looking for something meaningful to do? In many ways, grandbaby lust is a lot like the baby lust of younger women, with the same uncertainties of fertility, desire and commitment. But there is one agonizing difference: They are not your uncertainties to work out. They’re your son’s or daughter’s. And these sons and daughters often think that they have all the time in the world. While we, the would-be grandparents, know that our own time is running out. In the last few years of her life, my mother would talk about the angst of aging. Who’s that old lady in the mirror? she’d say, thinking she was being clever. And, more seriously: Why does no one need me anymore? When did I become unwanted, or, as the French would say, de trop? I was impatient when she said these things. Everyone feels that way, I would tell her. It was almost the cruelest thing I could have said to my brainy mother, that her conversation was a bit of a cliché. She died last year at the age of 92, and my impatience with her feeling de trop is one of the things I feel most guilty about. Why did I have to be so brusque? She was just trying to connect, to state an emotional truth that’s a cliché precisely because it’s so universal. She was an old, lonely lady with a terrifying blunting of her once-sharp intellect, and she just wanted to talk. And maybe she was also trying to do what mothers and grandmothers do: prepare us for her absence. That is the weird self-annihilation at the heart of the job, as the novelist Edwidge Danticat observed. The ultimate goal of raising a child, she wrote, is to give the child everything she needs to leave you: “to get bigger, smarter, to crawl, babble, walk, speak, to have birthdays that you hope you’ll live to see.” I knew about all that as I was raising my two daughters, but I knew it with my head only, not my gut. I was 26 when the older one was born, 30 for the next one, and I had every expectation of hanging around for a long, long time even after they learned to walk away from me. I planned to live to see, and share in, birthday after birthday after birthday. But as a grandmother, I have no such belief; the anguish is in my gut at last. I have internalized the stinging knowledge that, beneath all the encouragement you give your children to grow and walk and speak and leave, beneath all the wonderful moments you may be lucky enough to share in and enjoy, your grandchild’s life will be a long string of birthdays you will not live to see. My friend Barbara lives in New York City, and she tries to get down to Washington, D.C., every month or so to visit her two grandsons. On one such visit, her younger grandson was playing with her jewelry. He asked to look more closely at her wedding ring. “Can I have this when I’m married?” he asked. He was 4. “Sure,” Barbara said. He looked at her engagement ring. “Can my wife have this?” he asked. Again she said, “Sure.” “Then it hit me — I’ll never see him get married,” Barbara told me later. “I’ll never meet his wife.” That’s the double-edged nature of being a grandmother: Your thoughts turn powerfully toward the future — one that now includes the grandchildren you adore — at the very same moment you’re reminded of your own absence from that future. It’s an odd mixture of birth and death, which is what gives grandmotherhood its beauty, as well as its specific and poignant pain.

2018,The Effort to Reimagine Company Towns,"NEW ORLEANS — Steve Case has been on a barnstorming tour of the United States in a red bus that reads “The Rise of the Rest.” You would be forgiven for thinking he was running for office. The co-founder of AOL has joined forces with J.D. Vance, the author of “Hillbilly Elegy,” to promote entrepreneurship across the United States and seed investments in cities often overlooked by venture capital funds. In doing so, the two men have recruited a list of who’s who in business, including Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Charles and David Koch of Koch Industries, to be part of their investment fund. The fund is part of a larger movement to reimagine company towns, and a challenge for venture capital funds to look beyond California, New York and Massachusetts — the three states that receive 75 percent of venture capital in the United States. “It takes a set of ingredients, including a comfort with new ideas and diversity,” said Walter Isaacson, the authorized biographer of “Steve Jobs” and a history professor. “It takes a willingness to take risks and even to fail at times.” That is the magic of her city, Mayor Jenny Durkan of Seattle said in conversation with Mr. Isaacson and Mr. Case at the Cities for Tomorrow conference. The city reimagined itself from the 1962 World’s Fair and is the home of Amazon, Nordstrom, Microsoft, Starbucks and Costco — what Ms. Durkan called “small mom-and-pop companies that stay below the radar until they’re not.” But on the conference stage, the discussion shifted from the benefits of rising cities to the reality of one rising sector. “Even in the successful cities, the success masks this other part of the city that hasn’t risen,” Ms. Durkan said. “And we’ve seen that in Seattle, with the huge growth of tech and the new economy, but it masks some real displacement, some real lack of opportunity.” The elephant in the room was Amazon. Two-hundred-thirty-eight cities across North America applied to be home for the company’s next headquarters, and last month Amazon selected Long Island City, Queens, and Crystal City, Va., for HQ2. Mr. Case pointed to the other 236 cities as ones with real opportunities also awaiting them. Those are the cities that can really rise, he said. “My hope is that the 236 that lost, if they take half of the energy they put into rallying their community, driving collaboration, and half of the dollars they were putting on the table to lure them, and refocus that on their start-up community, they might create the next Amazon,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,The El Chapo Trial Concludes Month One With Tales of Blood and Money,"Blood and money have dominated the first month of testimony at the trial of Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the Mexican drug lord known as El Chapo. The topics intertwined last week as two Colombian men who supplied Mr. Guzmán with hundreds of tons of cocaine testified over the course of three days. The first man, Juan Carlos Ramírez Abadía, Mr. Guzmán’s main Colombian connection, told the jury in Federal District Court in Brooklyn that he had taken part in at least 150 murders in the years he ran the North Valley drug cartel, both at home in Colombia and elsewhere in South America. Mr. Ramírez, who wore a winter parka and a pair of gloves inside the court, testified about how the blood bath started in the early 1990s, when he ordered the deaths of several workers connected to his New York City drug distribution operation. It continued unabated until 2007, when Mr. Ramírez was arrested at a luxury condo in Brazil. The victims were legion — prosecutors, thieves, former allies, Colombian military officers and a loose-lipped lawyer who once got drunk and talked about his business — but the full scope and details of the killing spree were never aired in court. Judge Brian M. Cogan told the defense that it did not need to thoroughly describe each of the murders Mr. Ramírez took part in to point out he was a violent man. As for the money, Mr. Ramírez told jurors last week that he had once paid a hit squad $338,776 — a detail he recorded in one of many accounting ledgers in which he scrupulously tracked expenditures. Then there was the series of payments — $10 million altogether — he said he made to members of Colombia’s Congress as an enticement to vote against a law that ultimately led to his extradition to the United States. On Wednesday, Mr. Ramírez’s frontman, a Colombian lawyer named German Rosero, told jurors what may be one of the saddest drug-world origin stories. Mr. Rosero recalled how decades earlier, while working as a public defender in Colombia, he turned to Mr. Ramírez for protection when someone threatened his life. He spent the rest of his career paying off that debt. Mr. Rosero served as an ambassador at large of sorts for Mr. Ramírez, working out of Mexico and selling his boss’s cocaine to Mr. Guzmán and other members of the Sinaloa drug cartel. In two days of testimony, he described a typical deal: He would get in contact with one of Mr. Guzmán’s men who would arrange for him to be picked up at a nearby hotel and ferried to an airport. From there, he said, he would board a small plane and fly into the Sierra Madre mountains outside the city of Culíacan in Sinaloa state. Mr. Guzmán, who at that time had recently escaped from prison, usually waited for him at a remote mountain hide-out. One hide-out, Mr. Rosero said, was a farm with a big wooden gate, a normal-looking house and a pool with a palapa. Mr. Rosero would make his pitch to Mr. Guzmán — 3,000 kilos, say, delivered on the open seas by speedboat — while sitting in the shade underneath the palapa. Mr. Guzmán, he recalled, often sat listening in a baseball cap. Though he could be hotheaded when it came to personal slights, Mr. Guzmán seemed relaxed when facing business problems. Once, Mr. Rosero said, the United States Coast Guard seized a mammoth load of more than 12 tons of cocaine that was headed to the Sinaloan traffickers. Hat in hand, Mr. Rosero flew into the mountains to see the kingpin and break the bad news. “He told me we had to keep moving,” Mr. Rosero said. “We had to keep working.” In the early 2000s, Mr. Ramírez went to Brazil, learned Portuguese and underwent a series of face-altering surgeries in an effort to avoid the authorities. Doctors adjusted his jawbone and cheeks. He got a hair transplant, lip implants and his eyes were widened, among other changes. During cross-examination, one of the defense attorneys, William Purpura, who is bald, asked about the hair transplant. “How did that work out for you?” Mr. Ramírez, who still has a head of hair, laughed and said that it had worked out well. Later, Mr. Purpura said, “You were a handsome man.” The prosecution objected. Mr. Purpura pivoted: “You weren’t a handsome man.” Another objection came. On Wednesday, Judge Cogan admonished the jury for not paying attention. “I know there is a lot of testimony to listen to,” he said. “Without singling anyone out, sometimes I look over and wonder if you’re as focused as you should be.” The next day, grueling testimony about tanker cars and secreted cocaine put two jurors to sleep — one still holding his notebook in the air — and a third woman doubled over in her chair. This time, the judge said nothing. Jurors will get two weeks off for the holiday season starting Dec. 20. Bajadores — A word used often during the trial comes from the Spanish verb bajar, meaning “to go down.” (The -dor suffix changes the verb to a noun.) Thus, bajadores has been used during the trial to describe people who bring drug money down from where the drugs are sold. Seizures — Despite having created innovative techniques to hide drugs, including truck traps and false walls, several government agents testified this week about how the Drug Enforcement Administration and the United States Coast Guard seized large shipments of El Chapo’s cocaine and marijuana. The revelations included details about a 1999 raid of 3,500 pounds of marijuana and more than 1,000 kilograms of cocaine, some of it bundled into Robert Wayne Footwear shoeboxes. Later, in 2002, some 1,900 kilos of cocaine was seized from a warehouse in Brooklyn and a similar amount of cocaine was seized the following year in Queens.",The New York Times
2018,The El Chapo Trial: New York’s Newest Tourist Destination,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] The list of New York City’s tourist destinations is long and familiar. Traditionalists can visit the Empire State Building. Theater lovers can go to a Broadway show. And this time of year, who can resist the Christmas tree in Rockefeller Center? But a new and unusual event has recently become a must-see attraction: the drug conspiracy trial of Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the Mexican crime lord known as El Chapo. For the last several weeks, the epic legal drama has been drawing crowds of curious narco-tourists who show up, often before dawn, hoping for a glimpse of the world’s most famous drug dealer. Among the visitors so far: a French scholar of organized crime, an off-duty group of Guatemalan diplomats, a couple from Lithuania, a retired Connecticut banker and a mysterious man carrying a Bible whom court security officers took to calling “The Reverend.” “Everyone back home is jealous — they can’t believe I’m at the El Chapo trial,” said Greg Gold, a lawyer from Denver, who turned up for the spectacle last week. “It’s better entertainment than ‘Les Mis.’” Court buffs are, of course, a common sight at prominent proceedings. But even though Federal District Court in Brooklyn, where Mr. Guzman’s case is being heard, has had its share of blockbuster trials over the years, with boldface defendants like John Gotti, rarely, if ever, have so many ordinary people dropped in for a peek. Getting a spot isn’t easy. There are only about 50 seats in the courtroom, 17 of which are reserved for the media, government officials and Mr. Guzman’s wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro. To secure a place, visitors — including journalists — tend to queue up before 7 a.m. for a trial day that begins at 9:30 and runs, with breaks, until 4:30 p.m. Mr. Gold’s experience was typical. Two weekends ago, he and his girlfriend, who owns an art gallery, flew to Miami for Art Basel, the annual art fair. Then — for him — they flew to New York and made it to the courthouse in time to hear the testimony of one of Mr. Guzmán’s Colombian cocaine suppliers. They stayed a few days, gripped by stories of ton-sized drug deals and cartel bigwigs knocking back mezcal in a remote mountain hideaway. After court let out on Thursday, they flew home to Denver. Gary Merkling, who works in a paper mill near Green Bay, Wis., flew to New York for only one day — last Tuesday — and early that morning stood in line among the throngs of reporters. Mr. Merkling appears to have a fascination with the international cocaine trade. Last year, he said, he went to Colombia to visit the estate of Pablo Escobar, the drug lord who died in a shootout with Colombian authorities in 1993. But Mr. Merkling believes El Chapo is on another level: “I’ve been fascinated with him with for years,” he said. (People have been fascinated with El Chapo from the moment he became a well-known kingpin.) There was another reason for the trip: He had just turned 35. “It’s kind of like a birthday present to myself,” Mr. Merkling said. A cartel connoisseur could not have asked for a better gift. From the moment it began in November, the trial has offered up a cornucopia of drug-world lore — with weird, wild and seemingly unimaginable details. On a single day last week, the jurors heard about a catering company that sneaked cocaine onto airplanes, fraud involving the indigenous people of the Amazonian jungle and a jailhouse murder plot that revolved around a cyanide-laced arepa. There has, at times, been news: On Wednesday, a witness testified that executives from Pemex, Mexico’s national oil company, once discussed a deal with Mr. Guzmán to ship cocaine in the firm’s tanker vessels. There has also been gore: On Thursday, jurors heard the tale of a trafficker who was shot in the heart while parked at a gas station. He died with his daughter sitting beside him. That sort of thing apparently appealed to Max Acker, a former Marine enrolled in the sports management master’s program at Columbia University. Several years ago, he said, he wrote a letter to Richard Ramírez, the serial killer known as the Night Stalker. On Wednesday, he showed up to see El Chapo with a friend who makes movies. “You see him on TV and he’s like a larger-than-life figure,” Mr. Acker said of the kingpin. “But you rarely get to come in contact with guys like this face to face.” Twelve years ago, Agustin Juarez did come face to face with Mr. Guzmán. A TV cameraman who often covers boxing, Mr. Juarez said he was working at a fight in Culiacán, Mexico, and went to a party afterward. When he arrived, he recalled, “My reporter grabbed me and said, ‘Oh my God, look who’s here.’” Mr. Juarez, who lives in Los Angeles, was in New York last week to cover the Canelo Álvarez-Rocky Fielding fight at Madison Square Garden. With a little time to kill, he showed up at the courthouse on Wednesday. “I want to see El Chapo,” he said. Then there was Jeanie Carlson, who flew in from Chicago to catch Monday’s action. Ms. Carlson, who came with her son, said she had worked for decades in Mexico for General Mills and had been at the Guadalajara airport when one of the most infamous murders connected to Mr. Guzmán took place in 1993: the assassination of Cardinal Juan Jesús Posadas Ocampo, a Mexican bishop. “It brings back a lot of memories,” Ms. Carlson said.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The End of Europe?,"France is pivotal in holding the European Union together. Opinion Columnist PARIS — Ever since World War II, the liberal global order that has spread more freedom and prosperity around the world than at any other time in history has been held up by two pillars: the United States of America and the United Nations of Europe, now known as the European Union. Both of these centers of free markets, free people and free ideas are being shaken today by rural and beyond-the-suburbs insurgencies of largely white working-poor and anxious middle classes, which have not generally benefited from the surges in globalization, immigration and technology that have lifted superstar cities like London, Paris and San Francisco and their multicultural populations. Having just seen the shocking sight of Parisian stores boarded up right before Christmas to protect against rioting along the Champs-Élysées by some of France’s yellow-vested protesters; after being told in Rome a few days earlier that Italy, a founding member of the E.U., could conceivably shuck off both the E.U. and the euro one day under its new bizarre far-left/far-right governing coalition; after watching Britain become paralyzed over how to commit economic suicide by leaving the E.U.; and after watching President Trump actually cheer for the breakup of the E.U. rather than for its good health, it is obvious to me that we’re at a critical hinge of history. The core challenge for both the U.S. and the E.U. is the same: These rapid accelerations in technology and globalization have brought many more immigrants into many more remote corners of their societies — public housing in Paris today is dominated by immigrants — at the same time as many long-frozen social mores have changed — like acceptance of gay marriage and transgender rights — and as average work no longer returns an average wage that can sustain an average middle-class lifestyle. The middle classes that powered the growth of the U.S. and the E.U. in the 20th century were built on something called a “high-wage, middle-skilled job.” But robotics and artificial intelligence and outsourcing and Chinese imports have wiped out a lot of middle-skilled routine white-collar and blue-collar work. Now there are high-wage, high-skilled jobs and low-wage, low-skilled jobs. But high-wage, middle-skilled jobs are vanishing, leaving a considerable cohort of people with stagnant incomes and burning resentments at the globalized city slickers who they think look down at them and have mastered the nonroutine skills required for a high-wage job today. When you simultaneously challenge all these things that anchor people — their sense of home, their job security, their prospects for growth and the social norms that, for better or worse, defined their lives — and then amp it all up with social networks, you can get a really ferocious blowback, as France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, saw across his country. On Nov. 24, The Guardian published an illuminating collection of voices from Yellow Vest protesters in Paris that told their stories. There was Florence, 55, who worked for an airfreight company outside Paris, who said of Macron, “When he appears on television we have the impression he is uncomfortable with normal people, that there is a certain contempt for us.” There was Bruno Binelli, 66, a retired carpenter from Lyon, reacting to Macron’s raising the taxes on diesel to combat climate change, leading to fuel costs that hit people in the countryside particularly hard because they have only cars to get around: “I have a little diesel van and I don’t have the money to buy a new one, especially as I’m about to retire. We have the feeling those from the countryside are forgotten.” And there was Marie Lemoine, 62, a schoolteacher from Provins, who said she was neither “right or left,” explaining: “ I’m here for my children and grandchildren and all those people left crying by the 15th of the month because they’ve gone into the red. … Macron is our Louis XVI, and we know what happened to him. He ended up at the guillotine.” It is going to take extraordinary leadership for the U.S., Britain and the E.U. to come up with a strategy for these grievances. It has to balance the need for economic growth and redistribution, the need to take care of those who have been left behind without burdening future generations, the need for free-flowing borders to attract new talent and ideas, and the need to prevent people from feeling like strangers in their own homes. But that leadership is not present. I get why a slim majority of U.K. citizens voted for Brexit — as it was sold to them. They were told they could curb all the stuff they didn’t like — such as a flood of 2.2 million foreign E.U. workers — and still keep all the stuff they liked — mainly Britain’s free access to the E.U. market — and give up nothing. But it was all a lie. And to now watch the Conservative Party hacks who pushed that lie, led by Boris Johnson, continue to demand that their prime minister deliver this fantasy Brexit in the face of the reality that it’s impossible — and in the face of how bad even the second-best option will be — is to watch a once-sane country write a suicide note in a moment of irrationality and then argue endlessly over how to carry it out — death by hanging, poison or a gunshot to the head. They’ve got to reconsider. Disconnecting in a connected world is nuts. Macron, by contrast, dared to do the right things to unlock growth in France, at the right time, “but he did not understand the difference between being right and doing it right,” a French economist, Ludovic Subran, told me. And he did not understand how his policies differently affected “the beer drinkers and the wine drinkers.” Macron set up a totally imperial presidency, built around a tiny team — “they were like a commando unit,” Le Monde writer Alain Frachon remarked to me. Macron pushed through four vital structural fixes that fostered growth: pro-investment tax reforms, reduced pensions for the bloated railway union, relaxed labor rules to make it easier to fire and hire workers, and big new public investments in skills and education for the most disadvantaged. But because Macron’s party didn’t exist until he ran for president, it had no mayors to connect locally with the people and feel their pulse. So Macron was stunned when his royalist, let-them-eat cake, top-down approach produced a vicious backlash after he cut taxes for the wealthy and corporations and sought to pay for some of it with taxes on diesel fuel and pensions — without exempting the rural working classes, which have no mass transit and need to drive everywhere. Feeling humiliated, they donned their yellow vests, drove into the heart of Paris and other cities and lashed out: “Can you hear us now?” Macron “thought he was governing Singapore, not France — a revolutionary country,” added Frachon. “He made every political mistake. He did not miss one.” To save his presidency, a shellshocked Macron busted his budget and canceled the fuel tax hike, raised the minimum wage by 100 euros ($114) a month and scrapped a planned tax on pensions under 2,000 euro ($2,272) per month. But because the Yellow Vests have no leader, no one knows what happens next. “France today has a leader with no followers and an opposition with no leader,” said U.S. foreign policy expert Michael Mandelbaum. And the reason that matters is France and Germany were always the two adults whose partnership and adherence to the E.U. budgets and standards were the cement that held the whole E.U. pillar together. Here is what’s really scary, though. I don’t think there are national solutions to this problem — simply cut taxes or raise taxes — in the way there were in the past. I think the countries that will thrive in this era are the ones that have the most nimble cities, with the most nimble local leaders, who build adaptive coalitions of businesses, educators and social entrepreneurs, who can compete locally, regionally, nationally and globally. In this world, highly centralized countries will fare much worse than decentralized ones. That’s the real shift France has to make, and, if it can’t, watch out for falling pillars. France matters. Dominique Moïsi, one of France’s top foreign policy analysts, put it to me like this: At a time when America, which was always the European Union’s life insurance policy against predatory threats from the East and was the world champion of democracy, begins to withdraw from the world; when Russia returns with a vengeance to global politics; when Germany turns inward and Italy rebels against E.U. spending limits and moves closer to autocratic Russia; when so many roads now lead to Beijing; and when the U.K. is hellbent on suicide, “suddenly what happens in France goes beyond France. We are the last barrier protecting the European idea. If Macron fails, it can bring the end of Europe.” Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The End of Privacy Began in the 1960s,"Choices that Congress made decades ago allowed tech giants to become as powerful as they are. Dr. O’Mara, a professor of history, is the author of a forthcoming book about the history of Silicon Valley. In the fall of 1965, President Lyndon Johnson’s administration announced a plan to consolidate hundreds of federal databases into one centralized National Data Bank. It was meant as an efficiency move to make the Great Society even greater. But there were many Americans who were worried about privacy — from civil rights leaders and student activists under surveillance by the F.B.I. to lawmakers who had begun to question J. Edgar Hoover’s use of his electronic arsenal — and the National Data Bank confirmed their darkest fears. In the years that followed, Congress convened headline-making hearings, slamming the databank idea and warning of government information-gathering run amok. The privacy warriors of the 1960s would have been astounded by what the tech industry has become. They would be more amazed to realize that the policy choices they made back then — to demand data transparency rather than limit data collection, and to legislate the behavior of government but not private industry — enabled today’s tech giants to become as large and powerful as they are. The House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to question Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google, over allegations of bias in its algorithms, and energized Democrats are vowing to turn up the heat on tech companies over antitrust and privacy when they take over House leadership in January. There is a growing recognition in Silicon Valley and Washington that current data privacy regulations need to be changed. Understanding how American lawmakers approached these issues in the past is essential to getting it right this time. The mid-1960s were the heyday of punch-card-powered mainframe computers. In the two decades since their invention, digital machines had proved capable of processing a dizzying amount of information. Much of this data was personal, from medical information to military records to the type of cereal families bought at the supermarket, and there were no legal limits on what kind of data could be collected or by whom. The targeted marketing business until then had been largely left alone by regulators because it was so inexact. The computer age, however, transformed consumer targeting into a far more powerful science. Worries about data privacy erupted in the spring of 1964 with the publication of “The Naked Society,” by Vance Packard, a journalist best known for his unsparing critique of modern advertising. “The Naked Society” made a comparable assessment of the marketing schemes of big corporations, noting their immense and profitable traffic in personal data about American consumers. But he trained most of his attention on the entity that was then the largest user of mainframe computing power: the United States government. Unnerving amounts of personal information now could be sucked into bureaucratic databases, Packard observed. “There are banks of giant memory machines that conceivably could recall in a few seconds every pertinent action — including failures, embarrassments or possibly incriminating acts — from the lifetime of each citizen,” he wrote. Packard hit a nerve. Congress convened a Special Subcommittee on the Invasion of Privacy and started hearings into the government’s databank proposal in July 1966. The leading privacy crusader in the House, New Jersey’s Neil Gallagher, was a Johnson ally who believed that the databank had some merit but that the plan didn’t do enough to protect personal information. On the Senate side, North Carolina’s Sam Ervin was a critic of the president’s expansive domestic agenda and saw the databank as yet another sign of executive overreach. “The computer never forgets,” Ervin warned. Amid the growing distrust of the government’s decisions in Vietnam, the threat of computer databases became irresistible media fodder. “Would It Threaten Your Privacy?” a headline in The New York Times asked. “The names of most Americans appear repeatedly in government files,” The Times noted, “for a total of nearly 2.8 billion listings.” The uproar killed the National Data Bank. Over 100 pieces of data privacy legislation were introduced over the following years. The few that passed were landmarks — the Freedom of Information Act in 1967, the Fair Credit Reporting Act in 1970, and the Privacy Act in 1974 — but all of them focused on individuals’ right to know about the information these databases held. None addressed the question of whether this information should have been gathered in the first place. The push for data transparency rather than data restriction was in keeping with American legal precedents and political traditions that long predated the computer age. As the legal scholar Alan Westin observed in 1967, the United States cherished both individual privacy and the free flow of information, and the latter value usually prevailed. This was a contrast to Western Europe, where privacy was something to be carefully protected, and therefore treated with a far more robust regulatory approach. In being so relentlessly focused on the government’s use and abuse of data, Congress paid little attention to what private industry was doing. American companies remained free to gather data on the people who used their products. Congress is again wrestling with the balance between freedom of information and the right to privacy. Proposals for greater transparency — such as labeling bots so people know when they are interacting with a machine, and providing access for consumers to the data that companies obtain about them — are important first steps. But industry and lawmakers need to take a hard look at the data that companies are allowed to collect in the first place. Congress should recognize what it did not half a century ago: protecting privacy is bigger than quashing one databank, condemning one company or curbing one industry. And the decisions made now will shape technological generations to come. The computer never forgets.

2018,The End of a Dog’s Life,"Instead of euthanasia for my aging dog, I tried a palliative and hospice care approach to ease his pain and give him more time to enjoy life. They say cats have nine lives, but my dog, Mason, seemed to have almost that many in the last two and a half years of his life. He cheated death time and again, and I believe it was largely because he had excellent end-of-life health care. A decade ago, someone in my situation might have opted for euthanasia with the idea that it would put an end to his suffering. But the palliative and hospice care approach I took not only eased his pain but also gave him more days happily enjoying life. The first crisis came in 2015 when he was given a prognosis of less than a year to live with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure. I followed my veterinarian’s care instructions — avoiding food with sodium, dispensing medications twice daily, making sure he had lots of rest and adequate exercise — but I was missing writing deadlines for my latest book and generally feeling awful. One afternoon, my mother handed me a copy of Atul Gawande’s “Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End.” “I know most people read this book when they think about caring for their parents,” she said gently. “But I really think you should read it about caring for your dog.” By then, Mason was 12 years old and had been with me for nearly all of my adult life. I had moved several times, started a business, navigated friendships and relationships, finished graduate school, and written my first two books with him by my side. I felt a sense of responsibility that he was well cared for in his final days. It’s no secret that pets are an integral part of many American households. According to the 2017-18 National Pet Owners Survey conducted by the American Pet Products Association, 68 percent of American households — or about 85 million families — have a pet, and 60.2 million of those households have dogs. Doggie day cares, pet spas, organic food, non-BPA toys and training programs have become commonplace. The survey found that Americans spent approximately $69.51 billion on their pets in 2017. But we don’t spend much of it on health insurance. End-of-life care can be expensive for humans and pets, and one of the reasons Mason received such excellent care was because I had luckily purchased a pet insurance policy years earlier on the recommendation of a friend who had cared for several aging dogs. Though relatively uncommon in the United States and Canada, pet insurance is a mainstay for many European pet owners. The first known pet insurance policy was written in Sweden in 1890 by Claes Virgin. According to Sweden’s National Veterinary Institute, nearly 80 percent of dog owners in Sweden have pet insurance. But in the United States, only about 3 percent of families have it. According to data from the North American Pet Health Insurance Association, 2.1 million pets were insured in the United States and Canada in 2017, up 17 percent from the previous year. The policy I had for Mason, which my friend suggested, was from a company called Trupanion. It covered 90 percent of his treatments, not including examinations and prescriptions. The company’s chief veterinary officer, Dr. Steve Weinrauch, was a practicing vet in England before moving to the United States with his wife, a Scottish veterinarian, and he said he noticed a marked difference in the way people approached veterinary care in Europe versus the United States. In Britain, most of the pets he saw had medical insurance and their owners readily agreed to the treatments he suggested. In the United States, he found that pet owners who were just as caring would sometimes delay treatment or try conservative rather than proactive treatments because of cost, and then would be upset when their pet’s condition did not improve or greatly deteriorated. It may seem extravagant to purchase pet insurance at a time when many humans can’t afford health insurance in the United States, and I didn’t openly admit to many people that I’d done so. But I was surprised to find that it covered a wide range of care, including acupuncture, fluid therapy, chemotherapy, blood work, CT scans, M.R.I.s and physical therapy — not all of which Mason needed. “The pet is almost the same as the child to a lot of people,” said Dr. Diane Roberts, a San Francisco Bay Area veterinarian and medical director of SAGE Centers for Veterinary Specialty and Emergency Care, where Mason received treatment. Conversations around end-of-life care, palliative care and hospice treatment have a growing place in veterinary care. For years, euthanasia after a terminal diagnosis was somewhat common, but today, according to Dr. Roberts, pet owners “keep their pets comfortable for longer. They are more willing to give meds and care than they were 20 years ago.” According to the website of the International Association for Animal Hospice and Palliative Care, founded in 2009, “Hospice exists in the belief that patients in the last phases of life deserve this care so that they might live as fully and comfortably as possible.” For pets, hospice care mainly includes pain management and comfort care that focuses on maintaining quality of life. Hospice and palliative care can prolong a pet’s life with the option of euthanasia if it is determined to be the humane course of action. “Being Mortal” shifted my own fears around end-of-life and death into a focus on living a good life, with lessons I applied to my own life as well as to that of my aging dog. I began to focus on comfort and quality of life rather than drastic medical interventions. Pretty soon, we had a morning routine of going to a nearby park or beach, a treat once reserved for weekends or days off. Mason began perking up from the back seat whenever he realized we were blocks away, enthusiastically putting his paws on the center console. And then, Mason surprised everyone. Twelve months after his diagnosis, Mason’s enlarged heart had returned to a relatively normal size, and his heart murmur, though still pronounced, was not cause for great concern. His veterinarian said Mason was one of approximately 2 percent of dogs he’d seen whose condition actually reversed and improved since diagnosis. The combination of medications he was given for heart failure — pimobendan, Lasix and enalapril — seemed to work well, and over time his dosage was reduced. Over the next year and a half, Mason moved through heart failure, intervertebral disc disease, bladder cancer and kidney failure with awe-inspiring fortitude. Once, after a four-day hospitalization for kidney failure, the doctors wrote on his discharge papers how they had explained to me that we were likely in a hospice situation. Five days later, he was prancing at the park and begging for extra treats, leaving everyone dumbfounded. Because of Mason’s remarkable resilience, it was hard for me to know when his time was really near. About a week before he died, he became more fragile and more resistant to leaving home, getting up only to move between dog beds or to go to the bathroom. I had read a great deal about signs that a dog is dying, but it was really Shanti Zinzi, the veterinary assistant who administered Mason’s fluid therapy, who provided the most invaluable guidance, texting and emailing and providing in-home care — all covered by pet insurance — to make sure he was resting comfortably, and I put a plan in place in case his condition worsened. In the end, Mason died quietly and peacefully on his own at home one Wednesday afternoon. His end-of-life care reminded me of the importance of living well. “Unfortunately,” Dr. Weinrauch said of pets, “none of them can live long enough.” Ana Homayoun is the author of three books, most recently, “Social Media Wellness: Helping Tweens and Teens Thrive in an Unbalanced Digital World.”",The New York Times

2018,The Ethics of Genetically Editing Babies,"Listen and subscribe to our podcast from your mobile device: Via Apple Podcasts | Via RadioPublic | Via Stitcher Ever since scientists created the powerful gene-editing technique Crispr, they have braced for the day when it would be used to produce a genetically altered human being. Now, the moment they feared may have come. What’s likely to happen next? We also look at the latest updates on a possible government shutdown. On today’s episode: Jennifer Senior, an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times. Carl Zimmer, a science columnist for The Times. Background reading: He Jiankui, a researcher in China, announced last month that twin girls had been born with genes that he had edited, setting off the latest in a string of scientific controversies in the country. What exactly did Dr. He claim he had done, and why are scientists around the world so upset about it? We break it down.

2018,Opinion | The Exhilaration of Revolt,"Teachers who have taken their fight to the streets have drawn our attention in the past years, but many others are rising up, too. Ms. Jaffe is the author of “Necessary Trouble: Americans in Revolt.” As the organizer Mariame Kaba says, “Hope is a discipline.” That discipline is what sustains organizers who often grind away unseen for years. This is, most of the time, what unions and working people’s organizations do: make connections, and hope the sparks they light will catch and burn. On Dec. 15, an estimated 50,000 people marched in the streets of Los Angeles alongside the nation’s second-largest local teachers’ union, United Teachers Los Angeles. These teachers are fighting not just for higher wages (though as for all the teachers recently on strike, theirs are unacceptably low) but also, and unapologetically, for racial and economic justice. They serve, according to the union’s president, Alex Caputo-Pearl, a public school district whose student body is 95 percent minority and over 85 percent low-income. They’re fighting, they say, for the schools those students deserve — with nurses and counselors, arts funding, smaller classes and ethnic studies programs. They drew parents and students beside them into the streets, and onto the stage days later when they announced they would strike on Jan. 10 if those demands were not met. Teachers who have taken their fights to the streets have drawn the biggest share of our attention in the past years, but it has not just been them. The words “Green New Deal,” a demand that its proponents say can combine the needs of working people for decent jobs and a livable planet, are on the lips of many people — even in countries where the New Deal has little cultural resonance. But it was a sit-in in Congress, joined by a couple of insurgent new members, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib, who thrust the demand onto the public stage even as the Democratic Party’s establishment continues to try to water it down. In Britain, the new climate protesters call themselves Extinction Rebellion and clog streets through civil disobedience. The real extinction rebellion may have to look a lot more like the one going on in France, where the “Yellow Vests” have refused to accept the costs of climate adaptation being thrust onto the backs of a working class that has been hit again and again since 2008’s economic collapse. They are a potent reminder of what happens when working people see the wealthy cushioned from the results of their actions, while the resources they need are sliced away and they are exhorted to just work harder. The strikes and sit-ins are often carefully planned, but the exhilaration of revolt can take many forms, and once learned, it’s hard to forget.

2018,Opinion | The Family History DNA Can’t Reveal,"I could try to find out where my ancestors may have come from, but that is never going to show me what I’ve actually inherited. Contributing Opinion Writer When I was growing up, someone was always asking a member of our family, “Where are you from?” Usually, it was my mother. She has high cheekbones, deep, wide-set eyes and light brown skin with prominent freckles. Since we grew up in an area with a small black population, her appearance drew more notice than I think it would have elsewhere. Whoever was asking usually wanted to claim her as their own. Once, my sisters, our mother and I were in an epic, four-way fight in the car while holiday shopping. As our mother steered us out of the parking garage, the lot attendant waved her payment away. He was from Ethiopia and assumed she was too. He complimented her on what a great mother she must be — our windows had been rolled up, so he hadn’t heard the yelling. I don’t look like my mother. When I was younger and people asked, “Where are you from?” they usually wanted confirmation of my West Indian heritage. “My dad is from Barbados,” is how I usually answered the question of why I had the face I had. “Where are you from?” is a question we sometimes think we can find an answer to with DNA. One of my first jobs out of college was coordinating a community African-American genealogical class in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. It was run by a married couple from New Jersey, a former police officer and a former private investigator who dedicated their retirement to black genealogy. They had said in the class that DNA testing was a tricky thing for black people trying to trace their past. Different DNA testing companies have different proprietary DNA databases. This means you can get a different result depending on which company you use. If the company you’ve chosen doesn’t include information about your particular genetic background in its database, it may simply report that you don’t have that ancestry. If you have African ancestry, it becomes even trickier. The African slave trade to the United States ended, with some exceptions, more than 170 years ago. If you are matching your DNA to a database of African populations you are usually comparing yourself with present-day population samples, not the DNA of someone who may have lived in that area 170 or even 200 or 400 years before. Also, there is more genetic variation among African people than among Europeans, yet much of the information in the most popular commercial DNA databases contains only a fraction of the full African DNA spectrum. But people still believe in DNA and want it to reveal some “truth” about the depth and reach of family history. The scholar Alondra Nelson, author of the book “The Social Life of DNA,” wrote about the “democratization of DNA analysis” and asked this important question: Why is DNA analysis deemed to proffer more valuable or reliable information about a person’s familial history than their own words? For my mother’s family, like all African-American families, the question of “Where are you from?” is a complicated one. My great-grandfather on my mother’s side was Lumbee. The Lumbee are a tribe from North Carolina that includes the descendants of free Africans who married Native Americans. They were not recognized by the federal government and by some other tribes because of this. A DNA test would not reveal any of this history. It would not tell me anything about one of the enduring stories in my family, that my great-grandfather helped to found schools for his people at the turn of the last century and was forced to leave North Carolina when his entire town was burned to the ground, presumably by people who disliked the town’s organizing. He came north. He went to Dartmouth College. He studied there in the early 1900s, amid the rise of eugenics movements. He was with a handful of other black students. One of them, lighter-skinned, remembered him only as “that little black man.” His skin was the darkest of all of them. When he graduated from Dartmouth, he was still listed in the New Hampshire census as a popcorn seller. Many northern white universities would not hire a black English professor in 1910. He left his family to travel the South for decades, teaching at black colleges. He created my grandmother, one of the strongest, most-loving, smartest women I ever knew. I was terrified of her for most of my life. She moved to an all-white suburb of Boston at the start of the 1950s to make sure that her children had access to a good education. She worked for years as an administrative assistant at Harvard University and opened her doors to international students in the Boston area every Thanksgiving. She, too, had a school — an informal one she ran for my mother and her siblings during the summer so that they could be twice as good as everyone else once they got to school in the fall. If I were to have a child now, its DNA would not contain any trace of any of this story and would certainly not act as evidence to support it. I would, perhaps, look to see whether it loved books and education as much as its maternal ancestors did. But DNA would not reveal whether a child I had now would have the fortitude to survive the world it would be born into. If I had a child now, it would be a part-black, part-Jewish child in a country where white supremacist attacks do not look to be ending anytime soon. It would be a country that could lose much of its coastline to rising sea levels. The morning after the 2016 election, overwhelmed with what felt like the inescapable pull of history and biology, I told my mother: “I guess this means I’m never having children. I can’t imagine giving birth to a child under Trump, and in four years it will be too late for me.” She wrote me back to tell me she loved me with all her heart and to assure me that she never regretted having any of us. She reminded me that black and biracial babies will always be born, no matter who is president. “Maybe the child would grow into someone who carries on this legacy of finding a way to make a difference in the world,” she wrote. My mother understood what I was grappling with, and said: “I do not wish you had been born in another skin or body, as painful as being a person of color can be. There is also great pride, great joy and an inner strength that can feel the pain and rise through it.” She continued: “We will survive this through our strength as a family and as a people. We each have to reconcile it for ourselves, but we will.” I think about what people are looking for when they talk about ancestry. When they take a DNA test, is it this history they are hoping to find, or an alternative to what we know of the past? Malinda Maynor Lowery is a historian of Lumbee tribal history. This fall, she wrote on Twitter about the concept of genograms. Originally, they were a resource for families — you write down the diseases that occur in your family tree so that everyone can be aware of what you might inherit. But Professor Lowery argued for expanding what we include in a genogram, citing the work of Jessica Lambert Ward. What if we mapped the strengths passed down, for the things that helped our ancestors survive in a hostile world? Isn’t that an echo of what we are looking for when we try to determine which tribe in West Africa we may have come from, which kin group we might claim? Sometimes we’re looking in our blood for a map from our ancestors, when it has always been here, in how we talk to and love one another.

2018,The Family-Run Store That’s Sold New York’s Best Lox Since 1914,"The 212 Russ & Daughters has served its beloved bagels, bialys and smoked fish for over a century, but its legacy is about much more than food. In this series for T, the author Reggie Nadelson revisits New York institutions that have defined cool for decades, from time-honored restaurants to unsung dives. A chilly day in early December and I’m sitting on a bench outside Russ & Daughters, eating a hot latke. Made of grated potato and onions, fried until golden brown, crispy outside, fluffy within, these are eaten to celebrate Hanukkah, which began last night. Down-home types eat them with sour cream or apple sauce; better still is the Russ way, with crème fraîche and a nice spoonful of red caviar, the fat red salmon roe that you can pop with your tongue. Eight nights of Hanukkah, eight occasions to nosh a latke. Eating the latke here, I’m thinking about my father. I’ve come to Russ because so much of my own life is invested in this little shop on the Lower East Side, where my father was born and grew up. Sitting here, I feel the weight of all this history. Almost a century ago, as a little kid, my pop was probably eyeing a plump schmaltz herring or a pickle at Joel Russ’s first shop, which opened on Orchard Street in 1914. A few years later, Russ moved here, to 179 East Houston. Maybe it’s a Jewish thing, this combination of joy and melancholy expressed through food. “Food is one of the deepest ways we have to connect to and take pride in who we are,” says Niki Russ Federman, who co-owns the store with her cousin Josh Russ Tupper. Mr. Russ had no sons, so he gave the store to his three daughters, and one of them, Anne, begot Mark and Tara, and Mark begot Niki, and Tara, Josh. Niki and Josh opened the Russ & Daughters Cafe on Orchard Street in 2014 and, two years later, another one at the Jewish Museum uptown. They’re the fourth generation, and counting. On the front of the shop is the pink-and-green neon sign with two little lox next to the lettering. Outside, a line has formed. A new generation has discovered the shop, and if you are a real Russ-nik, you wait. After all, inside is Paradise. To your left as you enter is a counter that runs the length of the store. Here is the shining pink lox, that fatty, salty, cured-belly lox that, with cream cheese on a bagel, has given its name to the greatest sandwich ever produced by humankind — this is a fine thing anywhere, but at Russ, it is the ne plus ultra. And then down the counter is the more expensive, less salty, la-di-da Nova. Other smoked salmons are arrayed in one of the glass cases, like a United Nations of salmon: salmons from Norway, Scotland, Ireland. There’s smoked sturgeon that will produce creamy translucent slices and smoked sable (black cod) and those little golden-skinned chub, baby-size white fish, not to mention caviars and roes, vats of cream cheese, scallion and the herrings in cream sauce, in wine sauce, chopped herring salad, fresh herrings from Holland, when they come, or French herring, if you’re fancy. Latkes are now available all year round; so is the gefilte fish and matzo ball soup, once sold only for Passover. On the wall at the back are family photographs, evocative black-and-white pictures from across the 20th century of Mr. Russ, the three daughters and their children. So much history; so much time passing. Half a dozen slicers and servers are working; white coats on, they look up to answer questions and take orders, and if they recognize a regular, there’s an exchange about kids and family. Chhapte Sherpa, an assistant manager, jokes that his New York name is Sherpa Lox. This is a guy who guided people to Everest Base Camp once upon a time and in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy ran up twelve flights to deliver food to people who were stranded. “Shall I make you your sandwich?” calls out Herman Vargas, one of the managers. Herman has been with Russ for more than thirty years, since he arrived from the Dominican Republic. “Half,” I say. “I already ate a latke.” “A bissel butter?” He makes me my bespoke sandwich, a lightly buttered toasted bialy with smoked sturgeon and smoked salmon. Vargas learned English at Russ, but also plenty of Yiddish so he could chat with the older customers. The best part of Russ — well, not quite as good as the reserve smoked sturgeon — has always been the socializing. You go in before a holiday, any holiday, and the place is packed with people and their parents and their kids, maybe kids who are now grandparents themselves. You wait for your order; you kibitz relentlessly. Mark Federman, Niki’s father who quit his law practice to take up with the lox racket and ran the place with his wife, Maria, for years, was a Grade-A schmoozer, and a lovely guy; he still is. Niki and Josh are coming along nicely in the art. Johanna Shipman, the other manager, prefers the Norwegian smoked salmon. Her favorite way to eat Russ food is “with friends or family at home,” she says. Opposite the fish counter, near the front of the store, are the piles of dried fruits like jewelry — apricots, pineapple, dates, pears, papaya. Glass jars contain chocolate-covered jellies and three kinds of halvah and doughnuts for Hanukkah. Also: the rugelach, the salty caramel macaroons, the black-and-white cookies. All of it now baked at the new Russ facility in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, a place so big and white, clean and fragrant, Joel Russ would surely have imagined heaven this way. Soon, a retail shop will open there. “One for the road,” says Josh, holding up a golden bagel. The Russ bagel, also baked at the Navy Yard, is possibly the best in town. This is a great bagel, a Nobel Prize bagel, the gold ring of life, glistening and crusty, hard but chewy, a bagel that’s like reading Philip Roth. In “Operation Shylock,” Roth recalls the aromas of the Newark shop where, in the 1940s, his family shopped for Sunday breakfast: “ … the bitter fragrance of vinegar, of onions, of whitefish and red herring, of everything pickled, peppered, salted, smoked, soaked, stewed, marinated, and dried, smells with a lineage that, like these stores themselves, more than likely led straight back through the shtetl to the medieval ghetto and the nutrients of those who lived frugally and could not afford to dine à la mode, the diet of sailors and common folk, for whom the flavor of the ancient preservatives was life.” An earlier headline with this article misstated which product Russ & Daughters has sold since 1914; it is lox, not latkes. The article also misidentified a fish; sable is commonly known as black cod, not as cod, which is in a different family.",The New York Times
2018,"The Far Out Freestyle Fashion of Byron Bay, Australia","STREET STYLE Playful looks abound in this beach community where the waves become a runway — hiding out as far east as you can go in Australia. When dressing, comfort is always my top priority. It’s got to be effortless, ready to go. I'm not into buying the newest, latest and greatest — every now and then I’ll buy a staple piece. I love my bikinis to have a bit more coverage. This one is from a local designer, Saint Helena, and I love them because they are feminine and offer that coverage. I don’t want to be coming off a wave and worrying about where my bottoms and tops are. The girls surfing here at The Pass are pretty stylish. The wave can be a bit of a runway, there are lots of girls in high cut bikinis and jewelry. I’m not into it as much but I can appreciate the beauty of it. It’s fun. There are so many female surfers here, it is a female-dominated line up now, hence why I think fashion and surfing is popular here. The waves are relaxed and mellow, everyone is happy to share. Party waves! I believe that the ego is your flavor, so my style changes from tribal to angelic, fairy, gypsy. I like to dress with a sense of magic and elemental mysticism. I paint my face every day, I feel naked if I don’t and each day my face paint is different. Today’s paint in more representative of my tribal heritage. I’m given a lot of my clothes from people’s throw-outs and I’ll go through them and make adjustments to suit my style. I like to clown around. People need more silliness in their life. Byron is full of fringe dwellers like myself. Carley, designer: I’m heavily into dressing in vintage finds, there are so many amazing unique pieces to be found and the reuse of clothes is important to me as a stop to consuming. I’m hugely inspired by my granny’s house, as a child I remember visiting and being mesmerized by her collection of colorful and eclectic things she had collected on her many travels. We’re on a journey to find a new home. We like it here and we keep returning, there are so many like-minded people. The Byron Bay area feels like home for us, there is such a lovely attitude here, you’re free to wear what you like and be who you want to be. Kamil, fashion photographer: I grew up in Poland and I used to dress in gray and black. Poland has that Eastern European vibe, you don’t want to stand out, and you want to be invisible. There are a lot of judgments in the small towns and dressing like this can bring unwanted attention and lead to trouble. I first met Carley in London. The way she dressed seemed more like me so I started to dress that way too. It felt liberating. She makes a lot of my clothes and has a real talent for styling. I like to dress for comfort and color. This shirt I wear is a Christian Dior and is from a second hand shop. Feather: The reason I call myself Feather, I was going on a trip to Africa on my own because my husband had passed away about 6 months prior. I never collected feathers at that stage, I had nothing to do with feathers, I got out of the shower the morning I was leaving and there was a white feather on the bathroom floor. I picked it up and started collecting feathers. I was writing poetry at the time so I called myself lone feather. I’ve been collecting feathers ever since and have also incorporated feathers into my dress style. It’s a hot climate and the sea also inspires me, it’s very influential in what I wear. I wear a lot of white, blues, turquoises and always cowrie shells. I’ve lived by the beach for about 40 years. You have the freedom to go overboard, nobody takes to much notice if you do so. Don’t let age define you, wear anything you want to wear, there’s no fashion police around here. I feel the best today. The style here is absolute freedom, I feel so happy to be here. Kiata: My sense of style is very personal, not really reflecting the external world. I love to dress according to my whim and that’s usually very feminine styles. When I was younger, I used to have a lot of pain in my heart and I started to self-harm as a way to externalize my inner pain. When I reached the age of 16, I got my first tattoo and I realized that it was the same pain I was experiencing from harming, a surrender, so I started to get tattooed. Every single tattoo that I have represents a process that I was going through in my life. I turned my emotional pain and scars into beauty. I used to love sitting for full days; my latest one, last week, I sat for 6 hours straight, and it was an amazing experience. I have both arms full and a full back. Mandy: I’m a hunter and gatherer, I find things and put them together. Ever since I was a little girl I’ve wanted to put more color in the world. I use the Lady of Guadalupe a lot. I have no attachment to Catholicism; for me it’s an aspect of the goddess. One of my main things is for people to take themselves less seriously. Be a joke unto yourself, which is one of my mottos. And keep them guessing! I’m quite shy, people find that hard to believe because of the way I dress. Frida Kahlo is a big inspiration for me, I love her story. I too have had a lot of health issues, I think that is part of my journey. It doesn’t matter how good-looking the clothes are, if they are not comfortable then I’m not wearing it. I love dresses that are floaty and airy and that I do not need to wear underwear underneath. If I wear a black dress like today, then I need to also wear something with a lot of flowers. My skin is so earthy, so I like to wear a lot of colors. I like Byron Bay because there are so many people free to dress the way they want to. I’ve never been to a place that wasn’t a festival that has people so freely and unapologetically dressed the way they want to dress. I really love that. I’m originally from Sweden, there is a mentality there of “this is fashion and this is how you are supposed to dress,” it’s more judgmental. Brock: I like to be expressive. We both have the long hair, it’s a surfer look. Girls like it. The long hair looks like the “I don’t care” look, but really you have to put more effort into maintaining it, so it’s definitely to impress the girls. I like to take it chilled, not make any plans. Stay as close to the ocean as I can. Being outdoors is a priority. Cam: I love the lifestyle here. Being in my twenties, there are plenty of other people the same age doing the same thing. It’s a massive mixed culture, its very communal. It’s easy to meet people here. Jango: I travel around the world collecting precious stones and making jewelry to sell. I’m originally from Japan, I used to live and work in Tokyo. It was too busy, so I quit and started traveling around to mines worldwide, collecting stones. The embellishment on my vest is from Ethiopia and the feathers in my hat I found on the street in Bali. I like that the things I wear have unique memories attached to them. Natalie: I pretty much like to be able to go swimming whenever I can so I’m always in a bikini and then I’ll just chuck some pants on. Utility pants are my go-to so I’m ready to do anything. I like to be able to feel feminine and also strong and grounded at the same time. The jewelry I’m wearing around my neck I have made myself from stones that I have found. Byron is full of a mix of styles, it’s a great place to come, lose yourself and then redefine yourself. I dress quite eclectically. When I’m in Byron, I dress to match the hippie vibe and wear anything that’s beach-friendly. When I’m in the city, I’ll dress much quirkier, but I like to shop in Byron for the local labels. Louella: All my pieces are either gifts from friends or secondhand clothes. These earrings are a gift from Peru, they are of a sacred mythical bird. I made my own head crown. I grew up in Sydney and the first time I came here I found my place, my people, I had found the Promised Land. We are all the black sheep here, of course. We are all the people who didn’t work out in the mainstream, so we accept each other, so people here dress with a sense of individuality. Jesse: My mum has taught me the most about having style. All of the items I have on today are from markets or from my mum’s drawer. She is a big inspiration to my style. I had really bad style for a long time, she would subtly make suggestions, now we are very similar in style. I used to only dress in suits, only brands like Hugo Boss, but that didn’t feel right anymore with my changing lifestyle, I wanted to look more flowery, colorful, alternative and special. This is also how I ended up in Byron Bay. People could be so much more beautiful if they could be brave enough to wear what they feel like. I’m impressed by the way the women dress in Byron. I’m a really funky street style person and every day depends on my mood and energy. I live here in a beautiful paradise, so I’m enjoying it. Known as the rainbow region, it is all about inclusion here. My favorite tattoo of mine is on my hand. It means self-love. I have been through a really tough time in my life. It reminds me to love myself.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Farm Bill Ignores the Real Troubles of U.S. Agriculture ,"True farming reform means adjusting the system to support small and midsize producers and cultivating a more sustainable system of agriculture. Ms. Olmstead is a writer who contributes to The American Conservative, The Week, The Washington Post and other publications. Amid a five-year farm recession, continuing woes for small dairy farmers and a trade war with China, a lot is riding on this year’s Farm Bill. But the version Congress approved this week and that President Trump is expected to sign could make a bad situation worse. For years, Farm Bill subsidies have been skewed to benefit the rich and powerful. The 2018 subsidies — nearly $900 billion worth — reinforces the status quo, and that’s a danger not just to small farmers but to the nation’s farms, period. From 1996 to 2016, the top 10 percent of the companies that received the Farm Bill’s commodity subsidies — the biggest operations in sales — accounted for 77 percent of the total. This year’s bill continues to offer enormous subsidies to large corporations rather than prioritizing the needs of struggling small farmers. Farms in the top 10 percent for crop sales received 68 percent of all crop insurance subsidies in 2014, according to the American Enterprise Institute. Yet this year's Farm Bill exempts marketing loan gains and loan deficiency payments (generally used by farmers when, because market prices are low, they would rather store than sell their crop) from payment limitations. It also permits farmers’ children and spouses — without ever having set foot on the farm — to count as “actively engaged” in farming, thus qualifying them for $125,000 worth of subsidy payments. It also allows nephews, nieces and cousins to be “daisy chained” in to receive these payments as well. “Instead of making much-needed reforms to the nation’s farm safety net programs, the final 2018 Farm Bill expands existing loopholes,” the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition noted. Many of these subsidies aren’t even going to rural farmers working the land: The Environmental Working Group has found that nearly 18,000 Americans living in the nation’s largest cities received more than $63 million in farm subsidies in 2015 and 2016. Senator Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa, tried to attach an amendment that would tighten the bill’s definition of “actively engaged in farming,” ensuring that subsidy payments would be collected only by those who live or work on a farm, but it was rejected by the conference committee leaders who put together the final version of the bill. It’s no wonder the conservative Heritage Foundation calls the Farm Bill a “reverse Robin Hood” program. The new bill will also cut funding for the Conservation Stewardship Program, which encourages proper land management. That program has promoted crop rotation, cover cropping, farm forage-based grazing and other methodologies that prevent soil erosion and improve the environmental sustainability of farming operations. Congress generally gets away with Farm Bill cronyism with little to no public outcry. This could be in part because its creators advertise the bill with pictures of rolling wheat and young farm families and suggest that the bill helps keep American agriculture alive. But it may also be because the bill itself is gigantic and difficult to summarize. It covers commodity subsidies, land conservation, agricultural trade policy, food stamps, farm credit loans, rural economic development, agricultural research and teaching policy, forestry and horticulture programs, pesticide use and federal crop insurance policy. The first “farm bill” was passed in 1933 in response to the ravages of the Depression and the Dust Bowl. It offered farmers a combination of commodity price supports and supply controls while seeking to reverse the catastrophic damage to soil and grassland caused by overproduction. In the 85 years since then, the Farm Bill has turned into an $800 billion-plus fusion of complex programs and policies. House Republicans, even those in the fiscally conservative Freedom Caucus, have demonstrated a widespread apathy for true agricultural reform. Democrats denounced Republican cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly food stamps) but rarely highlight the hypocrisy inherent in Republicans’ willingness to pour taxpayer dollars into the pockets of large agribusiness corporations — indeed, they often side with Republicans in promulgating these programs. This year’s bill could be worse. The House’s iteration of it, which was passed on a party-line vote in May, would have made it possible for 10 percent or more of the nation’s commodity farms to become eligible for unlimited subsidy payments overnight. It axed funding and authority for the Conservation Stewardship Program, cut funding for several conservation programs, and failed to renew mandatory funding for several local and organic food-encouraging programs — including a farmers’ market promotion initiative, a grant program for young and beginning farmers, and a cost share program that helps farmers procure and maintain organic certification. Most notoriously, the House bill’s creators introduced stricter work requirements for users of food stamps, requiring able-bodied adult beneficiaries to work or participate in work training for 20 hours per week. The reforms could have caused as many as two million food stamp recipients to lose benefits or see them reduced. The final bill maintains most of this coverage. It folds the farmers’ market and young and beginning farmers grant programs into a Local Agriculture Market Program that will get $60 million in permanent funding going forward. It also combines the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program with Section 2501, which serves socially disadvantaged and veteran farmers and ranchers into a Farming Opportunities Training and Outreach Program. That will provide $50 million yearly over the next four years to help these groups get started in agriculture — a growing need as the average farmer’s age continues to increase and as American farmers continue to skew white and male. The final bill does make some changes to food stamps aimed at work force development programs, better case management and encouraging nutritious food purchases, but leaves out House Republicans’ broader plans for work requirements. In recent years, American farmers have endured slumping prices for corn, wheat and other commodities caused by a glut of grain worldwide. The Wall Street Journal warned in early 2017 that “the next few years could bring the biggest wave of farm closures since the 1980s.” The alarming trends call for urgent attention and action — but it’s not what we get from the new bill. As fewer and older farmers produce a less diverse and sustainable array of food, we desperately need to support small and midsize producers and cultivate a more sustainable system of agriculture. Ultimately, Farm Bill reform is not just about saving taxpayer money or fighting cronyism — it is about saving the nation’s farms.

2018,Opinion | The Fashion Plates of Schulman’s,"The men of this immigrant Jewish community had the synagogue — my grandfather and his friends went every day. The women had the store. Ms. Schulman’s latest novel, “Come With Me,” has just been published. I was in a daze as I meandered up Columbus Avenue a few weeks ago — politics, the country, the world, you name it — when a pair of pants, a silly dazzling pair of silver-sequined flares that I couldn’t afford and had no cause to wear, called to me from the window. I wondered, as I stared longingly: Why do I, a woman of a certain age, still have a penchant for glitter, decades after I should have outgrown a 7-year-old’s yearnings for sparkly dress-up clothes? In truth, it’s not much of a mystery. I grew up in Manhattan, but about once a month we’d make the trip across the Hudson and through the polluted industrial parts of the Garden State to Elizabeth, where my father’s family lived above their namesake ladies’ dress store, Schulman’s, later renamed Schulman’s Village East. Elizabeth was a small port city then, and it had no village east or west as far as any of us knew. It was a bit of a geographic sleight of hand, a fantasy, but that was also the product. Saturday-night dreams of Hollywood glamour were nurtured and maybe sometimes came true in those aisles, just as they still do sometimes in my own closet — my passing on the silver-sequined flares notwithstanding. A whole way of life seemed to revolve around Schulman’s. In the ’20s, when my father was born, and well into the ’60s and early ’70s, when I was a child visiting, Elizabeth had been a haven for Jews who had fled the sweeping tragedies of Europe. Schulman’s was a place where the dispossessed and frightened gathered to work and browse and shop. The men of this immigrant Jewish community had the synagogue — my grandfather and his friends went every day — and the women had the store. A lot of gossip took place there, among the salesladies and the customers: the affairs, the separations, the matches. I remember the hustle and bustle of working women scoping the racks for office attire, mothers and grandmothers hunting for bar mitzvah wear — the fancy stuff. I remember homemakers searching for outfits appropriate for shul, and single girls and teenagers shopping for date nights. My brother and sister and I used to play hide-and-seek-among the racks of clothes. I was a shy child and thought myself invisible. I loved to eavesdrop (and still do). I’d watch quietly as customers tried on gowns in front of the store’s mirrors and the salesladies would gather to ooh and aah. “She looks like a fashion plate,” they said, no matter what the woman looked like or how badly the dress fit. A seamstress would get on her knees and measure. With the pins still in her mouth, she’d say, “Right out of the pages of Vogue magazine.” Not exactly: The dresses my grandmother sold were often showy, long, filmy, shiny concoctions, with sequined necklines and lace sleeves. They were priced for working-class people with fairy-tale aspirations, and they came in nylon and sateen and other cheaper fabrics; the skirts often swirled, and the waists had big stiff bows. It seemed as though the dresses themselves were enough to lift these women out of their daily grind, away from their painful memories, their threadbare lives, into what I imagined as clouds of fun — dances, parties; I had no idea. My grandparents were Russian refugees. They had met around 1915, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where first they had a vegetable cart, and then a clothing pushcart. Several years later, they moved to Elizabeth, their small neighborhood an American version of a shtetl, where they eventually opened Schulman’s. My grandmother was the genius behind the business. Malnourished as a child, she was just 4 feet 11 inches tall and weighed 90 pounds, and she was basically illiterate in all three languages she spoke (Russian, Yiddish and English). She was no clothes horse — she wore “house dresses,” soft cotton button-downs that were easy to take off and on, wash-and-wear, with a simple slip underneath, unadorned but presentable — but she was an excellent businesswoman. Her strategy was to sell off-the-rack dresses to her clientele and have seamstresses on hand to alter the clothes to fit at no charge. When my father was a boy, one of the seamstresses took him under her wing — after he tore his pants and broke his eyeglasses playing ball she mended them so he wouldn’t get in trouble with his father, who counted his pennies and had a temper. Her name was Sherrie. She was still working in the back room when I was a girl, and I always made sure to say hi to her at her sewing machine when we visited. There was a cardboard box filled with scraps of fabric that she kept below her machine. I loved to rummage through them, and Sherrie would let me take these schmattas home — green velvets, orange tulle, red lace. Alone in my room before my mirror I played dress-up, tying the lace around my head like a kerchief, wrapping the velvet around my body; sometimes I would stitch them together. I wish I could say I had a knack for making clothing, but I didn’t. What I had a knack for was daydreaming, and I couldn’t wait to be old enough to wear dresses like the ones my grandmother sold, to twirl in front of a mirror and have Sherrie tailor something sublime to my body so that I, too, could float around like a lady in a movie at a ball. Sadly, I never had the temerity to ask. I last visited Schulman’s when my grandmother died in the early ’70s, when I was in junior high school, and we sat shiva. My uncle and aunt owned and ran it after that, but the neighborhood was filling now with a new generation of immigrants from Latin America; many of Schulman’s original clientele and their children had by this point moved on to the suburbs. By the time the store officially closed, I think in the early ’80s — so much time has passed, I’m not sure — I had not been there in years, and I’d long stopped thinking about it. My father has been gone a long time now, along with his siblings and, of course, Sherrie, who was older than any of them. I have a chunky pale purple crystal necklace of hers that my father’s sister gave me when I first got married and that I still wear. I pair it with a black velvet top I got in Paris during the soldes — the crazy, state-sanctioned rock-bottom sales that occur twice a year in France. The shirt was a find, and whenever I wear it I dress it up with that necklace. I discovered when I was young that the flashes of light that come from a little sparkle seem to brighten anything, even as the lift itself is weightless and ephemeral.

2018,"The Father, the Son and the Sins of Italian Politics","ROME — Luigi Di Maio used to believe that the sins of the father should be visited upon the son. Then he became the son. For years, Mr. Di Maio, a 32-year-old leader of Italy’s populist coalition government, attacked his political enemies by seeking to stain them with the alleged misconduct of their fathers. Now he has found himself in the midst of his own family drama. Recent news reports have charged that his father paid employees off the books and illegally built on his land outside Naples. The violations, some of which the Di Maios have conceded, have hit close to home given that Mr. Di Maio, Italy’s squeaky clean deputy prime minister with the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, also wears the hats of minister of labor and of economic development. The scandal has prompted a feeding frenzy among Mr. Di Maio’s critics, who charge that his party’s mantras of “honesty” and “transparency” are rank with hypocrisy. After years of vicious, personal and dubious attacks spread through vast social media networks, the guilt-by-association and guilty-until-proven-innocent ethos of Italy’s populists now seems to endanger one of its most prominent leaders. Late last month, the Italian news program “Le Iene,” or “Reservoir Dogs,” began a series of reports that featured former employees of Mr. Di Maio’s father, Antonio, recounting how they were paid partly off the books or were pressured not to report work injuries. The latest program, which aired Sunday, showed how Antonio Di Maio also appeared to have illegally built on his property outside Pomigliano D’Arco, the small town where Mr. Di Maio lived with his parents until leaving for Rome to join parliament. When confronted with before-and-after aerial pictures of his father’s property, the populist leader suggested the buildings were always there, just previously camouflaged. He dismissed another apparently illegal structure as a simple stable. But the reporter, who subsequently received death threats from Five Star supporters on social media, produced photos showing Mr. Di Maio and his friends at a 2013 party relaxing in a pool on the property and hanging out in the supposed stall’s kitchen. As local authorities have investigated the buildings, which they want to demolish, Mr. Di Maio has acknowledged that “my father made mistakes in his life.” He also added that “for years I didn’t even speak with him” and said that “I distance myself from this behavior, but he is still my father.” But Mr. Di Maio has come under pressure. On Monday, the elder Di Maio, who dabbled in post-fascist politics, posted a painful video on his Facebook page that was subsequently spread across Five Star social media. In the video, the elder Mr. Di Maio, sitting at a desk with a fax machine, calculator and yellow Post-it Notes, woodenly reads a statement in which he begs forgiveness and describes himself as a small-business man who, “like every father,” did what he could to provide for his family. “I’m sorry for my son Luigi, who they are trying to attack,” he says, insisting his son knew nothing of his misdeeds and praising his “honesty, transparency and courage.” He demands that critics “leave my family alone” but argues that he had no choice but to hire workers off the books. He signs off by apologizing, again, to his son and saying, “As a father, I can only encourage him to go ahead, not because he is my son, but because I believe he is doing good for this country, against everyone and everything.” For years, “everyone” included relatives of the younger Di Maio’s political enemies. Before Five Star came to power, its main target was Matteo Renzi of the Democratic Party, a former prime minister. Mr. Di Maio and the party’s army of online supporters seized on investigations into his father’s alleged influence-peddling as an example of the corrupt politics they promised to replace. But Italian judges in October shelved a case against Mr. Renzi’s father, Tiziano, and fined Il Fatto Quotidiano, an Italian newspaper supportive of the Five Star Movement, for defaming him. “I’m convinced that the sins of the father should not be visited upon the sons,” Mr. Renzi wrote on Facebook after the program about Mr. Di Maio’s father aired. “This is something I have always said, unlike Di Maio, who understands it only now.” He went on to lament Five Star’s “campaign of hate” against his father, who, he wrote, has become reluctant to leave the house and worries about what his grandchildren hear about him. Mr. Renzi’s father recently wrote on Facebook that if he had done what Mr. Di Maio’s father had, Five Star “would already have launched an appeal on social networks for the return of the death penalty.” (This week, La Verità, another newspaper close to the populist government, alleged new improprieties, prompting Tiziano Renzi to deny that he and his son paid paperboys off the books when they operated a paper route decades ago in Florence.) Matteo Renzi’s former reforms minister, Maria Elena Boschi, had a similar experience. For years, Five Star and its allies alleged, without proof, that Ms. Boschi used her power in the government to rescue the senior bondholders at the cost of regular stakeholders in the bank where her father worked. Mr. Di Maio claimed his party had “zero conflicts of interest, not like Boschi who makes laws for her father.” After the allegations against Mr. Di Maio’s father emerged, Ms. Boschi spoke straight to camera in a video posted on Twitter. “I’d like to look in the face Mr. Antonio Di Maio, the father of Luigi, and say I hope that he does not go through what his son and his friends put my father and my family through,” she said. Until recently, Mr. Di Maio had responded with outrage, and litigation, to reports about his family. Then the left-leaning newspaper la Repubblica published reports about his father illegally expanding their childhood home in Pomigliano D’Arco. In a Facebook video published on Nov. 7, Mr. Di Maio attacked the reporting and sent “a big hug” to his father. “We were always an honest family who behaved honestly,” he said. On Nov. 27, Mr. Di Maio faced off on television with la Repubblica’s editor, Mario Calabresi, who pointed out that a lawsuit Five Star had filed against him was mistakenly addressed to his father, Luigi, a police official assassinated by left-wing terrorists in 1972, when the editor was two years old. The next day, the party’s blog wrote that Mr. Calabresi was so intellectually dishonest that “to tar Luigi Di Maio he is willing even to use the name of his dead father.” The Five Star Movement is itself no stranger to family connections. A co-founder of the party, the late Gianroberto Casaleggio, bequeathed the web platform upon which the party is operated to his son Davide. Though an unelected internet consultant, Davide Casaleggio is now perhaps the ultimate power broker behind the party. As Five Star’s popularity has slipped, political observers have begun wondering when the party, or Mr. Casaleggio, might pull the plug on Mr. Di Maio. Waiting in the wings, they say, is Alessandro Di Battista, a charismatic politician who has written a book with the subtitle, “a letter to my son on the courage to change.” But if Mr. Di Battista steps onto center stage, it is likely he will also bring baggage. His father, Vittorio, kept a bust of Mussolini in his foyer and has proudly proclaimed, “I’m a fascist!” Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, the leader of the hard right League party, seems to be enjoying Five Star’s episode of “Family Feud.” He shares power with Mr. Di Maio, but his support is increasing as Mr. Di Maio’s fades. “I am happy my father is a quiet pensioner,” he said last week, “who at most volunteers in the local parish or plays bridge.”",The New York Times
2018,The Fed Just Raised Interest Rates. Here’s What That Means for Your Wallet.,"The interest rate increase has consequences for savers and spenders alike. Whether you’ve got a savings account or a credit card (or both), here’s what you need to know. The Federal Reserve has raised its benchmark interest rate again — Wednesday’s increase was the fourth this year — and consumers can expect to feel it, one way or another. Whether you will cheer or chafe at the increase depends, broadly, on whether you’re a saver or a spender. Savers and retirees seeking juicier yields will have an easier time finding savings accounts that pay more than 2 percent, a figure that looks attractive after they were starved of any interest for nearly a decade. But people trying to whittle down a pile of credit card debt, tap their home equity line of credit or purchase a car may find that it will cost a little more. All these changes are a result of the Fed’s gradual increase in the federal funds rate, which is the interest rate banks and depository institutions charge one another for overnight loans. The rate influences how banks and other lenders price certain loans and savings vehicles — and it can have broader impact on our financial lives. The Fed raised short-term rates by a quarter of a percentage point to a range of 2.25 to 2.5 percent, which was the ninth increase since the end of 2015. That’s still low from a historical standpoint, but it’s the highest that rates have climbed since the financial crisis a decade ago. Indeed, the latest quarter-point bump is no different than previous increases, but consumers may be beginning to feel the cumulative effect in a more pronounced way. Here’s a refresher on what it all means for your wallet. When the Fed raises rates, some banks may pay more interest on savings accounts, particularly when they want to lure consumers to park their money. But the big banks haven’t been too generous lately, and you shouldn’t expect much to change with the latest increase. Today, the average savings and money market deposit accounts pay a paltry 0.22 percent, according to BankRate.com. That’s up from 0.10 percent in 2015, when the Fed starting raising rates. You also shouldn’t rush to tie up your money in certificates of deposit, which tend to move in step with similarly dated Treasury securities. Two-year C.D.s are paying just more than 1 percent on average, but you can find some paying 3 percent if you take the time to comparison-shop, according to BankRate.com. You’ll probably do better with an online savings account; many are already paying more than 2 percent and are likely to rise further. “For the first time in more than a decade, you can earn more than the rate of inflation on your savings account, but only if you shop around,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at BankRate.com. The inflation rate, which measures how much prices have risen from a year ago, is now roughly 2 percent. If your money isn’t earning at least that much, you’re losing purchasing power. CIT Bank and Citizens Access are offering 2.25 percent, according to BankRate.com, and at least two other online banks are paying 2.4 percent. Bond investors often get nervous when interest rates rise because bond prices tend to fall in response. Why? When rates increase, the price of existing (and lower-yielding) bonds drop because investors can buy new bonds that offer higher interest rates. But higher rates also mean that bonds will generate more interest income, which is good for investors over the long run. The average person who invests in bonds does so through some kind of mutual fund. To get a sense of how your bond fund may react to rising rates, take a look at its duration, a number that you can look up on your fund provider’s website. It’s a complex calculation that combines interest payments and the bond’s maturity date to measure the investment’s sensitivity to rate changes. The longer the duration, the more sensitive the bond. A good way to estimate the effect of an interest rate change: A rate increase of 1 percent will reduce an investment’s value by a percentage equal to the duration. For example, a fund like the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund, which has an average duration of 6.3 years, would decline by about 6.3 percent if interest rates rose a full percentage point. But fear not, that’s not the full picture: A fund like that also pays investors interest, and will soon be adding new bonds paying a higher rate. That offsets some of the decline in value. Many people think mortgage rates are tied to the Fed’s short-term rate, but there is no direct link. Most 30-year fixed-rate mortgages are priced off the 10-year Treasury bond, which is influenced by a variety of factors, including the outlook for inflation and long-term economic growth here and abroad. But some home loans are more directly connected to the Fed’s action, including home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, or A.R.M.s. A typical home-equity borrower has already seen rates rise to about 6.5 percent, according to BankRate.com, from roughly 4.5 percent three years ago. And now rates will probably move a quarter-point higher. The Fed’s latest rate increase won’t be “too damaging,” said Keith Gumbinger of HSH.com, which tracks the mortgage market. But the combination of the recent increases and changes in the tax code that restricted the interest deduction “is a bit of a double pinch for some.” The good news related to adjustable-rate mortgages — which typically have a fixed rate for a certain number of years, and then adjust each year thereafter — is that few people have them, Mr. Gumbinger said. But borrowers who are already out of their fixed-rate period and are set for an annual reset in December can expect to pay more. They will most likely see a rise to about 5.36 percent for 2019, up from a rate of 4.3 percent over the past year. For the sake of comparison, rates on 30-year fixed mortgages are now about 4.75 percent. That’s still favorable from a historical standpoint, and those loans are usually the most practical for most buyers. Credit-card holders with variable rates — averaging around 17.6 percent, up from about 15.7 percent at the end of 2015, according to BankRate.com — can expect their rates to rise another quarter-point within one or two monthly cycles. While the rate hikes’ cumulative effect is beginning to squeeze car buyers, the latest increase probably won’t change your decision to finance a car. It would only your raise monthly payments by a few dollars a month on a $25,000 loan that will be repaid in five years. Since the Fed started raising rates, however, the annual percentage rate on a car loan has increased by more than a percentage point. The average rate was 6.03 percent in November, up from 4.58 percent three years earlier, according to Edmunds. November was the second consecutive month that rates remained above 6 percent. And consumers are being offered fewer zero-percent deals. Those paying off federal student loans don’t have to worry, because they carry a fixed rate. The next round of new loans will have their rate set in July, based on the 10-year Treasury bond. But private student loans generally base their fixed and variable rates on the Libor index, which tends to track the Fed funds rate pretty closely. So students in that market can expect to see a more immediate increase.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Feminist Power of Embroidery,"When I pick up needle and thread, I join a long line of women who have turned the domestic arts into political expression. Ms. Kim is a journalist. Many years ago, inspired by a book on Korean folk art and craft, I began a crude, autodidactic experiment in stitching. I worked without a pattern, using cheap floss, a needle with a too-small eye and a plastic embroidery hoop to sew geometric designs on a few worn-out T-shirts. Thread lends itself almost too easily to metaphor. With each clumsy stitch, I thought of my maternal grandmother, whom I never got a chance to meet. An artwork of hers hangs on my parents’ wall, in Tacoma, Wash. From a distance, the framed image appears to be a painting, but it is in fact hair-fine embroidery. A light-green parrot sits at rest in a magnolia tree, the bird’s curved, red-orange beak contrasting sharply with its layered feathers. The flowers are in full bloom, shaded dark pink to white. Each tiny stitch of plumage and branch is the work of a young woman’s fingers, cramped by the needle’s demands, her bowed head curving her torso into a C. My grandmother created the panel around 1941, when she was a high-school student in Seoul living under Japanese colonial rule. Given the oppressions of that era — she and her classmates were forced to use Japanese names; she walked past soldiers on her way home from school — embroidery must have lent her a quiet, fleeting freedom. My own practice has been intermittent, but last year, in a moment of anger and news overload, I picked up my old hoop and thread. I began to sew objects, words and portraits of loved ones into handkerchiefs and remnants of felt. I embroidered during afternoon work breaks and in the evening, while watching bad TV. I learned how to keep my fabric just taut enough and marveled at the difference a millimeter of thread can make in evoking a nose or the tuning peg of a tiny violin. I began to notice stitchers all around me, and not just because of the knitting mania inspired by the pussy hat. Articles about “how feminist cross stitching became a tool of the resistance” appeared in my feed. There seemed to be more crocheters fiddling with needles on the subway and pillows embroidered with girl-power motifs in storefront displays. The fabric arts tick upward in times such as these, when women feel particularly indignant. In the 1970s, feminist artists such as Margaret Harrison and Judy Chicago sewed polemics onto canvas and tablecloths. To take up the needle is to reclaim our histories of anonymous, poorly paid and unpaid female craft, garment labor and piece work. As Rozsika Parker writes in her 1984 book, “The Subversive Stitch: Embroidery and the Making of the Feminine,” “because of its history and associations embroidery evokes and inculcates femininity in the embroiderer. But it can also lead women to an awareness of the extraordinary constraints of femininity, providing at times a means of negotiating them, and at other times provoking the desire to escape.” There’s an undeniable satisfaction in pulling thread through the last letter-limb of an embroidered expletive or sewing up the image of a raised fist. Consider the even more radical figures common in “story cloths” created by Hmong women. On these ornate panels, subjugation and survival coincide: Soldiers burn down villages, families cross the Mekong River, women cook dinner in a refugee camp. Even when the design at hand has no straightforward message, the act of embroidery can feel transgressive in its silence and domesticity. It is a haven from news whorls and internet noise, a return to a female tradition when our bodies and minds feel so keenly under assault. The history of embroidery affords a glimpse of “the private inner world” of women, as a chronicler of the Korean tradition puts it. Because it has tended to flourish in female and feminine spaces — namely, the home — it is a kind of secret. To embroider is to embellish: to create a fantasia and thus be momentarily free. None of this is to argue for retreat, let alone to the sewing room. Resistance is necessarily public, manifested in rallies and pickets, door-knocking and debate. Yet for all the time I have spent outside in the Trump era, there is a corresponding need for time indoors, where I can be still and let the mind wander. Textile work resembles meditation, though it can also take place in knitting circles and quilting groups, where silence is shared. I recently reread “Embroideries,” by Marjane Satrapi, a graphic memoir about the lives of women in her extended Iranian family. The young Marjane sits with her grandmother at home over tea and listens to the stories told by female relatives and neighbors. The title of the book refers not only to needle and thread but also to the elaboration in “old wives’ tales,” domestic labor, fashion and nose jobs. Feigned virginity becomes “the full embroidery.” I know just a few things about my grandmother. She was a passionate student who, despite the limited opportunities available to Korean women during Japanese rule, became a high-school math teacher. Her husband forced her to quit when they were married, but she applied her intellect and skills to work in the home. I used a photo of my grandmother’s embroidered parrot to guide a recent project: a bust of my mom sewn into a periwinkle handkerchief. The weave of her face isn’t as delicate as in my grandmother’s work. But there is a hint of her, there in the eyes and red-thread smile.

2018,The Fight for and Against Australian Secrecy,"Letter 85 The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau chief. Sign up to get it by email. This week’s edition is late due to extra efforts to ensure that what you’re reading does not break the law. The introduction below also ran as a separate article, online and in print. ______ There is a criminal case unfolding in Australia that shall not be named. The defendant is a figure with a global reputation, someone of great influence in the country and the world. The charges are serious and of significant public interest. But publishing news about this case is illegal. Judges in Australia and some other countries, including Britain, often issue gag orders that temporarily restrict the publication of information related to a criminal proceeding on the grounds that it might sway jurors or potential jurors. Sometimes, judges even require the existence of these orders to be kept secret. In this case, something unusual is happening — the sweep of the restrictions is so all-encompassing that the conflict between the public’s right to know and the defendant’s right to a fair trial is rippling across the internet and the world, touching news outlets and institutions in distant countries. If you’re not in Australia, you may have already read recent coverage of the case. If you are in Australia or depend on online news from international organizations like The New York Times, The Associated Press or Reuters, you probably know nothing about it. Gag orders, also known as suppression orders, are supposed to work that way. They usually apply to speech within a specific jurisdiction. But the global nature of the internet has blurred the lines, giving local judges the power to threaten any website accessible to local residents, regardless of where the site or its journalists are based. That includes The Times: The Times is not publishing the latest news of the case online, and it blocked delivery of the Friday print edition to Australia, to comply with the judge’s order. The Times’s lawyers in Australia have advised the organization that it is subject to local law because it maintains a bureau in the country. Two Times journalists who have been covering the case would be at risk. The judge in the case has threatened journalists with contempt of court charges, which can bring up to five years in prison. Some publications that have published the news have no full-time staff in Australia and face no such risk. Even naming them appears to be illegal. But the battle reaches beyond one particular case. It’s a contest of competing democratic values. The core debate is an old one, pitting the right of the accused to a fair trial against the right of free speech, and of the public to know what’s going on in the courtroom. Those poles are not mutually exclusive: Trials in Australia, as in the United States, are usually both open and fair. “What you need for a fair trial are fair and unbiased jurors, not people who have been kept in the dark,” said Kurt Wimmer, a media and technology lawyer who is a partner with Covington and Burling in Washington. Because of the way technology has shifted the media landscape, gag orders now raise additional questions of scale and geography. The question now is whether a local judge, in protecting the right to a fair trial, should have the unilateral authority to silence journalists and publishers around the globe. In the case at hand, a criminal matter involving someone whose previous position of power touched the lives of millions all over the world, the stakes are especially high. The defendant is well known, having played a public role with issues and institutions that inspire strong emotions, making bias harder to stamp out. On the other side are not just journalists, but also those who were affected by the defendants’ actions over many years in many places. They demand accountability, and also claim a right to know, seeing secrecy as an accomplice to the crimes of the case. A few news outlets without personnel or a corporate presence in Australia — and therefore no legal obligation or vulnerability — have already reported the case’s latest developments online. On Twitter and Facebook, where the news can be found but is not ubiquitous, there has been praise from some Australians that the news was posted, and criticism from others worried that publication has jeopardized justice. Other attempts to maneuver within the law have varied. One news site published the news online but tried to block access to the article in Australia. The New York Times published the news in its American print editions, but not online, while Australian media outlets have tried to sidestep the issue, boldly calling out the court’s restrictions while avoiding mention of the underlying news. Several newspapers published front-page editorials this week. One led with a large-font headline that said: “Censored.” The court, in turn, has been strictly enforcing limits within a common framework. Suppression orders that completely ban coverage related to continuing sensitive prosecutions have become more frequent in many parts of Australia. It happens more often when there are two related trials in close succession and the goal is obvious: to prevent the risk of prejudice by juries, and to ensure that accusers and the accused can have their cases heard without being undermined at trial or on appeal. But, international lawyers note, there are other ways to accomplish that. In the United States, the First Amendment prohibits prior restraint on publication in nearly all instances. Courtrooms are rarely closed, and those that are shut mostly involve cases with classified information. For the most sensitive, dangerous or high-profile cases, such as O. J. Simpson’s murder trial, juries are sequestered. They are kept in a hotel away from the internet, television and other media when not in court, and ordered not to discuss the case with anyone. In Australia, too, there are states — Queensland, for one — that rarely muzzle the media to provide an extra layer of protection for a fair trial. But in Victoria, the location of this particular case, suppression orders have become fairly routine. Hundreds of cases each year in Victoria are subject to such orders, according to court statistics — a trend that began in the 1990s with dozens of overlapping murder cases involving organized crime. And the scope of these prohibitions tends to be broad. In many cases, they bar all information derived from legal proceedings, including ancillary issues that appear to have little to do with protecting the defendant, like a judge’s ruling on challenges to the gag order itself. Some legal experts in Australia say that such orders reflect a misplaced lack of faith in jurors’ ability to reach a fair conclusion without being influenced by coverage or related cases. “We should trust juries, and we should give clear instructions,” said Bruce Baer Arnold, a law professor at the School of Law and Justice at the University of Canberra. He added that this was the standard in the United States, as in most of Australia. “Take the law seriously. Obey instructions. You make your decision on the basis of the argument and the basis of the facts.” Journalists and scholars have also argued that there is another problem with prohibiting publication of facts about such a significant case: the suppression of criticism and accountability. Several lawyers in Victoria declined to be quoted about the issues raised by this case, even generally, fearing they would run afoul of the judge. Members of the public who have already spent months in court observing the case’s progress have also been silenced, unable to share their conclusions with the world when they are most relevant and likely to be respected. For now, one judge in an Australian court is altering how the world sees a global figure accused of serious crimes. To preserve a local media blackout, he and the case’s lawyers, who have supported the media ban, demand that the rest of the world not publicly debate their competence or the man being prosecuted to ensure, as much as possible, fair treatment in court. To some, that suppression of information will be seen as a triumph of justice, a noble win for local self-determination and the rule of law. To others it will be seen as an act that, however well intended, undermines transparency and accountability in a case that much of the world would desperately like to discuss.

2018,The Fight to Save the Traditional Tortilla,"In Mexico, this staple — made with heirloom corn — is under pressure from mass production and modernity, but small producers are pushing back. TLAXIACO, Mexico — Petra Cruz González wakes at 6 every morning to make some 400 tortillas by hand. Despite a few modern advancements, like an electric flour mill and a metal hand press, she still cooks them over a wood fire as she learned to do when she was 8 years old. Ms. González, 49, sells tortillas on the street and from her home. As the president of the Union de Palmeadoras in Tlaxiaco, which started in 1990 to organize this Oaxacan city’s handmade tortilla producers, she believes this is important work. The union’s 89 members (all but one a woman) are fighting to keep this millenniums-old tradition alive in the face of cheaper competitors. The city’s 25 tortillería shops have severely cut into their sales, and Ms. González often has to work until 10 p.m. to sell all her tortillas. She charges 10 pesos (about 50 cents) for six, but this covers little more than her expenses. She often trades any remaining tortillas for food from other vendors. “The tortillerías just want to make more money — they’re not interested in what they sell,” Ms. González said. “We sell quality, not quantity.” From the city to the countryside, the Mexican tortilla is in crisis. Consumption has dropped nearly 45 percent in the last 35 years, according to the nutritionist Julieta Ponce of the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana Xochimilco, to 125 pounds per person in 2016 from 225 pounds in 1982, as Mexicans eat more bread and fast food. Quality has suffered in the race for the cheapest tortilla; nearly half the supply is now made with industrially produced masa harina, or corn flour, like Maseca. Cristina Barros, an author who investigates Mexican cuisine, says the perilous state of the tortilla is a red alert for Mexico’s wider social ills, including obesity, poverty and emigration. “If the tortilla is not functioning well, if it’s not good quality, there are going to be a bunch of problems,” particularly for tortilla makers and corn farmers, Ms. Barros said. “When we decided to change our traditional food for industrial food, this epidemic of obesity shot up.” The country’s embrace of free trade in the 1980s contributed to this change, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, which says the rate of obesity among Mexicans rose to 20.3 percent in 2016 from 7 percent in 1980. In May, more than 75 organizations and businesses created the Alianza por Nuestra Tortilla to promote corn tortillas. There are wheat-flour tortillas in Mexico, especially in the north, but the group’s focus is on corn as the bedrock of Mexican cuisine. The alliance is pursuing a strategy that includes research, educational events, media campaigns and lobbying. In the alliance’s view, a good tortilla is made from scratch, through the traditional process known as nixtamalization, in which dried corn (ideally native heirloom varieties) is cooked in water with calcium hydroxide (called cal in Mexico) and left to soak overnight. This unlocks nutrients, and makes the tortilla a valuable source of vitamins, minerals and protein. Industrially produced corn flour is also nixtamalized, but further processing strips it of nutrients, resulting in an inferior tortilla, according to tortilla purists. Amado Ramírez Leyva, an agricultural engineer who has worked with corn producers for more than 25 years, promotes biodiversity as the key to persuading consumers that traditional tortillas are worth the expense and the effort to seek them out. “For the last 50 years, people don’t know how corn tastes in the city,” he said. “The native heirloom corns have a much wider flavor palette than industrial corns.” The alliance is pressing the federal government to codify what can and cannot be called a tortilla, and to require large producers to list their ingredients on labels, said Rafael Mier, the founder of the Fundación de Tortilla Maíz Mexicana, an alliance member that works to preserve this cultural tradition of tortilla production through education and advocacy. He said he wanted to expose “fake” products, so Mexicans can make informed decisions about which tortillas to eat. “People are interested in providing healthy food for their families,” Mr. Mier said. “We simply need to provide the information.” Like many other new tortillerías in Mexico City, Maizajo makes masa dough and tortillas the traditional way. Business has grown rapidly since it opened last year: Santiago Muñoz, a founder and chef, said the traditional tortilla producer originally made 65 pounds each day and now makes at least 450 pounds. Though there are three million corn farmers in Mexico, many have stopped planting heirloom corn or have emigrated because of low prices. Like similar tortillerías, Maizajo pays fairer prices for heirloom corn to keep this tradition alive. Simon Angoa, a farmer in San Juan Ixtenco, 100 miles east of Mexico City, said the average price for a pound of his heirloom corn is 2.25 pesos (12 cents), and sometimes as low as 1.35 pesos (7 cents). He considers 4.5 pesos (24 cents) to be a fairer price, so laborers don’t have to work in cities or emigrate to the United States. (Mr. Angoa plans to work in California for three years in construction while his family takes care of his fields.) Unfortunately, many Mexicans and cooks are unaware of the work involved with nixtamalization, and few cooking schools teach the technique. Each corn varietal has to be investigated to find the correct amount of calcium hydroxide and appropriate cooking times. (For example, too much cal can alter the color and produce an overly pungent flavor.) “The tortilla is like a bread dough, a pizza dough — it needs to be understood that it has the same importance, to give it value,” Mr. Muñoz said. That value comes with a high price. In cities, most traditional tortillas sell for about five times the price of commercial ones, making them a luxury product for many. At Tamoa, a business in Mexico City that works with farmers to supply local and international restaurants with masa and corn, the owners, Francisco Musi and Sofia Casarin, are making high-quality tortillas more possible and accessible there by cutting the cost of distribution and using heirloom corn grown nearby. Well-made tortillas are already in the city’s top restaurants, so Ms. Casarin sees the larger change happening in less expensive restaurants, fondas and taquerias. “It’s finding a place for that middle-priced tortilla,” she said. One shop, Molino El Pujol, a collaboration between the chef Enrique Olvera and Mr. Ramírez Leyva, aims to lower costs by using machinery. But modern equipment is designed to process a standard product like Maseca, which moves more smoothly through the machine’s rollers. To produce a good tortilla with all the variables of heirloom corn has taken much trial and error in tweaking the machine, Mr. Ramírez Leyva said. “But if we can use more machines, then surely we can democratize” the traditional tortilla. The fight to preserve the old ways is just beginning. In Mexico, there are still 40,000 tortillerías that nixtamalize their corn and millions of people who make traditional tortillas at home. “There’s an enormous knowledge, but the market doesn’t recognize it,” Mr. Mier said. “The know-how exists. We simply need the will so it doesn’t disappear, the will to transmit it to new generations.” Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

2018,The Filets Mignons of the Sea,"City Kitchen Seared sea scallops shine when you prepare them like steak au poivre. Sweet, meaty sea scallops are best in winter, and like many other luxury foods, they tend to appear in abundance during the holiday season. Though it doesn’t come cheap, the splendid sea scallop is exceedingly easy to prepare. To find the best product for your money, get yourself to a good fishmonger. Ask for fresh large or medium day-boat scallops, also called dry-packed — frozen scallops do not qualify here. (Frozen scallops, instead of browning, just weep in the pan, flooding it with their juices; most are dipped in a preservative solution before freezing.) When you have scallops that are freshly harvested, you can serve them raw for a delightful first course. Make a scallop crudo, thinly sliced and adorned with just a speck of coarse salt, a dribble of extra-virgin olive oil and a drop of lemon. Or use raw diced scallops to make a ceviche, doused very briefly in lime juice and sparked with hot green chile, onion and cilantro. When cooking your scallops, pan-seared or grilled is the tried-and-true method. Getting the surface of the scallop crisp and brown helps emphasize its natural sweetness and provides a textural contrast to the luscious tender interior. Some cooks sear scallops nearly entirely on one side, turning them over for only a minute or so to finish. Many like their scallops rare in the center; I prefer to cook them all the way through, keeping them juicy, but not overcooked. For this quick recipe, I take cues from the saucy, peppery French classic steak au poivre, usually made with beef tenderloin and pan-cooked. Reimagining the scallops as miniature filets mignons makes sense, non? The dish gets a boost from three types of peppercorns: green and black (both true pepper), and rose or pink peppercorns (not really pepper — they are the fruit of a different plant — but peppery nonetheless, and pretty too). Crush the peppercorns in a mortar or grind them very coarsely in a spice mill. The whole affair comes together in less than 30 minutes. The scallops are generously dusted with the three-pepper mixture and sautéed on both sides in butter over medium-high heat. A splash of sherry and a good dollop of crème fraîche make a rich pan sauce; use brandy and heavy cream if you prefer. To add brightness, a shower of citrus zest and fragrant mint just before serving tempers the lavish sauce. To add cheer, may I suggest a crackling fire and a bottle of bubbly?

2018,The Filmmaker Karyn Kusama Explores the Many Dimensions of Women’s Rage,"Feature From ‘Girlfight’ to ‘Destroyer,’ her movies are distinguished by her willingness not to revel in brutality but to look it in the face. Karyn Kusama at home in November.CreditCreditDru Donovan for The New York Times When Karyn Kusama was 10, she went with her mother and her younger brother and sister to see an interesting new movie, David Lynch’s “Eraserhead,” at the art house in downtown St. Louis. In Lynch’s surreal black-and-white fantasia, an alien baby — possibly a lamb fetus, though Lynch has never revealed what he used — grows sicker and sicker until its bandages are removed and its organs fall apart. At some point, one of Kusama’s siblings started crying, and her mother asked Kusama to take them both outside so she could finish watching the movie in peace. While her mom — whose taste did not normally run to grotesquerie — sat in the theater laughing as if “Eraserhead” were the comedy of the year and her sibling sobbed in the lobby, Kusama stood on tippy toes, trying to glimpse the screen through the porthole window. “That that movie found my mom?” she said, still impressed, when I met her in Los Angeles last spring. The experience taught her “the holiness of the cinematic experience,” the power that movies have to hold the most unlikely viewer in thrall. “Who might I find? Who might I captivate?” It was a question she has spent the last 20 years pursuing. Kusama’s new movie, “Destroyer,” opens on Christmas Day and stars Nicole Kidman as Erin Bell, a racked, bitter, alcoholic Los Angeles police detective on a vengeful quest to find the leader of a gang with whom she was embedded undercover years ago. In a career marked by artistic triumph and commercial failure, this is Kusama’s first time having complete creative control over a movie with a huge Hollywood star, and a test of whether she can turn a profit at the box office. It also marks a new moment of maturation in her art. Over five films, Kusama has used genre — the sports movie, sci-fi/fantasy, horror, the paranoid thriller and now the L.A. noir — to tell difficult stories about grief and trauma and what it takes to survive them. “I still believe that a lot of people want to feel safe enough to watch something, and they long to be challenged once they feel safe,” she explained. [Read about Nicole Kidman’s experience performing in “Destroyer.”] Where another director might try to shock the viewer’s senses, Kusama creates controlled moments of tension and violence that explore, in a precise and analytic way, human emotion. John Sayles, whom Kusama worked for in the ’90s, says she makes “psychological horror films with sociological impact.” They are distinguished by her willingness to do something rare — not to revel in brutality but to look it in the face. After a long day in the editing room, Kusama sat down at the dining table in her Spanish revival in Los Feliz with her husband, the screenwriter Phil Hay, and their 11-year-old son, Michio. “There’s salad, sprouted broccoli, pork tenderloin and radishes braised in butter and mint,” she said, a meal she had casually put together while chatting about “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,” the photographer Beatrice Minda and the family dog, Tako, a rescue who announced his presence by peeing on the floor. In the stairwell hung Vivian Maier photographs and a portrait by Kusama’s high school best friend, Paul Gellman, of a nude woman surrounded by a bevy of fire-engine-red devils. It was inspired by her. Kusama, who would turn 50 the next day, has long black hair, a high forehead and elegant hands. She doesn’t care about clothes and wears minimal jewelry: a dangly necklace, a plain gold wedding band. She reads widely, avoids social media, cooks often and tries to meditate once a day, because when she started doing it, around 10 years ago, she realized how much she needed it. She makes frequent reference to her anger in a way that indicates that achieving inner peace is a continuing project, but she rarely loses her cool. “Passion expressed in an incisive manner,” Hay said. “That’s your style.” Hay and his writing partner, Matt Manfredi, have written three films Kusama has directed — “Destroyer,” “The Invitation” (2015) and “Aeon Flux” (2005); it was while making “Aeon Flux” that Kusama and Hay became romantically involved. (They met years earlier, but Kusama was with a woman then.) As a trio, they share a love of 1970s American cinema but also something more mysterious, some dark energy that compels them to explore cults and crime and evil and violence. When Kusama was in her 20s, two people close to her died from heroin overdoses, and she has since told stories about the people left behind after a tragedy. In her debut, “Girlfight” (2000), which she wrote and which won both the Grand Jury Prize and the directing award at Sundance, a grieving teenager from the Red Hook Public Houses takes up boxing. In “Jennifer’s Body” (2009), written by Diablo Cody, a high school student becomes a demon-possessed cannibal, forcing her nerdy best frenemy to kill or be killed. “The Invitation” is a case study in the horror of denial, in which a woman who has lost a child joins a cult and hosts a dinner party that ends in bloody chaos. “Destroyer,” a moral sequel to “The Invitation,” asks what happens when the source of tragedy is not the outside world but inside yourself. If you were standing on tiptoes outside the theater door while your mother sat transfixed by “Destroyer,” what you’d see through the porthole window is Nicole Kidman’s face, looking like a red carpet that has been trampled. She’s haggard and worn, with eyes so sharp and wounded that they seem to look through you and into the shame of your own past. You’d see her body, loping like an old coyote across a dirty sunlit freeway, and you’d see her stagger and vomit and grimace while she grabs a soap dish and bashes in the head of a bodyguard and then, like some sort of furious arachnid with an uncountable number of legs, pistol whips a crooked lawyer till his eye bleeds. You’d see her cock a semiautomatic weapon like a veteran, and maybe you’d hear her tell her daughter’s scuzzy boyfriend how easy it would be to kill him, because, as she says with terrifying evenness, “I don’t care what happens to me.” All this would unfold at a human pace that might, if you’re used to high-octane, explosion-a-minute action movies, feel slow and, in a perfectly restrained, matter-of-fact way, as intense and compressed as a hematoma. “I don’t feel so far away from her,” Kusama explained on another occasion. “I don’t think I would have made the movie if I didn’t relate to her.” She understands Bell, her strength and her brokenness, what makes her circle like a dog that has done something wrong and snarls at the hands that try to feed her. “We need to explore those people. And we really need to explore those women.” Born and raised in St. Louis, Kusama has retained the flat vowels and the “cheerful morbidity” of a Midwesterner. She likes to joke that her grandmother would take the kids to the local cemetery to remind them of “you know, little Bobby Jones — he was decapitated in a freak accident.” Kusama’s father immigrated from Japan to attend medical school at Washington University, and her mother is of Scottish-Irish descent. She was an occupational therapist, and he was a child psychiatrist who came home with the occasional vivid tale of suffering. There were very few nonwhite children in Kusama’s school, and the family did not go to church, making them doubly outcast. Kusama, whose fashion ran to plaid jodhpurs and sparkly socks, discovered that she had a seizure disorder when, during a seventh-grade health lesson about drunken driving, she projectile-vomited. She was seated directly behind a student with long hair. “It’s that kind of thing where you’re just like, I’m now a marked kid,” she remembers. “And it was a lonely time.” But something about that isolation was emboldening. “I’d rather endure solitude than have pretend intimacy,” she says. Her family was reserved about emotions; watching movies helped her feel seen. For college, she enrolled at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts, where her first student films were stylized and arty. One of her professors, Carol Dysinger, remembers shots of a woman sitting on a chair in an empty swimming pool and an egg displayed against a velvet background. After Dysinger encouraged Kusama to “put her heart onscreen,” her next short consisted of shots of young people riding the subway or sitting in windows while she talked in voice-over about her friends and her worries about them. It blew Dysinger away. Kusama was starting to find her way of storytelling: a visual style that was poetic and simple — almost tough in its simplicity — paired with a plain, direct investigation of feeling. At N.Y.U., Kusama also found a tight group of friends and creative collaborators. Then, during senior year, the group was shattered when her writing partner mixed cocaine and heroin and died. After graduation, Kusama tried to finish the script they had been writing together, but it went nowhere. To make ends meet, she did odd jobs, including babysitting, editing student films and rolling loose change for a friend of Dysinger’s. All around her, people were dying — of drugs, of AIDS. “It was a time of extreme impermanence,” she told me. She became an assistant to Sayles and the producer Maggie Renzi, both of whom she impressed with her unflappability. (“Somebody from the Weinstein Company called and said, ‘You know, I’m going to lose my job unless I can get John on the phone with Bob Weinstein today,’ ” Sayles recalls. “She basically said, ‘I feel so bad for you that you have a job like that and that your life has come to such a pass.’ ”) She started boxing at Gleason’s Gym in Dumbo, where she was one of only a few women, and she began noticing young women on the subway who looked as angry as she felt. It occurred to her that she could tell their stories. After Dysinger bet her a hundred dollars that she couldn’t finish a script in a month, she wrote what would eventually become “Girlfight.” Two years after her friend died, Kusama and her sister, Kristen, were together in the Fort Greene house they shared with friends when they got the call that their brother, Kevin, had died of a heroin overdose. Kevin had been charismatic and intelligent but also, in Kusama’s description, “a kid who came out screaming and kind of didn’t stop — it was his nature,” she says, “to be in conflict with life itself.” When they were young, his saucer sled flew out onto the ice, and he walked out to retrieve it; a bunch of kids were playing ice hockey in the center of the frozen pond, and it looked safe. But he fell through the ice. “That was his life,” she says. “He was touched by that kind of closeness to catastrophe.” Everything changed after these deaths. Kusama didn’t know how to understand the world, so how could she make a movie about it? There was also the matter of being, or becoming, an adult. “It really did hit me in my 20s: I’m not going to make a good movie if I don’t know how to pay my rent,” she says. “That was the hammer on my head, realizing that I can’t make a movie if I can’t take care of myself.” “Girlfight,” which screened at Sundance when Kusama was 31, is an assured and muscular debut. It’s “about” trauma, class, domestic violence, gender. But you could watch it with the sound off and it would still make sense. Many shots have the feel more of portraits or tableaux than conventional movie blocking, with close-ups on faces and coordinated swatches of color: red, blue, purple and lots of pink. At the end, Diana Guzman fights her boyfriend in a “gender-blind” bout in the ring. (Guzman is played by a leonine, charismatic Michelle Rodriguez, in her first movie role.) It can be difficult to watch a girl from a violent home choose to hit and be hit by a boy she loves — for her to overcome her trauma by repeating it, to embrace ritualized violence as a matter of dignity. “There are people who rejected that moment in the movie,” Kusama said over dessert at the table in Los Feliz, “and then there were people who embraced it emotionally. And then I think there was that interesting sliver of the audience who saw it as reality.” In Guzman’s world, she explained, the safest place is the ring. “I felt like there was something about the idea of, not necessarily acceptable violence, but a controlled space,” she said, “a refereed space. It’s kind of like we’re all looking for that in some way.” Kusama stormed into a dim office accented with screens, a leather couch, a purple exercise ball and tangles of black wires. “Do you think it would be aggressive if I put a sign up over the sink that says: ‘There’s no dish fairy. Be a [expletive] grown-up!’?” Armed with a black stylus and facing a cockpit of three large computer monitors, her editor, Plummy Tucker, mildly replied, “I think humor can work.” It was the beginning of Kusama and Tucker’s fourth week of cutting “Destroyer.” The film had a $9 million budget — not a big number when compared with a Marvel movie, but “The Invitation” had a $1 million budget, and Kusama and Tucker felt they had come up in the world. For one thing, they were editing in a suite on Hollywood Boulevard, not in Kusama’s garage. Kusama didn’t have to roast chickens for everybody’s lunch. (When Kidman came down with the flu during the shoot, Kusama did make her a bone broth, but that was a one-off.) Parking was free, and there was a Core Power Yoga studio on the first floor of the building, if ever they could find time for that. Kusama knows what can happen when a director doesn’t have final cut. “Aeon Flux,” her $62 million Hollywood break, was taken away from her, mangled beyond the point of recognition, returned to her hands under supervision and released to awful reviews. The studio didn’t know how to market “Jennifer’s Body”; the posters tried to appeal to teenage boys with a bodacious Megan Fox, but the movie was actually a sly and witty take on a toxic friendship between two girls. (It has since found an audience as a cult classic.) Six years later, “The Invitation” — a low-budget indie, released simultaneously in theaters and video on demand and over which Kusama had creative control — was heralded as a “comeback.” Kusama refuses that label. “I’ve never gone anywhere,” she says. “If I was exiled, I exiled myself.” Still, it’s clear that her current strength has something to do with the decision to avoid studio behemoths and work alongside people she knows and cares about. Tucker has edited all her movies, and her composer, Theodore Shapiro, has scored four out of five. She takes Hay and Manfredi onstage for festival Q. and A.’s and consults them on set. Fred Berger, a producer of “Destroyer,” says she sets “a sort of familial tone in the way she constructs a team.” She isn’t afraid of collaboration, perhaps because she knows who is in charge. Kusama and Tucker had spent the day looking at a sequence that takes place after a knockdown brawl between Bell and Petra (Tatiana Maslany), a member of the gang with which Bell was embedded years before. The scene was based on an incident from Hay’s childhood. Standing in line at a bakery one day, he observed a “very twitchy” woman bleeding near him. A pair of undercover cops burst in and got into an “absolutely insane” fight with her. Turned out the woman was part of a crew who botched a bank robbery down the street. The brawl in “Destroyer” culminates with Petra shackled to a radiator, mauled and cracked, blood drying on her face, hands and chest. It was tricky to finesse. During shooting, Kidman took an exploratory approach to the performance, which gave Kusama a lot to choose from, but it sometimes created problems, as when Kidman raised an arm in one take but not in another. “It’s a process,” Kusama said again and again. She expressed satisfaction moderately: “I think this almost works,” she said at one point. As the day went on, she started saying “Nein!” in a funny, high-pitched voice to any option that was clearly unusable. Finally they left Petra chained to the radiator and turned to a brightly lit flashback. Kusama had intended to cast a younger actress in the film, which would have made straddling the story’s two temporalities easier, but she could not pass up the opportunity to work with Kidman. She appreciated that in addition to all her other gifts, Kidman brought to the role what a younger actress could never bring: “life maturity.” “Destroyer” is very much a document of time and the burden of experience. Like “Girlfight” and “Jennifer’s Body,” it explores how women internalize their trauma by externalizing it physically. Kidman suffers. She’s punched and kicked and bruised. She’s constantly hung over. She is sun-damaged, wrinkled, grimacing, exhausted and unkempt. But she is also powerful — and looks beautiful. There is a nakedness to her face, as if now that she is unrecognizably unglamorous, we can finally see what she looks like. She speaks in a low, hoarse voice (the flu helped her find that register), and she squints into the sun, because “Destroyer” is an L.A. noir that takes place mostly in daylight. Some early audiences couldn’t get past Kidman’s physical transformation. Kusama had heard the reports that Bell was “such a mess, that she was grizzled like fried chicken.” But for her, Bell is a woman who punishes herself for the losses in her life and who finds a way, ultimately, to settle her accounts. The deaths of her friend and brother taught Kusama that she can’t be responsible for other people’s lives. With “Destroyer,” she has turned to the question of what it might mean to be responsible for yourself — and how even people who have done terrible things might be part of making a better world. “These are such extraordinary times,” Kusama says. “People at the highest levels of power would need to take extraordinary steps to address the mess we’re in, and that would all start with looking inward. I’m just curious about, why is that so hard?” “Destroyer” is full of close-ups of Kidman’s face, as many as the exigencies of pace will allow. There are ecstatic shots, too — birds in the sky, snow falling on wet sneakers, two backs overlooking a twinkling Dodger Stadium — but they are, by and large, fleeting. Kusama compared it to the experience of living in Los Angeles: “It’s like: Oh! That was beautiful! It’s gone now. There’s a lot you don’t see.” Color interests her, how it can unify the image — but also how it can enliven or change the story. In the white desert light, a bag suddenly explodes into purple smoke. A robbery is filmed in black and white, like surveillance footage. Scenes in Bell’s apartment are a sludge of brown; Bell and Petra’s brawl in the bakery is given a cheery lift by the pink décor and Petra’s peach sweater. Kusama is fundamentally an image maker, and she loves visual art: photography, old European masterpieces, giant Assyrian slabs of stone, the paintings of Kerry James Marshall, the dizzying op-art of Bridget Riley, Joseph Cornell’s boxes of tiny collections of ancient rings and scarabs. “Imagine if your job was to lay that out,” Kusama said one day this fall as we walked through the Egyptian wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in search of a room of Indian miniatures that she remembered from her time in New York. “That would be so fun.” She wore jeans and black Nikes (they had a gold swoosh), a frilly shirt decorated with fruits and a tote bag emblazoned with Gloria Steinem’s face and the initials WWGD? that she had gotten free somewhere. She does not carry a handbag, because she does not believe in spending good money on an object that is to be thrown onto the floor. “Destroyer” isn’t self-consciously beautiful, she explained, because it hadn’t “earned” it. She mentioned the paintings of Gustave Moreau and the new Yorgos Lanthimos movie, “The Favourite,” both of which depict the brutality of power by paying fanatical attention to glitter and pageantry. But “Destroyer” isn’t about power — it’s about corrosive, ragged degradation — and too much beauty would work against the story, or function only as “cinema porn.” And then there were the demands of realism. The money-laundering lawyer, played with a delicious wheedling whine by Bradley Whitford, doesn’t live in some Michael Mann-inspired stunning glass cube filled with tasteful modernist furniture; he lives in a tacky beige McMansion with fake Roman columns that Kusama describes as “a blight on my eyes.” But “this is wealth talking,” she said. “It’s really ugly.” Walking through the museum was a moment of respite in a “noisy” fall. Kusama was trying to avoid the tweets that her publicist collected and emailed to her, but she gathered that some viewers were finding it challenging to spend two hours in the company of Erin Bell. “Some of the people have been talking about the movie in terms of how brutal it is, how dark it is, how tough it is,” she said. “I’m just like: Guys? What world are you living in? You think I’m dark?” Just before we found the miniature paintings, we took a turn coming down from the Arts of Tibet and Nepal and found ourselves in the Southeast Asian galleries, where a small stone creature stopped Kusama in her tracks. It had a wide, distorted mouth, and the overall effect was gremliny: at once fearsome and adorable. “In Japan, they have a version of this,” she said in a low voice so as not to bother the other museumgoers. “It’s called netsuke. It’s like your little demons.” Netsuke are elaborately carved figures, beasts or demons that were used to fasten a box to a man’s kimono sash. They are highly coveted by collectors. Kusama smiled. “And so, of course, all you’d want to do is collect a ton of them, to have control over your demons.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Five Most Important Stories of 2018,"The newsletter’s countdown starts today, with #5. Opinion Columnist This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Today’s newsletter starts a countdown of my choices for the five most important news stories of 2018. They’re not necessarily the ones that received the most attention this year. They are the ones likely to have long-term impact. For each one, I’ll offer a few reading suggestions that put the stories in perspective. The countdown will run through Dec. 31 (although tomorrow I’ll pause the countdown for a bit of Christmas distraction). During this time, I’m going to take a break from writing about the latest news. I’ll be back to writing about the news on Jan. 1. In the meantime, The Times Opinion report will be full of commentary on the big stories, like the government shutdown and President Trump’s foreign policy — and, as always, you can find links to the Opinion report at the bottom of the newsletter. I hope all of you enjoy the final days of the year, however you mark them. [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] Now for the fifth most important story of 2018: The tarnishing of big tech When The Harris Poll ranked the American companies with the best reputations two years ago, the top three were all technology companies: Amazon, Apple and Google. Last year, those three were all still in the top 10. In the 2018 version, though, only Amazon remained at the top. Google had fallen to #28, and Apple to #29. Facebook was down at #51 (and has never been very high). This year was one when many Americans soured on Big Tech. The concerns included screen addiction, privacy violations, monopoly-like powers and technology’s role in fomenting political extremism. “This was the year,” The Wall Street Journal’s Greg Ip wrote, “when Big Tech companies were humbled, their reputations tarnished and their share prices clobbered.” I’m glad to see a new level of scrutiny. Digital technology obviously brings some enormous positives, and there is no reversing its spread. But we’ve been too blasé about the downsides of our new online world. A question for 2019 and beyond is what we’re going to do about those downsides.

2018,"The Foreign Billionaires, Activists and Missionaries Detained in China","BEIJING — Missionaries. Corporate investigators. Billionaires. Legal activists. China has a long history of arresting or holding foreigners for mysterious reasons, often in a tit-for-tat play to put pressure on overseas rivals. In recent years the number of such detentions has increased, a disturbing trend for foreigners visiting or conducting business in the country. The Chinese government has detained two prominent foreigners in recent days: Michael Kovrig, a former Canadian diplomat, and Michael Spavor, a Canadian writer and entrepreneur. They are the latest foreigners to be held by the authorities, in what some experts said might be retribution for the arrest of a senior Chinese tech executive in Canada this month. Here are some recent cases of foreigners caught in the cross hairs of China’s opaque legal system. Kevin and Julia Garratt, Christian aid workers from Canada, were best known in Dandong, a Chinese city near the border with North Korea, for operating a popular coffee shop. They also worked with a charity that provided food to North Koreans. But in 2014, they were arrested by the Chinese authorities on “suspicion of stealing and spying to obtain state secrets.” Ms. Garratt was released on bail and allowed to leave China. Mr. Garratt spent two years in prison before his eventual release. Both have denied the accusations. Legal experts say that the Chinese government might have arrested the Garratts in hopes of pressuring Canada into releasing Su Bin, a Chinese aviation entrepreneur who was being held in Vancouver, after the United States accused him of stealing military data and sought extradition. Chinese officials have denied that the Garratts’ arrest was related to Mr. Su’s case. On a January morning last year, Xiao Jianhua, one of China’s most politically connected financiers, was escorted out of the Four Seasons Hotel in Hong Kong in a wheelchair by unidentified men. Mr. Xiao had rare insight into the financial holdings of China’s most powerful families, having made his fortune investing in banks, insurers and real estate. Mr. Xiao, a Chinese-born Canadian citizen, is now believed to be in custody in the mainland, helping the authorities with investigations into the finance industry, though the government has not specified the reasons for his abduction. Peter Humphrey, a British private investigator, and his wife, Yu Yingzeng, a Chinese-born American citizen, ran a small consulting firm in Shanghai that specialized in “discreet investigations” for multinational companies, focusing on issues like counterfeiting and embezzlement. But as an investigation by the Chinese government into fraud and corruption at GlaxoSmithKline, the pharmaceutical maker, escalated in 2013, Mr. Humphrey and Ms. Yu, who advised the firm, came under scrutiny as well. The couple were arrested and charged with violating the rights of Chinese citizens by obtaining private information. Mr. Humphrey and Ms. Yu served prison sentences of about two years. Peter Dahlin, a Swedish citizen, was the co-founder of a nongovernmental organization in Beijing that provided legal aid to Chinese citizens. His work soon caught the attention of the authorities, who were cracking down on foreign nongovernmental organizations and human rights lawyers. In early 2016, Mr. Dahlin was detained and interrogated for 23 days by China’s Ministry of State Security. He was forced to record a confession and to apologize on national television. Then he was deported. Liu Changming, a former executive at a state-owned bank in China, is among China’s most-wanted fugitives. He is accused of playing a central role in a $1.4 billion fraud case. He fled the country in 2007. Now, in what some describe as a bid to lure Mr. Liu back, the Chinese government is preventing his wife and children, who are American citizens, from leaving China. Mr. Liu’s wife, Sandra Han, and their children, Victor and Cynthia, arrived in China in June to visit an ailing relative. Ms. Han was detained, and the children have been held for months under a practice known as an exit ban.",The New York Times
2018,The Four Seasons Returns. But Can It Come Back?,"Restaurant Review When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. There is a good case to be made for not reviewing the newly relocated Four Seasons Restaurant at all but just leaving it on the slush pile, and that case can be found in court records involving Julian Niccolini. Mr. Niccolini has operated the restaurant with Alex von Bidder since the mid-1990s, first at its original home in the Seagram Building and now, after a two-year hiatus, in a smaller berth on the other side of Park Avenue. Over that time, he has frequently been celebrated for his charm. Less frequently, he has been a defendant in civil and criminal actions arising from things he was accused of having done to women inside the restaurant. In 1991, one of his waitresses sued Mr. Niccolini and the Four Seasons, citing sexual harassment. She claimed that for more than three years he had repeatedly rubbed up against her, told her in vulgar terms about his sexual urges and called her “slut,” “lesbian” and other things. Mr. Niccolini denied the charges. In 2014, a former assistant manager filed suit against Mr. Niccolini, Mr. von Bidder and the Four Seasons, alleging discrimination. The ex-manager said that after she returned from a maternity leave, the restaurant made it difficult for her to pump breast milk during work hours and, about three months later, fired her and replaced her with a man. In a response filed with the court, the defendants denied the allegations. Both suits were settled under terms that have not been divulged. In 2015, Mr. Niccolini was arrested on a felony charge of sexual abuse. According to a prosecutor, he had attacked a woman at the Four Seasons bar “with such force that he ripped her bra open and caused significant scratch marks on her back and bruising on her hip.” After pleading guilty the following year to a reduced charge of misdemeanor assault, Mr. Niccolini was given a “conditional discharge,” avoiding jail. I know people who will never eat at the Four Seasons because they don’t want to give Mr. Niccolini their money. I understand this. I also know people in the food media who think the Four Seasons should not get any coverage as long as Mr. Niccolini owns a piece of it. I understand this, too, but it’s not my view. [Julian Niccolini has since been forced to resign from the restaurant.] Their stance rests, I think, on the idea that writing about powerful men who have been accused of abusing women amounts to condoning the abuse and helping the abusers stay in power. While it’s true that media attention is often like oxygen to restaurants, critics have the power to tell a story other than the one the restaurant is pushing. Even when we’re not writing a pan, a fair assessment often requires weaving shining threads with ugly ones. The ugliest threads at the Four Seasons happen to be ugly enough to make many people stay away. But there is beauty in the fabric, too. The Four Seasons has been a significant force in dining: a pioneer in championing American ingredients and wine; an innovator in bringing contemporary design into the restaurant world; a cultivator of an eclectic scene that treated political power, financial success and creative talent as coequal branches of a high society that was peculiar to New York. Most of this happened some time ago. In its last years in the Seagram Building, the Four Seasons had become a shabby but lovely museum of midcentury architecture and design, with martinis that I didn’t mind overpaying for and food that I did. I was curious about its new incarnation, which opened in August, and curiosity is as good a reason as any for a critic to swing into action. If I were writing the next chapter in a long history, I’d mention how gracefully Diego Garcia has grown into his new job as the restaurant’s chef. I enjoyed Mr. Garcia’s fish cookery at his last restaurant, a small, bare-bones place in Hell’s Kitchen called Gloria, but he seemed limited by the kitchen’s size. He works on a grander scale now, with more expensive ingredients and more delicate treatments that still betray his creative streak. He roasts duck because the Four Seasons is famous for it, and makes fresh pasta and risotto because the captains in their black jackets need some place to shave all those white truffles. For all intents and purposes, though, he has turned the Four Seasons into a seafood restaurant, and a very good one. It’s not hard to believe he was once a sous-chef at Le Bernardin when you taste, say, the raw scallop slivers in citrus juices, elegantly equipped with tart apple and caviar, or the intensely smooth chowder of tiny, just-cooked clams in a New England-style cream broth that’s pale yellow with butterfat. He knows when to show restraint and when to go all in, taking sea-urchin ravioli that are already head-spinningly rich and draping lobes of sea urchin over them. Some of the cooking is boring in the right way. I don’t want surprises in Dover sole à la meunière, and I didn’t get any. It was flawless. The duck will surprise only people who don’t know that duck meat cooked to well-done bastes in its own fat until it is almost a warm confit. Other dishes were boring in the usual sense. The mustard sauce poured around the golden crab cake tasted like cream that was shown a picture of a mustard jar. The chapter would also depict the return of Bill Yosses. Anybody who ate his desserts before he disappeared into the White House won’t be surprised by how good they are here. They do have a slight Rip Van Winkle quality, suggesting that Mr. Yosses allowed several new waves in pastry to pass him by, but that’s no criticism. He makes a better baba au rhum than almost anyone in town, his chocolate tart with a salted stripe of caramel is both powerful and precise, and his hazelnut financier balanced over roasted pears is more delicious than almost any almond financier you can find. He has even improved the restaurant’s signature, the Kate Pierson beehive of cotton candy that sails out to the tables of valued guests. (Apparently I’ve joined that club.) This being the Four Seasons, the history would have to mention the new restaurant’s interior. It reminded me of the old Philip Johnson dining rooms without making me sad to be here instead of there, a trick I had thought was impossible. The bronze bead curtains have transformed into strings of gilded glass baubles; the flatware and glasses pay homage to the vintage designs used at the original restaurant; and the bar is once again a four-sided island in the middle of a lounge. For the first time you can eat a real meal there, while you watch the Grand Central-bound commuters outside and the cotton candy-bound regulars inside, generally a mature group in tightly knotted ties or heels that echo down the corridor to the dining room like the ticking of a grandfather clock. All of this and a generous budget (the prices are as exclusionary as ever) could make for a few hours of celebratory sightseeing of a kind that is quickly disappearing from the city. The Four Seasons offers an escape from the outside world. Escaping from what’s inside, however, takes a mental effort that is beyond me and will probably be beyond many others as well, whether Mr. Niccolini is in sight or not. During my three meals, I never saw him. Restaurants, even grand ones like the Four Seasons, are intimate places; eating is an act that requires trust and a sense of safety. We want to get up from the table feeling restored on all fronts except the financial one. Mr. Niccolini’s actions have done serious damage to his power to provide that feeling, even as he and Mr. von Bidder have made the restaurant better than it has been in years.

2018,Opinion | The Fun (or Not) of Walking My Cat,"letters Readers share experiences, including the not-to-be-repeated. To the Editor: Re “Yes, You Should Walk Your Cat,” by David Grimm (Op-Ed, Dec. 8): I have walked my cat for years on a leash and can attest to the benefits. My cat can enjoy nature without being a predator or prey; get some exercise; socialize with friendly neighbors; enjoy some extra attention; and have a focal point in her day. Sure, I get plenty of comments and bewildered looks, but even those can be fun. The best was a man who stared straight at us and said, “This is right out of ‘Seinfeld’!” Nadia El-BadryDobbs Ferry, N.Y. To the Editor: I tried walking our cat, a beautiful Persian-Maine Coon mongrel with the soul of a teamster, shortly after he came to us from his earlier life in a wide open suburb. What I forgot was that a cat is a climbing animal that, when startled, will go up the nearest thing. On that day, the nearest thing was me. The stripes from his muscular claws healed, but the experiment was over. Ann Norvell GrayRichmond, Va.",The New York Times
2018,The Future Is Bright for the Video Games of Yesterday,"Scott Bachrach remembers playing games like Centipede, Galaga and Pac-Man with his friends at his local arcade in Los Angeles in the 1980s. “It was the spot where we went to on Friday nights,” said Mr. Bachrach, now 50. “We put our quarters on the top of the machines to play the game. We would play for hours.” Now, as the chief executive of Tastemakers, a toy company, he is recreating that experience for a new generation. The business has collected licenses for his favorite games and others, like Street Fighter II, and is reproducing them in its Arcade1Up arcade-style cabinets. “This was a passion project,” Mr. Bachrach said, “that turned into a significant business for us.” Tastemakers is not alone in trying to capitalize on the nostalgia for older video games. Nintendo helped popularize the retro gaming trend with the 2016 release of the NES Classic, a scaled-down and inexpensive version of its original console and 30 vintage games. After that, other rivals, including Sony, started mining their vaults to resurface games and hardware, while smaller companies began remastering past titles. Some struggling game brands, like Atari, are getting a boost from continued interest in older games. Retailers are getting into the mix as well, with companies like Amazon and Target scrambling to provide space exclusively for classic video games and related merchandise. Even the electric-car maker Tesla included some Atari games in the latest software update for its vehicles. “In the past, we thought games were more disposable entertainment,” said Mat Piscatella, a video game industry analyst for NPD, a market research company. “There is a lot of intrinsic value that old games can provide.” One in five new consoles sold in the United States this year has been a retro plug-and-play device, Mr. Piscatella said, contributing to the overall growth in the video game industry. Sales of hardware, software and accessories in the United States reached $14.6 billion in 2017, an 11 percent increase over 2016, according to NPD. “Everything in gaming has gotten so complicated and tech heavy,” Mr. Piscatella said. “Here’s this $80 device that you can plug into a TV and go.” Nintendo’s NES Classic was an immediate sellout, prompting the company to follow up with the Super NES Classic, one of the top-selling consoles in the 2017 holiday shopping season, according to NPD. Nintendo announced on Wednesday that it had sold more than two million NES Classic consoles and more than 2.5 million Super NES Classic consoles in the United States since they were introduced. For players looking to play the games on a modern device, Nintendo offered 20 classic games to subscribers of its Nintendo Switch Online network, a premium service that went live in September, and has plans to add more. “People remember the colors and shape of the console and the feel of the controllers from their childhood, and they have a visceral reaction when they first fire up their favorite NES or Super NES games,” said Reginald Fils-Aimé, president and chief operating officer of Nintendo of America. Sony will follow suit on Monday with the PlayStation Classic, a plug-and-play unit loaded with 20 games for $100. The company has reintroduced older titles over its game network in the past, but this will be an opportunity to relive playing those games on the first PlayStation console, said Eric Lempel, senior vice president of global marketing at PlayStation. “It’s kind of like watching a classic movie versus a remake or a colorized version,” Mr. Lempel said. “This is the way you remember those games.” Smaller companies are having success licensing games and repackaging them with new hardware. AtGames, a manufacturer in Taiwan, has sold titles from developers like Activision, Atari and Bandai Namco for more than a decade through its Flashback series, which packages games on replicas of the once popular Atari 2600 and Sega Genesis consoles. AtGames’ latest offering, Blast, is a pared-down version with fewer games, a small controller and a dongle that plugs into an HDMI port on a TV. This new product allows the company to move into a lower price point, said PK Hsiung, the company’s chief executive. Nintendo and PlayStation aim for typical technology retailers, he said, but 80 percent of AtGames’ sales come from retailers like CVS, Kroger, Walgreens and Bed Bath & Beyond. “They are not competing with us,” Mr. Hsiung said of his bigger rivals. “They are helping us by making retro games mainstream.” The influx of games and new consoles is starting to make analysts like Mr. Piscatella of NPD wonder how much longer the sales growth can last. Nintendo dominates sales, but it has not announced plans to release other classic consoles. Other publishers may face difficulties, Mr. Piscatella added, like finding the right fit for their games or securing licenses. Rather than license their games to other companies, some video game publishers are releasing them on their own. After finding a hit with a retro Crash Bandicoot package last year, Activision remastered a trilogy of games featuring Spyro the Dragon. “It’s probably better to say we remade these games,” said Steve Young, executive vice president and chief revenue officer at Activision. Because of advances in the processing power of consoles, studios are able to rebuild games from the ground up with high-definition graphics, he said. Even the music was updated. The publisher invited Stewart Copeland, the former drummer for the Police and the composer of the original Spyro series’ soundtrack, to create a new main theme for the remastered version. Other publishers are reaching deals with accessory makers like Retro-Bit. The company’s Super Retro-Cade console features more than 90 titles from publishers like Capcom, Data East, Irem and Technos. “This console brings a lot of games released out of Japan that were never released in the U.S.,” said Richard Igros, the marketing manager for Innex, the distributor of Retro-Bit products. The company also repackages hard-to-find classic games on cartridges made for older consoles. One of their biggest sellers, for instance, is a collection that includes an obscure title, Magic Drop. “It’s not a well-known game,” Mr. Igros admits, “but it has a cult following.”",The New York Times

This excerpt has been edited and condensed. MS. GONZALEZ I don’t want to minimize the fact that newspapers in this country are facing a serious threat, but I’d like to say that we’re so good at telling our own stories — a little too good in this instance. We write so much about the issues that newspapers face. But left out of the conversation is the fact that the same digital upheaval that is impacting us is impacting television and cable and the music industry. Technology is disrupting everyone. The key is how are we responding to that disruption. It requires a creative realignment of how you approach what you do. I think the essence of what we do is so critical, I think we have to figure out how we keep doing what we do. I cannot imagine the city like Miami without The Miami Herald to hold our elected leaders and the powerful accountable.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The G.O.P. Goes Full Authoritarian,"Only Trump’s flamboyant awfulness stands in the way of his party’s power grab. Opinion Columnist Donald Trump, it turns out, may have been the best thing that could have happened to American democracy. No, I haven’t lost my mind. Individual-1 is clearly a wannabe dictator who has contempt for the rule of law, not to mention being corrupt and probably in the pocket of foreign powers. But he’s also lazy, undisciplined, self-absorbed and inept. And since the threat to democracy is much broader and deeper than one man, we’re actually fortunate that the forces menacing America have such a ludicrous person as their public face. Yet those forces may prevail all the same. If you want to understand what’s happening to our country, the book you really need to read is “How Democracies Die,” by Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt. As the authors — professors of government at Harvard — point out, in recent decades a number of nominally democratic nations have become de facto authoritarian, one-party states. Yet none of them have had classic military coups, with tanks in the street. What we’ve seen instead are coups of a subtler form: takeovers or intimidation of the news media, rigged elections that disenfranchise opposing voters, new rules of the game that give the ruling party overwhelming control even if it loses the popular vote, corrupted courts. The classic example is Hungary, where Fidesz, the white nationalist governing party, has effectively taken over the bulk of the media; destroyed the independence of the judiciary; rigged voting to enfranchise supporters and disenfranchise opponents; gerrymandered electoral districts in its favor; and altered the rules so that a minority in the popular vote translates into a supermajority in the legislature. Does a lot of this sound familiar? It should. You see, Republicans have been adopting similar tactics — not at the federal level (yet), but in states they control. As Levitsky and Ziblatt say, the states, which Justice Louis Brandeis famously pronounced the laboratories of democracy, “are in danger of becoming laboratories of authoritarianism as those in power rewrite electoral rules, redraw constituencies and even rescind voting rights to ensure that they do not lose.” Thus, voter purges and deliberate restriction of minority access to the polls have become standard practice in much of America. Would Brian Kemp, the governor-elect of Georgia — who oversaw his own election as secretary of state — have won without these tactics? Almost certainly not. And the G.O.P. has engaged in extreme gerrymandering. Some people have been reassured by the fact that the Democratic landslide in the popular vote for the House did, in fact, translate into a comparable majority in seats held. But you get a lot less reassured if you look at what happened at the state level, where votes often weren’t reflected in terms of control of state legislatures. Let’s talk, in particular, about what’s happening in Wisconsin. There has been a fair amount of reporting on the power grab currently underway in Madison. Having lost every statewide office in Wisconsin last month, Republicans are using the lame-duck legislative session to drastically curtail these offices’ power, effectively keeping rule over the state in the hands of the G.O.P.-controlled Legislature. What has gotten less emphasis is the fact that G.O.P. legislative control is also undemocratic. Last month Democratic candidates received 54 percent of the votes in State Assembly elections — but they ended up with only 37 percent of the seats. In other words, Wisconsin is turning into Hungary on the Great Lakes, a state that may hold elections, but where elections don’t matter, because the ruling party retains control no matter what voters do. And here’s the thing: As far as I can tell, not a single prominent Republican in Washington has condemned the power grab in Wisconsin, the similar grab in Michigan, or even what looks like outright electoral fraud in North Carolina. Elected Republicans don’t just increasingly share the values of white nationalist parties like Fidesz or Poland’s Law and Justice; they also share those parties’ contempt for democracy. The G.O.P. is an authoritarian party in waiting. Which is why we should be grateful for Trump. If he weren’t so flamboyantly awful, Democrats might have won the House popular vote by only 4 or 5 points, not 8.6 points. And in that case, Republicans might have maintained control — and we’d be well along the path to permanent one-party rule. Instead, we’re heading for a period of divided government, in which the opposition party has both the power to block legislation and, perhaps even more important, the ability to conduct investigations backed by subpoena power into Trump administration malfeasance. But this may be no more than a respite. For whatever may happen to Donald Trump, his party has turned its back on democracy. And that should terrify you. The fact is that the G.O.P., as currently constituted, is willing to do whatever it takes to seize and hold power. And as long as that remains true, and Republicans remain politically competitive, we will be one election away from losing democracy in America.

2018,Opinion | The G.O.P. Is a Boys’ Club. This Woman Is Trying to Change That.,"One of the few Republican women in Congress fights the male status quo. Ms. Cottle is a member of the editorial board. Representative Elise Stefanik considers last month’s midterm elections a “watershed moment” — and not in a good way. Ms. Stefanik, a Republican from upstate New York, is sick of her party losing female members. In the new Congress, the number of Republican women in the House will plummet to 13 from 23. That’s the lowest in more than two decades, even as a majority of the incoming Democrats in the House takeover are women. Republican women also lost significant ground in state races. As for voter support, 59 percent of women went Democratic, and the overall gender gap hit a whopping 23 points. This meltdown should be a “wake-up call” for every member of her party, said Ms. Stefanik in a phone interview. While the reasons for Republicans’ lady troubles are many and varied, the dearth of women’s voices at the table makes it all the more unlikely that the situation will improve. When Ms. Stefanik, at 34 one of the youngest members of her conference, pushed the issue at a recent meeting, her colleagues — about 90 percent of whom are men — displayed little motivation to address it. “I don’t think there has been enough introspection,” she said. More troubling was the total absence of ideas for tackling the problem: “I wanted a specific strategy for how we do better to ensure that the conference reflects the American public.” And so Ms. Stefanik decided to take action herself. She has begun touting a new crusade to get more Republican women elected to Congress by having her leadership PAC “play big” in primary races. Last cycle, as head of recruitment for the National Republican Congressional Committee — the first woman to hold that position — she drafted around 100 female candidates for the midterms, only to see many of them fall in the primaries. The N.R.C.C. has a policy of not playing favorites in primary races. But, citing her own experience as a first-time candidate in 2014, Ms. Stefanik stressed that early support is vital in what can be an “overwhelming” process. “This needs to be a real priority,” she said. Ms. Stefanik’s new project may seem like an uncontroversial step — a no-brainer. Except that the Republican Party has always been skittish, derisive even, about prioritizing female candidates, sniffily claiming to reject identity politics in favor of backing the “best candidate” without regard to gender or race. This means that, going forward, Ms. Stefanik will be battling not only a fired-up Democratic opposition, but also deeply entrenched elements within her own party. Sure enough, upon announcing her effort, Ms. Stefanik promptly faced pushback from the N.R.C.C. Representative Tom Emmer, the committee’s new chairman, pronounced her plan “a mistake,” telling Roll Call, “It shouldn’t be just based on looking for a specific set of ingredients — gender, race, religion — and then we’re going to play in the primary.” The idea that the Republican Party under President Trump doesn’t indulge in identity politics is laughable. In addition to fanning racial grievance, Mr. Trump has aggressively pitched himself as a defender of Traditional Manhood against feminists and #MeToo advocates, reflexively defending accused predators and lamenting how scary it is to be a young man these days. Mr. Emmer’s comments, in fact, struck some Republican women as Exhibit A of how a shameful number of men in their party still don’t grasp the gravity of the situation. “Totally tone deaf,” lamented one strategist. “Antagonistic when he didn’t need to be.” According to Andrea Bozek, the spokeswoman for Winning For Women, a super PAC aimed at getting more Republican women elected, “Someone has to be pushing the panic button — we’re at code red.” If women “don’t see themselves” and “don’t feel like they have a voice” in the party, she warned, “those numbers are going to dwindle” even further. There’s no reason the party can’t take a stand on this, agreed Jean Card, a communications strategist active in Republican politics. “How about: Men and women are different and do approach tasks differently and do approach life differently? That’s a Republican value.” Ms. Stefanik finds the whole debate over identity politics “outdated.” “I’m from a different generation,” she said. “I really leaned into talking about the fact that I am a young woman.” At campaign events, she would boast that she “wasn’t what most people picture when they picture a traditional Republican candidate.” She also aimed to “talk about every issue as a women’s issue.” As an example, she cited medical-device manufacturing, a field that employs a large number of women in her district but doesn’t exactly qualify as a traditional women’s issue. “Some colleagues would say that’s identity politics,” she said. “I think it’s a smarter, more personalized way of communicating.” Of course, the Republican refrain that “all issues are women’s issues” is often used to shift discussion away from policy areas that have been helping Democrats expand the parties’ gender gap — areas like as health care, gun safety, reproductive rights and this president’s irrepressible sexism. Liz Cheney, the House Republicans’ newly elected chairwoman, hit this theme soon after the midterms, denouncing the Democrats’ approach to wooing women as “offensive” and “paternalistic.” Another way to characterize it might be “highly effective.” Ms. Stefanik isn’t looking to have a public brawl over ideology. She’s simply pushing to get more women a seat at her party’s table. Who’s to say where things could go from there? “Elise Stefanik is no dummy,” said Ms. Card. “She knows that a political party is reformed in the primaries. That’s what’s going on here.” Which may explain why some of Ms. Stefanik’s male colleagues don’t seem all that enthusiastic about her plans.

2018,Opinion | The Generals Won’t Save Us,"People who saw Jim Mattis as a check against Trump misunderstand the role of the military in a democracy. Ms. Schake is the deputy director general of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. In a pique of anger over Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis’s resignation letter, President Trump announced over the weekend that Mr. Mattis would be out of a job on Jan. 1, instead of the end of February, as the secretary had recommended in order to provide a stable transition. The hunt for his replacement is now on, setting up a rushed conversation in the news media, and then in the Senate, over what sort of person should follow Mr. Mattis in leading the Pentagon — and with it, a debate about the state of civil-military relations. Given the way the public praised Mr. Mattis, and then bemoaned his departure, we have some work to do. President Trump originally picked Mr. Mattis because, according to reports, he looked the part of a battle-hardened warrior, and had even been called “Mad Dog” by an enterprising journalist. That Mr. Mattis was equally known for lugging around a footlocker of Western novels and stoic philosophies, testifying in favor of greater spending for diplomacy, standing Christmas watch for enlisted Marines and writing thoughtfully about civil-military challenges 45 years into America’s experiment with an all-volunteer force were, evidently, matters of indifference to the commander in chief. The president’s political opponents, including me, heaved a huge sigh of relief at Mr. Mattis’s nomination; we knew him as an intelligent, measured leader. But some among us, on both sides of the political divide, went further, anticipating that the recently retired general (and other veterans in the new administration) would save us from the president and his policies — even though, for better or worse, the American people had voted him into office on the basis of those policies. Some people also imagined that Mr. Mattis and others would stand in the way of the president should he make ill-advised or apocalyptic military decisions — for example, some questioned whether the Defense Department would carry out a nuclear launch order against North Korea, even though not doing so would dangerously undermine civilian control of the military. Many, in other words, hoped that Mr. Mattis would be willing to subvert American democracy in order to check a bad president. Many also cheered Mr. Mattis’s forthright resignation letter, which detailed his fundamental differences with the president on national security. But these attitudes, welcome as they are to those of us who share them, need to be tempered by the other important element of the Mattis letter: that the president has the right to have cabinet officials who work assiduously to carry out his policies. This is especially true where the vast power and influence of the Department of Defense is concerned. Drawing those associated with the military into highly charged political arguments, as the president did when he called Mr. Mattis “sort of a Democrat,” is unquestionably bad for our military as an institution. But the president’s opponents make the same dangerous mistake when they demand a secretary of defense who acts to oppose his or her own president. Moreover, the president has the right to be wrong, and the Department of Defense has the obligation to carry out lawful orders rather than set themselves up as uniquely virtuous arbiters of the good of the country. As Thomas Jefferson said, the people are the only safe repository for the ultimate powers of society. We do our military and veterans a disservice by treating them all as comic book heroes and shirking onto them responsibility for policies that protect us from our elected officials. They have done enough by securing our liberty. But perhaps the Trump presidency may end up being good for civil-military relations in America. By selecting so many veterans for high offices, he has given the public a rare view into the executive competence of our former military leaders. We have front-row seats to judge their abilities and compare them to their counterparts who did no military service. The Trump administration is providing a welcome reminder for us that our veterans, like the rest of our fellow Americans, are a diverse bunch. Jim Mattis is a model of Roman virtues; Michael Flynn is now a felon. And perhaps this exposure, after decades in which the military leadership was largely left in the wings of public policy debates, will help Americans — the overwhelming number of whom have no military experience — develop a better sense of what the military can and cannot do in a democracy. The solution to the dangers posed by the president is not to put our faith in a Roman tribune. Rather, it is to use the legislative and political tools available to us as citizens to hem in the chief executive, and wrest those powers from him at the ballot box.

2018,The Genes That Make Parrots Into the Humans of the Bird World,"Trilobites Long-lived and clever parrots may be as different genetically from other birds as humans are from other primates. A macaw named Poncho starred in movies like “102 Dalmatians,” “Dr. Doolittle” and “Ace Ventura: Pet Detective” before retiring in England. She recently celebrated her 90th birthday. Alex, an African grey parrot who lived to 31, knew colors, shapes and numbers, and communicated using basic expressions. He could do what toddlers only do after a certain stage of development — know when something is hidden from view. And they’re just two of the many parrots in the world who have surprised us with their intelligence, skills and longevity. “Nature does these experiments for us, and then we have to go and ask, how did this happen?” said Dr. Claudio Mello, a neuroscientist at Oregon Health and Science University. So he and a team of nearly two dozen scientists looked for clues in the genome of the blue-fronted Amazon parrot in Brazil, his home country. After comparing its genome with those of dozens of other birds, the researchers’ findings suggest that evolution may have made parrots something like the humans of the avian world. In some ways, the long-lived feathered friends are as genetically different from other birds as humans are from other primates. Their analysis, published Thursday in Current Biology, also highlights how two very different animals — parrots and humans — can wind up finding similar solutions to problems through evolution. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] A general rule of life span in birds and other animals is the bigger or heavier you are, the longer you live. A small bird like a finch may live five to eight years, while bigger ones like eagles or cranes can live decades. The blue-fronted Amazon and some other parrots are even more exceptional, in that they can live up to 66 years — in some cases outliving their human companions. In their analysis, Dr. Mello and his colleagues found that these parrots and some other long-lived birds shared changes in a set of 344 genes that seem to be involved in various processes that influence life span, like how an animal’s body repairs DNA, manages cancer or controls cell growth. While about 20 of these genetic changes have been implicated in aging in other animals, the rest of the genes’ direct role in life span has not been investigated. Future studies may reveal that they’re not just important to aging in parrots or other long-lived birds, but in other animals as well. Parrots are distinguished not only by their longevity, but also by their cognitive abilities. “They’re really, really smart animals, and the brains are particularly big. We seem to see a parallel in humans that have bigger brains and enhanced capacities, compared to other animals,” he said. “We think parrots are the parallel in the avian world.” The team found changes in parts of the parrot genome remarkably similar to those that set humans apart from other primates. This intrigued Dr. Mello. The similar changes found in parrots and humans aren’t to the genes themselves, but occur along regions of the genome that regulate the expression of nearby genes that seem to play a role in brain development and intelligence. Could these changes explain the parrot’s large, complex brain and diverse set of talents? Only by looking at specifics can we find out. While it’s relatively simpler to quantify age and see how various genetic changes might alter it, it’s harder to assess how tiny switches turning on and off at certain times might alter the size of a parrot’s brain — or how well it can impersonate Matthew McConaughey. By looking at specifics in the genetic changes of parrots and humans, researchers in the future may develop a better understanding of the powers of convergent evolution. Perhaps there is only one path that leads complex brain structures and advanced cognitive abilities like those of parrots and humans. Or it could be that there is more than one evolutionary route capable of producing such complex creatures in different parts of the animal kingdom.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Ghost of Trump Chaos Future,"Sorry, investors, but there is no sanity clause. Opinion Columnist Two years ago, after the shock of Donald Trump’s election, financial markets briefly freaked out, then quickly recovered. In effect, they decided that while Trump was manifestly unqualified for the job, temperamentally and intellectually, it wouldn’t matter. He might talk the populist talk, but he’d walk the plutocratic walk. He might be erratic and uninformed, but wiser heads would keep him from doing anything too stupid. In other words, investors convinced themselves that they had a deal: Trump might sound off, but he wouldn’t really get to make policy. And, hey, taxes on corporations and the wealthy would go down. But now, just in time for Christmas, people are realizing that there was no such deal — or at any rate, that there wasn’t a sanity clause. (Sorry, couldn’t help myself.) Put an unstable, ignorant, belligerent man in the Oval Office, and he will eventually do crazy things. To be clear, voters have been aware for some time that government by a bad man is bad government. That’s why Democrats won a historically spectacular majority of the popular vote in the midterms. Even the wealthy, who have been the prime beneficiaries of Trump policies, are unhappy: A CNBC survey finds that millionaires, even Republican millionaires, have turned sharply against the tweeter in chief. But market behavior has, until recently, been a different story. The reality that presidential unfitness matters for investors seems to have started setting in only about three weeks (and around 4,000 points on the Dow) ago. First came the realization that Trump’s much-hyped deal with China existed only in his imagination. Then came his televised meltdown in a meeting with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, his abrupt pullout from Syria, his firing of Jim Mattis and his shutdown of the government because Congress won’t cater to his edifice complex and build a pointless wall. And now there’s buzz that he wants to fire Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. Oh, and along the way we learned that Trump has been engaging in raw obstruction of justice, pressuring his acting attorney general (who is himself a piece of work) over the Mueller investigation as the tally of convictions, confessions and forced resignations mounts. But let’s play devil’s advocate here: Does all this Trump chaos matter for the economy, or for the stock market (which isn’t at all the same thing)? At first sight, it’s not all that obvious. After all, aside from the prospect of trade war, none of Individual-1’s tantrums, unpresidential as they are, have much direct economic impact. Even the government shutdown will impose only a modest drag on overall spending. And even trade war might not do that much harm, as long as it’s focused mainly on China, which is only one piece of U.S. trade. The really big economic risk was that Trump might break up Nafta, the North American trade agreement: U.S. manufacturing is so deeply integrated with production in Canada and Mexico that this would have been highly disruptive. But he settled for changing the agreement’s name while leaving its structure basically intact, and the remaining risks don’t seem that large. So why do investors seem to be losing their what-me-worry attitude? It’s not so much what Trump is doing, as what he might do in the future — or, perhaps even more important, what he might not do. The truth is that most of the time, presidential actions don’t matter much for the economy; short-term economic management is mainly up to the Fed. But when bad things happen, we do need the White House to step up. In 2008 and 2009, it mattered a lot that officials of both the outgoing Bush administration and the incoming Obama administration responded competently and intelligently to the financial crisis. Unfortunately, there’s no reason to expect a comparable degree of competence if something goes wrong again. Consider how the Trumpistas have responded to falling stocks. So far these are just a minor economic bobble. Yet Trump himself, having claimed credit when stocks were rising, has flown into a rage and lashed out; hence the attacks on Powell. Meanwhile, top officials are still claiming that last year’s tax cut was a triumph in the teeth of the evidence, and issuing bizarre statements — via Twitter — about the health of the banks, which nobody was questioning. Now imagine how this administration team might cope with a real economic setback, whatever its source. Would Trump look for solutions or refuse to accept responsibility and focus mainly on blaming other people? Would his Treasury secretary and chief economic advisers coolly analyze the problem and formulate a course of action, or would they respond with a combination of sycophancy to the boss and denials that anything was wrong? What do you think? Let’s be clear: There isn’t an obvious crisis-level threat looming at the moment. But growth is slowing, and as the bumper stickers don’t quite say, stuff happens. And if and when it does, the people who would be supposed to deal with it are the gang that can’t think straight. Merry Christmas.

2018,The Giants and Eli Manning Stumble Toward the End of an Era,"On Pro Football EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Lying near his own 10-yard line, Eli Manning raised his right arm and pounded his fist on the turf. Seconds earlier, he had clumsily fumbled the football as he toppled forward, an embarrassing pratfall that resulted in another touchdown in the Tennessee Titans’ 17-0 whitewash of the Giants on Sunday. For 15 N.F.L. seasons, Manning has been famously unflappable in moments of failure and disappointment. But in this instance, perhaps especially in this moment since it so manifestly symbolized another lost season, Manning was slamming his fist in fury. Before kickoff on Sunday, the Giants had won four of their five previous games, a rally that had expunged some of the stain of a humiliating 1-7 start to the year. A remote chance at a playoff berth still existed. Manning was at the center of the comeback and there was considerable talk of his value to the team lasting into next season. But with Manning prone on the turf after his third-quarter fumble, any uplifting vibe to the 2018 season had vanished. Worse for the Giants, they have to wonder if the rally was all a mirage — one that ought to be discounted moving forward. Earlier this season, there was little disagreement that with Manning’s declining performance — and its deleterious effect on a reeling Giants offense — the team had to begin the transition away from Manning, a beloved figure in team history and a two-time Super Bowl Most Valuable Player. Privately, the team’s management conceded that a new quarterback, one acquired through the college draft or free agency, would be on the roster by next year. If that plan changed in the last five weeks, if there was renewed confidence that Manning could still be the answer at quarterback, Sunday’s game should surely negate that thinking. In addition to his fumble, Manning repeatedly missed open receivers and threw an interception near the Titans’ 15-yard line, ruining the Giants’ best scoring chance of the day. Manning was also sacked three times and the Giants offense, so dynamic in the past month behind rookie running back Saquon Barkley, went back to looking predictable, inept and lifeless. In the end, it became more evident than ever that the Giants must plan for their football life after Eli Manning. It does not mean Manning will be or should be released, indeed he could well be important for the inculcation of the next Giants starting quarterback, which could take several months or more than a year. But Manning, who will be 38 years old next month, isn’t going to turn back the clock. If things go as poorly in the Giants’ final two games this month as they did against the Titans, it’s possible Manning will retire. Adding to the pressure of that decision will be the harsh reality of Manning’s 2019 salary, which is slightly more than $23 million. The Giants will have a hard time affording a new, young free agent quarterback like Teddy Bridgewater, currently with New Orleans Saints, and Manning. For the hearty fans who braved a drenching rain to watch the Giants get shut out Sunday — MetLife Stadium was never more than a third full — the notion that Manning’s days as the face of the franchise were dwindling had to be omnipresent. It was a dreary afternoon, and for Giants fans clinging to be joyous memories of Super Bowl victories in 2008 and 2012, the end of the Eli era will be far more depressing than a day of soaking rain. A career Giant, Manning not only helped revive a dormant franchise, he willingly gave his time and money to countless causes in the New York-area community. He carried himself laudably after wins and losses in a demanding media environment, something he was still doing late Sunday afternoon. At a podium just off the locker room, Manning took the blame for the missed connections with his receivers — “poor throw by me” or “just didn’t execute like I wanted” — and he conceded that he had not done enough to help the Giants resurrect their season. Of his ill-timed third-quarter fumble, Manning was, as he almost always is, plain-spoken: “It slipped out of my hands. I tried to push it out late. But right there, I have to back up, hold onto the ball and take a sack if I have to. I can’t turn it over to them and give them that good field position.” Manning spoke in a measured, impassive tone. His eyes showed no emotion. But it was 30 minutes after the game ended and roughly an hour since Manning had awkwardly fumbled not far from his own end zone, a miscue that finally doomed the disastrous 2018 Giants season and perhaps set in motion what will be the final stage of his career.

2018,Opinion | The Good News About Terrorism ,"The Islamic State is weakened, and the jihadist threat to the U.S. has diminished. Professor Byman is a vice dean at Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service and a senior fellow at the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution. In terrorism, we may remember 2018 for what didn’t happen: The jihadist threat to the United States has dissipated. We had only one death from jihadist-linked terrorism in this country, and while disturbing, it was hardly an Islamic State spectacular. (In Florida, a teenage boy, inspired by jihadist videos, stabbed a 13-year-old friend to death during a sleepover.) This death toll is dwarfed by the 2018 body count from right-wing terrorism (15) and a far cry from attacks like the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting, when a jihadist loner shot 49 people. The number of jihadist terrorism-related legal cases has also plummeted, to 13 this year from 80 in 2015. As the recent killings of five people at a Christmas market in Strasbourg, France, indicate, the European situation is worse, but not hopeless. In Europe, around 20 people have died from jihadist terrorism in 2018, a steep fall from 2015, when attacks in Paris and elsewhere led to 150 deaths. Around the world, global terrorism fell in 2017, and 2018 looks even more promising. We can hope the death toll will be low in 2019, too. The Islamic State will not go away, but it is unlikely to return to its 2015 peak. None of this good news has stopped President Trump from emphasizing the terrorism threat. He invoked it to justify more funding for a border wall with Mexico (despite no known jihadist terrorists crossing to the United States from Mexico). Perhaps not surprisingly, Americans’ fears of jihadist terrorism remain high. A mix of successful counterterrorism efforts overseas and more effective measures and a weak jihadist movement at home explain the low death toll. The American-led military campaign against the Islamic State has diminished the threat in the United States and Europe. The group has been largely driven underground, and its losses have tarnished its prestige and undermined its effectiveness. Intelligence and law enforcement services have monitored the jihadist threat and prosecuted suspects, disrupting the flow of fighters to and from Syria and the Islamic State’s efforts to incite Americans online. In Europe, the 2015 Paris attacks shocked many governments into action. Even formerly dysfunctional security services like Belgium’s, which once seemed helpless as terrorists recruited and plotted on their soil, are more aggressive and effective. But we must remember that terrorists need get lucky only once, and new dangers — though not necessarily worse ones — are emerging. Militant groups that use terrorism plague many countries in the Middle East. In the West, the networks, connections and propaganda forged to recruit and proselytize for the Syrian civil war are likely to endure in some form. “Lone wolves” and others who act in the Islamic State’s name will conduct mostly low-level but still lethal attacks. The Islamic State itself is more likely to revive if the United States removes its troops from Syria. At home, right-wing violence is surging, with Mr. Trump’s rhetoric legitimating it and emboldening the worst elements of the far right. We cannot expect 2018’s incredibly low level of jihadist terrorism to endure for too long, but we can hope that the numbers remain small.

2018,The Harvard Bias Suit by Asian-Americans: 5 Key Issues,"The two sides in a case accusing Harvard of discriminating against Asian-American applicants have submitted documents to the court that try to synthesize the evidence and testimony for the judge ahead of her ruling. The briefs — 82 pages from Harvard and 86 pages from the plaintiffs, Students for Fair Admissions — were filed on Wednesday in Federal District Court in Boston after a high-profile trial in October and November. The basic claim by the plaintiffs, a group representing Asian-American students rejected by Harvard, is that the university has systematically discriminated against Asian-Americans by holding them to a higher standard than other applicants. Harvard argues that in trying to compose a diverse class, it considers each applicant as an individual and does not discriminate. The case could change the way colleges across the country conduct admissions. The latest papers lay out the crux of the dispute: The plaintiffs claim that Harvard systematically and knowingly discriminated; the university counters that it did its best and that the students it admitted were the result of a normal selection process. Here are some of the points addressed in Wednesday’s briefs. The judge, Allison D. Burroughs, is expected to deliver a decision in several months. The plaintiffs argue that Harvard has been racially stereotyping Asian-Americans for decades. They cite a 1990 report by the federal Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights, finding that admissions officers had repeatedly characterized Asian-American applicants as “quiet, shy, science/math oriented, and hard workers.” They argue that the practice has continued. Harvard counters that out of 1,591 pages of documents reviewed in court, the plaintiffs were able to find only two handwritten notes that described individual Asian-American applicants as “quiet.” Such comments, Harvard said, may have been an accurate reflection of the applicants, not stereotypes but “unbiased assessments.” The plaintiffs supported an admissions system that would disregard race in favor of socioeconomic factors, like poverty, geography and other indicators of lack of opportunity. In its brief, Harvard said that if it eliminated all consideration of race and other preferences, the African-American share of the class would decline to 5 percent from 14 percent and the Hispanic share would decline to 9 percent from 14 percent. The plaintiffs say that Harvard could achieve levels of racial diversity close to what it has now if it were to eliminate preferences for the children of alumni, donors and staff, while allowing for a slight fall in SAT scores and a significant drop in the percentage of wealthy students. The plaintiffs argue that statistical analysis shows that Asian-Americans as a group have better academic and extracurricular credentials than white applicants, but are penalized by a biased personal rating. Harvard disputes the evidence offered by the plaintiffs but says that even if it were valid, it would not be enough to show that any disparate impact on Asian-Americans was intentional. “Even though courts have recognized that statistical evidence generally cannot prove discriminatory intent, S.F.F.A. has repeatedly conceded that statistical evidence is the core of its intentional discrimination claim,” Harvard’s brief says, referring to the organization that filed the suit. Harvard says there is no evidence that the admissions committee — with about 40 members of diverse backgrounds — engaged in some kind of conspiracy to discriminate against Asian-Americans. The plaintiffs say that in this day and age, discrimination is often subtle and insidious, and people know better than to leave proof of it behind. If Harvard were serious about avoiding racial bias in admissions, the plaintiffs contend, it would have instituted bias training, but it did not. “Harvard’s failure to properly instruct admissions staff — in writing or even orally — as to when and how race should be used in evaluating applicants made matters worse,” the plaintiffs write. Last summer, as the trial was approaching, a group of admissions officers recommended changes to the rules for evaluating applications that appeared intended to warn against racial and ethnic stereotyping. The plaintiffs see the changes as a tacit admission that Harvard knew it needed to do better. Harvard says it was merely codifying what had long been the unspoken rules. “Once this record became public, a group of admissions officers pushed for changes designed to counteract Asian-American stereotyping. Those changes included a new written instruction on how and when to use race that Harvard’s leadership adamantly claimed was unnecessary, as well as revisions to the criteria for assigning the personal rating that is sensitive to the stereotype that Asian Americans are introverted,” the plaintiffs say in court papers. “That these individuals — unlike Harvard’s leadership — recognized the need to takes these steps speaks volumes.” During the trial, the plaintiffs argued that there was evidence of unconscious bias in admissions. In the latest brief, Harvard says that if it was bias then Asian-American legacies (children of alumni) would be less likely to get in than white legacies, but they are not. The plaintiffs reply that members of favored groups, like legacies, are like family, and it would not be natural to discriminate against them. “There is nothing anomalous about Asian-Americans who are athletes and legacies evading the racial stereotyping that plagues the 98 percent of Asian-Americans who are not lucky enough to be in the club,” the plaintiffs say in their brief.",The New York Times

You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. First, China: Tensions keep rising between the United States and China, which isn’t an altogether bad thing. For too long, American leaders have failed to respond adequately to China’s increasing assertiveness — its theft of intellectual property, hostility to foreign companies, aggression in Asia and imperial ambitions around the world. A more hawkish policy toward China makes sense. Unfortunately, President Trump is pursuing a version of clueless hawkishness. His administration has alienated obvious allies — both in Asia and Europe — and is starting a potentially destructive trade war. Trump’s instincts on this issue are better than on most issues. And yet China’s leaders must feel very fortunate that he is running the country they hope to supplant as the world’s greatest power. For more, read Paul Krugman’s new column on the trade fight. In The Washington Post, Josh Rogin has a more sympathetic take on the Trump administration’s approach. In Vox, Emily Stewart and Alex Ward explain the significance of the recent arrest in Canada of Meng Wanzhou, an executive at Huawei Technologies. [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] The Weekly Standard I am saddened to see the apparently imminent demise of The Weekly Standard, the conservative magazine that has refused to buckle to Trumpism. Elsewhere, Adam Serwer mourns the magazine’s fate, while Politico’s Jack Shafer says, in effect, “That’s business.” Democracy watch. The editorial board of The Charlotte Observer, the largest newspaper in North Carolina, has called for a do-over election in the state’s 9th congressional district. The race was close, and a slew of evidence suggests that a Republican operative illegally tampered with, intercepted or destroyed absentee ballots, as CNN’s Harry Enten explains. It’s worth noting that local media, especially the Charlotte-based WSOC-TV, has been crucial to surfacing the fraud story, as Grace Bennett of Media Matters writes. As for Wisconsin, where Republican legislators passed a bill to strip power from the incoming Democratic governor and attorney general: In The Atlantic, Charles Sykes — a “longtime friend” of Scott Walker, the outgoing governor — urges him not to sign the bill. “Signing the lame-duck legislation would be an especially classless way for Walker to leave office; it will tarnish his reputation in ways that I’m not sure he grasps,” Sykes writes.

2018,The Heisman Vote Is Filled With Homers,"For the first time in a decade, all the finalists for the Heisman Trophy are quarterbacks. They all play the same way, too. Ohio State’s Dwayne Haskins, Oklahoma’s Kyler Murray and Alabama’s Tua Tagovailoa are all relatively mobile but are nonetheless steadfastly pass-first quarterbacks. And, of course, all had tremendous success this season, compiling astounding statistics and leading their teams to conference championships. Murray and Tagovailoa, who are widely considered the two top contenders in the closest Heisman race in years, took their teams to the College Football Playoff. But there is at least one sense in which all three athletes, one of whom will hoist the bronze statue Saturday night, are distinct from the others — an aspect that close watchers of the Heisman balloting process know can have an outsize impact. In a low-fat version of the Electoral College, the media members who compose the vast majority of Heisman voters are apportioned equally among six regions of the country. Each area — such as the Far West, the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic — is allotted 145 media votes. This year, each finalist’s team is based in a different region. Alabama is in the South, Ohio State in the Midwest and Oklahoma in the Southwest, making it a perfect test case for whether regional bias affects Heisman voting. The historical data, deeply explored both in academic papers and in sports debates everywhere, is clear: Indeed, it does. But not in all the ways you may think. “Results show Heisman finalists do receive higher vote tallies in their home regions on average,” concludes a paper, “The Nature of Regional Bias in Heisman Voting,” by Nolan Kopkin, a professor of African and African Disaspora Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Kopkin said in an interview that he first thought of the paper while studying economics under the Cornell sports economist Lawrence Kahn. Heisman voters may select players for first (three points) second (two) and third place (one). The winner is the top points-getter. There are 870 total media voters, plus the 58 votes of former Heisman winners and one public vote. How many players are considered finalists is determined by how close the final vote totals are. “Where major gaps exist, that’s where you get a cutoff, ” according to the website of the Heisman Trophy Trust, which administers the award. Kopkin’s paper, published this year in the Journal of Sports Analytics, studied the Heisman vote tallies between 1990 and 2016, and used equations to control for different variables and across seasons when there were different numbers of finalists. According to the study, Heisman finalists received substantial boosts from their own regions. Compared to his overall tally, the average finalist over that period received 42.9 extra points from his region. He also received 4.9 points more for every game played in a given region, including those outside his home region. And finalists lost small but statistically significant numbers of points from regions that had their own home finalists. The Heisman system does try to protect players from this bias. For one thing, within regions, states receive a number of votes approximately commensurate with their populations. California and Hawaii must split the Far West’s votes, but California gets more (there are presently no voters from Alaska). For another, the regions are roughly equivalent: Five of the six contain between 53.8 million and 65.5 million people, per U.S. Census Bureau population estimates from last year, and between 21 and 31 teams in the Football Bowl Subdivision. “It’s a national collegiate award, so we’re always concerned to make sure we have the best electorate we can,” said Tim Henning, a spokesman for the Trust. If any region could claim to be disadvantaged by this process, it might be the Far West, which is the most populous, or the South, which has the most F.B.S. teams (31). There has long been a perception that players from teams on the West Coast that are not the Southern California Trojans have a longer shot at winning. “People from the West always complain theirs are not receiving enough respect nationally,” Kopkin said. “The data basically doesn’t bear that out.” Rather, he said, finalists from the Northeast, Southwest and South on average received fewer points from other regions’ voters than might otherwise be expected. But that hurdle is not insurmountable. Ten of the past 11 winners played for teams in the South or Southwest. And ultimately, since everyone is from somewhere, regional bias in Heisman voting should cancel itself out — particularly in a year, like this one, when the top points-getters are from different regions. In contrast, Kopkin saw regional bias have a more decisive influence in, say, 1993, when the top three points-getters all hailed from the South. The overall victor, Florida State quarterback Charlie Ward, actually lost his own region to runners-up from Alabama and Tennessee. He stacked his points in other regions, Kopkin speculates, partly thanks to Florida State’s membership in the predominantly Mid-Atlantic Atlantic Coast Conference and the Seminoles’ prodigious number of nationally televised games. If there is a bellwether region, meanwhile, it is the Northeast, which is New England and New York. It contains just 34.6 million people and only six F.B.S. members (and merely two teams in the so-called Power 5 conferences). Since it rarely produces a finalist, it is theoretically freed from regional bias and therefore more likely to reflect the national dispensation. “Because of the low representation, the Northeast region tends to mirror the overall Heisman voting results,” said Daniel P. Heard, a quantitative risk analyst who began tracking Heisman voting patterns while studying statistics at Duke, in an email. Every year but one since 1998, Heard said, the eventual Heisman winner also won the Northeast. The exception was 2003, when wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald of Pitt — then of the Big East, whose members included several Northeast programs — received more points in the Northeast than the overall winner Jason White, Oklahoma’s quarterback. If the Northeast is something of an accidental kingmaker, that may be appropriate for the region in which the Heisman originated and is still handed out. “This is New York City’s chance to shine in college football,” said Dick Weiss, known as “Hoops,” a former sportswriter for The New York Daily News and the Mid-Atlantic regional representative. There is a final twist: Regional bias is diminishing. Kopkin credits the sharp increase in the number of games that are nationally televised. Dave Campbell, the Southwest regional representative and eponymous longtime publisher of a magazine about Texas football, recalled that, decades ago, sportswriters’ adjudication involved word-of-mouth and intra-jouranalistic argumentation. “You tried to get a consensus of thinking, to make sure everybody was getting a fair shot,” he said. But we are long past the days when the N.C.A.A. restricted teams to just a couple nationally televised games per season. We are now in an era when three (and soon four) conferences have their own networks, and ESPN and its affiliates can be relied upon to show games on several weeknights as well as for 12 hours on Saturdays. Replays are available for Easterners loathe to stay up late to watch West Coast games. “The voter now who claims he didn’t see someone — he should have seen someone,” Campbell said. So as we approach a blissful future in which every single college football game is broadcast to every television set, or laptop, or brain-implanted moving-picture device in the country, might regional bias fade away entirely? Maybe not. Kopkin’s data showed a sharp decline in bias in recent years — but not its wholesale elimination. “That’s still not what we see,” Kopkin said. “I don’t think we ever will. You’re still going to see voters in the South being more prone to vote for S.E.C. players.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The High Cost of Shattering Democratic Norms,"Republicans in Wisconsin, Michigan and North Carolina seem intent on subverting the will of the voters. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. The Wisconsin Assembly speaker, Robin Vos, a Republican, said the quiet part out loud this week when he told reporters that it was a blatant power grab for his lame duck chamber to pass legislation that weakens the incoming Democratic governor, Tony Evers. “We did have an election,” Mr. Vos said on Tuesday. “Whether everyone here likes it or not, I respect the fact that Tony Evers is the governor and he’s going to be starting on Jan. 7. But he’s not the governor today, and that’s why we’re going to make sure the powers of each branch are as equal as they can be.” Unless they acted, Mr. Vos warned, “we are going to have a very liberal governor who is going to enact policies that are in direct contrast to what many of us believe in.” Mr. Evers, that “very liberal governor,” won the election with 29,227 more votes than the incumbent, Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, so more Wisconsinites seem to believe in his policies than in those of the departing governor. Mr. Evers, the state schools superintendent, ran on an agenda that included increased school spending, a middle-class tax cut and a more humane stance on undocumented immigrants. The package of bills now sitting on Mr. Walker’s desk would require the new governor to get the Legislature’s permission to ban guns in the Capitol, adjust benefits programs or withdraw the state from a lawsuit challenging the Affordable Care Act. The Legislature would also appoint the majority of the members to the state’s powerful economic development board. Mr. Walker should veto the package for the good of his state. Meanwhile, another power play is unfolding in Michigan, where a lame duck Republican Legislature is also scheming to strip the incoming Democrats of various powers of their offices. Under the measures, oversight of campaign finance rules would shift from the secretary of state’s office to a special commission. Another bill would allow the Legislature to intervene in lawsuits that involve the state, rather than leaving that authority to the incoming attorney general, a Democrat, Dana Nessel. The chairwoman of the Democratic Governors Association, Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island, called the mischief in the Midwest “a dangerous assault on our democracy.” Are these political shenanigans norm shattering? Absolutely. They’re obnoxious and cynical, too. And it is regrettable that one political party in particular is so insecure about the merits of its ideas — and the concept of representative democracy — that it feels the need to push a political system under strain even further toward extremism. Are the moves illegal? That’s for the courts to decide. In 2016, Republicans in North Carolina passed measures to weaken the incoming Democratic governor. Some were struck down by the courts; others are still being litigated. Democrats in Wisconsin have threatened to sue over some of the bills the Republicans jammed through this week. Is all this unprecedented? Sadly, not. Lame duck and 11th-hour power plays of all sorts by both parties are common in American politics at all levels, though they usually are not as bald as what we’re seeing in Madison and Lansing. But American history is replete with examples of patronage, ballot box stuffing, corruption, legislative chicanery and disenfranchisement on a societal scale, and somehow the Republic has survived. Speaking of disenfranchisement, to see something truly undemocratic, look at North Carolina’s Ninth Congressional District, where a Republican political operative is accused of mishandling mail-in ballots, in violation of state law. The results of the election have not been certified, and the election may have to be held a second time. Up the road in Raleigh, the lame duck General Assembly has passed a new voter ID law before the party loses its supermajority in the next session. Part of what makes the moves in Wisconsin, Michigan and North Carolina unusual is that all three states can have lame duck sessions of their legislatures in the first place. Most state legislatures don’t meet throughout the year and so don’t have the chance to thwart the will of voters after an election. If they did, this sort of thing might be more common. It’s easy to lose faith in American democracy when the two major political parties have gerrymandered themselves into impregnable bunkers and bathe in rivers of campaign cash. Most depressing of all is the nationwide effort to erect barriers to voting, orchestrated by the party of Lincoln. But keep the faith. This is what democracy looks like. Messy. Unfair. Imperfect. The country insulates itself from the worst of the glitches in the system by establishing norms, rules of the road that everyone tacitly agrees to follow, especially around the orderly transfer of power. There are also laws, and regular remedies at the ballot box. Those norms exist not only to protect the political parties from each other but also to protect them from their own self-destructive impulses. After all, another election is always around the corner. And, as the Republican Party may learn, short-term gains often lead to long-term losses.

2018,The High Line Gets a Gemlike Neighbor,"A 12-story office building known as the Solar Carve Tower tries its best not to throw shade. For architects of urban towers, the sun is a double-edged sword, producing cheap warmth and light in buildings, but also unneighborly shadows. The taller the building, the more likely it is to throw shade. This problem is of particular note when your neighbor is New York City’s High Line. But the designers of 40 Tenth Avenue in Manhattan’s Meatpacking District managed to prevent pools of darkness from flooding the High Line next to it by sidestepping the sun. The commercial tower’s glass curtain wall recedes and breaks into eye-catching facets on the north and south sides, allowing concentrations of solar rays to find their way to the elevated park and nearby streets. Studio Gang, the Chicago-based architecture firm led by Jeanne Gang, designed the 139,000-square-foot building using a strategy it describes as “solar carving.” The architects mapped the sun’s annual course to determine which parts of the nearly finished 12-story tower to slice away and sheathed portions of those sections in tilted angular panes of glass. Multiple benefits will accrue from this gemlike surface to those inside and outside the building, said Weston Walker, the design principal of Studio Gang’s New York office. Coupled with high-performance, low-reflectivity glass, the optimized geometry will minimize heat gain and reduce glare for drivers on the West Side Highway, which runs alongside the building. It will also discourage migratory birds from striking. The sculpting “creates visual noise that makes it easier for the birds to detect the building and fly around it,” Mr. Walker said. Inside, the facets will frame dynamic views of the Hudson River and add interesting bumps to office or amenity spaces. The building, which is scheduled to open in April, has been designed with minimum ceiling heights of almost 16 feet and outdoor space on every floor but one. An 8,000-square-foot second-floor terrace will sit alongside the High Line, and there will be a 10,000-square-foot communal roof deck. “We call it the lighthouse,” said Jared Epstein, the vice president of Aurora Capital Associates, which developed the building with William Gottlieb Real Estate. (The cost, he said, while declining to give specifics, was “well over” $200 million.) Mr. Epstein said he hoped the tower would entice leaders in technology, finance, the media or advertising to the Meatpacking District. A Genesis automobile marketing center and restaurant will occupy the base, and office-floor tenants will be announced early next year.

2018,The High Line: A Place to See and Be Seen,"Living in Glimpses of life in the apartments along the 1.45-mile park are often unavoidable. That’s part of the attraction, some residents and visitors say. 11 Photos View Slide Show › For confirmation that all the world is indeed a stage, consider the High Line, the elevated park that threads among buildings in West Chelsea. Amid a squeeze of large-windowed apartments and a stream of passers-by, where shades often go unused and cameras snap furiously, residents and visitors can seem locked in a perpetual state of performance. Reliable stars, residents say, include a woman in the curtainless unit on West 23rd Street who regularly blow-dries her hair in the nude. Other shows seem more improvised. On a recent afternoon, under a chandelier on West 19th Street, a brown dog hopped on and off a table, prompting a park-goer to whip out her iPad. 1/4 mile W. 38TH ST. 10TH AVE.

Meat- packing District High Line W. 14TH ST. GANSEVOORT ST. By The New York Times A young girl who likes to blow bubbles on a balcony at West 24th Street has also drawn upward stares over the years, said Cheryl Skura, a neighborhood resident who also happens to be the girl’s grandmother. “I think that tourists have more photos of her than we do,” said Ms. Skura, 68, a retired jewelry importer. But far from complaining about the downside of living in a fishbowl, Ms. Skura, like others, had high praise for a lively, well-kept enclave that finally seems to be coming into its own, nearly a decade after the park’s first section opened. “The High Line is pretty, all the plantings are beautiful, and it’s idyllic to look at — at least at seven in the morning,” she said. “Maybe not when 20 million people are walking.” Ms. Skura’s first apartment was a two-bedroom, two-bathroom condo, with the balcony that functioned as a stage. It cost $1.4 million in 2006, when Ms. Skura, recently widowed, left suburban Long Island to be closer to her SoHo office. The night life in the area, once thick with restaurants and clubs, was appealing. The High Line? Not so much, Ms. Skura said, as it was then an abandoned freight track awaiting conversion. The first phase of the 1.45-mile park, which runs from Gansevoort Street up to West 34th Street, opened in 2009, with the bulk completed by 2014; a spur at 10th Avenue and West 30th Street is still in the works and expected to open next year. Once the park was up and running, Ms. Skura quickly became a fan. In fact, after selling her condo for $2.8 million in 2015, she bought another in the neighborhood, on the other side of the tracks. It is not exactly hidden away. The three-bedroom, three-bathroom condo, for which she paid $5.5 million, has a park-facing terrace where Ms. Skura sits a couple of times a day. Noise can be an issue. “There’s a slightly elevated buzz. You can hear people talk,” said Atith Pagdi, whose one-bedroom, one-bathroom cond-op, which cost $800,000 in 2017, has a balcony that serves as a veritable opera box for the action. Mr. Pagdi, 36, who works for a bank, wasn’t seeking the spotlight when he moved from New Jersey after a divorce. Indeed, to make sure his home-to-be was private enough, he asked a friend to stand in the apartment while he paced the High Line. “But this is New York City,” he said. “You are bound to be seen at some point anyway, in any apartment, in any neighborhood.” Besides, Mr. Pagdi added, the convenience of the High Line, which allows traffic-light-free passage from one block to the next, can’t be beat. In addition to hitting the park for early-morning jogs, he uses it for speedy commutes to the beer garden at the Standard Hotel and to his gym near West 17th Street. “The location is awesome,” he said. The High Line touches Hudson Yards and the meatpacking district. But in a city with a tendency to chop neighborhoods into ever smaller pieces (all with their own names), the block-wide district should be considered a stand-alone place, say many who live and work there. That wasn’t always the case. Lined with storage facilities for clothes, meat and mail, the area was for decades mostly indistinguishable from the industrial West Side, or the “Wild West,” according to a common sobriquet. In the early 2000s, about the time the Friends of the High Line organization began agitating for the preservation of the elevated metal trestle, large-scale rentals began arriving in the area. Condos followed. Today, the neighborhood, which the city rezoned in 2005 to cap heights and lure apartments, has lost much of its grit. Longtime parking lots are gone, as are most of the bars and clubs where music thumped late into the night. Bungalow 8, a mid-2000s mainstay on West 27th Street, is now the site of an art gallery whose concrete shape resembles an oversized picture frame. But Marquee New York, a bottle-service joint on 10th Avenue, and Scores, a strip club on West 28th Street, endure. Some developers have paid homage to the past, including Tamarkin Co., whose 508 West 24th Street, a 15-unit condo, and 550 West 29th Street, a 19-unit version, feature casement-style windows reminiscent of factories. Mostly, though, the High Line seems like a keeping-up-with-the-Joneses type of showcase for whimsy. The series of silvery fins along 520 West 28th Street, a 39-unit condo from the architect Zaha Hadid, who died in 2016, gives the facade the look of an egg slicer. Its developer was the Related Companies, a firm whose huge footprint in the neighborhood is about to get bigger with 515 West 18th, an under-development condo that will flank the park with a pair of towers, akin to the 505 West 19th Street building designed by Thomas Juul-Hansen. Related has also broken ground on another condo, at 555 West 22nd. In a similar spirit is the XI, a condo-and-hotel complex at 76 11th Avenue from the architecture firm Bjarke Ingels Group, with two towers that lean and twist so much they seem on the verge of falling over. The 236-unit complex, which started sales this fall, is slated to open in 2020. At the splashy Soori High Line, at 522 West 29th Street, from the architect Soo K. Chan, some living rooms come with saltwater pools. There is also the 14-unit Fitzroy, at 514 West 24th Street, whose jade-colored, terra-cotta exterior was designed by Roman and Williams, a firm known for residential interiors and hotels. It’s all enough to make the few tenements remaining, like those on West 23rd and West 29th Streets, seem small and plain by comparison. On Dec. 5, there were 85 apartments listed in the area, according to StreetEasy, almost all of them condos, for an average of $6.92 million. The least expensive was an alcove studio for $780,000; the priciest was a triplex penthouse for $50 million. Sales are cooling. In 2018, through Dec. 5, 49 apartments had sold, for an average of $3 million, according to StreetEasy. During the same period in 2017, 73 units sold, for an average of $3.7 million. Still, the neighborhood is no bargain compared with the rest of Manhattan, where the average sale price in the third quarter of 2018 was $1.93 million, according to Douglas Elliman Real Estate. Rental options in the area include contemporary high-rises like the Tate, Ten23 and Abington House. As of early December, the average rental studio in the neighborhood was asking $3,800 a month, according to StreetEasy, while the average one-bedroom was listed for $4,300. Around the High Line, art and retail can blur. The stylish interior seen through tall windows on West 28th might at first seem to belong to a gallery, but it is actually Il Piccolo Ristoro, a new cafe. Likewise, the cartoonish colors of a carwash at 10th Avenue and West 24th Street, with blue walls and a lighted red sign, suggest a clever set piece, but autos do get cleaned there. The sculpture-lined park, which closes at 7 p.m. in winter, hosts about eight million visitors a year. A more vexing issue, some say, is the relentless construction activity nearby. Restaurants that once largely catered to gallery patrons still dot 10th Avenue. Their ranks are thinning, however, with the closure of Trestle on Tenth, in May, and the Red Cat, which will close at the end of December. But Cookshop and the High Line Hotel, both at West 20th, remain popular draws. For pharmacies, haircuts, manicures and groceries, residents mostly have to trudge east. Students are zoned for two public schools, both outside the neighborhood. P.S. 33, or Chelsea Prep, offers prekindergarten through fifth grade. On last year’s state exams, 67 percent of students met English standards, versus 46 percent citywide; 65 percent met math standards, versus 47 percent citywide. P.S. 11, the William T. Harris School, also offers prekindergarten through fifth grade. There, 72 percent met English standards on last year’s state exams, and 74 percent met math standards. The zoned middle school is M.S. 297, on Morton Street in the West Village. Students can choose their high school; several are on West 18th in the multi-school Bayard Rustin Educational Campus. A private option is Avenues: The World School, a for-profit that opened in 2012 on 10th Avenue. Annual tuition at the school, which enrolls around 1,600, is $54,000. For subway service, most residents hike to Eighth Avenue, which offers C and E service, at West 23rd Street, and A, C and E service, at West 14th Street. The final cargo on the High Line train, which was in service from 1934 to 1980, was three boxcars of frozen turkeys. Originally, the railroad — officially, the New York Central viaduct — ended at the St. John’s terminal near Spring Street. But in the 1960s, sections along Washington Street began to come down; in 1991, the city razed a five-block span from Gansevoort to Bank Streets. But some railroad stops remain, including 95 Horatio Street, now part of TF Cornerstone’s West Coast rental complex. A tiled section of its otherwise yellow-brick facade, at the second floor, is a tip-off to where turkeys once rumbled through. For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

2018,"The Holiday Air Travel Forecast Calls for More People, but Better Screening","A record 45.7 million passengers are expected to fly on domestic airlines from Dec. 20 to Jan. 6. But unlike holiday seasons past, they are unlikely to be standing in nightmarishly long lines. “My hope is this Christmas will be a better, less stressful, more hassle-free airport screening experience than last year,” said Henry Harteveldt, founder of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel industry analysis firm in San Francisco. Why? Better technology is one reason. The Transportation Security Administration has installed more effective equipment, like improved conveyor belts and 3-D scanning machines, which give screeners a better view of the contents of travelers’ carry-on bags. The airlines and airports are testing biometric screening of passengers’ passports or other photo IDs. The airlines are also adding more flights on some of their busiest routes or switching to bigger planes to meet demand during the period. And then, there are the dogs. The T.S.A. is using more dogs trained to detect explosives. The dogs speed the security process because passengers have already been vetted for explosives by the time they reach the scanners. “They’re a very important layer of security,” an agency spokeswoman, Lisa Farbstein, said. Of course, bad weather could throw a wrench into all the plans. But airlines also have an answer for that — apps that they say will allow travelers to reschedule their flights more quickly than standing in line at the ticket counter. The result should be smoother travel. “The industry is not ignoring the challenge of this,” Mr. Harteveldt said. “What I’m encouraged by is that steps are being taken, these new initiatives are being implemented and anything that can help move people through the screening faster is going to benefit everybody.” Multiple factors are responsible for the surge in passenger traffic, a 5.2 percent rise over the comparable period last season, industry analysts say. A robust economy with low unemployment and rising wages has given Americans more money and more confidence about spending that money. “We’re basically experiencing the impact of a strong economy,” said Dan McKone, senior partner and head of the travel and transportation practice at L.E.K. Consulting. “While there’s a lot of mixed indicators impacting the markets, the overall economy remains strong and air passenger growth tends to be most highly correlated with G.D.P.,” he said. While investors’ concern about economic growth has led to volatility in the stock market in recent weeks, it has also contributed to the slide in global oil prices that has translated to lower gas prices for drivers and cheaper jet fuel. “Jet fuel has decreased, although it was up as much as 30 to 40 percent earlier this year,” Mr. Harteveldt said. This is helping to keep ticket prices low, which also drives demand, especially among leisure travelers. According to data from the travel booking platform Hopper, round-trip domestic ticket prices for holiday flights are averaging $304, a drop of nearly 10 percent from last year. (Prices for international flights ticked up a bit, rising $66 on average.) “If you actually look at the average price of tickets in real terms adjusted for inflation, air traffic continues to be more and more affordable,” Mr. McKone said. With ticket prices lower, more Americans will be flying, and Hopper estimates that overall spending will be 6 percent higher this holiday season than last. “Having lower prices definitely does drive demand,” Mr. McKone said. Airlines for America, the industry trade organization, estimates that domestic airlines will add, collectively, 143,000 seats daily to accommodate holiday travelers, and according to Patrick Surry, chief data scientist at Hopper, much of that capacity is being added by the major carriers at large hub airports. Southwest Airlines, for instance, announced new routes last month in Northern California and the Washington, D.C., area, as well as to popular warm-weather vacation destinations. United Airlines, which expects to transport roughly half a million passengers — a 4 percent increase over 2017 — on its peak holiday travel days, is increasing the frequency of flights to locations like the Caribbean and ski resort areas, and plans to add nearly 20 domestic wide-body aircraft to help manage full flights over the holidays, an airline spokesman, Charlie Hobart, said. The airline industry is looking to technology to help prevent bottlenecks and move travelers from check-in to gate to boarding more quickly — not just for this holiday season, but into 2019 and beyond. Last month, JetBlue installed its first biometric self-boarding gate at its Kennedy International Airport headquarters in New York. Instead of having passengers’ IDs checked by gate agents, a camera takes a picture. The photo is sent to a United States Customs and Border Protection server to compare with that person’s passport photo on file. “They built the algorithm to compare those photos,” said Caryl Spoden, JetBlue’s head of customer experience. “Everything happens in two to three seconds,” she said, adding that the photo taken at the gate is not saved or stored. “It does remove the manual passport verification. That is a good time saver,” she said. “It allows our crew members to interact with the customer in a more meaningful way.” Ms. Spoden said the inaugural machine will process around 500 passengers a day over the holidays. “Our intent is to expand this to every gate at J.F.K. and beyond,” she said. Delta Air Lines has been testing facial recognition boarding for the past two years, and this fall introduced its first biometric terminal at its Atlanta headquarters for travelers taking direct international flights on Delta or its code-share partners Aeromexico, Air France-KLM and Virgin Atlantic. Delta says the technology shaves nine minutes off boarding time per flight. American Airlines also started a biometric boarding program this month at Los Angeles International Airport, which will be tested and evaluated for a 90-day period. In the interim, though, there are the dog noses. The T.S.A. currently has roughly 1,000 dogs trained to detect explosives, and it trains about 350 new dogs a year. It also works with teams of K-9 handlers employed by state and local law enforcement agencies. Last month the agency announced an initiative to allow private companies that train and handle explosives-detecting dogs to provide security for cargo air traffic, freeing up more of the T.S.A.’s dogs to screen travelers. Even though these early inroads into biometric and 3-D scanning technology will help speed the journeys of a relatively tiny subset of the nearly 46 million people expected to fly during the holidays, industry analysts say they will help airlines cope with the long-term growth in passenger traffic. “You’re still seeing this trend where the price of flying is increasing at a lower rate than general income, so you have, every year, a huge number of people around the world who take their first plane trip,” Mr. Surry, of Hopper, said.",The New York Times
2018,The Holidays in New York City: An Event Guide,"A sampling of seasonal celebrations throughout New York City, including concerts, plays and events. Take your pick. “George Balanchine’s The Nutcracker” has been running every year at New York City Ballet since 1954 and remains the local gold standard of Tchaikovsky’s classic (through Dec. 30). But there are a dizzying number of other options away from Lincoln Center. In Manhattan, New York Theater Ballet offers its one-hour “Nutcracker,” choreographed by Keith Michael, at Florence Gould Hall (Dec. 14-16); and Dances Patrelle’s New York-centric “Yorkville Nutcracker” is at Hunter College’s Kaye Playhouse, with guest stars Abi Stafford and Ask la Cour of City Ballet (Dec. 6-9). In Brooklyn, Moscow Ballet’s “Great Russian Nutracker” lands for one day only, on Dec. 8. Open for a longer run will be Mark Morris’s Pop Arty “The Hard Nut” (Dec. 14-23). Ditto Company XIV’s burlesque “Nutcracker Rouge,” continues through Jan. 13. You got all that?

It’s a wondrous family outing; Bar Car Nights, select evenings that offer drinks and live music, cater to the 21-plus crowd. (718-817-8700, nybg.org) At the Merchant’s House Museum — the 19th-century home near Washington Square Park in Manhattan — John Kevin Jones plays Charles Dickens as he tells the Victorian writer’s classic story by the light of flickering candles in the period parlor (through Dec. 29). Select performances begin with a reception offering mulled wine, cider, holiday fare and music. Through Dec. 8, Classical Theater of Harlem and City College Center for the Arts are presenting “A Christmas Carol in Harlem,” an adaptation by Shawn René Graham in which Scrooge is a latter-day miser who made his millions in real estate. On Staten Island “Jacob Marley’s Christmas Carol” is celebrating its 10th anniversary at the Staten Island Shakespearean Theater Company from Dec. 6 through 16. (212-777-1089, merchantshouse.org; 212-650-6900, cthnyc.org; 718-390-6616, sishakespeare.org) The high kicks of the Rockettes are back in the annual Radio City “Christmas Spectacular,” which is running with exhausting frequency through Jan. 1. Expect tradition — and onstage camels — but also recent additions like flying drones. Farther uptown, the Harlem School of the Arts is presenting “A Harlemettes Holiday,” a pageant about a Times Square tour group that wanders onto the A train and into an enchanted world of jazz, blues and hip-hop (Dec. 7-9 and 14-16). (866-858-0007, rockettes.com; 800-838-3006, harlemettesholiday.brownpapertickets.com) Some of the most electrifying holiday-season concerts are on New York’s smaller stages. Take 54 Below, where Michael Feinstein returns for his annual engagement (Dec. 23-30). In “Swingin’ With the Season,” he will sing Christmas classics and standards from the American Songbook. At Joe’s Pub, cabaret offerings include Justin Vivian Bond’s wintry show “Justin Vivian Bond Is Refrigerated,” which the venue is describing as a way to “celebrate the darkest time of the year with some of the brightest talents in town” (Dec. 13-22). (646-476-3551, 54below.com; 212-967-7555, publictheater.org) In addition to its “Messiah” concerts, the Choir of Trinity Wall Street and the Trinity Baroque Orchestra, led by Julian Wachner, will perform David Lang’s poignant, Pulitzer Prize-winning “The Little Match Girl Passion” at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium on Dec. 15. The thoughtful Julia Bullock, in residence this season at the Met, will present another contemporary holiday oratorio, John Adams’s “El Niño,” at the Cloisters on Dec. 21 and 22. Joining her in a chamber arrangement of the piece — this will be sung in the intimate Fuentidueña Chapel, after all — will be members of the American Modern Opera Company.

Then, at 6 p.m., the flagship edition of Phil Kline’s “Unsilent Night” returns for its boombox chorus processional that begins at Washington Square and ends at Tompkins Square Park. If you can’t make either event, there are more than a dozen others to choose from during Make Music Winter on Dec. 21. (westvillagechorale.org; unsilentnight.com; makemusicny.org) Beyond a bevy of “Messiah” performances, Carnegie is hosting a series of holiday concerts by stalwarts like the Vienna Boys Choir, who will sing folk songs and classics in the program “Christmas in Vienna” on Dec. 16. And the New York Pops returns on Dec. 21 with instrumental earworms, such as the “Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy” from “The Nutracker,” and songs featuring the actress Ashley Brown, the original star of Broadway version of “Mary Poppins.” (212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org)",The New York Times
2018,The Holland Tunnel’s Holiday Décor Is Changing. (The Traffic Will Stay the Same.),"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] The people have spoken. The HOLLAAD TONNEL is no more. For decades, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has spruced up the sign above the Holland Tunnel’s New Jersey entrance with holiday decorations: a Christmas tree and two wreaths. And for years, their placement over the letters of the tunnel’s name has driven some commuters crazy — particularly the location of the tree, which is nestled in the N of “Holland” instead of in the adjacent A that the tree more closely resembles. Now, after an online poll prompted by a viral petition that urged the Port Authority to re-deck the Holland, the tree will move. It will be shifted off the N and moved to a new home next door, over the A, the Port Authority announced on Monday. “More than 80 percent voted for change, so change there will be,” Rick Cotton, the agency’s executive director, said in a news conference outside the tunnel’s entrance. The agency will also remove one of the wreaths from the U in “Tunnel,” where it obscured the letter, essentially turning it into an O, effectively making the sign read “HOLLAAD TONNEL.” Discontent over the seasonal décor grew last week after Cory Windelspecht, 38, drew attention to the tree in social media posts and in a petition on Change.org. Mr. Windelspecht, who lives in TriBeCa and commutes to New Jersey for work, said last week that the tree had been bothering him for years. Others apparently felt similarly. By the time Mr. Windelspecht spoke about his Christmas tree crusade at a public Port Authority meeting on Thursday, his petition had been signed close to 2,000 times and had generated plenty of social media discussion. Even Budweiser, which has a brewery in Newark, had voiced its opinion. The Port Authority was moved to act, and on Wednesday, it announced a five-day poll to let the public weigh in. More than 21,000 votes were cast, Mr. Cotton said, with 42 percent of voters choosing to shift the tree and jettison the wreath. On Monday, Mr. Windelspecht said that he was both ecstatic and shocked by the size of the response his initial complaint had generated. “I literally couldn’t get one person to listen to me when this started,” he said. He also said he was pleased with the outcome of the online survey, even though he did not cast his vote in favor of ditching the second wreath. “I guess you could say I lost,” Mr. Windelspecht joked. The agency planned to move the sign decorations on Monday evening, Kevin J. O’Toole, the chairman of the Port Authority’s board, said. The tree will be in its democratically ordained place by Tuesday morning. The wreath will be relocated to the Journal Square PATH station in Jersey City. The day after it announced the holiday decorations poll, the Port Authority also approved a multibillion-dollar budget. So far, only 20 people from the public have responded to that announcement, Mr. O’Toole said.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Hope and Betrayal of Blockchain,"Turning Points Turning Point: Interest in blockchain technology surges as it spawns a highly volatile virtual currency market. Blockchain is far more than just the technology underlying Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency. It is a tool that promises to decentralize the structures governing all economic transactions and, in the process, redefine our concept of trust. This is the most revolutionary and innovative aspect of blockchain. But its promise could be undermined. Trust — the basis of social and commercial interactions — has been guaranteed for centuries by institutionalized trust providers, such as hierarchically organized companies and other third-party authorities. These trust mechanisms have worked for offline business models, but they are becoming obsolete in our hyper-connected digital world. In the digital-platform economy, trust is best fostered by those who control the platforms. These are tech giants, like Uber and Airbnb, which are replacing the institutionalized trust providers and becoming the keepers of our digital identity and our trustworthiness. They control the mechanisms that build trust upon transaction-based feedback, establishing community-based reputations through the star-score rating system. In the past few years, however, some open platforms, such as Twitter, have become increasingly restrictive. Things have turned sour, as developers and early users feel betrayed. They had been promised open platforms but that dream was snatched away. Moreover, incidents involving several tech giants, such as Facebook, eBay, Uber and Experian, have shattered their credibility as reliable keepers of our data. Our fear of surveillance and data misuse has grown. Thanks to blockchain, people are now able and eager to take on the platform owners by engaging directly with one another via peer-to-peer, or P2P, distributed networks that run on a commonly agreed-upon set of rules. The resulting machine-driven trust allows users to avoid the fallout from centralized trust mechanisms, such as third-party control or unauthorized surveillance. In fact, the large centralized trust enforcers may soon give way to decentralized trust systems and P2P network-enforced reputation systems that blockchain makes possible. Under such systems, algorithms confirm the authenticity of each transaction and can record each party’s identity, along with their trust and reputation rating, in the blockchain, which acts as a kind of ledger. Misbehavior is prevented because it is impossible to tamper with or falsify the ledger, and accountability is improved because all actions can be independently audited by any participant. The benefits of a decentralized system are clear: Users are able to build trust without involving a third party. Group cooperation is enhanced. Fraudulent transactions are minimized. In addition, users can build their personal reputation across multiple platforms, and they can not only control their vast transaction data but also build and manage their own digital identity — bypassing the surveillance of the tech giants. It is Uber without Uber, Airbnb without Airbnb. This evolution is already happening. Payment and financial services providers like PayPal are being challenged by Ripple or Circle. Social media and networking services like Twitter and Facebook face competition from decentralized platforms such as Steemit or Akasha. Decentralized apps — software making decisions and acting autonomously — can be created and deployed on different blockchains like Ethereum or EOS. These are just a few examples. This beguiling transformation seems too good to be true, and distributed systems based on blockchain face a conundrum. In modern large-scale P2P markets, trust and growth are at odds: The more a network grows, the less trust users often place in it. But user growth is essential to the success of the P2P platform economy. This problem can be solved by making it harder to join the network (reducing user growth) or by centralizing control to a handful of trusted coders or nodes (reducing decentralization). Unfortunately, the blockchain community seems to favor increased centralization. Apart from business-to-business platforms, which generally run on top of private blockchains where governance is centralized by design, the fastest, most secure and most rapidly growing P2P platforms are based on public blockchain networks — which are all centralized. A handful of people make and enforce the rules. For example, only a small group of “superpower” miners — those who tally and authenticate transactions — secure the majority of Bitcoin transactions, while a small core of developers make the vast majority of changes to Bitcoin’s protocols. For Ethereum, the largest public blockchain stack, adopted by thousands of P2P platforms, the situation is even worse. The top five mining pools secure as much as 80 percent of the transactions in the ledger. The developers are concentrated as well: 20 percent of Ethereum’s core code was written by the same coder. Machine-driven trust is about to jump from systems controlled by tech giants to systems controlled by a small group of anonymous tech gurus. If only a few members have the ability to edit the system’s ledger and control the protocol, where are the open, transparent, free-to-use and universally accessible blockchains that so many hoped would bypass third-party control and surveillance? Ultimately, this new frontier of managing trust in the digital world presents a rather stark choice: Either we bargain away our privacy to centralized but accountable trust providers or we keep direct “control” of our data via a trust machine run by a limited group of anonymous people who could go rogue. These governance problems undermine the credibility of blockchain as a trust machine for the new P2P economy. It seems that synthetic trust among peers is not supported by a solid set of principles. This lack of trust inevitably atomizes the community and fragments group solidarity, as evidenced by the many chains that have forked off from the original protocols of Bitcoin and Ethereum. For the time being, there is warfare to control those blockchain systems, and not a new common good that the technology still has the potential to deliver.",The New York Times
2018,The Hospital’s Gift of Downtime,"Doctors The hospital, especially during the holidays, crystallizes an unavoidable truth: There’s simply no substitute for being there. Christmas week is a strange time in the hospital. There’s an added melancholy for patients who spend the holidays hospitalized — a sense that their illness, whatever it might be, is so bad they must lie in bed while the world hangs ornaments and roasts chestnuts on open fires. It’s a time when the doctors and nurses on call start to feel the weight of jobs that too often keep them close to computers and far from their families. And yet, a certain camaraderie emerges, an extra measure of meaning and gratitude growing from the recognition that we’re all there together. Santa hats emerge. Ugly sweaters replace white coats. Candy canes flow freely. I remember caring for one patient, a retired college professor who was having trouble breathing, during this strange holiday time. His lungs had slowly scarred over, and now, only small patches performed their basic functions. He could barely walk to the bathroom without gasping for air. His speech grew staccato, short sentences punctuated by deep breaths. His adult son, who hadn’t seen him in years, had flown across the country to take an oral history of his life. Each morning when I stopped in to check on him I had to interrupt their recording sessions, hearing the son ask: What did you love most about Mom? Did you really like your job? What were you most proud of? “I’m asking him the questions I never did,” his son said. “I’ve learned more this week than in all the years before.” The hospital, for all its pain and misery, often imposes a kind of downtime that creates a space for the reflection we forgo in our daily lives. It’s not uncommon to hear a family member say they finally understand their loved one, or that they’ve reconnected after years apart. It’s more routine still to hear talk of time squandered — moments that might have been, conversations that should have happened. None of this happens on command. It requires patience, attention and, most important, time. Not minutes, flipping between tasks, tapping out emails while squeezing in a quick call on FaceTime or Skype — but hours, bordering on boredom, in person. The hospital, especially during the holidays, crystallizes an unavoidable truth: There’s simply no substitute for being there. That’s as true for doctors as it is for families. The moments that made me the doctor I am didn’t come while reading X-rays on a computer or rushing from patient to patient on morning rounds. They came late in the afternoon when a family wanted to talk prognosis, or in the middle of the night when a patient couldn’t breathe — and I was the only one around. We know from decades of research that there’s nothing more important than nurturing our relationships for long-term health and happiness. We’re also beginning to understand the significance of uninterrupted downtime — not just for creativity and productivity, but also for developing and maintaining bonds with friends and family. But far too often we don’t act on these insights. We leave weeks of paid vacation time on the table, instead opting for more work. We eat nearly three-quarters of meals outside the home and 20 percent in a car, knowing that family dinners have myriad benefits. Half of American parents say they spend too little time with their children. The hospital, by necessity, imposes time for contemplation and intimacy. Of course, it is not an imposition I’d wish on anyone. But still, there is a lesson to be learned: We need to create environments that facilitate downtime with loved ones. Behavioral science suggests that when there is opportunity for distraction, the human mind will take it. Technology is too seductive; our jobs too demanding. Creating the space for quality time takes work — and foresight. The trick is to intentionally construct protected spaces that make it easier to spend time with loved ones — places and times where no other options exist. Commit to meaningful experiences far in advance, to guard from the inevitable obligations and distractions that arise. Outlaw phones in particular rooms and at particular times. Create traditions that turn decisions about whether and when to spend time together into rituals of how and where to spend time together. Make it easier to do what’s hard by replacing in-the-moment choices with premeditated commitments. Because too often we wait until tragedy strikes. My patient got to narrate only half his life story before his breathing grew so labored he could no longer speak. As his condition deteriorated, I interrupted not excited chatter, but a father and son sitting silently, together. He took his last breath on Christmas Eve. “I got to know him,” his son said. “I got to know him because I was there.” Dhruv Khullar, M.D., M.P.P.

2018,The Hot Duck That Won’t Go Away,"We’re sorry, but this is another article about that pretty duck in Central Park. Within the past month, the Mandarin duck — sometimes called the “hot duck” — has become an international celebrity. A living, breathing, quacking meme. It has been difficult to scroll through Twitter without seeing a photo of his magnificent multicolored plumage. He has been featured on prime time news and discussed on late-night talk shows. His likeness has been stamped on T-shirts. Even the official mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party saw him fit for a tweet. On Sunday, he landed on the front page of The Los Angeles Times, which speculated that he was an escapee from a private aviary. With each new burst of media attention, crowds jostled each other around the edge of the Central Park Pond just to catch a glimpse. The duck has been captured at nearly every angle and endowed with a multitude of internet voices. When he can’t immediately be found, his fans worry. When he takes a side trip to New Jersey, they fear he’s turning into a suburbanite. And when he’s caught nipping at the back of one of his mallard companions, they wonder: Is this the duck we thought we knew? Could he be a “Milkshake Duck”? (Look it up.) There is one cohort of New Yorkers who are slightly less amused: serious birders. The ones who ogled ducks in Central Park before it was cool. On the whole, they are thrilled that this duck could draw outsiders into the broader world of bird-watching. Sean Sime, who has been birding in the city for more than 20 years, called him a “spark bird,” a fantastic creature that brings newcomers into the fold. At the same time, the Mandarin fixation has left a bit of a sour taste, Mr. Sime said. Birding is about taking in the natural world, and the internet-fueled popularity of the duck is anything but natural. The Mandarin is essentially the “Kim Kardashian of ducks,” he added. “It’s like manufactured hysteria,” he said. “From a native wildlife sentiment, it’s like reality TV. It’s not a wild bird that should be here.” In an “open letter” to the duck, an Audubon.org editor told the Mandarin duck point blank that he wasn’t “that special.” Because the duck is not believed to have reached the city naturally, birders can’t add him on their “life list,” a record of wild birds that an individual has seen, said Matthew Rymkiewicz, another local enthusiast. He worries about the behavior of the duck’s fans. “It’s a wild animal,” he said. “So respect it and have boundaries.” When my editors assigned a story about the duck a month ago, his origin was a mystery, and it still is. Mandarin ducks are native to East Asia, not North America, so experts concluded that the duck was likely an abandoned or escaped pet. While other publications had noted his incongruous presence in Central Park, attention from The Times pushed the bird into superstardom. Many birders online took issue with the article’s description of a fellow birder, David Barrett, who used a soft pretzel to try to coax the Mandarin to the shore and then, when that failed, chased him from one end of the pond with some convincing quacks. Mr. Sime said that behavior made birders cringe because it went against a widely accepted birder ethical code. Mr. Barrett, the creator and manager of the Twitter account Manhattan Bird Alert, can be fairly described as the duck’s kingmaker. He said his strategies for bringing the duck closer to shore were exceptions, and he has subsequently promoted healthy duck-watching behavior. (But, he added, it’s not as if he pioneered the idea of feeding bread to ducks.) As for the duck’s internet stardom, Mr. Barrett doesn’t see a problem. “What’s unhealthy about people liking a beautiful, natural thing?” But as the duck turned into a bona fide star, some of us worried that the obsession would take a sinister turn. That someone who loved him a bit too much would steal him away. That a hawk would swoop down and pick him up by the scruff of his neck. (The Urban Park Rangers assured me they check on the bird’s safety regularly.) For now, the duck seems content to winter in New York City and could, like so many other transplants, make the city his permanent home. Theoretically, the Mandarin could mate with a native duck, an ornithologist with the Cornell Lab of Ornithology said, although it’s unclear if they could produce offspring. Perhaps, with time, the novelty will wear off. On Friday afternoon, a light crowd of about a dozen people closely watched the Mandarin duck float serenely atop the water of the Pond, apparently napping as a sprinkling of rain made the water around him ripple. We watched him swim toward rocks near the shore, on top of which some mallards were dozing. He climbed out of the water and indulged in some post-nap grooming on the rock’s edge. Apparently dissatisfied with his spot, he snapped his bill at two mallards sleeping with their heads nestled in their feathers. They flapped away, and the Mandarin took his place at the rock’s highest point, looking regal, and magnificently out of place.",The New York Times
2018,The Housing Boom Is Already Gigantic. How Long Can It Last?,"Economic View We are, once again, experiencing one of the greatest housing booms in United States history. How long this will last and where it is heading next are impossible to know now. But it is time to take notice: My data shows that this is the United States’ third biggest housing boom in the modern era. Since February 2012, when the price declines associated with the last financial crisis ended, prices for existing homes in the United States have been rising steadily and enormously. According to the S&P/CoreLogic/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index (which I helped to create) as of September, the prices were 53 percent higher than they were at the bottom of the market in 2012. That means, on average, a house that sold for, say, $200,000 in 2012 would bring over $300,000 in September. Even after factoring in Consumer Price Index inflation, real existing home prices were up almost 40 percent during that period. That is a substantial increase in less than seven years. In fact, based on my data, it amounts to the third strongest national boom in real terms since the Consumer Price Index began in 1913, behind only the explosive run-up in prices that led to the great financial crisis of a decade ago, and one connected with World War II and the great postwar Baby Boom. The No. 1 boom occurred from February 1997 to October 2006, when real prices of existing United States homes rose 74 percent. This was a period of intense speculative enthusiasm — for houses and for financial instruments based on mortgages as investments — and it was also a time of great regulatory complacency. The term “flipping houses” became popular then. People exploited the boom by buying homes and selling them only months later at a huge profit. That boom ended disastrously. Soaring valuations collapsed with a 35 percent drop in real prices for existing homes, ushering in the financial crisis that enveloped the world in 2008 and 2009. The second greatest boom, from 1942 to 1947, had more benign consequences. Over this five-year interval, real prices of existing homes rose 60 percent. Booms and busts are rooted in popular narratives with complex social-psychological roots. This boom centered on a war-induced housing shortage, an enormous increase in the number of new babies and families who would need housing after the war, and the 1944 G.I. Bill, which subsidized home-buying by veterans. Home prices did not fall significantly after this boom ended. Today, signs of weakness in the housing market are being taken by some as a signal that the prices of single-family homes may fall soon, as they did sharply after 2006. The leading indicators, which include building permits and sales of both existing and new homes, have all been declining in recent months. But with few examples of extreme booms, we cannot be sure what such indicators mean for the current market. Low interest rates — imposed by the Federal Reserve and other central banks in reaction to the financial crisis — are the most popular culprit in the current boom. There is some apparent merit to this view, since these three biggest nationwide housing booms all included very low interest rates. But the market reaction to interest rates is hardly immediate or predictable. The housing market does not react as directly as you might expect to interest rate movements. Over the nearly seven years of the current boom, from February 2012 to the present, all major domestic interest rates have increased, not decreased. So, while interest rates have been low, they have moved the wrong way, yet the boom has continued. Another explanation is simple economic growth. But, as a matter of history, prices of existing homes — as opposed to the supply of newly built homes — have generally not responded to economic growth. There was only a 20 percent increase in real prices of existing homes in the 50 years from 1950 to 2000 despite a sixfold increase in real G.D.P. The simplest narrative being given for the current boom is just that the 2008-2009 financial crisis and the so-called Great Recession are over and home prices are returning to normal. But that explanation does not cut it either. In September they were 11 percent higher than at the 2006 peak in nominal terms, and almost as high in real terms. This is not a return to normal, but a market that appears to be rising to a record. It is difficult to assess the contribution of President Trump to the current boom. It is certainly less obvious than the role of President George W. Bush in the 1997-2006 boom. Mr. Bush extolled the benefits of “the ownership society” and in 2003 he signed the American Dream Downpayment Act, which subsidized home purchases. In his 2004 re-election bid he boldly asserted: “We want more people owning their own home.” This seems to have contributed to an atmosphere of high expectations for home price increases. The Trump administration’s attitude toward housing is less clear. President Trump’s slogan “Make America Great Again” has overtones of the “American dream.” But provisions of his Tax Reform and Jobs Act of 2017 were unfriendly to homeowners. Even without major further interest rate increases, there would seem to be a limit on how much the prices of existing homes can increase. After all, people must struggle to cover a range of living expenses, and builders are supplying fresh new offerings to compete with the existing houses on the market. Perhaps the home price increases are now a self-fulfilling prophesy. As John Maynard Keynes argued in his 1936 “General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money,” people seem to have a “simple faith in the conventional basis of valuation.” If the conventional basis is now that home prices are going up 5 percent a year, then sellers, who would otherwise have no idea what to ask for their houses, will just put a price based on this convention. And likewise buyers will not feel they are paying too much if they accept the convention. In the United States, we may believe that the process is all part of the “American dream.” It can’t go on forever, of course. But when it will end isn’t knowable. The data can’t tell us when prices will level off, or whether they will plunge catastrophically. All we do know is that prices have been roaring higher at a speed rarely seen in American history.",The New York Times
2018,The Huawei Executive’s Arrest Is Igniting Fear. The U.S. Should Take Notice.,"The New New World Days after the Canadian authorities arrested one of China’s leading technology executives at the behest of Washington, Cisco warned some employees that China might return the favor. In an email with the subject line “Travel Restriction to China,” the Silicon Valley networking giant cautioned employees against nonessential travel to China “due to recent events.” Cisco has since said that the email was sent in error and that there are no China travel restrictions on its employees. Still, the fear is real. The arrest this month of Meng Wanzhou of Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, appears to have put a certain kind of elite — tech-savvy, comfortable in both countries — square in the middle of the economic conflict between the United States and China. For many Chinese tech entrepreneurs, the United States suddenly doesn’t seem like the same place that welcomed them to study, work and raise money. That could be a big problem for both countries. Already, some tech types are reconsidering their travel plans, if not their connections, to the other country. Many see a bit of themselves in Ms. Meng. As Huawei’s chief financial officer and daughter of the company founder, she is a member of a tech elite that has long thought of itself as too valuable to be threatened. (American authorities say she was part of a plan to avoid American sanctions against Iran. Huawei says it is unaware of any wrongdoing on her part.) Over spicy hot pot last week after the announcement of Ms. Meng’s arrest, an American-educated Chinese tech entrepreneur told me that he wouldn’t travel to the United States unless necessary. Another Chinese tech figure, one who is backed by American money, discussed whether he should give up his beloved iPhone for a Huawei smartphone. That culture of fear and alienation has been building for a while, as the American government grows increasingly skeptical of China’s technology ambitions and its business ties in places like Silicon Valley. The founder of an artificial intelligence start-up said that when he visited the Bay Area in October, he was questioned extensively at immigration. One investor, a former Silicon Valley engineer who moved back to China a few years ago to set up a venture capital fund focused on A.I., left his laptop at home and deleted messages from the social media platform WeChat from his phone in case American security personnel decided to take a peek. They didn’t. (All the tech industry figures spoke on the condition of anonymity — to protect themselves not just from the Chinese government but from the American government as well.) The last time I saw so many liberal-minded Chinese elites so disappointed by the American government was after the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Serbia, in 1999, which killed three Chinese nationals. The United States said it was a mistake, and President Bill Clinton apologized. “Out of national security consideration, we can start thinking about the possibility of ousting Apple from China,” Fang Xingdong, the founder of ChinaLabs, a technology think tank in Beijing, wrote on WeChat. On Chinese social media, jingoism is running high. “A guilty conscience needs no accuser!” “Boycott Cisco!” “Let’s detain Tim Cook of Apple!” For China, this level of distrust could have some dire consequences. China and the United States remain tightly interconnected despite the clash over trade between Washington and Beijing. The Chinese economy is slowing down. Any pause in business relations between the two countries could make it worse. The United States, on the other hand, risks losing important potential allies in its tug of war with China’s authoritarian government. China’s tech elite are comfortable with the American system and open to many Western values. It would not be in Washington’s interest to push them closer to the Communist Party. Many in the Chinese tech scene were already growing increasingly alienated from the party. President Xi Jinping’s order to enhance party building in the private sector has eroded the independence of private enterprises. The party has grown tougher in enforcing rules requiring companies to set up local party cells and to make executives answer to party secretaries. “The party building in the past few years was a big present to the U.S. and Europe,” said Chen Zhiwu, an economist at Hong Kong University. China’s pro-market elites have been trying to use the pressure of a slowing economy and the trade war to push Mr. Xi to give power back to entrepreneurs, which would be in line with some of Washington’s goals. Now, they aren’t sure that the Trump administration views them any differently from the Chinese government. Chinese executives have run into trouble before. Last week a jury in New York convicted Patrick Ho, a former Hong Kong official working for a troubled Chinese oil company, in a bribery case. American officials came close to outright killing the Chinese tech company ZTE this year for also violating sanctions against Iran, depriving it for a while of American-made technology that it needed to do business. This time is different. Huawei is among the most respected private enterprises in China. The world’s biggest telecom equipment maker and No. 2 smartphone maker, Huawei is frequently exalted in China’s business world for elbowing out its bigger Western rivals and developing cutting-edge technologies. There are all kinds of tales about how hard Huawei engineers and salespeople work. Many entrepreneurs told me that they respected Ren Zhengfei, Huawei’s founder and Ms. Meng’s father, more than high-profile Chinese internet tycoons like Jack Ma of Alibaba and Pony Ma of Tencent because Huawei is the only Chinese corporation with a truly global footprint. The United States accuses Ms. Meng of being directly involved in efforts to circumvent its sanctions against Iran. The authorities there may have compelling evidence. For people not familiar with China and China’s business world, it may be puzzling that some businesspeople would take Ms. Meng’s arrest so badly. Still, many people in China who have grown up under an authoritarian regime see only a blunt exercise of state power. Because many Chinese view Ms. Meng’s arrest as a tool to escalate the trade war, they see her as a victim of geopolitics rather than a potential lawbreaker. They also worry they could be seen as tainted simply because they are from China. Think of it as China’s “original sin” — it is hard to be a truly independent private business in China because the government controls most of the resources. The Chinese government uses bank loans, business licenses and regulations to make sure companies toe the party line. It is increasingly a major venture capitalist. If the United States isn’t careful, it could alienate a group of people who may be instrumental if China is going to loosen up and give its people more freedom. Many admire the American political, judiciary and economic systems. If the United States puts more pressure on them, they may be forced to choose sides — and the Chinese government may seem like the only choice to make. “The whole world is taking sides,” Ren Yi, a senior investment banker in Beijing, wrote on the social media site Weibo. Huawei “suddenly finds itself on the front line of civilizational confrontation.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Hypocrisy of Hanukkah,"It’s a holiday that commemorates an ancient battle against assimilation. And it’s the one holiday that most assimilated Jews celebrate. Mr. Lukas is a novelist. It’s the question that Jewish parents instinctively dread. A few months ago, I was sitting on the couch with my 3-year-old daughter, watching YouTube videos about animals in space, when out of nowhere she looked up at me and asked: “Dada, can we celebrate Christmas?” “We don’t celebrate Christmas,” I told her, putting on my serious voice. “We celebrate Hanukkah.” Like generations of Jewish parents before me, I did my best to sell her on the relative merits of Hanukkah. True, Christmas might have those sparkly trees, ornaments and fruitcake. But we have latkes, jelly doughnuts and eight nights of presents. “Do we have Santa?” she asked, hopefully. “No,” I said, and her face dropped. “They do.” I tried to reiterate the part about the jelly doughnuts and the eight nights of presents. But she wasn’t having any of it. I can’t say I blame her. During the rest of the year, the Jewish holidays we celebrate are like special, bonus celebrations we get to have on top of everything else going on in the calendar. With Hanukkah and Christmas, however, it’s a zero-sum game. [Discover the most compelling features, reporting and humor writing from The New York Times Opinion section, selected by our editors. Sign up for the Sunday Best newsletter.] Most of the year, it isn’t hard for our family to feel both American and Jewish. But in December — when there are wreaths and Peppa Pig Christmas specials and inflatable Santas everywhere you look — that dual identity becomes more of a question. Which is why Hanukkah is a big deal for mostly assimilated Jews like myself. The only trouble is the actual holiday. Not the latkes and the dreidels, but the story of Hanukkah, which at its heart is an eight-night-long celebration of religious fundamentalism and violence. For most of the past 2000 years, Hanukkah was an afterthought on the Jewish calendar, a wintertime festival of lights during which people spun tops and ate greasy food to commemorate what has to be one of God’s least impressive miracles — a small container of oil lasted for eight nights! More recently, as Jews have become assimilated into American society, the holiday has evolved into a kind of Semitic sidekick for Christmas, a minor festival pumped up into something it was never meant to be so that Jewish kids won’t feel bad about not having a tree. This is the version of Hanukkah that I grew up with: presents and chocolate gelt; latkes with sour cream and applesauce; a few somber, off-key songs that no one fully remembered, about Judah Maccabee. This is the version of Hanukkah I had in mind when my daughter and I walked down to our local branch of the Oakland Public Library to check out a stack of books about the holiday. Most of the books we found presented a familiar narrative — dreidels and menorahs and pious Maccabees doing battle against their enemies — but between the lines, there were some hints at a darker story, enough to send me to Wikipedia and the Books of Maccabees on the (definitely not Jewish but very helpful) Bible Gateway website, which led me back to the library for another stack of books, this one for myself. According to most modern scholars — and a few rabbis I called on to help me out — the story of Hanukkah is based on a historical conflict between the Maccabees and the Hellenized Jews, the former being religious zealots who lived in the hills of Judea and practiced an ancient form of guerrilla warfare, the latter being mostly city-dwelling assimilationists who ate pork, didn’t circumcise their male children and made the occasional sacrificial offering to pagan gods. Some of the details are up for debate, depending on which texts you consult. But everyone agrees that the Maccabees won out in the end and imposed their version of Judaism on the formerly Hellenized Jews. So Hanukkah, in essence, commemorates the triumph of fundamentalism over cosmopolitanism. Our assimilationist answer to Christmas is really a holiday about subjugating assimilated Jews. The more I thought about all this, the more it disturbed me. For what am I if not a Hellenized Jew? (O.K., an Americanized Jew, but what’s the difference, really?) I eat pork every so often. Before having children, my wife and I agonized over the question of circumcision. And while I’ve never offered burned sacrifices to Zeus, I do go to yoga occasionally. When it comes down to it, it’s pretty clear that the Maccabees would have hated me. They would have hated me because I’m assimilated and because I’m the product of intermarriage. And while I can’t say for certain what the Maccabees would have thought about my fondness for Bernie Sanders or my practice of Reconstructionist Judaism, I’m pretty sure they wouldn’t have liked those things either. Given all this, there’s a part of me that wants to skip out on Hanukkah altogether. Why should I light candles and sing songs to celebrate a group of violent fundamentalists? The answer, frankly, is that it’s not my choice. With my daughter ready to sign up for Team Santa, we have to celebrate something, and I’m not quite Hellenized enough to get a Christmas tree. So this year, for lack of a better alternative, I’m going to try to embrace Hanukkah in all its contradictions. When I light the candles, I’m going to celebrate the possibility of light in dark times, the importance of even the smallest miracles. And when everyone else is singing about the Maccabees, I’ll be saying a prayer for the Hellenized Jews and for the “renegade Jews” of our day. Then I’m going to sneak my daughter an extra piece of chocolate gelt and break out the presents. Because at the end of the day, it’s all about beating Santa.

2018,The Impact of the Hong Kong International Races,"Although it has one of the smallest horse populations in the world, Hong Kong has positioned itself as global leader in thoroughbred racing. The Hong Kong International Races, or H.K.I.R., the marquee event of the island’s season, take place on Sunday at Sha Tin Racecourse. Begun in 1988, the event originally featured one race, the Hong Kong Invitation Cup, which was the first international race held there. Now simply named the Hong Kong Cup, the race has been joined by the Hong Kong Sprint, Mile and Vase, and they are worth 93 million Hong Kong dollars ($11.9 million) in total. More than 1,300 runners from 17 countries and regions have taken part since the races were created. Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges, the Hong Kong Jockey Club’s chief executive, discussed the success of the races as well as Hong Kong’s racing model. The conversation has been edited and condensed. How important are the Hong Kong International Races to the program? One of the cornerstones in developing Hong Kong racing to a world-class level was the introduction of the Hong Kong International Races. If you look back, our betting turnover was very high, and we had some good horses, but there was nothing, be it horses or races, of world-class quality. We wanted to strive for this level of excellence. Now, people appreciate how competitive Hong Kong racing is, how good it is and how much quality it has, and we can reap in the rewards, be it through sponsorship, brand recognition or commingling. How does the jockey club recruit international runners to compete? One reason is the very attractive prize money. The Sprint, the Mile and the Cup are the richest races at their distance on the world calendar. Also, if you look at our quarantine, it is probably one of the easiest places to fly into. When you talk to horsemen, in a lot of other jurisdictions it’s a little bit more difficult. The other thing is people know if they come to Hong Kong, they absolutely compete on a level playing field. Integrity in everything we do is key. Additionally, we have teams in different countries who try to convince owners and trainers to focus on our races. What value do international competitors bring to the races? I humbly say we have the most international racing product on a day-to-day basis, if you look at the horses, trainers and jockeys, but the H.K.I.R. is another spike. It’s a benefit not only for Hong Kong, but global racing. We are able to bring together those who are the best in Hong Kong and in the world. Jockeys, trainers and owners all strive to be at an event that is unique, and Hong Kong is a unique platform. I think the next stage of the H.K.I.R. is how we create not only prize money value for the owners, but how we create breeding value for winning horses. For example, Lord Kanaloa won twice at the H.K.I.R. The international profile he got in Hong Kong enhanced his stallion value in Japan. Now, you see his daughter Almond Eye dominating. To what do you attribute Hong Kong’s global success? We only have around 0.7 percent of the world’s horse population, but around 8 percent of the best horses are trained here, and we have around 8 to 10 percent of the best races in the world run here. We started with prize money, but we also wanted to increase the quality of horses. We also have a clear, strategic focus on turf. If you only have 1,200 horses, you can’t be good at all surfaces and all distances. Additionally, our racing authority has a very strong focus on integrity. There is no room for racing or training under the influence of prohibited substances. We also have one of the best teams in the world to administer and run racing. Why do you make so much free data available to fans and bettors? Our customers see racing as a mind game, and they need information. We make this freely available and in different presentation forms because different generations have different ways of how they process information. All the horses are trained in our premises, so training data, veterinary data, everything we have, we make available for our customers. Every race meeting, we have around 800,000 to 900,000 people searching for information on our website, and a lot of them spend three or four hours in this mind-game exercise. People have a gaming propensity, so we provide the information which we think is relevant to them and attractive to them, so they engage with our game. Is owning racehorses popular in Hong Kong? Horse ownership is extremely prestigious here. We have more people who want to have a horse than can have a horse. Every year, we can bring in 350 to 400 horses, but we have 1,200 to 1,300 applications for a horse. We did introduce a special replacement permit where you don’t have to go through the normal process. If you retire a horse and you bring in a horse of at least Group 3 quality, you can do this at any time. We have driven the quality up. Hong Kong is unique in that it has no breeding program, so how do you recruit and care for racehorses? It’s a huge education exercise with owners about what types of horses fit our program. The other thing we look at is equine welfare. We have a very stringent vet protocol. We provide owners with veterinary information before they bring in a horse, and also if you want to own a horse you have to pay 80,000 Hong Kong dollars, soon to be 90,000, into a retirement fund. We stress from the import of the horse that you as the owner are responsible. Why does Hong Kong allow owners to change a horse’s name, when many jurisdictions do not? A lot of it has to do with luck, and sometimes you have names which are very difficult to pronounce for the Chinese. Changing a horse’s name is, from a traceability standpoint, a bit of an issue. But as long as they are geldings, the impact is not as much. A lot of times, owners want their horses’ names to relate to each other. We have families that always include a certain word, like Beauty or Dragon. I think it will become more of an issue, but at the moment there is a very strong expression from our owners to be able to rename their horses. Racehorses have been trained exclusively at Sha Tin, but with Conghua Racecourse opening this year in mainland China, how has it changed things? I think this was one of the boldest projects we have ever done. We established the first disease-free zone in China. There’s a corridor between Hong Kong and this training center where the horses can move freely back and forth. We could not get more land in Hong Kong, so we could not expand here. Conghua gives us the opportunity to increase the horse population. Sha Tin will always be the center, but it gives us the next stage of development.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Impolite Realities of Observing Police Abuse,"Stepping outside of work for a bite — and ending up embroiled in an all-too-common case of aggressive policing. Mr. Smith is on the staff of The New York Times Opinion section. Most of the time, I witness police misconduct like many other Americans: secondhand. Scrolling through my news feed, a video pops up showing an appalling instance of officer behavior that was captured by a concerned onlooker. It has become an eerie hallmark of our time: the use of smartphone recordings as a limited yet meaningful deterrent against police abuse, or at least police impunity. But a couple of Fridays ago, on the evening of Dec. 7, I found myself, for the first time, in the role of alarmed eyewitness. On a break from work, I crossed the intersection of 40th and 8th Avenue in Manhattan and, through a jungle of midtown noise and limbs, saw a group of police officers pushing an African-American man outside the Port Authority Bus Terminal. I couldn’t tell how the squabble started, but the man repeatedly called out: “Somebody tape me. Tape me, please.” He didn’t resist as handcuffs were placed on his wrists, but the officer leading the pack kept shoving him against a wall. My hands shaking from a mix of adrenaline and December cold, I took out my phone and began to record the scene, along with another bystander or two. Port Authority Police officers approached those of us filming and told us not to interfere. The other person next to me filming, a young-looking Latino man wearing a beanie hat, kept his distance, but loudly protested. “I got the right to record all I want,” he shouted. “I don’t have to step off the sidewalk. Freedom of speech.” He then called the officers “pigs,” lacing his taunts with profanity. When I asked a nearby police officer his name and what prompted the clamor, he threatened me with arrest for blocking the sidewalk, at which point I identified myself as a New York Times journalist just trying to observe. The officers’ focus then turned toward the Latino man in the beanie, who continued to trade barbs with the five or so officers slowly surrounding him. He swiveled from side to side, waving his phone in a panoramic motion, its lens now serving as his shield. I walked off toward the spot where the black man was detained to ask others if they’d seen what started the commotion. Within moments, I heard the clang of a body hitting the metal barricades behind me. The Latino man in the beanie was pinned to the ground by four officers, one of them crushing the man’s neck and head into the concrete while another gave him quick blows to the side, as yet another cuffed him and a fourth twisted his leg. “All right, I’m sorry. I’m sorry, man — just let me go home, please,” the man pleaded. “Little late,” one of the officers said, tightening the cuffs. A plainclothes officer approached me and pushed away my phone. “Sir, you want to go to jail?” he threatened. “Stop recording.” This time, I stopped. When asked why the man in the beanie had been arrested, the officer limply offered, “Disorderly conduct.” With the sinking feeling that his response was most likely the first step in an attempt by the police to cover for themselves, I returned to work and began to do a little digging. The man in the beanie was Jairo Tejada Espinosa. He was charged with obstructing government administration, resisting arrest, disorderly conduct and assault on a police officer, which is a felony, among other charges. (The black man we both filmed was booked on a harassment charge, a violation usually punished with a fine.) Mr. Espinosa, 33, was taken to Bellevue Hospital for injuries sustained during his arrest. In response to my inquiries, the Port Authority said through its press office that the matter had been referred to the agency’s independent Office of the Inspector General. “We hold our officers to the highest standards,” the statement says. “And any conduct that would require disciplinary action will be addressed following the conclusion of the investigation.” The investigators may want to begin with a close examination of the police’s official account, as written in a criminal complaint to the court. The police claim that Mr. Espinosa “resisted arrest in that he manipulated his arms and hands to avoid handcuffing, continuously flailed his legs, and laid down on the ground” — a characterization that seems exaggerated at best. (Surveillance cameras on the corner, to which the Port Authority has access, should provide useful information for investigators.) The police also wrote in their official complaint that Mr. Espinosa, while in custody on the way to the hospital, “repeatedly kicked” an officer, hurting his hand. Mr. Espinosa is contesting all the charges and has declined to plead guilty to reduced non-felony charges. Mr. Espinosa’s public defender, Rebecca Phipps, informed the Manhattan district attorney’s office that the Port Authority inspector general had begun an investigation. He was released on Dec. 13; his next court date is Feb. 5. Citing privacy concerns, Ms. Phipps would not provide me with any further personal information about Mr. Espinosa. The facility commander of the Port Authority Police declined to comment in response to inquiries about Mr. Espinosa’s initial felony-assault charge. After I briefed him on the details of the case, Scott Hechinger, a senior staff attorney and director of policy at Brooklyn Defender Services, expressed skepticism about the police account, while cautioning that each case is different. “These are the quintessential allegations police make against someone who has been the victim of excessive force,” he said. While the truth of what happened on the way to Bellevue Hospital may end up a matter of Mr. Espinosa’s word versus that of the Port Authority police officers, the police’s less than forthright characterization of Mr. Espinosa’s arrest suggests this incident may be yet another case of excessive force by New York City public safety officers. A few weeks ago, police officers forced an incarcerated Bronx woman to remain handcuffed while giving birth. And this month, a video posted on Facebook showed Jazmine Headley sitting on the floor of a Brooklyn food-stamp office while authorities pried her 1-year-old from her arms following an argument over Ms. Headley’s sitting on the floor. Her charges, which included resisting arrest and obstructing governmental administration, were dropped following widespread public outrage after the video went viral. Mr. Espinosa may be a less sympathetic character than the young mother. But his original offense — using obscene language — is a violation typically punished with a ticket and a fine, not an elbow to the face. As I dug into his case, I found myself fighting the idea that maybe I was making too big a deal out of what I saw. After all, I thought, Mr. Espinosa didn’t suffer life-altering or life-ending injuries. But that thinking is a problem at the root of our criminal justice system: Little fuss is made when people without access to the levers of power are robbed of their dignity, rights or freedoms. The First Step Act, a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill winding through Congress that aims to roll back the excesses of tough-on-crime laws, deserves the polite plaudits it’s receiving. But if passed, it still can’t temper the attitude problem in policing, the insecurities of hot-blooded, poorly trained police officers whose first instinct, far too often, is escalation and force. For insulting an officer, Mr. Espinosa was beaten, cuffed, dragged in public and taken to the hospital, then locked up for several days because of felony-level bail too expensive for him. (I’ve seen white men I grew up with in the South and Northeast do much worse in the presence of the police without reprimand, and I’ve heard students of color at protests on elite college campuses call officers equally harsh names to their faces without being tackled.) The impolite reality is that stories like this explain why frustrated residents in many communities see the police as an occupying force. This shows what a growing cross-section of Americans in both political parties mean when they speak of a two-tiered justice system. This is why the police, in neighborhoods and editorial pages across the country, often don’t get the respect they demand — or the trust they feel they deserve.

2018,The Incredible Shrinking Apartment,"While rents continue to go up, the size of the average rental is going down. It’s no secret that rents are on the rise, which means you get less space for the money. But if you’re feeling cramped, there may be another reason as well. A recent study by RentCafe showed that the average size of a new rental apartment in the United States shrank more than 5 percent over the past decade, from 993 to 941 square feet. And the smallest apartments got even smaller: The average new studio shrank from 573 to 514 square feet, a decrease of more than 10 percent. At the same time, the average rent went up, from $1,523 to $1,944 a month — an increase of nearly 28 percent. So where did new apartments shrink the most? In these 10 metropolitan areas, where rents also increased substantially. 2008 2018 Phoenix 1,078 to 871 sq. ft. SIZE –19% $735 to $998 mo.

2018,Opinion | The Inevitability of Impeachment,"Even Republicans may be deciding that the president has become too great a burden to their party or too great a danger to the country. Ms. Drew is a journalist based in Washington who covered Watergate. An impeachment process against President Trump now seems inescapable. Unless the president resigns, the pressure by the public on the Democratic leaders to begin an impeachment process next year will only increase. Too many people think in terms of stasis: How things are is how they will remain. They don’t take into account that opinion moves with events. Whether or not there’s already enough evidence to impeach Mr. Trump — I think there is — we will learn what the special counsel, Robert Mueller, has found, even if his investigation is cut short. A significant number of Republican candidates didn’t want to run with Mr. Trump in the midterms, and the results of those elections didn’t exactly strengthen his standing within his party. His political status, weak for some time, is now hurtling downhill. The midterms were followed by new revelations in criminal investigations of once-close advisers as well as new scandals involving Mr. Trump himself. The odor of personal corruption on the president’s part — perhaps affecting his foreign policy — grew stronger. Then the events of the past several days — the president’s precipitous decision to pull American troops out of Syria, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis’s abrupt resignation, the swoon in the stock market, the pointless shutdown of parts of the government — instilled a new sense of alarm among many Republicans. The word “impeachment” has been thrown around with abandon. The frivolous impeachment of President Bill Clinton helped to define it as a form of political revenge. But it is far more important and serious than that: It has a critical role in the functioning of our democracy. Impeachment was the founders’ method of holding a president accountable between elections. Determined to avoid setting up a king in all but name, they put the decision about whether a president should be allowed to continue to serve in the hands of the representatives of the people who elected him. The founders understood that overturning the results of a presidential election must be approached with care and that they needed to prevent the use of that power as a partisan exercise or by a faction. So they wrote into the Constitution provisions to make it extremely difficult for Congress to remove a president from office, including that after an impeachment vote in the House, the Senate would hold a trial, with a two-thirds vote needed for conviction. Lost in all the discussion about possible lawbreaking by Mr. Trump is the fact that impeachment wasn’t intended only for crimes. For example, in 1974 the House Judiciary Committee charged Richard Nixon with, among other things, abusing power by using the I.R.S. against his political enemies. The committee also held the president accountable for misdeeds by his aides and for failing to honor the oath of office’s pledge that a president must “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” The current presidential crisis seems to have only two possible outcomes. If Mr. Trump sees criminal charges coming at him and members of his family, he may feel trapped. This would leave him the choice of resigning or trying to fight congressional removal. But the latter is highly risky. I don’t share the conventional view that if Mr. Trump is impeached by the House, the Republican-dominated Senate would never muster the necessary 67 votes to convict him. Stasis would decree that would be the case, but the current situation, already shifting, will have been left far behind by the time the senators face that question. Republicans who were once Mr. Trump’s firm allies have already openly criticized some of his recent actions, including his support of Saudi Arabia despite the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and his decision on Syria. They also openly deplored Mr. Mattis’s departure. It always seemed to me that Mr. Trump’s turbulent presidency was unsustainable and that key Republicans would eventually decide that he had become too great a burden to the party or too great a danger to the country. That time may have arrived. In the end the Republicans will opt for their own political survival. Almost from the outset some Senate Republicans have speculated on how long his presidency would last. Some surely noticed that his base didn’t prevail in the midterms. But it may well not come to a vote in the Senate. Facing an assortment of unpalatable possibilities, including being indicted after he leaves office, Mr. Trump will be looking for a way out. It’s to be recalled that Mr. Nixon resigned without having been impeached or convicted. The House was clearly going to approve articles of impeachment against him, and he’d been warned by senior Republicans that his support in the Senate had collapsed. Mr. Trump could well exhibit a similar instinct for self-preservation. But like Mr. Nixon, Mr. Trump will want future legal protection. Mr. Nixon was pardoned by President Gerald Ford, and despite suspicions, no evidence has ever surfaced that the fix was in. While Mr. Trump’s case is more complex than Mr. Nixon’s, the evident dangers of keeping an out-of-control president in office might well impel politicians in both parties, not without controversy, to want to make a deal to get him out of there.

2018,Opinion | The Invincible Benjamin Netanyahu,"The prime minister of Israel is being investigated for corruption. His cabinet is crumbling. And he’s not going anywhere. Mr. Pfeffer is a journalist based in Israel. JERUSALEM — This should have been the end of Benjamin Netanyahu’s career. His coalition is down to the minimum number of seats in the Knesset necessary to hold on to power, his ministers at war with one another and with him, and remarkably, the police have recommended indicting him on serious corruption charges three separate times, the most recent on Dec. 2. Yet despite all this, polling concurs that Mr. Netanyahu is on course to win a fifth election next year and surpass David Ben-Gurion, Israel’s founding father, as the country’s longest-serving leader. Meanwhile, he has more power than ever. When Avigdor Lieberman resigned on Nov. 14 to protest a cease-fire agreement with Hamas in Gaza, Mr. Netanyahu took on the role of defense minister, adding it to his portfolio of prime minister and foreign minister. (He also holds a couple of other less-interesting ministries.) He appears to have no intention of reallocating these policy roles in the near future. The remaining members of the cabinet grumble off the record that “Bibi is stealing the show” and hint darkly that the timing of Israel’s latest operation against Hezbollah tunnels — and especially the prime-time news briefings by the new defense minister — may have some connection to Mr. Netanyahu’s desire to deflect attention from the latest police findings. But they all acknowledge that after the next election, they will still be serving under him. The legal process won’t do Mr. Netanyahu in. While the police recommendations seem — and are — damning, they are legally meaningless. The attorney general has to issue the indictment, a process that could take at least another year. Even then, there is no clear obligation for Mr. Netanyahu to resign, even while on trial. He most likely wouldn’t. But the reason for that is politics, not the law. The seeming inevitability of Mr. Netanyahu’s continuing reign should be surprising. Replacing a prime minister in Israel isn’t difficult. All it would take is a majority of Knesset members to vote for another of their colleagues and Mr. Netanyahu would have to leave office. And he isn’t immune from prosecution. In the past decade, the Israeli courts have sent both a prime minister (Ehud Olmert for bribery) and a president (Moshe Katzav for rape) to prison. In 2008, Mr. Olmert was forced from office at a relatively early stage during his own criminal investigation, when members of his coalition refused to serve under a prime minister accused of taking bribes. What makes Mr. Netanyahu so different? In nearly a decade back in power, he has delivered what had never seemed possible: a period of sustained economic growth, including, for the first time, a AA- international credit rating; flourishing ties with countries around the world (and, behind the scenes, new alliances with Arab governments); and, by Israeli standards, security. A third Intifada hasn’t broken out on his watch. Israel found itself fighting on the ground in Gaza only once, for a 50-day period in the summer of 2014. And the shadow war with Iran in Syria has not boiled over. But the most incredible achievement for many Israelis is that Mr. Netanyahu has been able to do all of this without making any concessions to the Palestinians. For the Israeli right, this makes him irreplaceable. He stood up to international pressure during the Obama administration, long enough for the Palestinian issue to sink to the bottom of the global agenda. With President Trump in the White House and European and Arab leaders preoccupied by their own troubles, the pressure has now all but disappeared. There was a time not long ago, beginning in 1992 with the rise of Yitzhak Rabin, when the Israeli left seemed to be winning the argument: A two-state solution was necessary. No longer. No matter how deep their frustration with Mr. Netanyahu, no figures on the right want to openly challenge the most successful nationalist leader in Israel’s history. None are prepared to risk being accused of opening the way for the return of the defeatist left with its dangerous ideas of relinquishing territory. The aspiring prime ministers in Likud and its satellite right-wing parties all talk of making a run “only after Netanyahu.” This political and ideological ascendancy confers on Mr. Netanyahu at least temporary immunity — political, if not necessarily legal. Mr. Olmert was forced to resign when he was charged with bribery only because he was already weakened and discredited as a prime minister. But the course of justice was slow. It took seven and a half years from his resignation to him actually going to jail. A similar fate may well be in store for Mr. Netanyahu, but only years from now. As long as he is satisfying his political base and the opposition fails to come up with a better narrative with which to replace his, he can continue fighting his legal battles from office.

2018,"The Itsy-Bitsy, Teenie-Weenie, Very Litigious Bikini","On a sunny summer day in Montauk, Ipek Irgit was in the familiar situation of not knowing what she was doing with her life. It was 2012, and she was 34 years old. Earlier in the year, after having her heart broken, she had taken a vacation in Brazil, visiting Rio de Janeiro and the beach towns of Bahia. Now she was on the beach on Long Island, wearing a handmade-looking bikini with crochet and exposed elastic straps, trying to figure out what to do and who to be. It had been 11 unsettled years since Ms. Irgit moved from Turkey to New York, with $300 in her pocket and a vague dream of making a life in one of the city’s creative industries. She became part of a downtown class of trendsetters who all seemed to have a purpose. It was an expensive existence, especially for Ms. Irgit, who, without the cushion of a trust fund, bounced from job to job. She was a waitress and a bartender; she worked for a fashion company as an assistant to a merchandiser and in the wholesale department. Nothing stuck. On the Montauk sand, Ms. Irgit was playing paddle ball with a friend, the restaurateur Serge Becker, when he complimented her striking bikini. As Ms. Irgit would later put it, this was the spark that motivated her to start a business. Why not create more of these distinctive bathing suits? Why not become a bikini-maker? Ms. Irgit looked at the bathing suit and saw untapped “superpowers.” It was bright, colorful and looked fantastic on Instagram. Its tiny form contained an unexpected array of elements: triangular panels; contrast-color stitching; and most distinctively of all, those vibrant elastic straps threaded through loops of crochet. The suit had a D.I.Y. sensibility popular on both the internet and the runway, and Ms. Irgit hoped buyers would see it as sexy but sporty, bohemian but sophisticated. “A reflection,” she said, “of my personality.” Ms. Irgit asked a friend in the fashion industry to create a prototype, and a factory in China made a batch at a cost of about $29 each. Ms. Irgit decided to mark up the retail price to $285, putting her suit into the high-end luxury market. She paid careful attention to branding, playing around with “bikini” and her initials — I.I.I. — before settling on “Kiini” and a logo with three triangles over the “i”s, like the panels on the top and bottom of her suits. In June 2013, Kiini had its launch party at a buzzy restaurant owned by Mr. Becker. Models, stylists and other denizens of the beautiful-people set sipped Caribbean beer and posed for photos with Ms. Irgit, who wore bright lipstick and a pilot-style jumpsuit unbuttoned nearly to the navel, revealing her Kiini top beneath. Sales were unremarkable until January, when Ms. Irgit’s product got its first significant Instagram plug. The model Dree Hemingway posed provocatively by a surfboard in a bikini with dark panels and green-and-orange detailing. She captioned: “Thank you for my Kiini!!” “I was, like, bombarded,” Ms. Irgit said. “That was it.” The bikini was featured on Vogue.com, and in Vogue UK and Women’s Health magazine. There were Elle Italia, the style magazine of The Sunday Times of London, the Coveteur. In June 2014, People magazine called it “the hottest bikini this summer.” That December, it appeared on the U.K. cover of Condé Nast Traveller. A few months later, the company announced that the bikini was available at Barneys, the Valhalla of upscale boutique brands. Sales were exploding. By 2015, Ms. Irgit’s suit had brought in approximately $9 million, said Sally Wu, who for years helped the company source its bikinis from China. As is often the case in fashion, Kiini’s success drew copycats. Ms. Irgit complained about it to her lawyer, who advised her to apply with the United States Copyright Office for protection. Ms. Irgit came to regard knockoff makers with rage. She seethed when confronted by Instagram images erroneously referring to impostor Kiinis as the real article, and even hired a company to scrub such posts of the #kiini hashtag. Ms. Irgit told a lifestyle website that “one of my big challenges has been trying to keep up with demand without losing integrity and hiring the right people to help without panicking. My biggest challenge right now is the copiers around the world. People say I should be flattered but I despise all of them. It just shows a very ugly face of humanity to me.” In fashion, there is a fine, sometimes indistinguishable line separating inspiration and theft. Most apparel companies try not to get distracted by items that are derivative of their own. The trend cycle moves so quickly that experts tend to believe the best use of resources isn’t litigation, but creating next season’s styles. Ms. Irgit, though, could not abide the idea of rival versions of colorful crocheted bikinis. In 2015, she was particularly inflamed by the introduction of a faux-Kiini made by Victoria’s Secret. That October, in the central district of California, her lawyers filed a federal lawsuit accusing the company of copyright infringement. It called for Victoria’s Secret to stop selling the swimwear and pay damages. The lawsuit was a mismatch — teeny Kiini versus vast Victoria — but Ms. Irgit was scrappy. At one point, she surreptitiously recorded a meeting with a former Victoria’s Secret swimwear designer. Then Kiini’s lawyers deposed the designer; when her testimony contradicted what was on the secret tape, they played it back for her, making for a dramatic and embarrassing moment. As the litigation dragged on, Victoria’s Secret decided to get out of the swimwear business altogether, and by March 2017 the company and Kiini had agreed to a confidential settlement. (Victoria’s Secret declined to comment.) Ms. Irgit felt victorious. A year later, in April 2018, Kiini filed another federal lawsuit, this time in the Southern District of New York, against Neiman Marcus and two swimwear companies. It accused them of unfair competition, misleading consumers about the origin of the swimsuits and violating Kiini’s “trade dress.” In lay terms, Kiini was saying that any consumer in the world who saw a crocheted-and-exposed-elastic bikini would assume it was a Kiini. For an upstart brand, one lawsuit was rare. A second was unheard of. Kiini’s litigiousness brought Ms. Irgit unwanted attention — and revealed that even the tiniest two-piece can hide a lot of secrets. One day in August, Ms. Irgit greeted me at a loft in Tribeca, a large and airy space that serves both as her home and as Kiini’s showroom and office. We sat at a long, rectangular kitchen table that separates the living area and the work space. It is a point of pride for Ms. Irgit that she used her own marketing savvy to develop Kiini’s high profile without the use of a publicist, but our interview took place under specific conditions negotiated by Risa Heller, a crisis communications consultant. As we spoke, Ms. Irgit shared her disdain for the legal process — a hatred of lawsuits and a belief that it is lawyers who benefit the most from them. It was the creative process she most cherished, she said. She meandered, though, when I asked her repeatedly to talk about inventing the Kiini. Did she sketch it? How did she come up with the idea of threading elastic through crochet? “It goes back to with my grandmother,” Ms. Irgit said, in her most specific answer. “We used to make things like crochet bikinis, so I was like 10 and 11.” “You made crochet bikinis when you were 10?” I asked. “Not me, I’m not making them, right?” Ms. Irgit said. “No, ‘make’ is like — it is usually my idea. I’m not that — I didn’t make them. My mom made it, or my grandma made it.” What about the bathing suit Ms. Irgit was wearing on the beach in Montauk in 2012 with Mr. Becker? Who made it? “I had had it made,” was all Ms. Irgit would say. I called Mr. Becker, her paddle ball partner. He remembered the moment well. “She was wearing it,” Mr. Becker said. “I noticed it and I said it was really cool. She told me she had found them in Brazil and was contemplating starting to do something with it in different varieties.” Maria Solange Ferrarini lives in Trancoso, a beach town in Brazil’s Bahia state, along a dirt road littered with garbage and stray animals. When I walked up to her tidy four-room home one day this summer, she greeted me dressed in crocheted shorts with brightly colored elastics woven through them. Under a sleeveless T-shirt, she wore a similar bikini top. Inside, as we talked with the help of a translator, Ms. Ferrarini picked up a ball of yarn stuck through with a needle. She had a habit of grabbing it and crocheting absent-mindedly, holding it almost like a rosary, as she told her story. Ms. Ferrarini, 61, described herself as a street artist, but most people in Trancoso know her as the bikini lady. Since 1998, she has been selling handmade crochet-and-elastic bikinis on the beach, walking up and down the sand with her creations dangling off a hula hoop. She and the suit are inseparable. “It’s my husband,” she said, with a laugh. I looked at one of the bikinis in her living room. Ms. Ferrarini’s standard two-piece has two dark denim triangles connected by visible stitches of embroidery thread to crochet straps with brightly colored elastics woven through them. The bottom is made to match. It is virtually identical to the bikini Ms. Irgit had copyrighted. “I created this bikini to survive,” Ms. Ferrarini said. She was born in São Carlos, a university city outside São Paulo, where her father was a bricklayer and her mother was a seamstress. When she was 10, her mother taught her to crochet so that she could make clothes for herself and her younger sisters. Around 1994, she moved to Trancoso, took a room in a guesthouse, and tried to make money with her craft. She crocheted thong bikini bottoms and sold them by pacing the beach. It was nudist, though, and that created a problem. To get back to the guesthouse at the end of the day, Ms. Ferrarini had to pass a seaside church. As a Catholic, she didn’t feel right walking by in just a thong, with her breasts exposed. In reverence, she added a handmade, curtain-like top that draped over her chest. The design evolved into a bikini top. When Ms. Ferrarini realized she needed more support than yarn could provide, she began to thread elastics through the crochet to give a little lift. Other women quickly took note. They asked her to make tops for them, too. Initially, she sold the bikinis for the equivalent of $2.50. She increased the price by about $5 every couple of years. The Trancoso tourist economy was gaining steam by 2009. That year, Vogue called it “Brazil’s hottest beach town,” reporting that it was a favorite of no less an authority on sandy outposts than the Brazilian supergoddess Gisele Bündchen. It was the sort of beach that famous people and other fashionable types sought out. In the winter of 2012, the Daily Mail published photos of the British celebrity Kelly Brook on the beach in Trancoso, wearing one of Ms. Ferrarini’s bikinis. It was around that time that the town was visited by another trendsetter: Ipek Irgit. She confirmed the visit during our interview. Before I left Trancoso, I accompanied Ms. Ferrarini on a sales walk along the beach. She arranged a sale to a woman from California, and then sold a top to another tourist, from Canada, who mentioned she’d seen the same style “all over the place.” Ms. Ferrarini sighed. She was used to that, she said, but it still stung. To her, an artist, it is about creative integrity. “I’d see people in bikinis, and foreigners doubted that I was the creator,” she said. “They said the bikini was from the United States. To my face!” Sally Wu was happy on the day in mid-2012 when her friend, Ms. Irgit, contacted her to ask a favor. Earlier in the year she had been traveling in Brazil, she said, and was home with a new bikini. Ms. Wu said that Ms. Irgit told her, “I need to figure out how to copy it.” Ms. Wu was a good person to ask. Raised in Shanghai, she had moved to New York and become a fashion designer, then segued into the industry’s “private label” niche, working as a product developer and bilingual liaison between brands and Chinese manufacturers. She understood design, production and importing. In Ms. Wu’s recollection, Ms. Irgit brought a bikini to her Chinatown apartment and laid it on a couch. Ms. Wu saw that the suit, particularly the top, would be more complex to reconstruct than a layman might imagine. It would be tricky for yarn, for instance, to maintain its structure and color while being regularly submerged in water. And the unlined fabric would need to be a certain thickness, or else it would be see-through. She walked Ms. Irgit through each step of the replication process. “She is not a designer,” Ms. Wu said of Ms. Irgit this summer, as we sat on the back terrace of her current home, in East Harlem. “But she is a good marketer. She knows how to create a brand, and she really knows how to market a product.” After their initial consultation, Ms. Wu asked Ms. Irgit to send her a document of specs that Ms. Wu could relay to a Chinese manufacturer. Ms. Irgit sent the email on July 28, 2012. “Sally darling,” it began, and referred Ms. Wu to attached photos, with measurements and colors annotated. Ms. Irgit signed it “xo i.” Working with the factory, Ms. Wu helped to create a prototype. Ms. Irgit loved it, and asked for 300 more. Ms. Wu was worried about such a large order; if they didn’t sell, Ms. Irgit would be out a lot of money. But the Kiinis did sell — and sell and sell. What started as a favor for Ms. Irgit became a major time commitment. “Even in winter, we were shipping to Australia, shipping to Europe, shipping to New York,” Ms. Wu said. Ms. Irgit was crazed trying to manage the commercial demand and the press attention. The two women were consumed by work, and their relationship was fraying. Ms. Wu urged Ms. Irgit to expand her brand beyond a single motif. She made suggestions that Ms. Irgit ridiculed. Given the frostiness, Ms. Wu was surprised, she said, to get a phone call from Ms. Irgit one night in the late summer of 2016. “Can I come over?” Ms. Irgit asked. About a half-hour later, she arrived. She was nearly a year into litigation with Victoria’s Secret, and she explained that in the discovery process, lawyers for Victoria’s Secret had learned that Ms. Wu had a hand in Kiini’s production. Victoria’s Secret had given Ms. Irgit’s lawyers advance notice that Ms. Wu was going to receive a subpoena for a deposition. Ms. Wu said she clearly recalled what Ms. Irgit said next. “She’s like, ‘You can’t really tell them I copied.’ I said, ‘Listen, Ipek, I’m not going to lie.’” (Ms. Irgit disputed Ms. Wu’s recollection. “It’s a lie,” she said.) The two women talked some more. Ms. Wu was upset about getting pulled into a legal mess. Ms. Irgit was worried about how the drama could impact Kiini’s production. Before Ms. Irgit departed, Ms. Wu said, Ms. Irgit wrote a note on a yellow sticky pad. It read, “If Kiini LLC wins the VS case Ipek is treating” — the penmanship is imprecise and the word “treating” might be “hosting” or “having” — “Sally ChaCha and 3 optional friends on holiday anywhere in the world!” (Cha Cha was a nickname for Ms. Wu’s daughter.) She signed it “Ipek,” underlining her name in a flourish. Ms. Wu said she never received a subpoena. The next year, Victoria’s Secret settled the lawsuit with Kiini. By April 2018, around the time that Kiini sued Neiman Marcus, Ms. Wu and Ms. Irgit’s friendship and business arrangement had totally deteriorated. They had a blistering fight over email, with each woman impugning the other’s integrity, and Ms. Wu stopped working with Kiini. Not long after, Ms. Wu had dinner with a friend, an entrepreneur named Doug Schmidt. She told him the whole story about her work with Ms. Irgit: replicating that first Brazilian bikini, the copyright, the lawsuits. Mr. Schmidt told Ms. Wu that he had friends at Neiman Marcus. He bet they’d want to hear her story, too. Jason Forge was for years a federal prosecutor in United States attorney’s offices in California, going after dirty politicians and corrupt C.I.A. officials. Now he is in private practice; in his most notable case, he represented students in a class action against Trump University, winning them $25 million. Also, Mr. Forge is married to an owner of a swimwear supplier called PilyQ, which makes a crochet suit that looks a lot like a Kiini. Under a brand called Platinum, PilyQ has for some time been selling that suit to Neiman Marcus. In April, lawyers for Kiini sent Neiman Marcus a letter urging it to cease and desist selling swimwear from brands including Platinum. Neiman Marcus notified PilyQ, Platinum’s parent, and Mr. Forge started digging on PilyQ’s behalf. He got in touch with lawyers involved in the Victoria’s Secret litigation and heard rumors of an unacknowledged bikini maker in Brazil. Online, he found a video made by a friend of Ms. Ferrarini’s in 2016 that displayed her phone number. Mr. Forge reached Ms. Ferrarini, who consulted with a lawyer, and quickly negotiated a nonexclusive deal. In May, in exchange for using her crochet-and-elastic design and her name, PilyQ paid Ms. Ferrarini the equivalent of about $5,100. (In January 2019, she’ll get an annual fee of about $7,700.) Neiman Marcus and other major retailers now sell a suit under the name “Platinum Inspired by Solange Ferrarini” for about $170. This summer, Mr. Forge was thrilled to learn from someone at Neiman Marcus that there was a woman named Sally Wu who had worked with Ms. Irgit from the beginning. Mr. Forge met Ms. Wu for a drink and got her story. She subsequently emailed him a photo of the yellow sticky note with Ms. Irgit’s signed offer. She also agreed to give Mr. Forge access to data from her old hard drives. Within days, he was looking at the “Sally darling” email Ms. Irgit sent to Ms. Wu some six years earlier, with photographs of the bikini she wished the Chinese producers to use as a reference for her prototype. On his computer, Mr. Forge scrutinized the pictures for details. One image was of the bikini bottom turned inside out. Mr. Forge zoomed in. He zoomed again. Then he saw it. “I could not believe my eyes,” Mr. Forge told me. On the elastic, in marker, was a phone number, the words “Trancoso, B.A.” and the signature of Solange Ferrarini. In May 2018, as Mr. Forge was conducting his work, Kiini amended its lawsuit against Neiman Marcus to formally add PilyQ, Bloomingdales, Lord & Taylor, Macy’s and others as defendants. Mr. Forge found it outrageous. The way he saw it, PilyQ was compensating Ms. Ferrarini for her creation — and was now being sued by someone who he believed had copied that work and passed it off as her own to the United States Copyright Office. Mr. Forge contacted a lawyer who had done work for Victoria’s Secret in the Kiini matter, Michelle Rutherford, and asked her to take on a new client. On June 13, on behalf of Ms. Ferrarini, Ms. Rutherford sued Ms. Irgit and Kiini in federal court, in the Central District of California, citing unfair business practices and asking for a public apology. On July 3, one of Ms. Irgit’s lawyers, citing “irreconcilable differences,” petitioned the court to be removed from his role as counsel in her case against Neiman Marcus and the others. On July 6, Ms. Irgit withdrew her case. Mark A. Berman, Ms. Irgit’s lawyer in the case in which she is the defendant, has filed motions to dismiss and to have Ms. Rutherford disqualified. The judge, Fernando M. Olguin, who also oversaw Kiini’s action against Victoria’s Secret, has not yet ruled. It’s unclear what the implications of the new lawsuit are for Ms. Irgit. David J. Christopher, the chief of operations for the United States Copyright Office, declined to comment. But the allegations are notable to other experts in intellectual property law. “The role of truth in our judicial system is central,” said Jeanne M. Heffernan, a partner in the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. “Here you have a woman who appears to have taken the I.P. of someone else and registered it as her own — and then, it seems, had the audacity to sue an industry over something she did not create and may have stolen. If true, it’s breathtaking. I would think Victoria’s Secret would want to take a second look at their settlement.” When I spoke to Ms. Irgit in her Tribeca apartment this summer, she said she was not concerned about the case and was trying to focus on her company. Sales are not what they were during what Ms. Wu said were the peak times of 2015 and 2016, but Ms. Irgit is developing new products, including swimsuits for girls. As for the allegations in the lawsuit, Ms. Irgit said she sent photographs of Ms. Ferrarini’s bikini to Ms. Wu in 2012 because she liked the colors. She said the reason a photograph of a distinctive Trancoso pineapple cart had appeared on an early version of the Kiini website was simply because “it was a cute photo.” She didn’t have much to say about why the bathing suit shown in a photograph submitted to the Copyright Office is a near replica of Ms. Ferrarini’s bikini. She said the note promising Ms. Wu a reward if a court verdict went her way was not a bribe. At one point during the interview, Ms. Irgit walked into another room and returned with what she considered evidence that she created the design that became the Kiini. It was a bikini made in the Ferrarini/Kiini style, with elastic woven through crochet sewed to fabric — in this case, padded leotard-like pink fabric with mustard-yellow polka dots. The suit, she said, was made in 1999 and had been at her aunt’s house in Turkey until recently. Ms. Irgit declined to be quoted directly on a number of topics. Last month, though, she sent me an email expressing anger at Ms. Wu. She was even angrier with PilyQ and Mr. Forge, whom she called a “bully” and a “scumbag.” “What do they tell their children at the dinner table about how they make money?” Ms. Irgit wrote, saying she imagined them as film characters like Dr. Evil, from “Austin Powers,” and Maleficent, from “Sleeping Beauty,” attaching .gifs of them to illustrate her point. (“Ipek’s cartoon perspective is fitting for someone who lives in a world where people who expose frauds are villains and people who commit them are victims,” Mr. Forge said.) Ms. Irgit’s email also contained some positives. She pointed out that there would not be press attention and legal fights over crochet bikinis had she not envisioned and marketed a trendsetting global brand. “I must have done something right,” she wrote. Back in Trancoso, I asked Ms. Ferrarini what she wished would happen to Ms. Irgit. She replied with a reference to the colors of Brazil, and maybe of the bikini she had crocheted into existence. “Eu quero que ela se ferre em verde e amarelo,” she told me. “I want her to get screwed in green and yellow.”",The New York Times
2018,The Junk Removers Manhandle My Heart,"Modern Love Meandering through grief, a man tries to replace his sofa. It doesn’t go well. John and I bought the sofa together when he moved into my apartment on 14th Street. I say “together” even though he probably paid for it, as he did with most of our major purchases back then. He made four times what I did. Our choice was the Beecroft, a tight-backed sofa with low arms and wooden legs capped with offset brass wheels and covered in a white denim slipcover. I didn’t just feel grown up buying this sofa, I felt sophisticated. Initially, John balked. “I’m not paying $3,000 for a couch.” But it would last forever, I argued. “There has to be something cheaper that we like just as much,” he said. There wasn’t. Every other sofa we considered paled in comparison. When we moved into a new apartment 13 years later, Miss Beecroft was still as sturdy as ever. But with an opportunity to remodel and redecorate, we decided she was due for a refresh. We took the slipcover and cushions to an upholsterer who remade them in a natural-colored linen. The result was stunning. A few years later, our two new Chihuahua puppies, Sissy and Skeeter, quickly figured out how to pull the underside burlap from the wooden frame and create a little cave to hide in. Before long, all of the burlap had been ripped from its staples, which wasn’t a good look for Miss Bee. Sadly, things went downhill from there. The linen slipcover didn’t prove as durable as the white denim, especially with two small dogs. Holes appeared, so we flipped the cushions. The other sides got holes. Then one of Miss Bee’s wooden legs came loose, developing a gruesome tilt. I removed the leg altogether and propped up that end on a pair of books. I had our tailor patch the fabric with large squares until the patches themselves developed holes. I handled that on my own because by then John had died, succumbing to a rare and aggressive cancer he’d learned he had only two years earlier. My mind being elsewhere, I figured I would flip the cushions so no one would notice, forgetting that both sides were in tatters. I had a choice: Did I fix up Miss Bee, provider of comfort and anchor of my home and life with John? Or did I accept that she wasn’t worth fixing? I don’t remember what made me decide to bite the bullet and order a new sofa, only that it happened fast. I knew what I wanted. It was just a matter of checking a few boxes online, entering my credit card number and clicking “Buy.” All that was left was to arrange to have Miss Bee taken away. I called a junk removal service I liked because they would try to donate reusable items to charity or thrift shops. Miss Bee had a solid frame (not to mention a beautiful heart, as crazy as that sounds), so I hoped the right person could restore her to glory. I prepared for the haulers’ arrival by moving a huge shelving unit near the front door to provide fuller access to the entry. I had recently bought the unit to hold sentimental objects I had accumulated with John over the years. Before I could move the shelves, I had to remove those objects: seashells from vacations, random pottery, wasps’ and hornets’ nests, incense holders, pitchers, jugs and vases. I removed John’s grandmother’s metal salt-and-pepper shakers in the shape of two birds on a branch and her gold vase with ornate floral etching (the one John’s mother keeps hinting that she wants back). I removed the simple wooden box that holds a portion of John’s ashes. Made by my carpenter brother-in-law, the box also holds clippings from John’s hair and beard, a few trinkets and a small bag of our first dog’s ashes, because she was John’s favorite little girl. I removed framed photos of John, the candles I light for him, the tiny Ganesh I bought for him in India, the incense he gave to me on our last Christmas together and the metal bird feet he bought for me many years ago and that I love so much. After moving the shelf, I was ready. Or so I thought. The October morning the haulers arrived, I explained that the sofa would fit through the doorway but only at a specific angle. I knew this because the movers who brought it in had an arduous time but finally figured it out. These haulers weren’t so patient. They attempted to shove it through from different angles with no luck. And then it happened. Although I had moved the shelves and everything on them, I had left a small, porcelain deer head hanging on the wall near the door, a Christmas gift from John that was one of my most cherished possessions. The night before, I had considered moving it along with the rest of my keepsakes but then thought, “Nah, it won’t be in the way.” As the haulers jostled and lifted, the sofa bumped the deer head and knocked it off. “Uh oh,” the main guy said as I bounded from my chair. “Hold up,” he said to his partner as I fell to my knees and scooped up the deer head and left antler, which had broken off. I cursed as I looked at the pieces in my hand, a wave of despair washing over me. Returning to my chair, I pulled out my phone. “trying not to have a total emotional breakdown,” I texted to my friends Jessica and Rosella. “the sofa removers broke my john derian porcelain deer that john gave me for christmas.” “i’m really heartbroken” “it’s like john was angry at me for getting rid of our sofa” Neither responded. Meanwhile, the haulers gave up trying to figure out how to fit the sofa through the doorway. “I’m going to the truck to get a hammer,” the main guy said. Then, to me: “Do you have a hammer?” I didn’t want them smashing up Miss Bee, but in my dazed state I retrieved a hammer for him. Within seconds, he was assaulting her back legs. They did not give in quickly. The hardwood frame was solidly built. I sat in my chair and watched as these two men violently attacked Miss Bee. “the guys are still trying to figure out how to squeeze the sofa through the door,” I typed to Jessica and Rosella. “they’re literally bashing it to bits with a hammer” “can’t stop crying” No response. Eventually, with much effort, the haulers succeeded in knocking off the back legs. Miss Bee had put up a fight, her legs cracking and splitting but not letting loose, even as chunks of wood flew across the living room. I felt as if I had watched a family member being murdered. This wasn’t how it was supposed to happen. They were supposed to give her to someone who would lovingly restore her, not butcher her in my own apartment. Once Miss Bee’s shattered legs were ripped away, the men were able to swiftly carry her through the doorway. Wiping away tears, I picked up her tattered seat cushions and carried them to the door, handing them to one of the haulers. I didn’t want those assassins coming back in. I signed for their work. It didn’t occur to me to offer them a tip. And then, I lost it. Jessica responded to my text first: “no, john not angry, it’s just the clumsy removal man. glue the deer. it’s ok. john loves you. go stand on your balcony and take some deep breaths, look up at the sky and tell him you love him so much. inhale some fresh air. everything is ok.” Then Rosella: “yes everything she said. i’ll be home around 1:30 and i’ll come by for moral support and with some gorilla glue.” The morning’s saga had unlocked a trove of mounting grief within me that wasn’t, of course, about the sofa. It was about Halloween, which John loved. It was about our anniversary, Nov. 6. It was about another Thanksgiving without John, and another birthday without him, and another Christmas, and then New Year’s Eve. “I miss you so much,” I wailed. “I want you back. I need you here. Please come back to me.” Out on my balcony, taking deep breaths of fresh autumn air, I realized I was dying of thirst, completely dehydrated from all the sobbing. So I poured a glass of ice water, trudged to my bedroom and collapsed into bed. Grief and catharsis can take surprising forms. I hadn’t expected a sofa to play such a starring role in mine, but the murder of Miss Bee had provided a powerful — and beneficial — release. Tomorrow would be another day, and a new year beckoned. Until then, Rosella (and her Gorilla Glue) were on the way. Mike Rucker, vice president of the NBC News Brand Studio, is writing a memoir about love and loss.

2018,Opinion | The Kernel of Human (or Rodent) Kindness ,"What we can learn from lab rats that don’t show empathy for other rats. Mr. Garrett is an illustrator and a writer. Morality exists only because we evolved the capacity to empathize. And empathy provides the best guide to moral action. But there are those who say that empathy is too selective to play such a central role in our moral system. People tend to empathize more readily with those who look, sound and behave like themselves. We feel the pain more acutely of those who resemble us. How then can empathy serve as a moral guide when it is morality’s role to lead us away from cruelty toward people outside our own group? To answer this objection, we can look to our fellow animals, many of whom share our capacity for empathy. If a rat sees another rat drowning, for example, it will forgo a chunk of chocolate to save its imperiled friend. Its actions are guided by its empathy. Scientists at the University of Chicago further explored the nature of empathy in rats. They found that a white rat raised among only white rats will do nothing to save a black rat from a trap. Rats, like humans, can be biased in how they act on, or don’t act on, their empathy. In a variant of the experiment, a white rat raised among only black rats would save a black rat from a trap — but would fail to save other white rats. And a white rat raised among black and white rats rescued rats of both colors. The researchers found that it is not the rat’s color that determines which type of rat it will show empathy for, but the social context in which it was raised. In short, rats do not show empathy because of an innate recognition of similarity in physical appearance. Likewise, when human empathy can be partial, it is because the experiences of people from some groups are hidden from our view, which limits our empathy toward them. It’s vital to recognize that prejudice is not baked-in: It is the result of our ignorance. A failure to learn about people (or rats) of different kinds can mean that we fail to recognize their pain as genuine pain. Empathy can be switched off. Empathy by itself is not enough. It becomes an accurate guide for moral action only when combined with knowledge of people of all different backgrounds — knowledge that can be attained only if you are willing to actively listen to people whose voices have been silenced.

2018,The Knee’s Better. Deshaun Watson’s Better. And the Texans Are Better.,"HOUSTON — The flashes came, at first, in jagged intervals: a sharp cut, a smooth scramble, an assertive plant-and-throw, the ball whistling toward a receiver. One after another, these flashes tantalized Deshaun Watson’s coaches and teammates on the Houston Texans, and in time they became expectations, and soon thereafter — a few games into this season, give or take — those expectations matured into a state of predictable comfort. There was no revelatory moment. One day, it just sort of happened. Watson, one of the N.F.L.’s singular talents — a player who just might have set all sorts of rookie quarterback marks had he not torn a knee ligament, halting his 2017 season seven games in — resembled his former self in full, only a more refined version of it. “Oh, he’s playing better than last year; I don’t think there’s any doubt,” Coach Bill O’Brien said of Watson. “He’s playing the game the way the Houston Texans need him to play the game.” The Texans have not lost since September because of a methodology that refutes the N.F.L.’s movement toward bazillion-yard passing days and optional defense. In winning their last nine games heading into Sunday’s against Indianapolis, they have demonstrated an aptitude for denying points and running the ball — which, if one has monitored their travails over the last decade, has more or less been an organizational mission statement. What distinguishes these Texans from their forebears that tried and failed to upend the A.F.C. establishment is their confidence in their quarterback, a position that has bedeviled the city longer than the franchise. Watson’s combination of mobility, instincts and passing acumen places Houston in scoring position anywhere on the field, though he has honed his recognition not to force a big play at the expense of a wiser decision. Through 12 games, Watson has not surpassed his performance from last season, when he set a record by throwing for 19 touchdowns across his first seven games, so much as he has certified his capacity for growth in an unforgiving league. A year later, Watson is completing more passes to his teammates (66.5 percent to 61.8) and fewer to his opponents (2.5 percent interception rate to 3.9). His highlights are littered with touch passes and pocket awareness and anticipatory mastery, like the 2nd-and-11 dart he fired before DeAndre Hopkins had slipped past a lurking linebacker last Sunday against Cleveland. Only Drew Brees has thrown more touchdown passes (20) in the red zone without an interception than Watson (17), who has committed only two turnovers total in the last six games. Watson is thriving in ways obvious and understated, and the totality of his evolution has left opponents dazed. “I’m really just doing what I do: playing smart within the system, protecting the ball and getting wins,” Watson said outside the Texans’ locker room Wednesday before practice. “But I don’t put limits on myself. I don’t compare myself to anybody else. If that’s being the best ever who played this game, I can be as good as I want to be.” Already Watson, 23, is the best quarterback to play in Houston since Warren Moon helmed the old Oilers with distinction. The successors who have moseyed through here over the past 25 years, with the Oilers and later the Texans, read like grand marshals at the Backup Day Parade: Billy Joe Tolliver, Cody Carlson, Brian Hoyer, Brock Osweiler, and on it goes. The four times the Texans reached the playoffs since their inception in 2002, their defense propelled them in and their offense knocked them out. The arrival of Watson, after Houston traded up to draft him at No. 12 over all in 2017, enchanted a city and transformed the organization. “He just has this aura, this presence, about him,” said his backup Brandon Weeden, who spent training camp in 2017 with the Texans and rejoined them in March. “Every time he called a play, you thought it was going to be a big one.” Watson seized the starting job after replacing Tom Savage in last season’s opener, beginning a spree that captivated the league. He belonged to the Texans, and he was all theirs — until he wasn’t. Four days after accounting for 469 yards and 4 touchdowns in a loss at Seattle, Watson rolled right in practice and crumpled, untouched, his right knee shredded. That night, Quincy Avery, his private quarterback tutor and a dear friend, flew in. Even now, Avery remembers how calm Watson seemed. Happy, even. Having endured the same injury once before — he tore his left anterior cruciate ligament at Clemson — Watson understood the rehab process. The bad days did not discourage him. The good days reassured him. “Every situation,” Watson said, “I knew and expected.” The familiarity helped him compartmentalize, focusing on his recovery but also football. Reviewing his game film from last season, Watson noted how some passes missed by mere inches. His feet, at times, spread too wide, causing his head to bob. His chest and head tended to tilt, duping him into perceiving the target was moving more than it was. “When the dude got off-schedule a bit,” Avery said, “his throwing motion would be a little different each time.” Watson set about improving his balance and posture so that he would release from the same platform every time, whether throwing in rhythm or after eluding defenders. Achieving that consistency has enhanced his credentials as a passer. “We love running quarterbacks because there’s not a lot of them, and when you find one like Deshaun, we become engulfed in that,” said the former N.F.L. quarterback Dan Orlovsky, now an analyst for ESPN. “But we forget that he’s really a ridiculous quarterback who happens to be married with incredible athleticism rather than somebody who’s a great athlete that just happens to be able to throw.” In the Texans’ first five games, Watson threw a lot — 192 times in all — and opponents pummeled him. He faced pressure on 45.7 percent of his dropbacks, second only to Josh Rosen of Arizona during that span, according to Pro Football Focus. Out of necessity, the Texans adapted. Their 20-13 victory against Buffalo on Oct. 14 heralded a philosophical shift. Since then, Houston has attempted the fewest passes in the N.F.L. From studying the Texans, Orlovsky has detected more presnap motions and dual play-action to slow defensive linemen. The Texans’ rushing success has amplified their commitment to play-action passing, and in those circumstances over their last seven games Watson ranks among the league’s best in passer rating, yards per attempt and touchdown passes, according to PFF. Now and beyond, the Texans accept their responsibility to optimize Watson without exposing him to unnecessary danger, a task quarterbacks coach Sean Ryan described as “a happy challenge.” In their parlance, they remind him to recognize when the journey’s over — to duck, slide, fling the ball away, do whatever necessary to evade contact instead of initiate it, as he did in a Week 5 win against Dallas that battered him with a broken rib and a partly collapsed lung. Rather than rest, Watson started the next game against the Bills. Rather than stay back when doctors advised him against flying to Jacksonville, Watson traveled there in a luxury bus, 12 hours each way. “He could have protected his future,” cornerback Johnathan Joseph said. “We all have a career and agents in your ear, financial people, family members. He made the decision to play, and that will always just stick with me.” For Weeden, the takeaway from that afternoon materialized midway through the first quarter. On 1st-and-10 from the Houston 20, the Jaguars’ pass rush collapsed the pocket, and Watson escaped, staggering backward. Steadying himself, he bolted toward the Texans’ sideline, beating two defenders there to avoid a hit. The evidence had been mounting for weeks, but for Weeden it crystallized right then and there. With that scramble, Watson had ceased being a quarterback returning from a severe injury. He was just Deshaun Watson, the Texans’ quarterback savior, capable of anything and everything yet again.",The New York Times
2018,The Last of the Old-School Cabaret Artists,"Steve Ross will always sing ‘Always.’ A certain Cole Porter tune still gives him a frisson. The entertainer, who could very well be the last of a dying breed, has devoted himself to the Great American Songbook since the 1960s. Here’s why. In the mid-20th century, cabaret clubs in the city made glamorous interiors, virtuosic singers, and beloved standards available to anybody with pocket money. Before they were stars, performers like Barbra Streisand and Harry Belafonte played rooms of just a few dozen tables. Cover charges were infrequent, so middle-class couples could make up much of the audience, according to “Intimate Nights: The Golden Age of New York Cabaret,” by James Gavin. This enchanted world has largely vanished. Cabaret persists, but mostly as a passion project or side gig, and often with quite a different musical repertory. Only a handful of performers still make a career out of interpreting the Great American Songbook on a small stage in a smoking jacket or a sequined dress. But if anyone can still conjure cabaret’s glory days, it’s Steve Ross. Now 80, Mr. Ross remains devoted to playing Cole Porter and wearing bow ties. He continues to accompany himself on the piano, the same way he did every night at the Algonquin Hotel’s Oak Room from 1981 to 1984. This was the era when Mr. Ross was known as “the Crown Prince of Manhattan’s piano bars.” His act has drawn the likes of Stephen Sondheim, Tennessee Williams, Ethel Merman and Lauren Bacall. “He sings songs we’ve known all our lives, but he makes me listen to them as though I’ve never heard them before,” Mr. Gavin said. Ross’s next gig will be at Birdland, in Midtown Manhattan on Dec. 17 and 18. He will perform songs from his new holiday album, along with some standards. This is an edited and condensed version of a recent conversation with him. Q. You probably play more music from the 1930s, when you were born, than from the ’50s and ’60s, when you were young and rock ’n’ roll became popular. What drew you to cabaret instead of rock? A. I started off with one of my great loves, which is ragtime. Ragtime had a big vogue in the early ’60s. Then I worked in cocktail lounges and nice hotels. I played standards and show tunes. You’re looking at someone that time passed by. The ’60s with all the turmoil — I was aware of them but I didn’t play much of the Beatles or Dylan. It just wasn’t my style. The ’30s was the gold mine. I will always play “Always.” I think it says something perfectly. When I play “Night and Day,” I still get a little frisson. How did you get established in New York? I went into the seminary for a couple of years. That didn’t work out. I was in the army. Then I was in Washington, playing at a couple of bars, not particularly focused. I was going to therapy. When I noticed the therapist was dozing off, I thought perhaps the time had come for me to make a move in my life. So I took my $200 or whatever it was and found a room on West 76th for $35. That was in 1968. I gave myself a minimum. I said, “If I go below this money in my hand, I'll have to go and work as a clerk or something.” I signed up for a temp agency job. And I was going to a gay bar called the Candy Store on West 56th Street, which served very bad Italian food — a lot of the gay bars in those days had Mafia connections — but it had a wonderful pianist. The guy running the bar said, “Would you like a job?” Because I had sat in for the pianist a few times. I said, “Yeah!” The next day I was supposed to go down to Wall Street and file in as a clerk. I just nicked it, and never had to do anything but music. Your first big job was at a club called Backstage. It is revered among cabaret aficionados. What made it so special? The guy who ran it was very flamboyant but a very canny businessman, Ted Hook. He had danced in Vegas and in the movies. He wanted to open this theatrical restaurant. He knew everybody. This was the late ’70s. Many of the great stars were still around. He had the very clever idea to meld the public and the stars — everybody wants to see stars and celebrities and all that. He was very lavish in giving drinks to all the people who were in the shows. It was a big, big step for me, because all these stars would come up and sing. Would you accompany them on the piano? Oh, yes. I remember Ginger Rogers coming up. She was there for the 50th anniversary of “Girl Crazy.” She still looked great. I said, “Oh, Mrs. Rogers, what would you like to sing?” She said, “Well, I think I should sing ‘Embraceable You,’ don’t you?” I said, “Yes. What is your key?” All I can remember is this beautifully manicured finger. “You know, I don’t know my key, but this is my high note.” Bong! She played it. “You figure it out.” What does it take to master the Great American Songbook? Well, you know Mabel Mercer always said, “I look at the lyric first.” And that’s what I do, too. If the lyric is a strong one, or if I can connect with the ideas in that lyric, then even if the music is not up to it, you can kind of make the music work. These lyricists — you have Yip Harburg and Ira Gershwin and Cole Porter — they wrote with great meticulousness, with great art and great craft. And I am honored to serve them. That’s how I really feel. I am a song ambassador. Was there someone in New York who took you under his or her wing? I found my own way. I played in these bars. I met people, they suggested songs and little by little my repertory got better. I realized that the personalization of the song was the key. If I sing “Over the Rainbow,” it’s my singing with my life and my voice and my experience. I’ve never been intimidated by that. There was, however, a rather tense moment in one of these bars. I love Janis Joplin because I love funky blues. I thought she was just so raw and terrific. So I said, “I guess if I sing it truthfully, I could sing a Janis Joplin song.” That was my theory. I tried and got halfway through “Piece of my Heart.” The audience looked around like, “What are you doing?” So I went back to Cole Porter. Are there new cabaret performers you admire? I heard a fantastic cabaret act two nights ago at 54 Below. It was Christian Holder. He was a dancer and then became a singer and cabaret act. The chances that he took — he sang a lot of songs we all know — and he made those songs totally part of his story. I continue to be impressed and inspired by audacity. Are there popular misconceptions about traditional cabaret music among young people? If I do a college class, I’m always tickled by the fact that young people have never heard someone sit at a piano and sing a funny song. They know about scabrous humor, and they know about really funky humor from the comedy clubs, and the shock humor. But to hear someone with wordplay and situational, non-X-rated humor — they are delighted that they are amused by it. When I perform in London, I’m always gratified to see that there tends to be a younger crowd, because there’s a sense of occasion in the culture. And it’s a verbal culture, which is why I was drawn to England in the first place. What are your favorite spots in New York? There is some fantastic urban lighting of skyscrapers in Midtown. Have you noticed that? When you light all their details, these buildings become temples. The Landmark Tavern is a great place. You’ll want to visit it — the wood-burning fireplace. It’s from the 1860s. Of course one laments some changes, but you have to be careful about that. There’s a wonderful line in a Noël Coward song called “I Went to a Marvelous Party”: “We talked about growing old gracefully And Elsie, who’s 74 Said, ‘A) It’s a question of being sincere And B) if you’re supple you’ve nothing to fear Then she swung upside down from a glass chandelier.” There is a great kernel of truth in that.",The New York Times
2018,The Latest Showdown Over a Shutdown,"Listen and subscribe to our podcast from your mobile device: Via Apple Podcasts | Via RadioPublic | Via Stitcher President Trump seemed poised to avoid a government shutdown and to carry his fight for a border wall into 2019, when the House will be controlled by Democrats. Then he shot down the spending deal. So what happened? Also, to cap off a chaotic day of breaking news, Jim Mattis resigned as secretary of defense. On today’s episode: Jonathan Weisman, the deputy Washington editor of The New York Times. Background reading: After President Trump refused to sign a stopgap bill to keep the government funded into February, House Republicans pushed through legislation that included $5.7 billion for a border wall. But the measure is almost certain to fail in the Senate. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis stepped down in protest of President Trump’s decision to withdraw American forces from Syria, a move that was praised by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. “Because you have the right to have a secretary of defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position,” Mr. Mattis wrote in his resignation letter.

2018,The Laundromat Is Hot!,"noted Fashion is subliminally telling us that it’s a dirty business. A few weeks ago, Jeremy Foster, a photographer, and Marikh Mathias, a model and former contestant on “The Bachelor,” were riding around Salt Lake City, looking for a place to do an Instagram photo shoot. The mountains were a 10-minute drive away, but it was raining that day. A coffee shop is a reliable backdrop, but Mr. Foster finds them too crowded and overly photographed. Instead, the pair ended up at 4th Street Coin Laundry, where Ms. Mathias sat in an orange plastic chair and stood in high-heels and designer jeans in front of a Speed Queen commercial washing machine. In their choice of setting, the photographer and model were right on trend. Yes, it seems your corner suds shop has become a strangely coveted location. For its fall 2018 campaign, Balmain, the French luxury brand, photographed the model Duckie Thot in a laundromat. Madewell recently used a laundromat to shoot a social media video for its jeans. And G-Star RAW took over an old-school laundromat to launch the brand’s G-Star Elwood X25 jeans during New York Fashion Week a few seasons back. Hermès went even further last year, when the house known for its five- or even six-figure Kelly and Birkin bags opened its own pop-up laundromat in New York. Hermèsmatic, as the space was called, featured washing machines and laundry carts in signature orange, and a free service to dip-dye scarves (which are … not washable). Why has a place associated with domestic toil suddenly become chic? Dawn Nagle, the vice president of marketing for Laundrylux, the distributor of Electrolux commercial machines in North America, said it’s about juxtaposition. “It’s that contrast between the beautiful and elegant fashion with the everyday task of washing clothes,” Ms. Nagle said. “You have a background of machines, granite, stainless steel, and everything repeats. It really draws your attention to the model and the outfit.” And of course, laundromats are instantly recognizable, open to all and found everywhere. It’s the rare chore you can’t outsource to your phone, and in cities like New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, the laundromat is one of the last democratic zones. Perhaps that’s why on Instagram the #laundromatshoot has replaced the national park as the influencer backdrop du jour. A visual language has already established itself. There’s the sitting-in-a-laundry-cart pose; the casually-leaning-on-the-dryers; the risky crawl-inside-the-washer; and the hey-it’s-laundry-day-and-all-I-have-left-to-wear-is-my-bra. A group of dancers even went into a “heavy spin cycle” at a laundromat in Miami. Mr. Foster was drawn to the Salt Lake City laundromat because it had big street-facing windows that let in natural light, a neutral interior and a vintage vibe. “It’s a fun place to be that’s also not crazy-distracting,” he said. “And where do you find ’70s bowling chairs?” Another reason laundromats may now be modish is that they have become more than just laundromats, at least in a few cities. Places like Spin Laundry Lounge in Portland, Ore., Laundré in San Francisco, Laundry City in Baltimore and Celsious in Brooklyn have been consciously designed as not just places to drop your wash but community gathering spots. They offer amenities like Wi-Fi, food and coffee, attentive customer service, eco-friendly machines and bright, clean environments where if you drop a garment on the floor, you won’t want to rewash it. One of the consequences of creating an inviting laundromat is that it becomes overrun by Instagrammers, said Ariana Roviello, the owner of Laundré. “There are tons of bloggers that come in that don’t even do laundry,” Ms. Roviello said. “They get a coffee and do a photo shoot in the back. You obviously want the exposure. But it’s a tricky thing. People are there doing laundry, going, ‘Why are all these people here?’ I’m always, like, ‘Please don’t sit in the laundry carts. They’re not made for your weight.’” Blame this folly on Corinna and Theresa Williams, the owners of Celsious, in Williamsburg. Before their laundromat opened last year in a cheerful, high-ceilinged space with a mezzanine cafe, the sisters posed in a laundry cart in Vogue. “It’s a cute picture,” Corinna said. Said Theresa: “Such a mistake. Now everyone is recreating it.” Like Ms. Roviello, the Williamses opened their laundromat because, as Corinna put it, they “couldn’t fathom how a place where you went to get your clothes clean could be so not clean”; how otherwise demanding urbanites “accept it as the status quo.” Sitting in the lofted cafe as the machines spun down below, Corinna offered a simpler explanation for why laundromats, the grungy and the upscale, have become a setting for high-style shoots. “Fashion is laundry,” she said.",The New York Times
2018,The Legacy of George Bush,"Listen and subscribe to our podcast from your mobile device: Via Apple Podcasts | Via RadioPublic | Via Stitcher George Bush rode the Reagan revolution to the White House, where he had one of the highest approval ratings of any president, and where he successfully oversaw the end of the Cold War.

Many view Mr. Bush as emblematic of an approach to public life that has given way to the politics of polarization under President Trump.

2018,The Littlest Epicures,"For a certain set of urban parents and entrepreneurs, Kraft mac and cheese is just not going to cut it. Last week in a sprawling apartment overlooking the Hudson River in New York, about 10 women sat at a dining room table eating avocado toast and tasting baby food. With children on laps, latched to breasts or in utero, they had come together to discuss parenting and nutrition. The babies babbled. The adults bantered. (“Everyone I know imports their formula from Europe.” “I know a lot of adults who swear by charcoal in juice, but I wouldn’t recommend it for kids.”) Everyone nibbled. “When you raise your kids, you want them to be like you but a better you,” said Angela Sutherland, a mother of two, ages 4 and 2. She wants her children to value what she does about family, community and the environment. “I want them to have the same taste buds too,” she said. Ms. Sutherland, 35, and Evelyn Rusli, 34, a former reporter for The New York Times, are the founders of a new line of baby food, Yumi (“From Farm to Highchair”). It is high on nutrients and spices, low on fructose and free of gluten. Ms. Rusli and Ms. Sutherland have created a business based on the research of doctors and nutritionists who stress the importance of what children eat in their first 1,000 days. Yumi purées are sent in weekly installments in 4.5-ounce jars filled with buckwheat-infused kabocha squash and quinoa-fortified kale and pears; they cost about $5 each. Started last year in Los Angeles, the company has become a darling of parents who take organic food and Instagram posts seriously. Yumi is now available to New York babies. To celebrate its new market, it hosted this breakfast at the home of Marissa Vosper, who has a 22-month-old son. Luke Marano, 19 months, is one of Yumi’s new East Coast eaters. His mother, Mari Agory, a model and entrepreneur, wasn’t sure he would like it when she began to receive the jars gratis as part of a promotion. “Luke has always been a foodie and has never really liked purée,” Ms. Agory said. “From the age of 4 months, we would give him the skin of smoked whitefish with the fat on it and he would just demolish it.” She has started him on Yumi, and the baby has taken to it. “He’s completely obsessed with the bell pepper,” said Ms. Agory, looking glamorous despite having given birth to a second son eight weeks ago. Nash Neidich, 1, has been eating Yumi for more than a quarter of his life. Five months ago his mother, Alessandra Brawn, began having the baby food delivered to her in hotels in Los Angeles, a city she visits frequently. “I was very nervous he wouldn’t like it,” Ms. Brawn said. “There are very expansive flavors like cumin and chia seeds, things that are complicated for an adult palate, let alone an infant’s.” Strewn on the table were jars of Yumi products such as mulligatawny, made from carrots, coconut milk, apple, lentils, chickpeas, turmeric and curry powder. Ms. Brawn sat at the table feeding her son a berry mash and tiny forkfuls of avocado, but then Nash had to dash early for music class. Yumi is one of several companies trying to cultivate a new generation of foodies. Eat2explore is another. It was created by Rowena Scherer, 50, who had an aha moment after taking a family cooking class while traveling in Thailand. “I realized my kids couldn’t even dice or chop vegetables, and I knew it was because I do everything for them,” said Ms. Scherer, who used to work in finance. She suspected that if her children were more involved in the preparation of different dishes, they would be more likely to try them as well. As a child in Malaysia, Ms. Scherer said, she and her family would cook lunch together each Sunday, letting her also practice what she learned in home economics class. “Because I had a familiarity in the kitchen and good knife skills, I had a lot of independence as a teenager. Cooking is a life skill, and we are not longer preparing our own kids in this way.” Her company sells country-themed boxes (Brazil, Ethiopia, Lebanon). They cost about $20 to $25 and include nonperishable sauces and spices, three recipes that are local to the country, as well as maps and cards that explain why certain flavors and dishes are important to the particular culture. The meals are meant to be cooked by children with help from a parent. “If you make something with your own hands, you are much more likely to try it and over time you will develop your palate,” Ms. Scherer said. In Brooklyn, two longtime food writers and editors who have long preached the importance of passing cooking skills to children are now putting their money where their mouths are. “It was ironic that food has never been as trendy as it is today and yet families are cooking less and less at home with their kids,” said Dana Bowen, 46, the former executive editor of Saveur and Food and Wine magazines. Last summer, she and Sara Kate Gillingham, 43, a James Beard Award-winning writer, opened the Dynamite Shop. During weeklong summer sessions, children learned knife skills and about the cultural significance of foods in the kitchen before producing a pop-up restaurant experience for their parents. This fall, students have signed up for weekly after-school sessions that culminate in them bringing home dinner for their families after each class. Wilson Rumble, 12, started taking classes at the Dynamite Shop early this fall and now knows how to whip up guacamole — and that vegetables “can be cooked with certain ingredients to make them taste less like vegetables,” he said. Kristin Earhart, Wilson’s mother, has a 15-month-old daughter as well. Between work and taking care of the baby, Ms. Earhart has struggled to get dinner ready by the time Wilson gets hungry. She heard about the Dynamite Shop and was surprised by her son’s enthusiasm. “I was excited,” Wilson said. “I wanted to cook fine meals.” He had always hated butter, but at the Dynamite Shop he was encouraged to make compound butter by adding spices to it that he likes. Then he slathered it all over a sweet potato that he baked and gobbled the whole thing. At home, he has been helping his mother in the kitchen. “It makes things go much smoother when you have a sous chef,” Ms. Earhart said. “And one day, probably not too long from now, I’ll be his.”",The New York Times

2018,The Long Path From My Desk to Clint Eastwood’s ‘The Mule’,"Times Insider When I started reporting on an octogenarian drug mule, I had no idea it would inspire a Hollywood film. Leo Sharp in May 2014 at his day-lily farm in Indiana.CreditCreditEugene Richards for The New York Times Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. It started, as so many things now do, with a tweet. I was in the Times newsroom mindlessly scrolling through Twitter when I spotted a headline, one of those News of the Weird police blotter items. I clicked. “An 89-year-old Indiana man who grows lilies pleaded guilty Tuesday in Detroit to serving as a drug mule to distribute more than 1,400 pounds of cocaine.” Ding ding ding! I sat upright in my chair. Now that’s a sentence. I felt like a 19th-century miner emerging from a cave with a fleck of gold in my dirt-caked hand. I emailed my brother, who is also a writer and thus spends a good chunk of his day scrolling through Twitter. “I would read a magazine story about this guy,” I wrote. And then I thought, I should write a magazine story about this guy. My reporting for The New York Times Magazine on the rise and fall of Leo Sharp, the day-lily farmer turned geriatric drug mule, took me to packed courtrooms, seedy stash houses, an abandoned day-lily farm and the cluttered office of overworked federal investigators. And despite a zeal for the story that bordered on obsession, I never had the imagination to think, Clint Eastwood should make a Clint Eastwood movie about this guy. And yet here we are. “The Mule” opens December 14 with Clint Eastwood directing and starring. (Bradley Cooper co-stars, along with Laurence Fishburne and Dianne Wiest.) Who says Twitter is a waste of time? I spent months trying to understand how Mr. Sharp, a grandfather and World War II veteran, wound up working for the Sinaloa drug cartel. I interviewed dozens of his acquaintances and customers — both the cocaine and the day-lily kind — and after I asked them everything I could think of, I asked who else I should call to learn more. I became a student of the drug trade and the cat-and-mouse game played by the Drug Enforcement Administration and the cartels. I read transcripts of wiretapped Spanish conversations — the cartel’s nickname for Mr. Sharp was Tata, slang for Grandpa — and pored through brittle copies of his decades-old day-lily catalogs. I spent hours with the investigators who chased and eventually caught Mr. Sharp. I walked through Detroit stash houses — anonymous, squat buildings with shuttered grates, utterly forgettable if not for the massive drug deals that happened inside. I drove to see Mr. Sharp’s overgrown day-lily farm, squatting in the grass to read the dirty labels for the special breeds he had once so carefully nurtured. I remember one label said, simply, Happiness. I watched every frame of the police video of Mr. Sharp’s arrest — “What’s going on, officer?” — like it was the Zapruder film. And yet, as a journalist, I was never able to crack Leo Sharp. I spent months chasing the central question at the center of my story: Why did he do it? Was he a dupe? Was he a con man? Was he a criminal mastermind? I have my theories. But journalism can take you only so far. We can write only what we know — that’s one of the beautiful principles of the craft. Our characters are real people: complicated, contradictory, mysterious, surprising. They spring from the messy tangle of the lived world, which means some of the questions we ponder — like, what ran through Mr. Sharp’s mind that first time he packed his truck with cocaine? — can’t ever really be answered. Even with all my reporting, I couldn’t fully tell you what motivated Mr. Sharp. I don’t think anyone could, not even Leo Sharp himself. That’s where Hollywood stepped in. Movie producers read my article, saw a spark and eventually sent it to Nick Schenk, a gifted screenwriter. From there, Mr. Schenk ran with it on his own, inventing an elaborate back story for the elderly drug mule, complete with a resentful daughter, a guilty conscience and a predilection for pecan pie. Fiction filled in the spaces where journalism could not go. Along the way, Mr. Schenk and his producers were generous enough to share drafts of the script with me and to indulge me in listening to my thoughts about the world of drug mules. But “The Mule” is Mr. Schenk’s and Mr. Eastwood’s story. It goes well beyond the limits of my reporter’s notebook, as it should. Leo Sharp died several years after I wrote my story. I met him only once. Outside the courtroom on the day of his sentencing I saw him sitting on a bench, hunched over and staring blankly at the wall. He looked older and more frail than I had imagined. I walked over and introduced myself to this man with crepe paper skin in an ill-fitting jacket, so removed from the sly, charming, audacious swindler I had been chasing for months. I looked in his eyes — watery and red-rimmed — and realized I had reached the end of my reporting. That’s where, some five years later, Clint Eastwood and Nick Schenk added a twinkle to the drug mule’s smile; and more embroidery, plus lots more star wattage, to the strange and jagged story I set out to tell. I cannot wait to see it. Keep up with Times Insider stories on Twitter, via the Reader Center: @ReaderCenter.",The New York Times
2018,The Magic of the Food Gift Swap ,"In holiday season exchanges, like the one organized through Food52, strangers give edible gifts and receive a sense of connection. Opening a package of homemade food mailed by a stranger and eating the contents seems like the last thing anyone would want to do at a time when distrust and fear seem woven into our national psyche. But that’s just what Liz Larkin, 52, who runs a home-baking business in Pound Ridge, N.Y., intends to do this month, when she’ll ship off a box of cookies and scones to someone she has never met while she waits for another person to send her a box filled with gifts from the kitchen. “It sounds a little weird, right?” Ms. Larkin said. “But connecting with a stranger like this is just a cool thing to do. Doing good is kind of contagious.” Like many cooks who turn to food as a gift, she knows the magic that can come from trading something delicious and homemade with another cook. But neighborhood cookie swaps and even more informal exchanges are increasingly hard to find. A hunger for that kind of relationship was part of what drew Ms. Larkin to the holiday food exchange organized through the website Food52, in which cooks swap boxes filled with homemade treats and hand-selected gifts. This year, 1,107 people from 15 countries have signed on, a record for the effort. Since it started eight years ago, the swap has kindled enduring friendships and, for some, has become their favorite holiday tradition. Adrienne Kerrigan, a food writer in Seattle, has been a devotee of the exchange for years. Five years ago, she was randomly matched with someone who discovered through the swap organizer that Ms. Kerrigan was about to have a newborn. So he and his partner packed up a swaddling blanket and a frozen container of something they called “apples cooked forever.” The couple included a note explaining that they had fed the long-cooked apples to their own baby. That batch became one of the first solid foods Ms. Kerrigan fed hers. Then there was the woman from St. Paul who sent Nina Wladkowski a box of wild rice and maple syrup, along with some gifts from her garden that included shallots, sweet potatoes and the only five peanuts she had managed to coax from the ground that year. “The fact that she couldn’t grow that many peanuts but she decided to sent the entire little harvest to a stranger in Alaska really touched me,” said Ms. Wladkowski, 29, who works in the advertising department at The Anchorage Daily News. She shipped back a jar of homemade jam and a thank-you note. “People always talk about food bringing people together, but this kind of broadens that table to a national and international table,” she said. The Food52 swap started as a procrastination project for Noëlle Bittner, who was studying evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona in Tucson. When she wanted to avoid studying, Ms. Bittner would dip into the nascent Food52 website, which she discovered in 2010, when it was more a small community of like-minded cooks exchanging recipes than the full-blown cooking and retail site it is today. She watched as the site’s regulars organized gatherings of food-minded people in New York, and longed for some of that camaraderie. Around the same time, she stumbled across the Secret Santa exchange that Reddit, the website with a collection of more than a million online communities, had started a couple of years earlier. Food packages — like Russian chocolate, vegan snack packs and plenty of coffee and tea — are only some of the gifts traded among the tens of thousands of people who participate in that exchange. Why not try a similar thing, she thought, but with people who really want to cook for one another? She posted her idea on Food52. About 110 people responded, and Ms. Bittner matched them by hand. Now, the exchange has grown so big she has added spreadsheets and written software to coordinate the pairings, which are random. She won’t be swayed by people who are lobbying to be matched with gift-givers who are known to send fabulous packages, or who are in a nearby ZIP code. She makes exceptions for people who live outside the United States — trying, for example, to keep people in Europe or Canada together — or who have specific dietary needs. “Like, I try to match gluten-free people with gluten-free people,” she said. The packages, which must be shipped by Dec. 10, are supposed to have a value of $25, whether in actual dollars, or the time and effort to make them. Ms. Bittner advises swappers to “gift as you would like to be gifted.” Many go overboard, using the little bit of information they have about their intended recipient as a conduit to deeper online investigations, so they can send a superior package. Photos of the gifts are posted on Instagram, where they serve as both inspiration and fodder for commentary. The feed is filled with pictures of pickled jalapeños, loaves of marbled rye, cardamom shortbread, pistachio jaggery brittle, bourbon balls and brownies. Dorie Greenspan’s World Peace Cookies are popular. Homesick New Yorkers even get bagels. There aren’t many complaints, and there have been no conflicts that have exploded into online flames, Ms. Bittner said. A few people have written in because they received a store-bought gift or felt their package was underwhelming in some other way. She tells them that is the nature of the exchange, and suggests tolerance. “A lot of the time when people get premade gifts, it’s usually because someone had a last-minute family emergency,” she said. “I think people are receptive that life can be complicated.” Participants are encouraged to donate $5 to a charity. This year, it’s Action Against Hunger. They’ve raised about $12,600 so far. Food52 adds to the pot. Amanda Hesser, a former editor and columnist at The New York Times who founded Food52 with Merrill Stubbs (both of whom participate in the swap), said the project stands out in an age where so much of life plays out online. “There’s something thrilling about receiving a box of goodies from a stranger, who has taken time to bake their favorite cookie recipe for you and package it up with pickles from a local maker or a wooden spoon carved by their uncle,” she said. The same ethos drives local food swaps, which started to rise up about a decade ago along with the do-it-yourself food culture, said Emily Paster, a preserve-maker and blogger who wrote the 2016 book “Food Swap: Specialty Recipes for Bartering, Sharing & Giving — Including the World’s Best Salted Caramel Sauce.” Ms. Paster started a food-swap group in Chicago in 2011; it hosts a much-anticipated holiday gift swap in December. People show up to trade homemade limoncello and vanilla extract, or packages of custom soup mixes and holiday candies. People often ask her if exchanging food with strangers is safe. “I say, ‘Well, the good news is you get to talk to the person before you trade food, but of course you don’t know what they are doing in their kitchen,’” she said. “‘But if you go to a church potluck, you don’t know what they’re doing, either.’” The beauty of exchanging homemade food, she said, is getting to know other people who value making food from scratch as much as you do. Although it’s too late to sign up for this year’s Food52 swap (you can sign up for next year’s here), it’s not too late to organize a little holiday food swap with your own friends or family. Edible gift exchanges ease the financial pressure of giving, and can help build community and good will. And the stakes are lower with a box of chai-tea eggnog cookies than with a sweater. “People buy you expensive gifts that bomb, and then what do you do?” Ms. Paster said. “At least you know a food gift was made with love, and you can always put it in the compost.” Recipes: Christmas and Holiday Food Gift Ideas Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

2018,The Man Behind the Times Square Ball,"Tom Brennan, who comes from a working-class family in a small Irish town, is the master artisan in charge of the most famous crystal ball in the world. For much of the past 111 years, the sparkling New Year’s Eve Times Square ball has been a signal for the 1.2 billion people watching it across the globe to dance, cheer, blow their horns, and embrace. It has become such a touchstone that it almost seems like another year can’t start without it. The ball is the product of the Times Square Alliance and Waterford Crystal, the Irish company that’s been maintaining the 2,688 crystal-paneled orb for 19 years. The man entrusted with the crystal, Tom Brennan, 48, takes his role so seriously, that he starts working on next year’s ball in January. “We have a glass of champagne,” he said, “take a week off, and then start improving it for next year.” Mr. Brennan grew up in Waterford, a small Viking town in the southeast of Ireland — and home of the crystal company — with a current population of 47,000 people. His father was a master glass blower for 30 years, and he used to run around the factory as a child watching him work. In 1986, when he was 16, he started to learn the craft. He recalled making a port glass as his first project. “With my uneducated eye it looked great,” he said. “But then they did a quality check, and I realized the part you hold in your hand was all lopsided.” Mr. Brennan has improved since then. Five years ago he was promoted to the role of master artisan. With his new title came responsibility for the famous ball. “I still can’t believe this huge thing that the world watches comes out of my small hometown,” he said. This is an edited and condensed version of a recent conversation with him. Q. Tell us something we don’t know about the ball. A. In the past the ball would have the same pattern every year. But six years ago we decided to introduce themes. We wanted to give people a simple message that they could think about for just one day or one hour. In 2014, the first year, the theme was imagination. Then it was fortitude, wonder, kindness, and serenity. For 2019 the theme is harmony. Of course it’s a marketing message, but I try to personalize it. I’ve been thinking about what it means to my work/life balance and to my wife and kids. The ball is 12 feet in diameter and weighs 11,875 pounds. It’s a physical feat. How does it get made? The entire ball doesn’t get remade every year. This year, only 192 panels with the new theme were replaced. We make the panels the same way crystal has been made for 5,000 years, along with some updated technology. We take imported sands from all over the world — I’m not permitted to tell you which kinds — along with potash (a sort of fertilizer made from potassium chloride) and crushed crystal. We fire up the furnace to 2,400 degrees and heat the material. When it starts to look like this bright orange, yellow, toffee-like substance, we mold it. That creates a blank crystal panel. Then we hold it against this cutting wheel and groove it and shape it into the design we want. That’s when we cut the theme into it. The total process takes weeks and weeks. We have to make sure every piece is perfect. We don’t accept anything that is potentially flawed. It also takes a large team, hundreds and hundreds of people. You have the glassblowers, the glass cutters, the packaging engineers, the quality checkers, I can go on and on. How does the ball get to Times Square? It is kept at 1 Times Square (in the building with the Walgreens at the bottom.) We ship in the new panels on whatever airline is flying that day. We have special containers. Then they are kept in a secret location in New York City, and we make sure that they are completely guarded until they are ready to be used. This year, on Dec. 27, our engineers installed them onto the ball. Does anything ever go wrong? The panels have never not arrived; we plan it too carefully. But from time to time something breaks or there is a last minute quality check, so we always have some extra. I don’t think there is any person who has ever worked for Waterford who hasn’t had that moment when it’s like, you broke that beautiful vase or glass. Your heart stops for a moment. The first ball drop was in 1907. How has technology changed since then? The first ball was made of wood and steel and had 100 light bulbs installed over it. Now, behind the crystal panels, are 13,000 LED lights. We have this incredible team of engineers who designed a software program that creates billions of different light patterns. You can see the different colored lights flashing, circling, going in different directions. The ball is a celebrity in New York. Do you have any fun stories of people interacting with it? I’ll never forget one day when I was walking through the New York Stock Exchange with one of the crystal panels about to be installed onto the ball. There were traders everywhere in their jackets, and the monitors were all lit up with the stocks going up and down. But when word got around that there was a crystal panel on the trading floor, I was surrounded. They were all jumping around trying to take pictures with it. I think people get so excited about the ball because it’s like the changing of the guards. It’s out with the old, in with the new. And it’s crystal. The one thing that crystal is associated with is celebration.",The New York Times
2018,The Man Who Brought Leonardo and Galileo Into the 21st Century,"The Saturday Profile FLORENCE, Italy — Just Google, “10 greatest geniuses of all times,” and it is highly likely that two of the names on that list will be Leonardo da Vinci and Galileo Galilei. Now, think about what you would do if you were put in charge of bringing their legacy into the 21st century, in all its complexity, as neither man can be reduced to one simple label, say “artist” or “astronomer.” Both were proverbial, intellectually omnivorous Renaissance men. But that is the life’s work of Paolo Galluzzi, the longtime director of Florence’s Museo Galileo and former director of the Biblioteca Leonardiana, the research center dedicated to things Leonardo, who has successfully masterminded the conversion of the two analog geniuses into the digital age. Even though Professor Galluzzi, 76, has considerable hands-on experience tinkering with Leonardo and Galileo’s manifold machines and instruments (from reconstructions of Leonardo’s mechanical contraptions to Galileo’s real-life telescopes housed in the museum’s collection), one of his greatest achievements has been to cement their presence online. For the past two years, Galileo scholars and aficionados have been able to access all of the Tuscan prodigy’s manuscripts and the principal related scholarship through the search engine Galileo//thek@, a project developed through the museum. “It lets you find in seconds things that would take months to find by hand,” he said proudly. A similar search engine, Leonardo//thek@, is in the works for the other Tuscan genius and is expected to be in operation next spring. The two search engines will exponentially magnify the global reach of both Galileo and Leonardo, embodying one of Mr. Galluzzi’s driving aims: to widen access to knowledge. “This is a patrimony that should be universally available,” he said. When he was hired in 1982 as director of what was then known as the Institute and Museum of the History of Science, he inherited a staff of one and headquarters that occupied just one floor of the 11th-century Palazzo Castellani, adjacent to the Uffizi galley, one of Italy’s top tourist draws. By contrast, tourists merely trickled into the science museum. Today, the Galileo Museum, as it was renamed after a 2010 restoration, has doubled its floor space, draws around 300,000 visitors a year and produces specialized multimedia exhibitions that tour the world. For Mr. Galluzzi, the dawn of the internet age brought an epiphany of sorts. “Compared to the Uffizi, this little institution just couldn’t compete,” he said in an interview in his wood-paneled office. “But I had the impression that using these novel instruments, it was possible to create a new playing field in which we could grow.” Back in the 1990s he embraced what were then unfamiliar technologies with gusto (and not without some mishaps, he acknowledged, recalling the unreliability of the earliest data storage systems). The museum was the first in Italy to have its own website, in early 1995, “and not just a home page, there were contents too.” Today, it has more online viewers than the Uffizi, he boasted happily. “It’s certainly unique in Italy, and rare elsewhere, for a museum to have such a powerful digital presence,” he said. It strives to remain current. The catalog can be downloaded in PDF format and the museum can be ‘‘visited’’ by Google Street View, while an online virtual tour includes detailed descriptions of some 1,000 instruments. The mobile phone app does much the same, with the addition of videos on how things work. A significant number of the books in the institute’s library, one of the best in Europe on the history of science, are also available online, including most of the rare volumes and manuscripts on the early modern history of science and technology. In many ways, Mr. Galluzzi and the museum were traveling in two orbits destined to cross. After high school studies in the humanities, he studied philosophy at the University of Florence under the Renaissance scholar Eugenio Garin, obtaining a degree in the history of philosophy. He was one of the first students in Italy to specialize in the history of science, a discipline that had not been formally recognized at the time. His passion for Galileo dates back to then. “I received my degree in 1968, the years of student unrest, and Galileo was seen as a hero because of his battle for the autonomy of reason from the control of the church,” he said. His decades-old fascination with Leonardo, on the other hand, was a matter of “fate,” he said. After college, he was hired as director of the Biblioteca Leonardiana, in Vinci, the artist’s hometown. “If I hadn’t gotten the job, I probably would never have become a Leonardo scholar,” he said. “Maybe I would have studied Newton, or some other thinker.” It worked out well, in the end. “Leonardo is a prey that’s hard to capture, but then he fascinates you and completely engages you,” he said. Even as he navigated the Leonardo museum into a new era, he embarked on an academic career, teaching the history of science first at the University of Siena, then the University of Florence, interspersed with many short-term appointments at a number of universities: Harvard; Princeton; U.C.L.A.; the University of Hamburg; École des Haute Études in Paris; and the University of Toronto, to name a few. Under his guidance, the museum embarked on a new venture, pioneering the era of multimedia, interactive exhibits. Leonardo’s intricate musings on a host of contraptions were a good fit for this burgeoning project, and his sketches and drawings were brought to life on computer screens to show how they operated. “The first shows were very primitive compared to what we do today, but they were an indication of the path we were taking,” he said. The museum’s growing reputation began attracting young engineers. Currently, it invests a third of its budget, and a third of its staff, to information technology. One staff member’s sole task is guaranteeing long-term digital preservation, keeping up-to-date with new systems and moving data to new platforms when necessary. “We want to ensure that our archives will be accessible in 300 years,” Mr. Galluzzi said. “At first we thought that digital would last forever, but it turns out it’s much less durable than a book, which can last centuries,” he said, adding with a laugh: “Not to mention stone inscriptions.” His own library consists of more than 20,000 volumes, forcing him and his wife, Lynne, to maintain a large home, even after his two daughters moved out. He also collects wine, mostly French, and produces olive oil from trees in the grove of his country house near Vinci. From the start, the multimedia exhibits were crowd pleasers. “Engineers of the Renaissance,” toured the world’s major cities, while one Leonardo show in Tokyo drew around a million people in three months, he said. Mr. Galluzzi recently curated an exhibit of the Codex Leicester, Leonardo’s scientific writings, at the Uffizi Galleries. While he dismissed the knockoff exhibits of large-scale Leonardo machines now ubiquitous in Italian cities as commercial operations “done by people who couldn’t tell you when Leonardo was alive,” he conceded that the Uffizi show was rather, well, showy, with lots of scientific bells and whistles. “An exhibit isn’t like reading a book; it has to be fun and create emotions,” he said. “Naturally, if along with the emotions we are able to transmit a concept or two, the game becomes more interesting.” The director of the Uffizi, Eike Schmidt, described Mr. Galluzzi as the world’s most eminent scholar of Leonardo’s scientific writings, though Mr. Galluzzi admits his expertise does not extend to Leonardo’s artistic accomplishments. Authenticating paintings is “not my vocation,” he said. But he has collaborated with investigators trying to unmask the makers of fake copies of Sidereus Nuncius, Galileo’s observations on the cosmos. For a man who preaches the digital gospel, he still pens his scholarly writings by hand, he said, a self-described “hyper-corrective” with an old-school approach to writing. Typing got in the way of reflection and meditation, he said. “One of my privileges is that I have secretaries who type up my handwritten notes,” he said, smiling. After 36 years at the helm of the museum, Mr. Galluzzi is thinking about retirement. “I want to leave when I am still of sound mind and body,” to pursue independent research and study, he joked. His dance card is certainly booked. He serves on many committees, advisory boards and scientific commissions, and a year ago he was named president of the national committee marking the 500th anniversary of Leonardo’s death, which falls in 2019. But his true legacy is that of Leonardo and Galileo. “We are meteors that leave no trace,” he said, adding after a beat. “Unless you become Leonardo or Galileo.” Opinion",The New York Times

JOHN MARSHALL The Man Who Made the Supreme Court By Richard Brookhiser Illustrated. 324 pp. Basic Books. $30. A Republican president and Congress declare war on the federal courts, eliminating newly created judgeships and canceling the Supreme Court session so the court can’t meet for more than a year. The chief justice, who considers the president a populist demagogue, fears further attacks on judicial independence. The president accuses his former vice president of treason, and the chief justice presides over the trial himself, upholding a subpoena that requires the president to turn over relevant evidence. And after the vice president is acquitted, the chief justice leads a court that represents the last bastion of resistance to mob rule, defending the sanctity of contracts against attacks from populist presidents and the states, upholding the power of Congress to regulate the national economy and forcing the president and state courts to acknowledge the supremacy of the Constitution. Chief Justice John Marshall’s battles with Thomas Jefferson and then Andrew Jackson, the two populist presidents in question, seem freshly relevant in our age of renewed anxieties about the future of the American republic. And, as Richard Brookhiser’s fine new biography, “John Marshall,” makes clear, the polarization of the age of Marshall matched (or even surpassed) our current battles over the composition of the Supreme Court. What differed in Marshall’s day was the great chief’s ability to win over Republican justices appointed by his archrival, Thomas Jefferson, and to join him in a series of unanimous opinions. By persuading the justices to set aside their partisan differences and to speak in one voice, Marshall established the court as an emblem of bipartisan legitimacy in a polarized time. As Brookhiser’s compact and balanced account makes clear, Marshall famously transformed the judicial branch into one fully equal to the president and Congress in stature and legitimacy. And he did so by declining to pick political fights he couldn’t win in the short term while declaring broad constitutional principles that would shore up the authority of the courts in the long term. This narrative, familiar to law students, has certainly taken on new relevance in the age of Donald Trump, when battles between the president, the chief justice and the courts are once again provoking talk of constitutional crisis. Brookhiser, a senior editor of National Review and the author of several books on the founding fathers, draws no present-day parallels, but it’s impossible not to think of our current vexations when reviewing 19th-century Republican efforts to impeach Federalist judges. The House did indeed impeach a Federalist justice, Samuel Chase, for being “highly arbitrary, oppressive and unjust,” but after Marshall testified for Chase, the Senate acquitted him. Congress then expanded the size of the Supreme Court from six justices to seven, to give Jefferson the chance to fill vacancies with Republicans. But Marshall won over the Republican justices by convincing them of the court’s institutional legitimacy. At a time of tribalism and polarization, culminating in threats by the states to nullify federal laws and secede from the Union, Marshall’s central idea, shared with his Federalist heroes George Washington and Alexander Hamilton, was that “we the people” of the United States as a whole are sovereign and united, as opposed to “we the people” of the individual states. “Our Constitution is not a compact” of states, Marshall wrote in an anonymous pamphlet defending his own opinion upholding Congress’s power to charter the Bank of the United States. “It is the act of a single party. It is the act of [the] people of the United States.” (Abraham Lincoln invoked the same argument in denying the South’s power to secede from the Union.) In an opinion echoing Washington’s Farewell Address, which had defined the United States as “one people,” Marshall wrote an eloquent paean to national unity: “In war, we are one people. In making peace, we are one people. In all commercial regulations, we are one and the same people.” Insisting that America was a republic rather than a direct democracy, he criticized Jefferson as a proto-Trumpian demagogue: “His great power … is chiefly acquired by professions of democracy. Every check on the wild impulse of the moment is [therefore] a check on his own power. … He looks, of course, with an ill will at an independent judiciary.” Jefferson’s allies, led by Senator Richard Mentor Johnson of Kentucky, responded by proposing to attack judicial independence by limiting the tenure of federal judges, preventing the federal courts from hearing cases, making judges removable by Congress, allowing the Senate to overturn the Supreme Court and increasing the size of the court to 10 justices. Although Johnson was a populist legend for having killed the Shawnee chief Tecumseh, these proposals went nowhere because of the bipartisan unity on the court that Marshall managed to inspire. Could the Supreme Court under Chief Justice John Roberts, who has embraced Marshall as his model, play a similar unifying role in defending the Constitution against populist threats to judicial independence today? That depends on his fellow justices. And although Brookhiser’s biography reminds us that American politics has always been polarized, today the polarization threatens to transform the deliberations of the court. The life of Marshall reminds us of the urgent importance of Roberts’s efforts to persuade his colleagues to unite around a shared commitment to defending the legitimacy of the court by rising above partisan politics.",The New York Times
2018,The Market Is Worried. The Economy Is Strong. How Will the Fed React?,"WASHINGTON — The challenge confronting the Federal Reserve as it meets this week is a tale of two economies. Wall Street investors are behaving as if the economic expansion is in grave danger, while the best available data show that the American economy has continued to grow at a healthy pace. The disconnect is visible on other Wall Streets across the United States. Dorice Soroka, who runs a small company at Wall Street and Myrtle Lane in Daytona Beach, Fla., said her revenue has finally reached the level she last saw in 2006. “And that was unhealthy growth,” Ms. Soroka said of the years before the crisis. “This is much more healthy.” Peoples State Bank, on East Wall Street in Eagle River, Wis., also is prospering. “Our market areas remain economically healthy,” said Scott M. Cattanach, the president of PSB Holdings, which operates nine branches in central and northern Wisconsin. The bank recently reported that profits rose 28 percent in the third quarter, and demand for development loans remained strong in the fourth quarter. Katy Brooks, the president of the Bend, Ore., Chamber of Commerce — whose offices sit on Wall Street — said the region’s tech companies were trying to fill more than 400 vacancies. The Fed on Wednesday is widely expected to recognize the continued strength of the economy by announcing a quarter-point increase in its benchmark interest rate after a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. But the central bank also is expected to tip its hat to queasy investors by emphasizing that future rate increases will depend on continued economic growth. That would amount to an acknowledgment that 2018 has been a very good year on Wall Streets across the United States — but that there is growing reason to worry about the coming year. “While the domestic economy remains healthy, the external backdrop has worsened,” said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, referring to a recent weakening of international economic growth, particularly in Europe and China. Mr. Gapen said financial conditions in the United States had also tightened sufficiently for the Fed to worry about the broader economic effect. Equity markets jitterbugged on Tuesday, rising and falling and rising again. The S&P 500 stock index closed the day up 0.01 percent. Oil prices continued to fall, and President Trump renewed his Twitter attacks on the Fed, urging it “feel the market” and not make “yet another mistake.” The expected rate increase, which would lift the benchmark rate into a range between 2.25 and 2.5 percent, would mark the fifth consecutive quarter that the Fed has moved to raise borrowing costs. The benchmark rate now sits close to the bottom of what most Fed officials regard as a neutral zone in which the Fed would neither be encouraging nor discouraging economic activity. The Fed also will publish a set of economic projections by the members of the committee, which comprises the Fed’s board of governors and the presidents of the 12 regional reserve banks. In the last round of forecasts, published in September, most Fed officials predicted the central bank would raise rates three times in 2019. Shaving those predictions would underscore the Fed’s doubts about the economy’s trajectory. There is still a lot of good news. The economy has been expanding for almost a decade, the unemployment rate of 3.7 percent is the lowest in a half-century, job growth remains strong and wages are beginning to rise faster. Consumer spending, the primary form of economic activity in the United States, has been growing at a healthy pace, up 0.6 percent in October. “What we know about Main Street is they’re spending like banshees on Christmas stuff, and that’s because we’ve seen a real increase in wages at the low end of the spectrum,” said Diane Swonk, the chief economist at Grant Thornton. But the good news is not great news, at least by historical standards. Some economists see evidence that there is still considerable slack in the labor market, and it appears increasingly likely that inflation will fall short of the Fed’s 2 percent target for the seventh straight year. Ms. Swonk, who expects the Fed to raise rates on Wednesday, said the central bank was trying to strike a delicate balance by wrapping up its post-crisis campaign to stimulate the economy by holding down interest rates to encourage consumer and business borrowing. “There is good news, and that’s what the Fed is acknowledging by raising rates,” she said.“They don’t think that’s going to crush the economy.” The fragility of the economy is visible in the anxiety of investors. Between 2004 and 2006, the Fed raised rates at 17 consecutive policy meetings — from 1 to 5.25 percent — without noticeably dampening the euphoria on Wall Street. In recent years, markets have treated each quarter-point increase in the Fed’s benchmark rate as a significant threat to growth. But the fragility is also visible far from New York’s financial district. Ms. Soroka, in Daytona Beach, runs a company that gathers information on development projects, allowing contractors and workers to identify potential opportunities. The company, Builders Exchange and Reprographics, employed eight people before the crisis. Ms. Soroka cut half of those jobs during the crisis, and she has not hired anyone as revenue has recovered. In part, she said, technology has reduced her need for workers. Local governments increasingly post the information she needs on websites, eliminating the need for people to collect documents in person. But Ms. Soroka said she also remained nervous about investing in her company. Even in the 10th year of an economic expansion — one of the longest periods of growth in American history — she said she was reluctant to spend on office decorations, or buy new equipment. “I tiptoe into things,” she said, “because I don’t know how sustainable this is going to be.” The Fed’s interest rate increases have added a new reason for anxiety. Higher borrowing costs appear to be pinching housing, as sales of new and existing homes have softened in recent months. The government reported Tuesday that housing starts increased in November, but the change was driven by a rise in multifamily construction, which tends to vary month to month. Ms. Soroka said that developers in the Central Florida region that she watches closely are showing signs of increased caution. For example, she said, developers appear to be breaking projects into a larger number of phases, so the initial increment of construction is smaller. A developer might obtain permits for a 500-lot subdivision, she said, but begin with a section of 50 homes. “I know a lot of business owners who are thinking about being a little more liquid, which means that money is not going into the economy,” she said. “They’re just holding it.”",The New York Times
2018,The Marvelous Mr. Mackie,"Thanks to a new musical, Cher’s favorite designer may finally get the respect he deserves. CreditCreditDaniel Arnold for The New York Times He has outfitted mannequins as diminutive as Barbie and as Amazonian as RuPaul, and, in between, beglitzed every brand of bombshell: Madonna, Tina Turner, Raquel Welch, Mama Cass, Ann-Margret, Bette Midler and many more. But it is in Cher, as the singer, actress and emoji-loving Twitter warrior Cherilyn Sarkisian Bono Allman is more succinctly known, that Bob Mackie, 79, found his perfect muse. Since the two met in 1967, when she appeared on “The Carol Burnett Show,” for which he served as costume designer, Cher and Mr. Mackie have over thousands of concert, movie, TV and award show appearances forged as formidable a fashion partnership as Audrey Hepburn and Hubert de Givenchy, Liza Minnelli and Halston, or Lady Gaga and her butcher. In 1975 Cher wore one of Mr. Mackie’s creations — what Vogue these days calls a “naked dress” — on the cover of Time. “Glad Rags to Riches,” read the headline. Forty-three years later, a new jukebox musical called “The Cher Show"" will open on Dec. 3 at the Neil Simon Theater, to the general hysteria of her fans. The show has put the spotlight back on Mr. Mackie, who has won multiple Emmy Awards and is responsible for some of the most instantly recognizable costumes of all time. For it, he has designed a plethora of the kind of paillette-drenched ensembles for which he is known. He is also a character, embodied by the actor Michael Berresse. “He can sing and dance, which has nothing to do with me,” Mr. Mackie said. But a first-act costume cavalcade that everyone who works on “The Cher Show” refers to simply as “the Mackie number” has everything to do with him. As Jason Moore, the director, said, “You can’t really tell the Cher story without telling the Bob Mackie part of it.” The sequined sequence, featuring the three women who play Cher at various stages of her life (Stephanie J. Block, Teal Wicks and Micaela Diamond), lets Mr. Mackie “turn back time,” to borrow a song lyric, and revisit Cher’s most infamous “get-ups,” as he calls them. “When you stick them all together, it becomes this feast,” Mr. Moore said. In quick succession, audiences will gorge on such memorable looks as the metallic handlebar headdress and sci-fi bikini from the cover of Cher’s 1979 “Take Me Home” album; the seatbelt, mesh and garters in which she straddled an aircraft-carrier cannon in the video for her 1989 hit, “If I Could Turn Back Time”; and the wittingly tacky tiger-striped unitard (with one black bra strap showing) that she wore as her most famous comic character, the launderette-lingering cutup Laverne Lashinsky, on her various TV variety shows in the 1970s. “Her look didn’t always correspond with the rest of the world,” Mr. Mackie said in October at Tricorne, a garment district costume shop in Manhattan, “but she has always had a definite taste in how she likes to look.” And how. Nowhere has Cher style been more apparent than in her choice of attire for the Academy Awards. In “The Cher Show,” her renowned award show ensembles (including her most famous, the 1986 Mohawk-inspired costume and feather headdress in which she upstaged that year’s Best Supporting Actor winner, Don Ameche) appear in a swiftly paced number set to the 1967 Sonny & Cher hit “The Beat Goes On.” “We copied them all exactly,” Mr. Mackie said. Early reviews have hailed this painstaking accuracy, wrought by highly skilled artisans in workrooms in New York and Los Angeles. Variety went so far as to call Mr. Mackie’s creations “the real star of the show.” Cher herself doesn’t mind sharing the spotlight with the man who has dressed her as everything from a Native American princess to Popeye’s main squeeze, Olive Oyl, and every “vamp, scamp and a bit of tramp” in between. “When I saw the show in Chicago,” Cher wrote in an email from Las Vegas, where she was on a string of concert dates, “the audience gave his fashion show segment a standing ovation. They went crazy and deservedly so. Bob has taken Broadway costume design into the stratosphere.” Whether creating for the lithe dancer Juliet Prowse (“the more naked she was, the better she looked,” Mr. Mackie once told me) or the more generously proportioned comedian Totie Fields, he has always reached for the outer limits. “A woman who wears my clothes is not afraid to be noticed,” he once said. “When that curtain comes up, and the lights hit those sequins and you hear the audience’s intake of breath, there’s nothing like it,” said Mitzi Gaynor, the actress who played Ensign Nellie Forbush in the 1958 film version of “South Pacific.” She and Mr. Mackie began working together in 1966, when she was putting together a splashy Las Vegas revue. “Bob has made everything I’ve worn on stage or in a TV special since then,” Ms. Gaynor said. “He revolutionized me. I love being his first ‘star lady.’” It was Mr. Mackie’s second “star lady,” Carol Burnett, who made the designer a household name. She hired him for her new CBS variety show in 1967 after seeing the clothes he had done for Ms. Gaynor at the Riviera. Over 11 seasons, he designed upward of 17,000 costumes and wigs for cast members, dancers, singers and guest stars. Mr. Mackie was particularly skilled at creating costumes for such film parody characters as Nora Desmond, Mildred Fierce and Shirley Dimple. Sending up the classic leading ladies of Hollywood was easy for him because he had been worshiping them all his life. Growing up in Southern California in the ’50s, where he once worked as the Easter bunny at Bullock’s department store, Mr. Mackie, the only son of a frequently absent military man and a homemaker of fragile health, found relief and escape at the movies. He learned his craft at the Chouinard Art Institute, now part of the California Institute of the Arts, and, after graduating, found work with the legendary Hollywood costume designers Jean Louis and Edith Head. In 1963, Mr. Mackie became the assistant to Ray Aghayan, the costume designer of “The Judy Garland Show.” The two men were inseparable in work and life until Mr. Aghayan’s death in 2011. Known for exquisite sketches, Mr. Mackie has always been equally adept at creating both navel-baring showgirl glamour and belly laughs. “In one moment, he can make me feel more glamorous than I’ve ever felt in my life, and in the next, he’ll make me a Hungarian Gypsy with a rubber chicken,” Ms. Gaynor said. Mr. Mackie’s comic chops are clear. It was he who suggested that the “The Carol Burnett Show” regular Vicki Lawrence, just shy of her 25th birthday in 1974, play the blue-haired harridan Mama Thelma Harper; she later became the centerpiece of a spinoff series. He was instrumental, too, in creating the knock-kneed gait of Ms. Burnett’s bubbleheaded secretary character, Mrs. Wiggins. If her skirt hadn’t been so tight, she never would have walked that way. “Many times, I didn’t know how I was going to do a character until I saw what Bob was going to put me in,” Ms. Burnett said on a TV special last year. Mr. Mackie is also responsible for what may be the greatest sight gag ever on television. When the show parodied “Gone With the Wind” in 1976, the sketch called for Ms. Burnett, playing Starlett O’Hara, to appear in antebellum garb made from curtains, per the book’s plot. Keeping the brass curtain rod attached was pure Mackie mischief. Today, the green velvet, bullion-fringed “Went With the Wind” dress is in the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History in Washington. Mr. Mackie never won an Emmy for “The Carol Burnett Show,” though he was nominated once. But he did pick up nine awards between 1967 and 2003, for various TV projects, most involving Ms. Burnett, Ms. Gaynor or Cher. He has three Oscar nominations, too. For the movies, he has most notably collaborated with Mr. Aghayan on 1972’s “Lady Sings the Blues” starring Diana Ross, took Barbra Streisand from funny girl to “Funny Lady” in 1975, and swathed a buff John Travolta in little more than a loin cloth and leggings for the 1983 curiosity “Staying Alive.” On the stage, his work was featured in “Platinum” starring Alexis Smith in 1978, the musical sequel “The Best Little Whorehouse Goes Public” in 1994 and “Moon Over Buffalo” starring Ms. Burnett in 1995. None of those shows ran very long. Funding for an Off Broadway revival of “Howard Crabtree’s When Pigs Fly” fell through last year after some of Mr. Mackie’s elaborately campy costumes had already been constructed for it, and the show never opened. Regardless of how it is received in New York, “The Cher Show” will serve as a lifetime achievement award of sorts for the designer. And yet there was a moment during the musical’s very long gestation (17 years by some counts) when Mr. Mackie was going to be only tangentially involved. “Initially, they asked me to do a couple dozen iconic looks.” he said. “But Cher was not happy with that.” Flody Suarez, a producer and the man who came up with the idea for the show after listening to a greatest hits CD on repeat play during a car trip through Spain in the early 2000s, scheduled his first meeting with Mr. Mackie after securing the star. “To my mind, there isn’t the Cher we know without Bob and I don’t think she’d have done it with anyone else,” Mr. Suarez said. While showcasing instantly recognizable Cher looks and spotlighting plenty of new ones, the show serves not only as a tribute to the singer’s life, but also as a reminder of how much of an impact Mr. Mackie has had on the notion of glamour over the last half-century. In the ’70s, he was a sequin tsunami. His clothes influenced such heavy-hitting designers as Tom Ford, who memorably created a Mackie-esque collection in the late ’90s, and Alessandro Michele of Gucci, who this past spring created looks inspired by the clothes Mr. Mackie created for Elton John during the singer’s biggest hit-making days. In 1975, Mr. Mackie slipped a svelte Mr. John into a sequined Dodgers uniform. “I dressed him like sort of a male showgirl,” the designer told Vogue recently. Today, a re-creation of that shimmeringly sporty look appears in the opening shot of the teaser trailer for the 2019 biopic “Rocketman.” Since tryouts of “The Cher Show” this past summer, Mr. Mackie’s flair has become an even bigger part of the onstage proceedings. “I thought after Chicago, ‘Oh, well, we’ll just tweak a few things’,” Mr. Mackie said. Instead, he has spent months designing more outfits, sometimes drawing patterns right on the actors’ bodies, and showing seamstresses exactly where to put mirror tiles for maximum effect. At a dinner party thrown by Manhattan magazine in Mr. Mackie’s honor on Nov. 5 at the Lambs Club, Ms. Diamond, the 19-year-old actress who plays the youngest version of Cher in the show, gave a toast during which she elaborated on the power of those strategically placed reflectors. She recounted the day she got to try on a glimmering miniskirt once worn by Cher: a minuscule mirrored garment held in place by only a G-string. She thanked Mr. Mackie for, as she said, introducing their vaginas. “In all my years in TV and film, I’ve never seen a designer who works this intimately with body types,” said Mr. Suarez, who has worked in publishing, advertising and as a television producer. “One of my favorite things to do is watch Bob sit in the empty auditorium and, as the girls move, sketch with his finger where he’ll put a strap. I’ve watched him stand over people and point to a place and add a sequin. He looks at every body and figures out how to showcase their best assets. We wouldn’t have a show that dazzles if Bob weren’t a perfectionist.” Of course Cher is no slouch either. As Mr. Mackie works toward opening night, he has been in contact with her more than usual. The two don’t really socialize when they’re not working together. “She’s out there in Malibu watching Turner Classic Movies,” he said. “But when there’s something to do, I get a call.” When that something to do is a Broadway musical based on her life, Mr. Mackie gets a lot of calls. “We’re covering 65 years of her life, and she is really concerned about getting it right,” he said. “But it’s difficult calling Australia in the middle of the night.” While he was designing the costumes, Cher was touring there in support of “Dancing Queen,” her album of ABBA covers, of which Mr. Mackie heartily approves. “It’s like they’re new songs,” he said. While Cher needs no one’s approval on an album or a Broadway show, Mr. Suarez said of Mr. Mackie’s relationship with her: “He’s a voice of reason, a constant in her life. He’s a male figure whom she trusts and loves, and I think he plays a big part in her confidence.” Mr. Mackie is happy that his fashion accomplice remains so successful. “Cher said, ‘I’m too old to be this famous,’” he said. “But she is so hot right now. People are more interested in her than ever.” People are more interested in Mr. Mackie, too. In addition to “The Cher Show,” he has had a selection of his work displayed aboard the Queen Mary 2 during a trans-Atlantic crossing in August. Another recent exhibit, in Beverly Hills, Calif., accompanied a sale by Julien’s Auctions of some of his major pieces. When Mr. Mackie began downsizing in early 2016 and put his Los Angeles home on the market for $2.18 million, it was all over the press. “At this point in my life, I’m getting attention for stuff,” he said. And perhaps, also a kind of respect he has been previously denied. “In many ways, Bob is a dean,” said Jeffrey Seller, one of the producers of “The Cher Show.” “He’s an inspiration to every costume designer who’s working today, from Paul Tazewell to William Ivey Long.” (Mr. Seller added that he had “never been surrounded by so many sequins in my life — it’s a lot different than ‘Rent.’”) Mr. Mackie’s ventures into other areas of design, like ready-to-wear back in the ’80s and ’90s, were not particularly well received. Although no less than Diana Vreeland once said Mr. Mackie’s “superb clothes are not equaled in even French workrooms,” New York snobs often dismissed him as merely a Los Angeles costumer, not a true Seventh Avenue designer. His fashion sense was often chided as folly. Cher long ago called bunk on that. Discussing her most famous Oscar get-up, she said, “If John Galliano or Dolce & Gabbana presented that dress as a bridal gown in one of their fashion shows, people would stand up and cheer.” That is what preview audiences are doing at “The Cher Show.” “I stand on stage every night and I feel them wanting to say thank you to Bob. It’s a tidal wave,” Mr. Berresse said. Mr. Moore, the director, said: “Everyone who knows who Bob is — and that’s a lot of our crowd — is overjoyed to see his designs, and those who don’t know him, know who he is now.” Such attention can be daunting, even for a veteran like Mr. Mackie. Because he is shy by nature, content to stand one step outside the spotlight in which his leading ladies blaze, it has been hard for him to make peace with seeing a version of himself on a Broadway stage. “All I said was, please don’t play me like a nelly, officious old queen who comes in with sketches under his arm,” he said. The designer’s dancing doppelgänger doesn’t do that. “It’s important to me that I honor this person that I admire so much,” Mr. Berresse said. A navy blazer man in real life, Mr. Mackie did let himself have some fun with his onstage counterpart’s clothes. The fictional Bob, at one point, enters wearing a very groovy python jacket. “Bob said, ‘You know, I would never wear anything I’m making for you,’” Mr. Berresse said. Regardless, when Mr. Mackie attends a performance at the Neil Simon these days, he is often greeted by adoring fans. “I get to watch people mob him and want to get their pictures taken with him and get his autograph,” Mr. Suarez said. “To be a small part of him having a big moment makes me beyond happy.” The toughest critic of “The Cher Show” — Cher — is also overjoyed with this aspect of it. “There is simply no one like Bob Mackie,” she wrote in her email. “I love him. Always have. Always will.”",The New York Times
2018,"The Marvelous World of Mrs. Maisel, Through Vintage Photos","Past tense The creators of the show take a look back in time with us. A view of Eighth Street in Greenwich Village. November 18, 1965.CreditCreditNov. 18, 1965; Larry C. Morris/The New York Times Editor, Past Tense It would have been so easy for the creators of “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” to get it all wrong. We’ve all seen New York through the eyes of the Hollywood dream machine in a way that could not fool us, the native New Yorkers. We’ve scowled at streets that were supposed to be Harlem but were clearly a backlot in Burbank, Calif. We’ve shook our heads at shimmering skyscrapers that were meant to be the financial district but were obviously Toronto or Vancouver. And perhaps the worst: We’ve watched characters who are not part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe hop on a subway in TriBeCa and arrive, moments later, in Washington Heights. Amy Sherman-Palladino and her husband, Daniel Palladino, the show’s creators, are both California natives, but they know and love New York. “We grew up separately in the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles and have spent most of our lives there,” said Mr. Palladino, “but always had this fascination with New York and just really needed a good excuse to be out here permanently. Which we are now — we live in Brooklyn.” Ms. Sherman-Palladino explained, “The big thing about a show like ours is, any network or studio is going to want to not do it in New York, because it’s expensive. We had a long talk with Amazon about the fact that this show cannot become a show that becomes people talking in rooms, because it’s not that show. It needs breath and air, and it needs to live out on the streets.” The streets of New York come to life in both Seasons 1 and 2 of “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.” Even those of us who weren’t born during the era the show portrays watched with delight as the show depicted places and spaces of New York lore — the Gaslight Cafe nightclub, Kettle of Fish bar and the Carnegie Deli among them. As the second season debuted on Dec. 5, we asked the creators to look at photos from our archives and to share their thoughts about the New York as shot by Times photographers and the New York of their show. DANIEL PALLADINO Right off the bat, a big thing for us and our production designer is that back then signage was much more prevalent. In the photo of Eighth Street [above], I’m struck by signage that you see here on both sides of the streets. Back then, if you went to a grocery store, the windows would just be covered from head to toe with signage: advertising goose livers, prices, “Come on in!” — all that stuff, at all different kinds of angles. Much more than we do today. So we’re constantly slapping signage up. AMY SHERMAN-PALLADINO All this stuff is like the layering of the signs, and the signs within the signs. We had a lot of talk about layers, and a lot of talk about the signage. Because the period was that period of like, “We’re on the upswing, and the last decade was sad, and we conquered the world. We’re America.” So that feeling was pulsating through the city. PALLADINO There’d be a sign over a sign, and then a sign sticking out, and a sign up here and a sign up there. SHERMAN-PALLADINO I want to live somewhere with a big neon “babka,” that sounds like heaven to me.” PALLADINO This looks like an uptown crowd came downtown a little bit. It’s a pretty white crowd. It looks like they came from work. And they would do that, we had in our pilot, we had Midge and Joel’s friends, the Clearys came down, it was very exotic for them to go downtown. There were people who, as you know, to this day, if you live uptown, sometimes they never go downtown. And if you live downtown, they never go uptown, unless it’s for theater or something. SHERMAN-PALLADINO The other thing is, if you look at a lot of these Village pictures, the men didn’t wear hats in the Village, they wore hats uptown. So if you look at a lot of these Village pictures, they are in black and white, but these guys could be wearing this today. It’s a little bit less of the Doris Day feeling, because people look much more modern in these pictures. PALLADINO It was Kennedy not wearing a hat to his inauguration that made men think, “Maybe I shouldn’t wear a hat.” It’s kind of a shame. SHERMAN-PALLADINO Hats are great. PALLADINO This looks like Italy a little bit with the motorbike and Borgia. But you also notice the other thing is there are more trees now. There weren’t nearly as many trees, they were just planting them. SHERMAN-PALLADINO So the trees were like sticks. That’s another thing that we have to deal with downtown, you have these blocks where there’s tree, tree, tree, and it feels like the Upper West Side, because there just weren’t trees there. They didn’t have that in the Village. SHERMAN-PALLADINO There is a lot of unchanged in New York, but it’s surrounded by a lot of change. We’ll go and we’ll shoot something, and then our special effects will come in and do all the cleanup. And the cleanup is crazy, from locks to the cages on the air-conditioners, not the air-conditioners themselves, but the cages, security cameras. PALLADINO Satellite dishes, A.T.M.’s. Everything is everywhere, and we erase so much stuff. SHERMAN-PALLADINO Oh my god. Look at this. PALLADINO This is something we should keep in mind, maybe. SHERMAN-PALLADINO Four women, one room, that’s a nightmare. That’s so great. “Singles Week.” Of course. PALLADINO “Singles Week,” what does that mean? Was it before or after the normal season? SHERMAN-PALLADINO It’s August. PALLADINO That’s right in the thick of the season, the whole week of just singles? SHERMAN-PALLADINO Not by the end of the week. SHERMAN-PALLADINO This is a great picture. PALLADINO I would say it’s [the actor] George Hamilton doing the frug or something in 1964. SHERMAN-PALLADINO Look at that! And this would not be the only show that night, right? That’s the amazing thing. PALLADINO This is thousands of people. We do an episode where we’re saying she’s at the Concord, but there was no way we could recreate a theater this wide with this many people … We want to make it look like the modern world, but the modern world for them was 1959, 1960. So that’s what Amy was saying, that a lot of times when you see movies especially, but a lot of television shows that are set in the ’20s or in the ’40s or the ’50s. SHERMAN-PALLADINO They’ll do it in the ’70s, like everything in the ’70s was orange. PALLADINO They’ll add a color of patina to the cinematography that is supposed to make it look like 1970 or 1960 to our eyes, but again, back then the world wasn’t orange. It was bright and colorful. So I think the vintage aspect comes into effect in the costume, in the wardrobe and the production design. SHERMAN-PALLADINO And New York is 1700s, 1800s, early 1900s, it’s everything layered upon, layered upon, layered upon. When you look at the Maisel apartment, it’s not just all 1950s — there’re pieces that would have been in Rose’s family from the 1800s and mixed up, because everyone’s apartment is a mixture of what your life has been up until then, not just a snapshot in time in that moment. Nobody goes out and furnishes an entire apartment in one day, and then that’s how they live. SHERMAN-PALLADINO We wanted to make sure that when we photographed New York, it didn’t have any sort of filter or sepia tone feel that made it feel quaint or old-fashioned or old-timey. Because you see the people in these pictures, they’re walking quickly, there’s an energy, there’s a vibrancy, even just to the pictures of New York. Especially during that time, because it was postwar and things were on the upswing, and there was so much innovation. It was, “Buy a washing machine, buy a car, buy this and buy that.” PALLADINO We always make a point to everybody that these people, they’re our past, but they thought they were living in a modern world. And they were living in a modern world. So one of the things we tell our extras who come in — we have to tell some of our guest actors this — but we tell our extras, too, “Don’t walk down the street in the scene like you’re in 1959, just walk down the street.” Because they didn’t know they were in 1959. SHERMAN-PALLADINO Don’t try to be old-timey. This interview has been condensed and edited for length and clarity.",The New York Times
2018,The Mayor and the F.B.I. Raid: Atlantic City Is Stained Once Again,"ATLANTIC CITY — At a lavish inaugural gala in March for the new mayor of Atlantic City at Resorts Casino, donors and supporters with business before the city paid up to $35,000 per table to celebrate with the new administration. Among the revelers was the former basketball star Dennis Rodman, wearing tinted shades and a black hat as he strolled past an ice sculpture and stacks of cured meat and fresh mozzarella. The gala was a fund-raiser for a tiny nonprofit, Connecting the Dots, that has five employees. One of them is the new mayor, Frank M. Gilliam Jr. But there is no record to be found of how much money was raised or the names of the donors. Connect the Dots has not filed a required disclosure form with the Internal Revenue Service since 2015, when it listed just $5,200 in donations. Now the nonprofit is part of a federal investigation into Mr. Gilliam, which was thrust into public view on Monday in a raid of his home by the F.B.I. For hours, agents combed through the house, carrying out boxes. The raid is the talk of the city, and with few details emerging about it, rumors are multiplying. For his part, the mayor, who has not been charged with a crime, has continued to show up at City Hall. The F.B.I. visit follows a campaign marked by accusations by several political associates of disappearing campaign funds. Swept into office on a wave of cash and the promise of a brighter future, Mr. Gilliam, 48, carried new hope for a city where life is often a daily struggle. As Atlantic City’s third African-American mayor and a native son, Mr. Gilliam raised expectations that more residents might benefit from the riches that flow into the casinos along the ocean, but never seem to reach the poorer neighborhoods. Instead, that faith has been shaken by the frustratingly familiar scene outside Mr. Gilliam’s home: grim-faced men and women in navy blue Windbreakers with three bold yellow letters — “F.B.I.” — stretched across the back. Here was another Atlantic City mayor whose future was placed in doubt by accusations of corruption. These include missing campaign cash and political donations meant for the Democratic Party rerouted to his own coffers. To make matters worse, an early morning brawl in October outside a casino that was captured on videotape left the mayor with a literal black eye. A gambling Mecca where piles of cash change hands every day, Atlantic City has been home to a series of politicians toppled by their own avarice. The history goes back at least to Enoch “Nucky” Johnson, the political boss romanticized in HBO’s “Boardwalk Empire” who turned the resort into a refuge for bootlegging and prostitution during Prohibition. Senator Harrison A. Williams of New Jersey, the last United States senator to be convicted of corruption and sent to prison, sought to use the lure of new Atlantic City casinos to enrich himself through stock in a titanium company as part of the infamous Abscam bribery scandal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Mayor Michael J. Matthews lamented in 1984 that “greed got the better of me” as he admitted to committing extortion. His successor, James L. Usry, was charged with conspiracy, bribery and accepting gifts as a public servant, pleading guilty to taking thousands of dollars in campaign donations to muscle through an ordinance that would have benefited a donor. And in 2007, with federal agents investigating falsified military records, Mayor Robert W. Levy fled the city, disappearing for more than two weeks before turning up in a rehabilitation clinic and later saying he lied to receive veterans benefits. Mr. Gilliam declined to be interviewed for this article; his office did not respond to a list of emailed questions. Under Mr. Gilliam, Atlantic City was supposed to be on the cusp of a fresh start after the collapse of the casino industry — fueled by competition from casinos in surrounding states — brought the city to the brink of bankruptcy. Though the state took control of the city in 2016, somewhat limiting the mayor’s fiscal powers, there were signs that the city was turning a corner: Two casinos opened this year, sports betting has become a booming industry months after it became legal, the city’s bond rating has improved and a new campus of Stockton University opened within the city limits. Yet the arrival of federal agents at Mr. Gilliam’s home has cast a shadow over the city. In many ways, Mr. Gilliam’s own life story could be a parable for his hometown’s struggles, successes and aspirations. In 1973, when Mr. Gilliam was 3, his father fatally stabbed his mother. Mr. Gilliam, in an interview after his election, said that he still remembered his mother and that her murder made him appreciate that “you can have something one day and now it’s gone.” As Mr. Gilliam progressed through Atlantic City’s public schools, he developed a reputation as a supremely confident youngster who could be a friendly charmer one moment and an angry bully the next, according to a family friend who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid getting pulled into any investigation. He made his mark on the basketball court. As a senior, he was a starting guard for the Atlantic City High School Vikings, and, despite his 5-foot-9 frame, a solid contributor. Tom Williams, who has been a play-by-play announcer for South Jersey high school sports since 1964, recalled Mr. Gilliam as scrappy and “aggressive defensively.” Mr. Gilliam went on to Delaware State University, but has said that he left within a year because of poor grades. He returned home, had a son and worked in casinos as a security guard and bar porter. Eventually, he enrolled at nearby Stockton College of New Jersey (now Stockton University) and graduated in 1998 with a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice. After becoming mayor this year, he returned to the campus in July and told incoming freshmen that he considered himself lucky because he could have ended up in jail. “In 1993, my world was a whirlwind,” he told them. “I had no idea, I had no clue, and I had no vision. I am in Atlantic City doing nothing but wreaking havoc, doing things I know I shouldn’t be doing.” Mr. Gilliam’s official biography says that after Stockton College, he received a master’s degree in social work from the University of San Francisco. But a spokeswoman for the university said that claim was “inaccurate”: The school has neither records of Mr. Gilliam nor a graduate program in social work. Mr. Gilliam held several jobs in the early 2000s. He worked for Covenant House, according to news reports. He founded a youth basketball program, Atlantic City Starz. He was elected to the City Council in 2009. His legislative achievements include an ordinance that imposes fines for any helium balloons that are released outdoors. He also worked assiduously to promote development in the city. “I think he saw himself as more business-friendly, or more business well-versed, than other political people,” said a former local official, who also did not want to be identified because of the continuing investigation. Mr. Gilliam’s campaign for mayor started with a spigot of cash that never seemed to turn off. All told, his campaign and allies raised nearly $525,000, an unheard-of sum for an Atlantic City mayor’s race and more than three times that of the next highest mayoral war chest in recent history. Irregularities concerning campaign money started showing up in the primary campaign. Mr. Gilliam promised his Democratic running mate, George Tibbitt, that he would hold onto a dozen or so checks written to Mr. Tibbitt’s campaign. The checks, each for $300, were never deposited into Mr. Tibbitt’s account, according to four people familiar with the episode. The race also featured the first super PAC in city history to focus solely on the mayoral election. Called “Our Atlantic City,” it raised more than $220,000 in support of Mr. Gilliam, largely from real estate companies and unions. The super PAC helped power an effective, if controversial, get-out-the-vote operation. Run by a local political kingmaker named Craig Callaway, the group paid messengers $30 per trip to deliver mail-in ballots to voters. Don Guardian, Mr. Gilliam’s Republican opponent, was suspicious of the group’s activities and, according to an account in The Philadelphia Inquirer, he paid an informant to get a job as a messenger with Mr. Callaway, in an attempted sting operation. With a voice recorder tucked into his pocket, the informant went with Mr. Callaway to the county courthouse to sign out a ballot that he was supposed to deliver to a voter, who would then mail it in. He gave the ballot to Mr. Callaway, not to the voter. Mr. Callaway told The Inquirer that he took the ballot to the voter himself, but Mr. Guardian still claimed fraud. A judge denied his request for a review of mail ballots. Mr. Gilliam won by 79 votes. But questions about the disposition of campaign money ruptured the Democratic ticket and turned some of Mr. Gilliam’s allies and friends against him. One dispute followed a fund-raiser organized by Mr. Callaway to help Mr. Gilliam cultivate the city’s Asian and Indian population. The donors, many of them taxi drivers and small shop owners, operate largely in cash and raised nearly $5,000 that night. Proud of their fund-raising prowess, the group spread the money out on a table to take a picture of it. Minutes later, it was gone. Mr. Gilliam denied in local news reports that he had anything to do with the missing money. But Mr. Callaway has his doubts. “He attempted to reach for the money and I said, ‘Don’t touch that money,’” Mr. Callaway said. He said he was standing next to Mr. Gilliam and turned to take the photo. “I turned back around,” he said. “It was gone.” Mr. Callaway added that he did not see Mr. Gilliam take the money, but only noticed that it went missing. In October, a $10,000 check sent to the city Democratic committee from the county party was intercepted by Mr. Gilliam and was deposited into his campaign account, appearing in a report with the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission. Mr. Gilliam claimed it was an honest mistake. But Democratic associates of Mr. Gilliam’s filed a criminal complaint accusing him of purposefully taking the $10,000. A judge dismissed the complaint, saying there was not enough evidence to move forward with a charge. “As soon as those checks started coming across, that’s when Frank changed big time,” said Mr. Tibbitt, who ran on the same ticket as the mayor. In his first act as mayor, Mr. Gilliam tried to give himself a salary of $140,000 — a $37,000 raise. He is also a top employee of Connecting the Dots, the local charity where the funds from his inaugural gala were directed. The executive director of New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission, Jeffrey M. Brindle, said money raised at an inaugural event can benefit any of several entities, including a charity. “But it’s kind of a little bit of a gray area when you’re talking about the individual himself runs the charity,” Mr. Brindle said. F.B.I. agents started interviewing several allies and aides to Mr. Gilliam in February, a month after he assumed office, according to three people who said they had been approached by the F.B.I. and who requested anonymity because they were not allowed to disclose having spoken with federal agents. Interviews have continued throughout the year. The mayor’s deepening legal troubles seemed to highlight for some in the city that the veneer of progress — the new casinos, coffee shops, yoga studios and apartment developments — was a mirage. “Propaganda,” said Donnie Russell, owner of the Pic-A-Lilli Pub, a working-class bar near the shore. He pointed to a boardwalk dotted with vape stores and dollar shops, the blighted blocks and the people struggling with substance abuse. The new businesses nearby and the talk of revival meant little to him, and the mayor’s problems came as little surprise. For Atlantic City to return to what it was when his pub first opened in 1991 — it was “fabulous,” he said — it needed a deep scrub, from the overflowing garbage bins on the boardwalk to the city’s leadership. “They need to clean the place up,” Mr. Russell said. “The mayor and all them — they don’t worry about cleaning it up.” He paused. “They hurt the city.” A caption with an earlier version of this article misstated the position of Atlantic City’s mayor, Frank M. Gilliam Jr., at a ribbon cutting in June. He is third from the right, not third from the left. An earlier version of this article misstated the surname of the real-life political boss romanticized in HBO’s “Boardwalk Empire.” He was Enoch “Nucky” Johnson, not Thompson.",The New York Times
2018,The Meeting in the Mountains That Led to $800 Million in Cash for El Chapo,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] In May 2005, Pedro Flores, a young drug dealer from Chicago, had just arrived in the Mexican mountains for his first official meeting with his boss in the cocaine trade, Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the Mexican crime lord known as El Chapo. Mr. Flores had been unnerved during his trip when the small plane he was on landed at a sharply inclined makeshift airstrip. He became terrified when a group of gunmen picked him up and drove him past a chilling sight: a naked man chained to a tree. Yet despite the harrowing journey, Mr. Flores and Mr. Guzmán soon reached an agreement: They would cut out their middleman and work directly with one another. Appearing this week as a witness for the government at Mr. Guzmán’s trial, Mr. Flores spoke at length about that deal, telling jurors that for the next three years he sold nearly 40 tons of the kingpin’s product in the United States, remitting to his boss in Mexico a staggering $800 million in cash. But as with so much else in the cartel world, what started with success ended in disaster. In 2008, exhausted by a life of crime and fearing for his safety, Mr. Flores began to spy on Mr. Guzmán and his partners, secretly recording them for American officials. Betrayal has been a central theme at the trial, which is in its second month in Federal District Court in Brooklyn. But even though several of Mr. Guzmán’s former allies have testified against him and exposed the inner workings of his business, Mr. Flores not only spoke about the drug lord’s various crimes, but also offered proof of them in two recorded phone calls. Those calls — captured on a Radio Shack recorder that Mr. Flores purchased — were played for jurors Wednesday. In them, Mr. Guzmán can be heard negotiating the sale of $1 million worth of Mexican heroin. He also instructs Mr. Flores to give the money to a courier in Chicago. For more than a month, the testimony at the trial has largely concerned the logistical complexities of moving drugs from Colombia to Mexico and then across the United States border. But in two days as a witness, Mr. Flores has shifted the trial to American soil, describing drug deals in a Denny’s parking lot in Illinois and distribution routes in Milwaukee, Minneapolis and Louisville, Ken. He has talked about spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on a trip for 60 people to a prize fight in Las Vegas and smuggling cocaine to Chicago in a truck filled with sheep. He has also testified about his own criminal history, which started during his childhood in Chicago’s Little Village, a mostly Hispanic neighborhood. At 7, he recalled, he and his twin brother, Margarito, acted as English to Spanish translators for their father during drug deals, and were also tasked with loading and unloading carloads of cocaine. By age 20, the brothers were among the city’s biggest wholesale drug dealers — a position, Mr. Flores said, that attracted the attention of one of Mr. Guzmán’s representatives in the Sinaloa drug cartel. With its network of rail yards, airports, waterways and interstates, Chicago has long been a focal point of the cartel’s operations. It is centrally located or, as Mr. Flores put it Tuesday, “halfway to everywhere.” The man from Sinaloa, Lupe Ledesma, hired the brothers as his distributors and by the early 2000s, Mr. Flores said, they had already moved up to 20 tons of the cartel’s product through several American cities. When the federal authorities indicted the twins in 2004 on drug trafficking charges in Wisconsin, they fled together as fugitives to Mexico. There, Mr. Flores told the jurors, they continued selling drugs and were ultimately spotted by someone else: Ismael Zambada García, Mr. Guzmán’s partner. Summoning the brothers to a meeting, Mr. Zambada praised them for the profits they were earning. He wished they could earn more, Mr. Flores added, quoting him as saying: “Imagine if you guys were triplets.” Shortly after that encounter, Mr. Flores said, he met Mr. Guzmán in his mountaintop hide-out. While the men eventually worked well together, there was at first a cultural divide. Mr. Flores recalled how he showed up for the meeting wearing jean shorts and a T-shirt. The kingpin disapproved, telling him, “With all that money, you couldn’t afford the rest of the pants?” The next three years went by in a flurry of drug deals and profits. Mr. Flores and his brother expanded to Detroit, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. They set up warehouses in cities across the country — always, he explained, in “the best neighborhoods” where the police weren’t likely to look. But in 2008 everything changed, he said. First, Mr. Guzmán went to war with one of his former partners, Arturo Beltrán Leyva, and the cartel chieftains demanded the brothers’ loyalty. Then, Mr. Flores’s wife got pregnant and he began to think about their future — or lack of one, he said. Within a few months, he had his lawyer reach out to American law enforcement officers who met with him in a hotel in Monterrey, Mexico. He went to Radio Shack, bought the small recorder and started to document his conversations with several cartel figures. He needed a way out, he said, and the American authorities provided it. “I couldn’t promise my family a tomorrow,” he explained.",The New York Times
2018,The Mets’ New G.M. Prefers Boldness to Bargains. Now Comes His Big Chance.,"On Baseball Just hours after Brodie Van Wagenen introduced his first acquisitions as the Mets’ general manager, his spotlight went out. A division rival stole it with a bold outlay of free-agent cash. The Mets had welcomed second baseman Robinson Cano and closer Edwin Diaz to Citi Field on Tuesday after a seven-player trade with Seattle. But then the Washington Nationals struck, agreeing with the All-Star left-hander Patrick Corbin on the first nine-figure deal — six years, $140 million — of the current free-agent market. It was the kind of contract Van Wagenen craved in his former job as an agent, uniting a player with a contender at a price too rich for even the Yankees. As Van Wagenen heads to Las Vegas for the winter meetings, which begin on Sunday, he finds himself in a role reversal: instead of asking for free-agent contracts, he will be trying to give them. Ownership provides his budget, of course, but Van Wagenen is now in position to live up to his strong words that jolted the industry last February. Back then, as owners shrugged at a lackluster free-agent market for the 2018 season, Van Wagenen posted an angry Twitter missive. He was still an agent at that point and he warned that a “fight is brewing” over a market that “feels coordinated, rightly or wrongly.” Van Wagenen even threatened that a “boycott of spring training may be a starting point if behavior does not start to change,” a possibility the players union refuted two days later. That post is deleted now, and Van Wagenen spoke with Commissioner Rob Manfred last month, smoothing over any hard feelings about the collusion charge. But while his new contemporaries — a young, analytically savvy group of general managers — have concluded that it is folly to lavish splashy contracts on players past their primes, Van Wagenen is not so sure. “Everybody’s model and opinion on what future value is should vary and differ, and I hope ours is unique, because if it’s not, then we’re all chasing the same game plan,” he said. “I certainly didn’t take this job to follow the lead of others.” With this winter’s free-agent market just starting to stir, we do not yet know how the Mets fit into it under Van Wagenen. Three of his lieutenants — Ruben Amaro Jr., Allard Baird and Omar Minaya — were general managers in the previous decade, when teams more eagerly invested in players over 30. Cano was not a free agent when the Mets obtained him, but he is 36 years old, is signed through 2023 and the Mets took on more than $60 million over all in the trade. As an agent, Van Wagenen negotiated Cano’s 10-year, $240 million deal with the Mariners in 2013 and in this trade sent Seattle two regrettable contracts the Mets agreed to last winter, with Jay Bruce and Anthony Swarzak. Those were just a few of the deals that supported the reluctance of most teams to spend a lot of money. In the weeks after Van Wagenen spoke out last winter, the free-agent market did finally pick up. Eric Hosmer got $144 million from the San Diego Padres, Yu Darvish $126 million from the Chicago Cubs, Jake Arrieta $75 million from the Philadelphia Phillies, Alex Cobb $57 million from the Baltimore Orioles, and so on. All four then underperformed in 2018, as did many others who signed late. Van Wagenen attributed it to timing. “I don’t think it’s ever a good thing to force a player into a circumstance where he can’t be successful,” he said. “And when you sign players late in the process and they don’t have a full spring training — or they don’t have the opportunity to have a clear idea of what their role and expectations are going to be with a new team — that hurts the individual, it hurts the teammates that player will join, and it certainly hurts the organization. My plan is not to bargain-shop in February and March. My plan is to be aggressive and strategic in filling our needs as soon as possible.” Baird, a former Kansas City Royals general manager, worked for the Boston Red Sox last season and saw the impact of an exception to the free-agent flops. J.D. Martinez signed in late February (five years, $110 million) and hit .330 with 43 homers. He helped lead the Red Sox to the World Series, where David Price — who signed for seven years and $217 million with Boston in December 2015 — won the clincher. Do the 2018 Red Sox, then, prove that aggressive free-agent spending may be a worthwhile gamble after all? Baird would not go that far. “We can look at the other ones that didn’t turn out; we can surely look at that as well,” he said. “But I also learned in Boston that the culture has a huge impact on those players — the supporting cast, the resources that are around that individual during the bumps and the grind. So the infrastructure that you put those guys into is a really, really important element.” The Mets’ intangibles will reveal themselves over time, but Amaro — a former Phillies general manager who returns to the front office after serving as the Mets’ first-base coach — said Van Wagenen was off to an encouraging start. He noted that, at the news conference for Cano and Diaz, Van Wagenen thanked numerous Mets staffers, including the scouts who signed the prospects the Mets had just traded. The Mets do seem united in their goal of contending immediately. That belief, and the vision to execute it, helped Van Wagenen get the job. “That was all part of the analysis when we looked at the different G.M. candidates, as far as what they thought,” said Jeff Wilpon, the Mets’ chief operating officer. “Some thought teardown, some didn’t think that we had enough. But Brodie being aggressive and knowing the landscape of New York and being comfortable here, he doesn’t seem like a rookie G.M. right now in terms of the way he’s acting. He wants to show this fan base that we can win and we can win now.” The trick is where Van Wagenen goes from here, and how much Wilpon will give him to spend. The free-agent market teems with options, and seems to be an easier way to plug holes than through trades. The Mets already dealt three prospects to Seattle, and would rather keep the position players most appealing to other teams, like Michael Conforto, Brandon Nimmo and Amed Rosario. Could they sign a catcher like Yasmani Grandal, Jonathan Lucroy, Wilson Ramos or Martin Maldonado? What about an outfielder like A.J. Pollock, Andrew McCutchen or Adam Jones? How about a reliever — Adam Ottavino, Andrew Miller, David Robertson — to set up for Diaz? (And there’s always the fantasy of Manny Machado or Bryce Harper …) So here is Van Wagenen’s chance. If the industry really does undervalue free agents, as he asserted just 10 months ago, why not sign some and test out the theory? The Mets are not tanking, and for that they should be applauded. But their chosen path, and their market, demand that they invest heavily in available talent. “The national sports landscape is better when the New York teams are successful — and that is for the Yankees, that’s for the Mets, that’s for the Knicks, the Nets, everybody in town,” Van Wagenen said. “I think that we are all better off, and sports is more compelling, if the New York teams are relevant. I want to be relevant, I hope the Yankees continue to be relevant, and I think the Mets owe it to this city and this fan base to try to win every year.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Mexican Border as Refugee Camp,"The Trump administration plans to send asylum seekers back to Mexico. What will happen to them there? Contributing Opinion Writer MEXICO CITY — When I was in Tijuana last month, a heavy rainstorm poured down on the Benito Juárez sports park, where more than 6,000 Central American migrants were crowded into tents, under tarps, or simply sleeping on the mud. The rain mixed with sewage that was leaking from broken toilets, forming putrid puddles that seeped into the tents and prompted a vain scramble for dry spaces. I saw one young mother squatting in filthy water, trying to comfort her sick baby. The city government eventually closed the park because of the unsanitary conditions. The men, women and children who have traveled north in a stream of caravans in recent months have grabbed attention because it is unusual for people to move through Mexico together in such large numbers. It’s even more unusual for them to have to seek temporary shelter in such awful conditions. There are refugee camps in many places in the world, but that one existed right next to the American border, where its occupants could literally see California, is disturbing. I’m worried that such scenes will come to seem normal. The Trump administration’s announcement on Thursday that it will make some asylum seekers wait in Mexico while their court cases are resolved in the United States makes this very likely. Mexico has increasingly become a transit country for refugees and migrants — especially those fleeing gang violence and government crackdowns in Central America. This puts it in a similar position to Turkey and Italy, where the passage of refugees and migrants has caused enormous domestic problems. Those fleeing Central America often face a level of violence akin to what we think of as occurring in war zones. I have talked to refugees who have been shot, raped, extorted, kidnapped and had their houses burned down by gangs allied with corrupt police officers. The latest move could potentially cause hundreds of thousands of them to pile up along the Mexican side of the border. With thousands of asylum applications being made every month, and with a huge backlog in United States immigration courts, migrants’ cases could take years to resolve. The new Trump administration rule would strand them in crime-stricken Mexican states. Two Honduran teenagers from the caravan were murdered in Tijuana, officials said Tuesday. It also raises the question of who will support the refugees, who are being helped here by churches, charities and some local governments that already complain they are short on money. “How is Mexico suddenly going to support hundreds of thousands of non-Mexicans for years?” asked the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights advocacy organization, in a statement on its website in response to Thursday’s announcement. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen claims the move will prevent people from using asylum applications to get into the United States and slip into the shadows. “Aliens trying to game the system to get into our country illegally will no longer be able to disappear into the United States, where many skip their court dates,” she said on Thursday. Studies show, however, that the vast majority of asylum seekers show up for their hearings. The move may well be challenged in United States courts. But will Mexico also oppose it? On Thursday, it sent mixed signals. The Foreign Ministry initially said in a statement it would accept those with United States court dates, but then the head of Mexico’s immigration institute said it was legally and logistically impossible to do so. Since President Andrés Manuel López Obrador took power on Dec. 1, he has been trying to develop a long-term strategy for the crisis. On Dec. 10, his foreign minister promised that Mexico will invest $30 billion in Central America over five years in a “Marshall Plan” aimed at curbing the march northward, including increasing jobs in southern Mexico. He has said he is looking to work with Washington on such a plan. Cooperation on finding a regional solution to the causes of the exodus would be a big step forward. But Mexico should not agree to house United States asylum seekers as part of any bigger deal. This would leave refugees in a painful, drawn-out limbo. The growth of long-term refugee camps along the border could also cause resentment among Mexicans, who are already questioning their obligations toward the caravan members. And it could lead to more conflict between frustrated refugees and border guards that snarl border crossing points, hurting the millions of people who rely on cross-border commerce and travel. The scenes of border guards firing tear gas into Mexico and migrants in sewage-filled water next to the United States should not be something we become accustomed to seeing. This should not become our new normal.

2018,Opinion | The Midwest’s Sore Losers,"The Republicans are trying to hold onto power at all costs, even if it means undoing democracy. Opinion Columnist This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. The Republican Party continues to show an alarming disrespect for democracy. It’s evident right now in Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and Missouri, and I’ll get to the details in a moment. But I first want to emphasize that I’m not talking about normal right-versus-left policy disagreements here. I happen to disagree with the Republican Party’s position on tax policy, for example. But there is nothing inherently anti-democratic about its position. The same goes for much of the rest of the Republican agenda: restricting abortion, passing pro-gun laws, reducing immigration, cutting health care programs and so on. What’s happening in those four states right now is different. It is an anti-democratic power grab. It is qualitatively different from the usual lawmaking that occurs during so-called lame-duck sessions, just after an election. [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] Republican officials are trying to change the rules to subvert the voting choices of their state’s citizens. The tactics resemble those now common in European countries sliding toward autocracy, like Hungary. Let’s take the four states one at a time: In Wisconsin, where a Democrat won the governor’s and attorney general’s races last month, the Republican-controlled Legislature is hoping to rush through a bill today that would make both offices less powerful. “The legislation is wide-ranging and would limit [the new governor’s] power in a host of ways,” Molly Beck and Patrick Marley of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel write. Among the measures: The Legislature would gain the authority to intervene in court cases that were traditionally overseen by the executive branch. “No one is really bothering to hide the purpose of this lame duck legislation: to continue the Republicans’ hold on state government, even at the expense of core democratic principles like respect for the separation of powers and majority rule,” Dan Kaufman writes in The Times. In Michigan, part of the story is similar: Democrats will also become governor and attorney general, and legislators are considering a new law to give themselves control over court cases involving the state. The Legislature may also strip some powers from the secretary of state, the office that controls elections. And Republicans are trying to use their “legislative majority in the lame duck session to gut popular citizen-initiated laws that would mandate paid sick leave and increase the state’s $9.25 hourly minimum wage to $12 per hour for all workers, including tipped employees, by 2022,” Tom Perkins of Metro Times, a Detroit alt-weekly, writes in Slate. If the measures pass, Nancy Kaffer of The Detroit Free Press notes that the major Michigan officeholders who would lose authority are all women. In Ohio, legislators are in less of a rush, because Republicans control the governor’s office and — thanks in part to gerrymandering — the Legislature as well. But they’re still trying to beat back democracy. The Legislature is, as Ari Berman of Mother Jones writes, “introducing legislation to make it nearly impossible for citizen-led groups to amend the state’s constitution.” Why? Republicans are upset that earlier this year, the state’s voters overwhelmingly passed a constitutional amendment to restrict gerrymandering. I’ve covered the shenanigans in Missouri in a previous newsletter: Republican legislators are trying to undermine an anti-corruption, anti-gerrymandering law approved by voters in a landslide last month. The Kansas City Star ran a good Op-Ed last week — co-written by a former Republican legislator and a Kansas City civic leader — explaining the issues. Finally, it’s worth keeping an eye on democracy in North Carolina. For one thing, there are reasons to believe that the congressional campaign of Mark Harris, a Republican, engaged in widespread voter fraud. A bipartisan panel of states officials has refused to certify the race, given the troubling signs. North Carolina is also the state where the modern power-stripping trend began. In 2016, Republicans legislators passed a law to hamstring the governor’s office after a Democrat won it. You can join me on Twitter (@DLeonhardt) and Facebook.

2018,The Misadventures of an Idealistic Restaurant in Cut-Throat New York,"When Emily Elliott moved to New York from North Carolina almost 12 years ago, she handed out resumes in the East Village and slept on her sister’s couch. Two weeks went by and no one hired her. Just as she was starting to feel desperate, Colors, a new restaurant cooperative in NoHo focusing on fair wages and equality, offered her a position as a line cook. Ms. Elliott found Colors, as she put it, “morally correct.” She recalled a Muslim cook who excused himself to pray in the locker area each day, even during peak hours. The staff, many of whom came from Windows on the World, the restaurant atop the World Trade Center that was destroyed during the Sept. 11 terror attacks, came from more than 20 countries. At Colors, staffers collaborated on a menu that reflected their various ethnicities — pad Thai, risotto, a Japanese-style smoked tuna. “It was like the Queens of restaurants,” Ms. Elliott said. “I never worked anywhere that was nearly as diverse.” Six weeks later, Ms. Elliott quit. She wasn’t getting paid on time. Working at a restaurant is a rite of passage for many New Yorkers. For some it’s a way to finance their dance classes or start-ups or screenplays. For countless others, it is simply a way to survive. But the model of working for cash in a restaurant is changing, as several businesses, in an effort to guarantee workers a better hourly rate, are doing away with tipping. There is also a campaign underway to raise the wages of tipped workers across the state and the country. Such changes could raise prices all around, affecting the entire food-service ecosystem in New York. Increasing wages for food service workers is certainly a noble cause, one that aligned with the ideals of Colors when it first opened, in 2006. But good intentions are one thing; running a restaurant in a city as competitive as New York is quite another. Colors was a fine-dining cooperative where employees had health benefits and made almost $10 over the tipped hourly rate. But there were other variables that hampered this lofty vision from working smoothly, like complex labor laws, fees from health department inspections and high overhead. Former employees described a restaurant strapped for cash and with no clear leadership. Clark Wolf, a food and restaurant consultant, described Colors as an “incredibly well-intentioned but logically doomed-to-fail situation.” Colors restaurant quietly closed in 2017. Restaurant Opportunities Centers United (ROC), the nonprofit that was the organizing force behind Colors, is still going strong, as it fights for what it calls One Fair Wage, which is to say, raising the minimum wage for all tipped workers across the country. It has also announced a new business model for Colors restaurant in New York, which is rescheduled to reopen on the Lower East Side next year. One Fair Wage has its supporters and its detractors. In states like New York, employers can take a “tip credit” and pay servers a lower wage, as long as tips help meet or exceed the minimum wage. Restaurant Opportunities argues that this two-tiered wage system perpetuates sexual harassment, poverty, wage theft and workplace discrimination. Others are concerned about a ripple effect. Restaurants will need to raise prices if the tip credit is eliminated, said Andrew Rigie, the executive director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance. “Customers are currently, constantly complaining that it’s so hard to go out and have a meal because it’s so expensive,” he explained. If prices increase, people could start to tip less. Earlier this year, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo ordered the New York State Department of Labor to hold public hearings on the issue. The Manhattan hearing in June drew a fiery crowd of protesters on both sides of the debate. Behind the barricades, there were chants of “Better wages, better tips!” One sign read: “Cuomo, we don’t need saving.” “It was the closest thing you can get to a riot on minimum wage,” said Louis Pechman, a labor lawyer in New York. Danny Meyer, the founder and chief executive of the Union Square Hospitality Group, recently admitted that after implementing a no-tipping policy, he lost close to 40 percent of his front-of-house staff (including waiters, bartenders and hosts). Other restaurateurs who followed Mr. Meyer’s lead in 2015 — like Andrew Tarlow (Marlow & Sons, in Williamsburg) and Claus Meyer (Agern, in Grand Central Terminal) — ended up reversing course this year, citing an increase in pricing that was not sustainable. Marlow & Sons returned to the tipping model on Dec. 17. “It’s become impossible to ignore that removing tips has created new challenges that we are unable to solve, chiefly that prices have hit a peak that the market cannot bear,” Mr. Tarlow wrote in a statement. “I’d still like to see us get rid of tipping,” said Amanda Cohen, the chef and owner of Dirt Candy, a no-tipping restaurant in New York. She increased menu prices by about 20 percent, which allows her to pay her kitchen staff, who don’t receive tips, a higher wage. But some servers are nervous about losing their tips. Alcieli Felipe, a waitress at the restaurant Lido, in Harlem, said that immigrants might be the first to go if raised wages and no tipping are enforced at her restaurant. “Who are they going to cut first? The ones who don’t speak English who work at the back of the house.” Laura Strauss, a waitress, said the pressure of pleasing customers exists even without working for tips, and the no-tip model she worked under for a while limited her income. Now working for tips, she makes about $200 a day, up from $120 before. If the tipped wage were eliminated, “I would definitely not stay in the industry,” she said. This was one of several conflicts that Colors hoped to solve. Saru Jayaraman, the president of Restaurant Opportunities, said that the no-tipping model is not what her organization is advocating for. It wants — and has successfully established in seven states so far — a continually increasing minimum wage for tipped workers. The tips of servers in California, where such a practice exists, have remained consistent since wages were increased, Ms. Jayaraman said. Many servers in Maine, however, successfully organized to have their salaries lowered in 2017 after a referendum the year before had increased their wages. The reason? Many had already noticed their tips were disappearing. Barbara Sibley, the owner of La Palapa in the East Village, said she was torn when it came to raising wages. “The structural things Saru talks about — sexual harassment — are true, but I can’t change the experience for my guests here,” she said. “Regulatory things have a real impact on the ground floor.” Shortly after Sept. 11, 2001, a union leader for Windows on the World, approached Ms. Jayaraman, who was then a young, ambitious lawyer, to help find jobs for the displaced workers. She had a fervor for workers rights and an impressive resume: degrees from UCLA, Harvard and Yale. But she had never worked in a restaurant. Still, she met with 250 former Windows employees. In 2002, she helped found Restaurant Opportunities Centers United. Its mission was “to organize workers to improve wages and working conditions throughout the restaurant industry,” Ms. Jayaraman wrote in her 2013 book, “Behind the Kitchen Door.” Over the years, Ms. Jayaraman, now the president of Restaurant Opportunities Centers United and the director of the Food Labor Research Center at U.C. Berkeley, became a voice for minorities, immigrants and women in the industry, helping win back more than $10 million in stolen tips and wages. She’s known for her work ethic and ability to rally a room. Francesco Palmieri, a chef who worked at Colors when it first opened, called her a trailblazer. Starting around 2003, Restaurant Opportunities raised more than $2.8 million to open Colors. Fekkak Mamdouh, a former Windows on the World worker and a co-founder of Restaurant Opportunities, had the idea for Colors. “With Windows on the World, we were like a family, a real family,” he said. “I was hoping to have a restaurant where all of us could work together and stay together.” A 6,000-square-foot space on Lafayette Street, next to the Public Theater, had been designated for the restaurant, and Restaurant Opportunities set up the corporate entity, 417 Lafayette LLC, to own and operate it. “Everyone had great hopes for the place,” said Raymond Mohan, the executive chef of Colors when it opened. From the beginning, workers believed in the mission of the restaurant to lift them up and treat them fairly. Some Restaurant Opportunities members were even offered a stake in Colors during the planning stages, when the concept of the restaurant being a worker-owned cooperative had been discussed. The momentum for wanting Colors to succeed was palpable. A Time Out review from 2006 started out with the restaurant’s “warm and fuzzy back story” and said it had “potential for a great new restaurant.” It brought up the international the staff and described a “swank Art Deco” interior. But that was where the good will stopped. “Sadly, the feel-good restaurant of the year — the place we all want to root for — just does not seem ready for prime time,” the review said. Among some Restaurant Opportunities members, there was conflict from the start, beginning with the logic of opening a cavernous space in a hot neighborhood like NoHo. “A lot of the people in Colors are minorities,” said Behzad Pasdar, a member of the committee helping to create Colors. “So why aren’t we going into Queens and opening a cool little Mexican restaurant?” Just a year later, Mr. Pasdar and seven other Restaurant Opportunities members sued Restaurant Opportunities and Ms. Jayaraman. The members had performed what Ms. Jayaraman called “sweat equity” — fund-raising, picketing restaurants, catering, meeting politicians — in order to become worker-owners of Colors when it opened. When some voiced fears that the co-op model they were promised might not pan out, they were expelled, according to the complaint. Ms. Jayaraman said that Mr. Pasdar and the others involved in the suit left the organization on their own accord, before the restaurant had even opened. “It was a shame, because it was a great idea,” said Arthur Schwartz, the lawyer for the plaintiffs. “That they were behind putting together a worker-owned co-op gave ROC panache in the political world, but it never happened the way they said it would.” Ms. Jayaraman said that Colors did indeed become a cooperative-owned restaurant for at least seven years. The suit was dismissed after the federal court ruled that the plaintiffs were not “employees” under the Fair Labor Standards Act. All the while, Ms. Jayamaran effortlessly moved among the powerful, advocating for restaurant workers’ rights. In 2013, as Colors was still finding its footing, Restaurant Opportunities started One Fair Wage. The campaign has garnered an outpouring of celebrity and political backing in recent years. Hillary Clinton stopped by Colors during her presidential campaign. Mayor Bill de Blasio visited on Sept. 11, 2016. This year alone, Amy Poehler took Ms. Jayaraman to the Golden Globes. Sarah Jessica Parker auctioned off her dress and jewelry at a Dolce & Gabbana party to benefit Restaurant Opportunities, and she also hosted a charity dinner for One Fair Wage. And most recently, Jane Fonda, who is campaigning for One Fair Wage, called Ms. Jayaraman “the Cesar Chavez of restaurant workers.” Restaurant Opportunities is now urging people to sign a letter to Mr. Cuomo in support of One Fair Wage. When Colors first opened on Lafayette Street, it offered training and gave restaurant novices hands-on experience. Chris Sciarrotta, a waiter from Long Island, needed serving experience in Manhattan. David Cardenas, who had emigrated from Cuba, wanted to learn how to tend bar. Ashley Ogogor, a waitress from Texas, learned about silverware placement. Working at Colors provided a foot in the door for them. “I was talking to the clients I was handling money. They trusted me,” said Mr. Cardenas, who ended up working as a bartender at Colors. Many of the staffers also became politically involved. In October 2014, Mr. Sciarrotta and Ms. Ogogor, while working for the restaurant, were also campaigning on behalf of One Fair Wage. They spoke at events like a wage board hearing in Harlem. But they were also noticing that their paychecks from Colors were arriving late. For them, it was a convergence of idealism versus practicality. “I was like, ‘Listen, I’m all about giving tipped workers who are sub-minimum wage higher pay and better working practices,’” Mr. Sciarrotta said. “‘I totally advocate it. But your point of view isn’t working right now, so I don’t want to be on a sinking ship when I also have bills to pay.’ I was all about helping them out, but when their ideologies weren’t on par with what I needed, I was just done.” Workers at Colors were paid a fair wage, sometimes up to $13 an hour. But foot traffic in the restaurant was lacking, several servers said, so it was difficult to make decent tips. “I’m sure mistakes were made, things were challenging,” said Ms. Jayaraman, who had moved to California by 2011. She said that she didn’t know Mr. Sciarrotta or Ms. Ogogor, but that the delayed checks issue was “unacceptable.” Over the years, Colors had several makeovers. “It had become a restaurant in the wallpaper of New York,” said Stephen Zagor, the former dean of business and industries at the Institute of Culinary Education. “You never heard about it.” In 2014, it even switched to gluten-free fare, the trend of the moment, but it made little difference. Wages fluctuated, Mr. Sciarrotta said, and paychecks were increasingly late. The bar couldn’t afford mint for cocktails and downgraded to a cheaper chardonnay. The kitchen was regularly running out of staples like fish and steak, servers said. In 2017, the landlord of Colors died, and the restaurant’s rent skyrocketed. Colors relocated to the Lower East Side. At its new location on Stanton Street, the restaurant lasted only a few months, as it waited on a liquor license and then the air-conditioner broke during a very hot summer. But Colors has continued as a training institute and sometimes holds special events. Ms. Jayaraman said that early into the Colors experiment, she realized that its true purpose was to teach restaurant skills and empower workers, which it what it has focused on since 2007. Training facilities, called CHOW (Colors Hospitality Opportunities for Workers), have expanded into nine states, she said. And come next March, Colors 2.0 will open on Stanton Street. Workers will be paid fair wages, said Ms. Jayaraman, thanks to a new business partner. “We decided we’d focus on the training and work with experienced partners to run the restaurant,” said Ms. Jayaraman. Owning a restaurant is not for wimps. Those who work in the industry “have chosen to do a very hard thing, with a very limited statistical probability of ever making any real money: serving food to people,” Anthony Bourdain once wrote. With over 25,000 restaurants across all five boroughs, staying relevant and popular — while swimming with real estate sharks and fickle consumers — is a serious challenge. Arguably, a restaurant such as the original Colors on Lafayette, may have aimed a bit too high for a first try. Others think Colors was simply ahead of its time. “In point of fact, it might work better now than it did then,” said Mr. Wolf, the restaurant consultant. “We’re seeing the minimum wage thing and the #MeToo thing, and the tip-credit thing all be focused on semblance of fairness of people who work in restaurants.” Emma’s Torch, a nonprofit restaurant that employs and trains refugees, for example, opened in Carroll Gardens in May. “More and more the notion of a restaurant as fancy people being served by their lessers is anachronistic,” Mr. Wolf said. “And I think we’ll see some of the things evident of Colors come back again and again.” We’re already seeing it: Colors New York is preparing to make its comeback as a full-service restaurant next year, while One Fair Wage is gaining steam, with campaigns underway across the country. In New York, backers and opponents of the tip credit are anxious to hear the Department of Labor’s recommendation. Ms. Jayaraman says she thinks that the restaurant industry is resistant to change — in particular, to increased wages for all — but that it’s doable, and the time is now. “Portraying it as doom and gloom doesn’t match with the data,” she said, citing thriving restaurant scenes in California and Oregon, which have embraced One Fair Wage. “I think the real concern is if New York moves to One Fair Wage, the National Restaurant Association knows what we already know: that other states will follow.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Misguided Priorities of Our Educational System,"Opinion We spend too much money on college students and not enough on everyone else. Students learning technical and manufacturing skills as part of a high school program in San Antonio.CreditCreditIlana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times Mr. Cass is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. Consider two high school seniors — one who exhibits strong academic talent and one who does not. For one, December marks the homestretch of a yearslong effort, intensively supported by his school, to prepare the perfect college application. For the other, December is just another month on the path to, well, whatever might come after graduation. The former will likely proceed steadily toward a bachelor’s degree; the latter is unlikely to finish college if he enrolls at all. To whom does our education system owe what? That second student, to be clear, has done nothing wrong. He probably clawed his way through his town’s standard college-oriented curriculum, though it neither targeted his interests and abilities nor prepared him for work force success. Looking ahead, he faces a labor market in which he may need to work harder than his college-bound counterpart for lower pay, with fewer options and slower advancement. Yet we celebrate the first student and lavish taxpayer funds on his education. To the second student, we offer little beyond a sympathetic “Sorry.” Our education system has become one of our nation’s most regressive institutions. After high school graduation, the first student can access more than $10,000 annually in public funds to support his college experience. Federal funding for higher education has grown by 133 percent in the past 30 years; combined with tax breaks, loan subsidies and state-level funding, the annual total exceeds $150 billion. That funding will cover not only genuine instructional costs, but also state-of-the-art gyms, psychiatric and career counseling services, and whatever social programming the student-life bureaucracy can conceive. At Ohio State, students living off campus get free fire alarms. The second graduate likely gets nothing. Annual federal funding for a non-college, vocational pathway, at both the high school and postsecondary levels, totals $1 billion. Certainly, he will need to buy his own fire alarm. One explanation for this bizarre state of affairs, in which society invests heavily in those headed for economic success while ignoring those falling behind, is the widespread belief that everyone can be a college graduate. If that were true, the shove toward the college pipeline might make sense. But most young Americans do not achieve even a community-college degree. Federal data show that fewer than one in five students smoothly navigate the high school to college to career pathway. More students fail to complete high school on time, more fail to move on from high school to college, and more drop out of college. Forty years of reform, accompanied by a doubling of per pupil spending, has failed to improve this picture. Standardized test scores haven’t budged. SAT scores have declined. More students enroll in college, but the share of 25-year-olds with a bachelor’s degree did not increase from 1995 to 2015, and it stands barely above the 1975 level. A second explanation is the widespread belief that a college diploma is a necessary and sufficient “ticket to the middle class.” If that were true, even a small chance at escaping the supposedly sad fate of inadequate education is better than ever admitting defeat. But while the median college graduate earns more than the median high school graduate, those workers are not the same person — indeed, they are likely people with very different academic prospects. Look instead at the wage distributions for more comparable samples: those with earnings toward the high end for workers with only high school degrees and those at the low end among college graduates. The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that high school grads with above-average earnings (50th to 90th percentile) earn $34,000 to $70,000 annually. College grads with below-average earnings (10th to 50th percentile) earn $28,000 to $58,000. Pushing people from the former category to attend college and land in the latter category does them few favors. And remember, that assumes they graduate; people in their position typically will not. Remember also, those are the outcomes before we attempt to create an attractive non-college pathway that they might prefer and that might equip them for success. What might such a pathway look like? For the roughly $100,000 that the public spends to carry many students through high school and college today, we could offer instead two years of traditional high school, a third year that splits time between a sophisticated vocational program and a subsidized internship, two more years split between subsidized work and employer-sponsored training, and a savings account with $25,000, perhaps for future training. Any American could have, at age 20, three years of work experience, an industry credential and earnings in the bank. To reverse the system’s regressive nature, we should shift our college subsidies toward funding this new pathway. The burden of financing a college education remains manageable for those who actually graduate and use their degrees. They will still be the economy’s winners, even while paying off loans. That some young Americans assume unaffordable debts is not an argument for yet more spending on college, but rather a reminder that its value proposition can prove to be a poor one. For student borrowers unlikely to graduate, the current subsidies succeed mainly in luring them toward a substantial investment of time and money that is both high-risk and low-return. If a good alternative existed, they would be well served to take it. Certainly, the choice should remain theirs. But to decide wisely whether college is worth the cost, they need to actually face the cost. People often applaud vocational education in theory, provided it is “for someone else’s kids.” Those kids are most kids, and a false promise of college success does more harm than good. We owe them our focus and the best pathway that we can construct — one that carries them as close as possible to the destination their college-bound peers will reach, and sometimes beyond.

2018,The Misleading Claim That $21 Trillion in Misspent Pentagon Funds Could Pay for ‘Medicare for All’,"Fact Check of the Day Representative-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the rising liberal star, cited a figure that refers to nearly two decades of internal financial adjustments, not actual spending. What Was Said The Facts Representative-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York Democrat who has become a darling of the progressive left, was quoting from an article in The Nation about “massive accounting fraud” committed by the Pentagon from 1998 to 2015. But her suggestion that the $21 trillion in military transactions could have “already” paid two-thirds the cost of a “Medicare for all” health care system goes beyond what the article reported — and is misleading. For starters, the combined Pentagon budget from 1998 to 2015 was $9.2 trillion. One study by a libertarian economic think tank found that “Medicare for all” legislation by Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, would cost the federal government $32.6 trillion over 10 years. So where did the $21 trillion figure originate? It comes from an analysis of the Pentagon’s “unsupported journal voucher adjustments,” by Mark Skidmore, an economist at Michigan State University. The term refers to improperly documented accounting adjustments that are made when different financial ledgers do not match. In other words, $21 trillion is the total value of adjustments made to the Pentagon’s financial records over those years that could not be traced. That is not the same thing as $21 trillion in spending. David Norquist, the Pentagon’s comptroller, explained in testimony to Congress in January that the adjustments occur after money is spent because “we have systems that do not automatically pass data from one to the other.” For example, Mr. Norquist said, the Army’s general ledger may initially estimate the cost of property and equipment. That estimate is later updated with a more specific cost, based on the actual value of property. In the 2015 fiscal year, the Army general fund reported making about $1 trillion worth of adjustments to its assets, according to the Defense Department’s inspector general. It also made about $1 trillion in adjustment to its liabilities. Together, that accounted for $2 trillion in adjustments — even though the actual dollar amounts potentially offset each other. “I wouldn’t want the taxpayer to confuse that with not — with the loss of something like a trillion dollars. It’s not. That wouldn’t be accurate,” Mr. Norquist said. “But it’s an accounting problem that does need to be solved, because it can help hide other underlying issues.” In an interview, Professor Skidmore faulted the Pentagon for its lack of transparency and expressed skepticism that mismatches in property evaluations could account for all $21 trillion. He noted that large state governments like New York and California will make similar adjustments, but equivalent to small percentages of their budgets — not magnitudes larger. The Pentagon’s adjustments could well be “accounting gimmicks to reconcile accounts, fine — or something else, I don’t know,” Professor Skidmore said. “I’m just absolutely perplexed. Why not have the underlying information?” The same article from The Nation that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez quoted also noted that Professor Skidmore’s analysis “does not contend that all of this $21 trillion was secret or misused funding” and that the transfers “are found on both the positive and the negative sides of the ledger, thus potentially netting each other out.” Todd Harrison, the director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the $21 trillion figure “double and triple counts funding that is transferred internally.” “And just because a transaction cannot be fully traced and documented does not mean it was fraudulent or wasted,” Mr. Harrison said. Instead, it means the Defense Department “has not been able to pass an audit,” he said. The Pentagon did indeed fail an audit in November.

2018,Opinion | The Most Distant Place We’ve Visited,"Overnight tonight, the New Horizons spacecraft will fly by a small world called Ultima Thule — an auspicious beginning to 2019. Dr. Stern is a planetary scientist who leads NASA’s New Horizons mission. It sounds like science fiction, but it’s not. Overnight tonight, on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day, an American spacecraft called New Horizons will fly by and explore the most distant place ever visited: a small world called Ultima Thule. Twenty-five hundred men and women across the United States worked to design and build New Horizons, its rocket and its nuclear power supply, and to launch it into space and to fly it across the solar system. In 2015, New Horizons became the first spacecraft to explore Pluto. Now on Ultima’s doorstep, it is a mind-boggling four billion miles from Earth. This spacecraft, this distant sentinel, is an amazing piece of American workmanship, operating essentially flawlessly in space for well over a decade, with no backup ship and with no second chance to visit any world it has explored. Fifty years ago this week, during the Christmas holidays of 1968, another American spacecraft, Apollo 8, was launched and made the first voyage of humans to another world — our moon. In the half century since, we in the United States went on to send the first humans to walk the moon and to send robots to explore every planet known at the birth of the space age. This week, New Horizons will continue in that legacy of inquisitiveness, soft-power projection and pure scientific exploration. The legacy of American leadership in space isn’t just for history books. It spurs technological development. It has inspired countless careers in science, technology, mathematics and engineering. It is a big reason we have had visionary space pioneers as diverse as Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Mae Jemison, Sally Ride and Carl Sagan. And it has created new knowledge that the United States continues to make freely available to anyone and everyone in the world who wishes to learn from it. As a result of these accomplishments, iconic American names like Apollo, Hubble, Cassini and New Horizons are known throughout the world. These accomplishments have laid a foundation for what may someday be a broadly space-faring human species, representing the first steps in an expansive new phase of human history, beyond our cradle Earth. Our flyby of Ultima Thule by New Horizons is just around the corner. That exploration will provide an auspicious beginning to 2019, the 50th-anniversary year of Apollo’s first moon landing — perhaps, in the long view, the most important historical event of the 20th century. Ultima Thule is 17,000 times as far away as the “giant leap” of Apollo’s lunar missions. The exploration at Ultima Thule is a fitting way to honor the brash exploration and boldness that was Apollo. As you celebrate New Year’s Day, cast an eye upward and think for a moment about the amazing things our country and our species can do when we set our minds to it. And picture for a moment that American spacecraft, New Horizons, billions of miles from home, exploring, as Apollo did, for all humankind.

2018,The Most Entertaining Videos T Made in 2018,"T’s Best of 2018 Sit back and watch our Q. and A. with George R. R. Martin, a groundbreaking pas de deux and Natasha Lyonne’s crossword jokes. For our inaugural online art issue, the visual artist and collector Cary Leibowitz — known in the ’80s and ’90s as “Candy Ass” — took us on a tour of his jam-packed Harlem abode. “My house has a lot of stuff in it,” he said. “Some people are shocked when they come in, which is not my objective.” Among the standout pieces in his home are Joan Collins’s old desk, a bust of George Washington, Budweiser-print wallpaper and a Nelson Mandela couch — with an outfit to match. From Broadway to the experimental downtown scene, theater in New York ruled supreme in the early 1980s. As part of our annual Culture issue, which this year focused on the city from 1981-83, we assembled some of the era’s notable alumni for a photo shoot. Watch as they catch up with one another and remember how it all began. As part of our ongoing video series Read T a Poem, the award-winning actress Glenn Close recited “Old Wives’ Tales on Which I Was Fed” by Jenny Xie. The craft-obsessed fashion designer Adam Selman was an obvious candidate for T’s video series Make T Something, in which participants create something in under an hour using only a few select items and one object of their choosing. For inspiration, Selman mined his own life: “I’ve been hitting the gym hard lately,” explained the designer, who swears by Barry’s Bootcamp (“I need someone to yell at me”). Watch the video to see what he made. The author of “A Game of Thrones” — and one of the six cover subjects of T’s 2018 Greats issue — gamely answered (or tellingly declined to respond to) a selection of queries from New York Times employees, on film. Here’s what he had to say about his favorite books, where he gets his signature hats and the “Game of Thrones” character that reminds him the most of Trump. Read the full Q&A here. For a feature in T’s winter Travel issue, the writer David Ebershoff explored how a group of gay male ballet dancers is rethinking masculinity. Among them are Preston Chamblee and Taylor Stanley, who perform part of a pas de deux that was choreographed specifically for two men in the video above. “If you didn’t know much about classical ballet, you might think it’s an obvious home for queer artists and narratives,” Ebershoff remarks, “but it’s more complicated than that: Ballet, of course, has always had gay dancers and choreographers and homoeroticism, but it’s an artistic discipline shaped by tradition.” Here, the painter and sculptor Glenn Ligon talks about an artwork that has been particularly important to him: “Self-Portrait Exaggerating My Negroid Features” (1981) by Adrian Piper. Ligon first encountered Piper’s work in 1980, but it wasn’t until two decades later, at her New Museum retrospective, that he came face-to-face with the small pencil drawing. As part of our video series Tell T a Joke, noted funny person and “Orange Is the New Black” actress Natasha Lyonne broached a truly Timesian subject: the crossword puzzle. The artist Manuel Solano’s earliest paintings were all about subtle gradient and tone; photo-realistic objects emerged from mist or disappeared in receding space. But in early 2014, the Mexico City-based painter started to go blind as a result of an H.I.V.-related infection. Since then, Solano’s blindness has become complete. It has also become a new way of seeing. The artist has developed techniques for navigating blindness through each new series of paintings, including five large-scale works displayed at this year’s New Museum Triennial. We visited Solano in Mexico City. For our Holiday issue, we brought together a group of 32 American men, who, with their peers, are producing literature that is essential to how we understand our country and its place in the world right now. Here, the director Yvonne Shirley captures the writers on set at the Brooklyn Historical Society — and they reflect on the literary women who have shaped their work.",The New York Times
2018,"The Most Important Kitchen Tools This Holiday (or Any Season, Really)","Tech We’re Using Tech has brought innovation, convenience and smarts to the kitchen. Here’s what Melissa Clark uses and the tools she finds indispensable. How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Melissa Clark, a food writer for The Times, discussed the tech she’s using. This time of year, you test and write lots of recipes. What are your most important kitchen tools and tech products for doing your work? The most important kitchen tool that I use for developing recipes is my trusty Polder digital scale. No matter the recipe, I measure the volume and weigh every ingredient, from the large onions (7 ounces each) I sauté for my Spaghetti With Caramelized Onions, to a cup of flour (125 grams) for my Olive Oil Sea Salt Brownies. At the Food section, we are urging people to move from volume measurements to using weights, which is much more precise. While this isn’t a big deal for roast chickens and lentil soups, it can make a tremendous difference in baking. For example, that cup of flour might weigh anywhere from 120 grams to 150 grams depending on how you packed it, which can mean the rise or fall of your no-knead bread. Weighing gives the baker a much more consistent result. I’m also dependent on my fancy Thermapen instant read digital thermometer, which can tell me if my turkey thighs have reached the required 165 degrees or whether my homemade yogurt is fermenting at the necessary 110 degrees. You don’t strictly need a digital thermometer for this, but I like its speed and accuracy. The large readout doesn’t hurt when I’m bending over the turkey pan in the oven, either. Of course, no matter how turkey-splattered or floury my hands get, my iPhone 8 is always within reach. I use the flashlight to see in the depths of the oven, the timer function to remind me to check the beans, and the camera to take pictures of the finished dishes so I can post them on Instagram, which is my social media addiction of choice (I’m @clarkbar). But my favorite kitchen tech is an old darkroom timer. It’s easy to use with messy hands, and the buzzer makes an unholy racket that keeps me from burning things in the oven while I’m multitasking on the iPhone. Is there a new or innovative kitchen tool you’ve recently adopted? I’ve become smitten with my electric pressure cooker, the Instant Pot Duo 6-quart. I wrote about using electric pressure cookers for NYT Cooking and then wrote two cookbooks, because one wasn’t enough to get all my ideas out into the world. I love my Instant Pot for two reasons: convenience and speed. I can load it up with all the ingredients, plug it in, and go for a run (or to the office). Then when I come back, I’m starving and dinner is ready. It’s a lot like a slow cooker in terms of its convenience, but cooks things in minutes instead of hours. It can cook dried chickpeas or beans from scratch, without soaking first, in under an hour. And it produces the most incredible ribs, stews, and braised pork, which is exactly what you want this time of year. Since I got one I’ve given up my crockpot and formerly beloved rice cooker, which are no longer needed in my kitchen. Plenty of our readers are just learning how to cook, a process that can be intimidating. What basic tools should they buy to get started? I truly believe the best tech you can get for a new cook is a subscription to NYT Cooking. It’s a vast and deep world of over 19,000 recipes, guides and videos that can teach novices and delight and enthrall more experienced cooks. Also, I think the digital scale I mention above should be standard-issue equipment in everyone’s kitchen. It’s one thing — like a good knife and a sturdy skillet — that will really make a positive difference in cooking, especially if you’re learning. Once you start weighing ingredients for your Sunday morning pancake batter, you’ll never go back to cups and spoons. A scale is cheap and compact, and now you don’t have to wash measuring cups. Beyond your job, what tech product do you and your family love and why? People often ask me how I stay fit as a food writer who constantly taste-tests brownies and cheese fondues and the like, and the answer is that I’ve been a runner since I was 17. My Garmin GPS watch spurs me on to run faster, and I link it to the Strava running app on my phone, which keeps track of my mileage so I can set goals — and sometimes even reach them. My Breville electric kettle has five temperature settings, which I actually use depending on what I’m making. I start out with boiling water for my morning cup of strong Assam with milk, then go progressively lower from there, 205 degrees for lemon verbena, 195 degrees for the hot ginger lemon water I drink all winter long, 175 degrees for my afternoon green tea before ending up back at 212 degrees for my nighttime toddy just before bed. Our Brooklyn townhouse is drafty this time of year, so sipping hot beverages all day long helps. There’s always music playing in our house, a mix ranging from the “Mamma Mia” soundtrack to Debussy and U.S. Girls. My husband and I ripped two lifetimes’ worth of CDs into a digital blob, which we listen to all over the house using Roon, which is a music player like iTunes but with a much cleaner interface and it’s easier to control, plus Tidal for streaming, because it has better sound than Spotify. We stream WFMU and BBC Radio 3 through Roon, and my husband buys a lot of our music on Bandcamp, a site where artists and labels sell their music directly, as files, CDs or vinyl. Cookbooks or touch-screen tablets — what medium is better for looking at recipes? It’s not about either-or, it’s about both. The question is, where and when. On the couch or in bed, nothing beats the feel and heft of a cookbook in your hands. But touch-screen tablets, and phones for that matter, make searching for recipes and how-to cooking videos on the fly easy and faster. I think people gain inspiration from cookbooks, which is important when you’re dreaming about cooking. But for actual day-to-day getting dinner on the table, these days a tablet or phone is indispensable.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Most Important Story of 2018,"It’s not the obvious one. It’s the one that will affect our grandkids. Opinion Columnist This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. A global heat wave. Extreme rainstorms. Severe droughts. Rapidly intensifying Gulf Coast storms. The deadliest wildfire in California history. And a presidential administration that’s trying to make the problem worse. There were more obvious big news stories than climate change in 2018. But there weren’t any more important stories, in my view. That’s why it is my choice for the top story of the year. It’s the one most likely to affect the lives of future generations. I sometimes feel guilty that I don’t write about climate change more often. From week to week, there isn’t as much new to say about it as there is about, say, President Trump. So I’ve devoted my final column of the year to the subject. I argue that, while the climate news this year was overwhelmingly grim, there were still two reasons for hope. [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] This concludes my countdown of the top five most significant stories of 2018. I realize I didn’t come close to covering everything important that happened this year. If I were doing a top 10 or top 20, I also would have found room for Brexit; family separations at the border; Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation; the continuing #MeToo fallout; the increasing assertiveness of China; the departure of Trump aides who constrained the president; and the tentative signs of an economic slowdown. Now onto 2019 — with hopes for a better year than the one that ends today. Related. Yesterday, “Meet the Press” devoted its entire show to climate change. It was a welcome change from just a few weeks ago, when the show hosted a climate denier as an expert panelist. On yesterday’s show, Chuck Todd, the host, said: “We're not going to debate climate change, the existence of it. The Earth is getting hotter. And human activity is a major cause, period. We're not going to give time to climate deniers. The science is settled, even if political opinion is not.” For more on the climate, be sure to read Justin Gillis’s recent Op-Ed arguing that a carbon tax isn’t the most effective way to address climate change, as well as pieces by Paul Bledsoe and The Times Editorial Board.

2018,The Most Memorable Lines That Made It Into The Times This Year,"TIMES INSIDER We asked our reporters, editors and critics to share some of their favorite lines of 2018 — the funny, the poetic, the astonishing and the surreal. I have written many, many words for The New York Times over the past 20 years. About actual wars between Israel and the Gaza Strip, and about intellectual wars between creationists and scientists. About political campaigns and school shootings. About a small town in the Midwest that tried to ban lying, and a small hummus place in the Mideast that tried to promote peace. As a news reporter, I mostly focused on writing clearly and fairly. But sometimes I tried to play poet. My best line was in a 2001 piece about the persistence of corporal punishment in public schools. At the time, 27 states had banned it, but the federal government estimated that 365,000 children a year were still paddled by principals and teachers. Most of these, I wrote, were in “a swath of Southern states that could be called the Belt Belt.” The capitalization may have been a bit much, but I still think it works. We asked some of our journalists to share their favorite lines of 2018. A selection follows. — Jodi Rudoren, associate managing editor By Choire Sicha, Styles editor, in a Tech We’re Using column in which he describes his codependent relationship with his smartphone: The best part of how they’ll put the phone in our heads is that when the seawaters all rise, the phone will be the last part of us to get wet. — Just Embed a Phone Into This Editor’s Mind, Already By Talya Minsberg, senior staff editor, in her article about how she decided to run two marathons back to back: My sister, an accomplished running coach, rolled her eyes when I told her my plans. “You’re an idiot,” she said.

2018,The Most Memorable TV Episodes of 2018,"Many of us watch television in batches now, inhaling seasons and whole series in snack-fueled sessions where individual episodes run together, differentiated by just a few impatient clicks of the remote. But the people who make those series still build them episode by episode, constructing individual half-hours and hours that can knock you out. [Read about the best TV shows of 2018.] There may be no one at the office the next day who’s watching the same show you are, so consider this collection of memorable episodes from 2018, presented alphabetically by series, your virtual watercooler. MIKE HALE ‘Teddy Perkins’ Fame, in “Atlanta,” has been a fantasy, a disappointment, an elusive taunt. This time, it’s a gothic horror story. The eccentric title character (Donald Glover, encased in ghoulish prosthetics) haunts a mansion that serves as a shrine and a prison for his brother, a once-renowned musician. It’s also a museum, honoring Teddy’s father — represented in the form of a faceless mannequin — who tormented his sons toward greatness (like the fathers of Michael Jackson and Marvin Gaye, both mentioned in the episode). It’s a poignant, creepy showcase for the deadpan Lakeith Stanfield and for Glover, who depicted entertainment culture as a mask for nightmares in “This Is America,” and here plays a monster made out of dreams. (Watch on FX Plus.) JAMES PONIEWOZIK Read more about the second season of “Atlanta.” ‘START’ Equal parts tragic and tense, the series finale for “The Americans” pulled off the nearly impossible: A conclusion that felt startling but appropriate. Complete. We knew there would have to be some kind of reckoning between the Jenningses and Stan, but it could have been violent or unhinged or less truthful. What we got was a standoff in a parking garage, with Stan pointing his gun at Philip, Elizabeth and Paige, his surrogate family, his best friends. I thought he might shoot them, and then I thought he might shoot himself. But enough people have died on “The Americans” for the characters to know that death isn’t always a punishment, and it certainly isn’t the harshest one. The rending of one’s identity — not being able to be who you were before, to know who you knew, to love who you loved, to trust your own thoughts, to have a cohesive and continuing story of yourself — creates a permanent wound. It’s one Philip and Elizabeth grappled with for the entire series, and one they inflicted on their children and on Stan. (Watch on FX Plus.) MARGARET LYONS [Read more about the series finale of “The Americans.”] ‘The Planned Parenthood Show’ The raunchy animated puberty-com has always been more sweet and insightful than its hormone-drenched premise might lead you to believe. Here, it became a downright public service. When well-meaning ignoramus Coach Steve (Nick Kroll) is assigned to teach sex-ed, his students end up taking over the lesson with sketches, fantasy sequences and parodies. (These include a “Bachelor”-style reality show in which a condom, an I.U.D. and other options compete with “the pullout method” to become a teenager’s contraception method of choice.) The story of terminating an unplanned pregnancy — scored entirely to, and reprising the video of, “Groove Is in the Heart” by Deee-Lite — made for a couple of the most ingenious, and oddly heartwarming, minutes of TV this year. (Watch on Netflix.) JAMES PONIEWOZIK ‘Just One of the Boyz 4 Now for Now’ The ever-optimistic Tina meets the latest love of her life (“I’m not boy-crazy, I’m boy-focused”), and in order to see him again she has to disguise herself and sneak into auditions for a struggling boy band. Of course. “Bob’s Burgers” is a model of consistency in its writing and delineation of its characters, a family of lovable misfits who run a diner you probably wouldn’t want to eat at, and any number of episodes could have made this list. The Season 9 premiere gets the nod for its closing musical number, in which Tina rides a unicorn while musing on “the right number of boys” in a girl’s life. (Watch on Fox.com and Hulu.) MIKE HALE ‘Free Churro’ This is the best episode of anything I saw in 2018. It’s a distillation of everything “BoJack Horseman” does right: A genius articulation of misery that’s never more than a few seconds from a 10/10 joke, and an experiment in form and structure. “Free Churro” is a 25-minute monologue, with BoJack eulogizing his awful mother, whom he hated and who hated him right back. He acknowledges their mutual bitterness, his father’s grave shortcomings and cruelty, his frustrations. The speech is full of haunting and hilarious and memorable lines, but most telling is BoJack’s digression about his ’90s sitcom, “Horsin’ Around,” a vintage schlockola show in the vein of “Full House” or “Family Matters.” “You can’t have happy endings in sitcoms, not really, because, if everyone’s happy, the show would be over, and above all else, the show has to keep going,” BoJack says. That’s what he really thinks, but it’s completely wrong — all you have are happy endings on those shows, everything always works out. People hug, people forgive. Happy family homeostasis. Thanks to his terrible parents and their terrible parents and whoever else, BoJack doesn’t see things that way; if all life is sadness, then at least sadness is life. “You can never get a happy ending, cause there’s always more show,” he says. Maybe that’s only true for BoJack. And “BoJack.” (Watch on Netflix.) MARGARET LYONS [Read a conversation with the creator of “BoJack Horseman” about Season 5.] ‘Season 4, Episode 8’ The Swedish actress Sofia Helin gave an uncompromising performance as a damaged, obsessional detective across the four seasons of this Danish-Swedish twist on the buddy-cop series. She also burned her character’s habitual cellphone salutation — “Saga Norén, Länskrim Malmö,” identifying herself as a member of the Malmo criminal investigation division — into the brains of TV viewers in 160 countries. The series finale, written by the show’s creator, Hans Rosenfeldt, put the perfect cap on her portrayal, in a moment that was simple, predictable and utterly moving. (Watch on Hulu.) MIKE HALE ‘The Queen’ This puzzle-series pastiche of Stephen King had its finest hour with its study of Ruth Deaver (Sissy Spacek), a woman lost in the corridors of dementia. While many TV episodes these days play with four-dimensional narratives and unreliable perceptions, “The Queen” stayed heartbreakingly grounded in character by anchoring itself in Ruth’s point-of-view. As we drift from present to past, from sweetness to tragedy, we are tethered to reality, along with Ruth, by the markers she set for herself: the chess pieces (from a reproduction of the beautiful Lewis chessmen) that she’s scattered around her home like a bread crumb trail. Spacek is measured and devastating as she takes us on a tour of Ruth’s life, pausing every once in a while to light on one of the game pieces and their quiet message: “I was here.” (Watch on Hulu.) JAMES PONIEWOZIK [Read more about “Castle Rock.”] ‘The Good Twin’ TV shows about TV shows often give you only a taste of what their fictional creations are like. (Think of the tiny glimpses of “TGS” on “30 Rock.”) But this full-length faux episode of the basic-cable women’s wrestling series, shot in ready-for-VHS standard definition (with a 1980s soundtrack and graphics to match), delivered wonderfully. “The Good Twin” — the title comes from a soap-operatic twist that gives Alison Brie’s Soviet wrestling heel character a twin sister — was an entertaining novelty on its own. But befitting the show’s fixation on role-playing as liberation, the faux-“GLOW” also advances the story line by showing how each character has poured herself into her wrestling alter ego. (Watch on Netflix.) JAMES PONIEWOZIK [Read more about the second season of “GLOW.”] ‘Janet(s)’ D’Arcy Carden, D’Arcy Carden, D’Arcy Carden, D’Arcy Carden, D’Arcy Carden! This afterlife comedy’s not-so-secret weapon outdid herself in this showcase by playing her own character and four of the show’s leads. (Carden’s character, Janet, is an artificial intelligence possessed of infinite knowledge who inadvertently transforms the characters into her image by — you know what, I’m not going to explain it. Watch the show if you’re not already.) A tour de force performance, yes, but also proof that this series has written its characters so well, they can be present even when the actors who play them are absent. (Watch on NBC.com and Hulu.) JAMES PONIEWOZIK ‘Chapter 81’ “Jane the Virgin” pulled off the twist of the year in its season finale, an episode that openly announced its theme as surprise! — and yet still totally surprised me. There was so much to adore in this episode, too: Alba’s citizenship ceremony and impromptu wedding; Alba, Rogelio and Xiomara getting all misty when Rafael asks for their blessing before he and Jane get engaged; the perfectly clever cliffhanger hashtag #JRShotWho, after JR shot an unseen assailant. How foolish I was to think that was the big shocker for the episode. No, instead, in the final moment, when I was all whipped up into an “is Rafael going to propose to Jane, or is Jane going to propose to Rafael” frenzy, there was back-from-the-dead Michael. (Or so it seems. You never can tell on a telenovela.) I’m Team Rafael forever, but even I screamed. On another show it might have felt like a cheap move. But “Jane the Virgin” is among the most emotionally literate series of all time, and I trust it to be a careful steward of my weak, fallible heart. (Watch on CW.com and Netflix.) MARGARET LYONS ‘Kintsugi’ Frank Langella, formerly the secret weapon of “The Americans,” segued seamlessly into the same role on “Kidding,” where he plays the seemingly button-down, business-minded manager-father of the children’s TV star, Mr. Pickles, played by Jim Carrey. The first season’s seventh episode, named after a Japanese process for repairing broken pottery, typified the show’s narrative quirkiness: a scene on the set of the Japanese “Mr. Pickles,” a Christmas toy store riot, an office-destroying meltdown. At its heart was a family Thanksgiving that went terribly wrong, and that in two brief moments — a dirty anecdote and a shouted expletive — was totally stolen by Langella. (Watch on Sho.com.) MIKE HALE [Read more about Jim Carrey and “Kidding.”] I’m cheating, since these aren’t episodes but rather stand-up specials, but they’re two of my favorite things I saw this year. “Nanette” is Hannah Gadsby’s searing piece that deconstructs stand-up, rejects the patriarchy and reclaims personal trauma narratives — but, like, funny sometimes. “Kid Gorgeous” is John Mulaney’s exquisitely polished act that includes the instant-classic segment comparing Donald Trump’s presidency to a horse being trapped in a hospital. (Watch on Netflix.) MARGARET LYONS Read more about Hannah Gadsby. ‘Open Mic’ “Schitt’s Creek” is a show in balance, one where nuttiness is grounded by thoughtfulness, where chronic insults are soothed by consistent support. Never was this more sweetly depicted than in “Open Mic,” where David’s doting and lovable boyfriend Patrick suggests they throw an open mic night at David’s store, to drum up some additional buzz and business. David squirms and demurs. “Worst case scenario, we get some people in the store!” Patrick says. “No, worst case scenario, I watch improv,” David replies. In the end, the plan works, the store is packed and Patrick serenades David with a truly lovely acoustic cover of “Simply the Best.” It was one of the most romantic, adorable moments on TV this year. Awww. (Watch on poptv.com or Netflix.) MARGARET LYONS ‘The Lost Art of Forehead Sweat’ While the revival seasons of “The X-Files” were, broadly, not great, “The Lost Art of Forehead Sweat” is one of the best episodes the series ever aired. Of course it’s written by Darin Morgan, who wrote many of the original run’s best episodes, too. There’s a cheeky mischievousness to Morgan’s episodes, and here that manifests as a looping narrative and an unreliable yet compelling whistle blower known as Reggie Something. Mulder and Scully learn about the Mandela Effect — a collective misremembering named for the weirdly common false memory that Nelson Mandela died in the ’90s — and are faced with the fallibility of their memories, something the show addresses with both humor and genuine depth. This episode is what happens when “the truth is out there” and “trust no one” bump up against bogus cries of “fake news” and maybe aliens. (Watch on Fox.com and Hulu.)

2018,The Most Popular Recipes of 2018,"What to Cook Good morning. We mined our data to come up with a list of the 50 most popular new recipes on NYT Cooking this year. I’m super-stoked to report that the top slot went to Julia Moskin’s recipe for chicken francese (above), an American-Italian interpretation of French cooking that you’ll find on restaurant menus all over the United States but particularly in ones built under the low slate skies of Rochester, N.Y., where the dish is known as “chicken French.” A number-one position for the children of East Avenue, Upper Falls and Swillburg! A Kodak moment for Fairport and Greece, Brighton, Pittsford, Irondequoit! Chicken francese is a fantastic dish, easily made, with deep and abiding flavor that goes nicely alongside plain spaghetti tossed with olive oil and butter, a side of garlicky greens, some bread. Try it. Chicken French for all. Other top recipes this year included: Alison Roman’s salted chocolate chunk shortbread cookies; Melissa Clark’s sheet-pan chicken with sweet potatoes and peppers; the beef and broccoli I learned to make from the private chef Jonathan Wu and the restaurateur and chef Dale Talde; and Alison’s classic baked macaroni and cheese. Check out the complete list, and get cooking. Collect them all! You don’t have to cook a recipe tonight, of course. On Wednesdays I encourage you not to use recipes at all, but to engage in an exercise of improvisatory cooking, working off a narrative theme. For instance, bananas Foster. You can look at the recipe a predecessor of mine, Jane Nickerson, brought to The Times in 1957. Or you can riff off the experience I had on Saturday night at Commander’s Palace in New Orleans, where a top-tier captain named Samantha La Pointe-Woolf made the dish tableside, and made it the best I’ve ever had. All you need is a lot of butter, a lot of brown sugar, a couple of bananas, light rum, some banana liqueur if you have any (if you don’t, the rum’s just fine). Everything is ratio: Think about a half stick of unsalted butter for every two bananas, and about as much brown sugar. Melt and swirl the butter and sugar over medium-high heat to create a thick caramel, then add the bananas, peeled and halved, to get a little color on them. Sprinkle with cinnamon, add a half cup of rum and a splash of banana liqueur, then tip the pan slightly so the alcohol goes alight. WHOOSH GOES THE FLAME. Continue swirling until everything dies away, then spoon the caramel over the fruit again and serve with vanilla ice cream. You can find actual, tested, written and photographed recipes to cook right now on NYT Cooking. Like, for instance, this awesome salty-sour recipe for pork shoulder asado that Priya Krishna learned from Chad and Chase Valencia, brothers who own and run the Filipino restaurant Lasa in Los Angeles. Of course, you’ll need a subscription to access them. It will support everything we do. (If you want to redouble that sustenance, consider buying a gift subscription for someone else.) And have you signed up for Emily Weinstein’s newsletter “Five Weeknight Dishes”? That’s free. As are most of the things we post on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. We’ll be standing by to help, should anything go wrong along the way, either with your cooking or our technology. Just ask for help: cookingcare@nytimes.com. We will get back to you. Now, nothing whatsoever to do with persimmons or Moscow mules, but Baratunde Thurston recently introduced me to Detour, a kind of cool-kid tourism app that leads you on tours around cities across the United States and the world. (It’d be neat, we agreed, to write a fictional one for New York, a satirical guide to the East Village, say.) Bose bought the app a number of months ago to use as an experience for their forthcoming augmented reality platform, so act now. Here are The Buzzcocks, “Ever Fallen in Love,” an early-days video performance I hadn’t seen before and it’s terrific. (Pete Shelley, the band’s leader, died last week at 63.) Finally, I like this photo-audio feature in The California Sunday Magazine, a roundup of some Californians’ go-to meals. Check that out, and make bananas Foster for dessert tonight.

2018,Opinion | The Most Powerful Reject in the World,"Is there anyone who wants to hang with Donald Trump? Opinion Columnist He’s not wanted. Not at funerals, though the Bush family, to show class and respect for tradition, held their noses and made an exception. Not in England, where they turned him into a big, hideous blimp. Not by moderate Republicans, or at least the shrinking club with a tenuous claim to that label, who pushed him away during the midterms as they fought for their survival and clung to their last shreds of self-respect. And not by a 36-year-old Republican operative who is by most accounts the apotheosis of vanity and ambition — and who just turned down one of the most powerful roles in any administration, a job that welds you to the president’s side and gives you nearly unrivaled access to his thoughts. Nick Ayers didn’t see enough upside to the welding. He could do without those thoughts. He said no to becoming Trump’s next chief of staff, and this wasn’t just the latest twist in “As The White House Turns.” [Go beyond the headlines and behind the curtain with Frank Bruni’s candid reflections on politics, culture, higher education and more every week. Sign up for his newsletter.] It was, really, the whole story — of a president who burns quickly through whatever good will he has, a president who represents infinitely more peril than promise, a president toward whom a shockingly small and diminishing number of people in Washington feel any real affection, a president more tolerated than respected, though even the tolerance wanes. He’s forever fixated on how wanted he is (“My crowds!” “My ratings!”), but what’s more striking is how unwanted he is. And that’s not merely a function of the crests and dips that every president encounters. It’s not really about popularity at all. It’s about how he behaves — and the predictable harvest of all that nastiness. While other presidents sought to hone the art of persuasion, he revels in his talent for repulsion: how many people he attacks (he styles this as boldness); how many people he offends (he pretties this up as authenticity); how many people he sends into exile. His administration doesn’t have alumni so much as refugees. H.R. McMaster, Gary Cohn and Reince Priebus are a dumbfounded diaspora all their own. Careerists who would normally pine for top jobs with a president assess his temper, behold his tweets, recall the mortifications of Jeff Sessions and Rex Tillerson, and run for the hills. Trump sits at the most coveted desk in the world, but almost no one wants to pull up a chair. What happened with Ayers, who is finishing a stint as Mike Pence’s chief of staff, speaks pointedly to the president’s diminished state. Bear in mind that Trump had already started telling people that Ayers would succeed John Kelly as chief of staff, so Ayers’s decision was doubly humiliating. Bear in mind who Ayers is: not just any political climber but someone whose every breath is focused on his enhanced glory, a trait frequently mentioned by Republicans who have watched his rise (and who sense in him more than a bit of Trump). They still groan and titter about the blast email that he sent out, unsolicited, after he signed on to manage Tim Pawlenty’s 2012 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. It crowed about all the riches in the private sector that he was passing over. It hinted that his services had been sought by Pawlenty’s competitors: Sorry, guys. It assumed a broad, edge-of-seat audience for the minutiae of his mulling and maneuvering. In fact there were news stories that mocked the self-aggrandizement of his announcement. At most other times, under most other presidents, someone like Ayers would jump at chief of staff, no matter the job’s infamous rigors. It catapulted such political heavyweights as Dick Cheney, James Baker, Leon Panetta and Rahm Emanuel to greater recognition and relevance. So Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump counted on Ayers’s interest and connived to shove Kelly out — he’ll leave by year’s end — so that they could shimmy Ayers in. They counted wrong. Ever clueless and oh so useless, they didn’t adequately factor in Trump’s toxicity, and the president now looks every bit as isolated as he is. “Trump was left at the altar,” wrote The Washington Post’s White House team. In his search for takers, maybe it’s time for Tinder. Administration officials like Steven Mnuchin and Mick Mulvaney practically put out news releases to make clear that Trump shouldn’t ask them to be chief of staff. He has no Plan B, just B-list options like Matt Whitaker, the acting attorney general. It’s fitting. As leaders go, he has never been much of a magnet. He unequivocally romped in the Republican primaries, but since then? He got nearly 3 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton did, a gap so remarkable that he had to claim a conspiracy of illegal voting to console himself. When he first filled his cabinet, he hardly had his pick of the litter. Many top Republicans wanted no part of him. Some who did enter the administration agonized beforehand: Were they helping the country or indulging someone who didn’t deserve it? When Barbara Bush died in April, it was clear to Trump that he shouldn’t travel to Texas to pay his respects. When John McCain died in August, Trump was told to skip the funeral. The heads of countries that share America’s purported values (pre-Trump, at least) reproach and recoil from him. Prominent corporate leaders rebuke him, despite his administration’s business-friendly policies. And voters? While many are on his side, many more aren’t. By one analysis of the midterms, the overall vote count for Democratic candidates for the House was 8.6 percentage points higher than for Republican candidates. That was the largest advantage for a minority party since such records began to be kept in the 1940s. His wife takes public shots at him. Old friends tattle to prosecutors; new friends don’t exist. Talk about a twist: He sought the presidency, as so many others surely did, because it’s the ultimate validation. But it has given him his bitterest taste yet of rejection.

2018,Opinion | The Most Wonderful Smelling Time of the Year,"The season’s scents of fir and pine evoke primal experiences, and remind us what we may lose. Dr. Haskell is a biologist. Walking in New York this season, I stumble into a time warp. The smell of fir from sidewalk Christmas tree vendors plunges me into memories: sparkling red and silver lights on childhood holiday boughs, the judder of a saw in my hand as I built spruce bookshelves, and the songs of wrens and hermit thrushes along a forested trail in Canada. This portal into the past is opened by odor alone, by the fir needles perfuming whole city blocks. No other sense is as direct as smell. No other sense is as ancient. Smell bypasses the neural processing centers that mediate all other senses. The aroma of fir trees flies me directly into specific wordless memories: childhood holidays, hand-sawn woodwork and my feet tramping through wet forests. When I breathe in, signals run along nerves wired straight to the parts of my brain governing emotional memory and associative learning. My conscious brain catches up later, adding a patina of language. This inward journey into human remembrance is mirrored by an outward connection to the lives of trees and forests. The chemical conversation between cells and air- and waterborne aromatic molecules unites all living beings, from animal noses to plant root tips to the cell surfaces of bacteria. The scents of holiday trees evoke primal experience. Other trees and their products join fir’s resinous spice in the seasonal bouquet. Roasting chestnuts loose sweet, earthy scents on street corners. Hanukkah olive oil perfumes the kitchen — sharp and green from early-season harvests, rounded gold from later pressings. The spiced wine of pomegranate mingles with the tannic nose-bite of olives and tree nuts on Persian Yalda tables marking the winter solstice. In the Southwest, piñon pine wood smoke is the winter incense of the desert mountains. [Discover the most compelling features, reporting and humor writing from The New York Times Opinion section, selected by our editors. Sign up for the Sunday Best newsletter.] Midwinter tree aromas connect us not only to memory but also to the language of trees. Every tree lives in connection with thousands of other species — bacteria, fungi, insects, other plants — and aromas are the links that hold together this community. Plant leaves use odoriferous molecules to defend themselves from insects and fungi, to cope with heat stress, to listen to the health of other plants and to summon parasitic insects to devour leaf-eating pests. Fruits use aromatic oils and alcohols to deter the growth of bacteria and attract seed-dispersing frugivorous animals. The unique aroma of each plant species results from a blend of thousands of molecules, an olfactory manifestation of the diverse chemical ecologies of trees. Soil and air are wrapped into these aromatic connections. A lively chemical chatter below ground allows plant roots, fungi and bacteria to trade food and information, exchanges essential for the vitality of trees and soil alike. When tree and soil aromas drift skyward, they act as water-gathering hubs, seeding raindrops. Forests, with help from oceans and grasslands, are the planet’s soil-builders and rainmakers. All of these connections account for the richness of forests. For 400 million years, forests have been the primary centers of biological diversity on land, home today to 80 percent of terrestrial biodiversity. They are the great mediators of global cycles of water, carbon and oxygen. Human life would be impossible without forests. They give us breath and send clean water to rivers and fields. Forests have, since the origin of humanity, fed, warmed and sheltered us. Yet, despite their importance to our well-being, we’re often disconnected from the lived, sensory experience of trees. Seasonal rituals let us heal this disconnection. Trees need not be mere props in our winter celebrations. Instead, we can honor the ecological roots of traditions. Holiday firs bring the scents, hues and textures of the great boreal forest, storehouse of carbon and home to billions of migratory animals. The aroma of olive oil tells of the ancient reciprocity between people and olive trees, a bond that allowed Mediterranean cultures to thrive, even on arid land. Yule logs, roasted chestnuts and holiday fruits are reminders of our dependence on plants for food and fuel. All these traditions invite us to remember, enjoy and be thankful for the many connections that give us life. This season, perhaps we could hear and answer the trees’ invitation: Inhale. Smell the needles, wood, oil and fruit. Then, expand the bounds of ritual and celebration to include the trees and the living Earth to which we belong. In these dark days, it is good to remember that we need one another.

2018,"Opinion | The Mueller Filings, and Kelly’s Exit","letters Readers react to the special counsel’s release of documents and the departure of the White House chief of staff. To the Editor: Re “Prosecutors Effectively Accuse Trump of Defrauding Voters. What Does It Mean?” (nytimes.com, Dec. 8): Plain and simple, Donald Trump violated campaign finance laws meant to ensure full disclosure of campaign contributions and expenditures to hide from public view two extramarital affairs. If this information had become public during the final phases of the 2016 campaign, it is likely that Mr. Trump would have lost the election. And that’s how he defrauded the American public. This is not a victimless crime. American democracy, American spirit, the fabric of our country and the American people are the victims, as are the poor, immigrants, the environment and longstanding relationships with historical allies. As Mr. Trump might tweet, “Shame.” Daniel FinkBeverly Hills, Calif. To the Editor: If the Democrats push for impeachment in the House and if the House does impeach, with the Republicans controlling the Senate, that will be as pointlessly distracting and destructive as the Republican-controlled House’s impeachment of President Bill Clinton was. Nothing will be gained. The country will suffer. The House, and hence the Democratic Party, will be shooting itself in the foot. President Trump’s crimes, if they are proved, will speak for themselves. Whether they have an effect on his ability to be re-elected will be determined by the electorate, which is where it should be determined. David C. NathansonToronto To the Editor: In your reporting on the latest from the special counsel, Robert Mueller, you say the prosecutors wrote that Michael Cohen, the president’s onetime lawyer, “deceived the voting public by hiding alleged facts that he believed would have had a substantial effect on the election.” If our election laws criminalize that, then we have criminalized politics. All politicians push good news and hide the bad. Have we made our political process any better from this labyrinth of laws? No. And calling it a fraud on voters is more evidence of lawyers going wild. William N. HokeManhattan Beach, Calif. To the Editor: John Kelly, the White House chief of staff, lasted less than two years. That is an eternity in this administration. People will always wonder what lapse of judgment took him to this White House in the first place, but at least he has had enough. Let us wish him well as he repairs his reputation.

2018,The Multiverse Isn’t All It’s Cracked Up to Be in ‘Come With Me’,"Books of The Times Maybe you think your obsessive need to find out everything about everything via your personal device is a delightful reflection of the boundlessness of your curiosity and the suppleness of your intellect. But your little quirk might not seem so charming when you see it manifested in Dan, the dispirited journalist in Helen Schulman’s new novel, “Come With Me.” Having slid down the greasy newspaper pole into joblessness, Dan has become a self-loathing middle-aged slacker who whiles away his days e-chatting with other underemployed writers and using Google to settle the picayune disputes anxiously raging in his brain. But as with the pleasures that come from pornography and Krispy Kreme doughnuts, these cerebral gratifications are brief and ultimately unsatisfying. His phone is his sin, his soul, his torment, “an oxygen tank for his breath-starved mind,” Schulman writes. His thirst for understanding can never be satisfied: Each moment of knowing gives rise to a new moment of not-knowing. The other characters in this smart, timely and highly entertaining novel all have their own troubles with, for lack of a more specific term, technology. This is the shadow under which we operate. What is all this convenience and quick-fix distraction doing to people, to families, to society? Is it bringing people together or driving us apart? Are we using it, or is it using us? These are not new questions. None of us is immune to the siren call of our gadgets, or to the nebulous sense of voluntarily hurtling toward some unforeseen future that is very bad. But Schulman, whose most recent previous novel was the best-selling “This Beautiful Life” (2011), has wrapped her distress in such an attractive package that the book slides down almost without your noticing its seriousness of purpose. Here is Dan’s son Jack, constantly on Skype and FaceTime with his long-distance girlfriend, Lily, bringing her along 24/7 while he eats, showers, sleeps and has virtual sex (with her). The sex is better on the phone — “it was like she was in a trance, like she’d do whatever he wanted” — and they end up spending more time together when they’re apart than when they’re actually in the same place. Here, too, are Jack’s younger brothers, twins known uncharmingly to the family as Thing One and Thing Two, after the Dr. Seuss characters, who have the requisite alarming love of PlayStation. Then there is Amy, Dan’s wife, who serves as the book’s emotional heart. Juggling work and home, she’s ended up doing P.R. for a rackety start-up run by the ludicrous Donny, a hoodie-wearing, Steve Jobs-imitating, Mark Zuckerberg-worshiping 19-year-old who happens to be the son of one of Amy’s oldest friends. Sometimes their meetings are held in his dorm room at Stanford, featuring his never-made bed. Sometimes he surprises her for breakfast meetings at home and finishes the box of Puffins that is meant for her kids. Donny’s company is experimenting with an algorithm that allows people to play out alternative virtual-reality scenarios from their pasts — their “multiverses” — for “Sliding Doors”-style experiences. He makes Amy his guinea pig, using intimate details about her that his indiscreet mother has shared with him. Her would-be lives spin out in front of her. She relives bits of her history and sees what it might have been like if she had, for instance, stayed with the irresistible, irresponsible, unfaithful, unemployed musician/actor/philosopher she lived with before Dan. What if she had not aborted their baby? What if Eric, the older brother she revered, had not died? What if? These fictional scenarios are utterly convincing and fill us with as much confusion, fear and longing as they do Amy. “It’s like nostalgia, only a billion times worse,” she says. “It’s like being boiled alive in oil.” The family reaches a fault line when Dan becomes interested in a woman named Maryam, a photographer who is obsessed with the devastation wrought by the nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan. Along with an exotic magnetism that quickly wears thin and a Knight fellowship in “experimental storytelling, immersive journalism and interactive design,” Maryam can out-nerd even Dan with the cascade of facts at her fingertips. She has a tiresome belief in her own fabulousness and a habit of sounding as if she is quoting from her own Nobel citation. “I came to Stanford to study the neurobiological effects of cyberconnectivity,” she declares. “But recently, every cell in my body has been crying for Japan.” One of her former lovers is described as a “South American professor/revolutionary/poet, a super hottie, a sexual adventurer, who had also been in the Olympics.” Schulman deftly moves around, telling her story from various points of view. Sometimes she strays a little far afield — I wasn’t sure I cared about the dating travails of Jack’s girlfriend’s mother, as amusing as they were — but her observations, particularly about the ridiculousness of the Northern Californian start-up mentality, are always apt and sharp. As the book gathers itself toward its conclusion, the crises that strike the family are all too non-virtual. Their machines cannot help them. We can play out multiple scenarios, dream multiple fantasies, write multiple stories in our heads, but in the end we have only one — complicated, imperfect, hard-to-face — reality.",The New York Times
2018,The Murder Case Seemed Solid. Here’s Why Jurors Would Not Convict.,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] The Queens district attorney’s office believed its case against Chanel Lewis was airtight. Prosecutors had a videotape of Mr. Lewis confessing to the murder of 30-year-old Karina Vetrano two years ago as she jogged through a Queens park. Police had also found his DNA on her body. But after a two-week trial last month, the unexpected happened: The jury remained hopelessly deadlocked after only two days of deliberations. The judge quickly declared a mistrial. Prosecutors did not object. Usually, a videotaped admission of guilt coupled with DNA evidence almost guarantees a conviction. But the Vetrano case demonstrated that jurors are starting to doubt such evidence. Over the last 20 years, several cases involving false confessions have surfaced, and DNA evidence, while seemingly convincing, has not always persuaded jurors who have concerns about police integrity. The skepticism is higher in minority communities where relationships with law enforcement have been strained, legal experts said. [Update: Defense lawyers say DNA from 360 black men was collected in order to solve Katrina Vetrano’s murder in a “race-biased dragnet.”] “There is a sophistication now among a lot of jurors that we haven’t seen before in understanding confessions can be false and that the DNA evidence needs to be examined,” said Lauren-Brooke Eisen, a senior fellow with New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice and a former Staten Island prosecutor. “Jurors are much more aware of the complexity of the criminal justice system — and of racial disparities.” Several jurors agreed with the defense’s argument that Mr. Lewis’s confession might have been coerced and that DNA evidence could have been contaminated, according to one juror, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of harassment. The juror’s account could not be independently confirmed, but it meshed with what transpired in court and with evidence the jury reviewed during deliberations. Two other jurors declined to comment, while several more did not respond to requests for an interview. The juror said all panel members agreed early on that prosecutors failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Lewis, 22, had sexually assaulted Ms. Vetrano, but the jury remained split about whether Mr. Lewis was guilty of murder. Seven members wanted to convict him, according to the juror, including all four white members of the panel, a Hispanic woman, an Asian man and a black man. The five people who had doubts about his guilt were of black, Hispanic and Indian descent. Some jurors were troubled by how Mr. Lewis, who is black, became a suspect in the first place, the juror said. He was arrested on what amounted to a hunch from a police lieutenant, who, months before the murder, had seen him “acting suspiciously” as he wandered through Howard Beach, a mostly white neighborhood where the murder happened. The members who were leaning toward acquittal thought the police had pressured Mr. Lewis into a false confession, the juror said. Some wanted more information about what happened in the hours before his videotaped statement when he had first denied any involvement in the murder. One of those jurors also questioned why DNA evidence had been handled by several officers before being turned over to a lab, and why Mr. Lewis’s DNA was found on Ms. Vetrano’s neck but not on her necklace. Jurors spent at least three hours discussing the DNA evidence, the juror said. Deliberations in general were civil at first, the juror said, but at certain moments it turned hostile. “You could feel the tension in the room,” the juror said. As talks dragged into the night of the second day, the jurors tired. They were still divided seven to five in favor of a conviction. But two jurors told the group their minds were firmly made up: Mr. Lewis was not guilty. The panel decided to write a letter to the judge, Michael B. Aloise of State Supreme Court, hoping that he could somehow help with the impasse, the juror said. “We were at a loss regarding what would be the next step, that’s why we wrote a note to the judge,” the juror said. “We wanted to go home, but we didn’t want to stop deliberating.” The jurors were surprised when Justice Aloise promptly declared a mistrial and let them go after only 13 hours of deliberations. The decision to do so without first instructing them to return and try to reach a decision — a judicial practice commonly referred to as an Allen charge — stunned many in the courtroom. “Everybody was a bit surprised by the alacrity at which he granted a mistrial,” said one court official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak publicly about the case. “It is not usual.” Justice Aloise did not respond to requests for comment. The Queens district attorney’s office has promised to retry the case in January. Ms. Vetrano’s murder was one of the most high-profile cases in recent years in New York City. Her badly beaten body was found near a weeded trail in Spring Creek Park in the Howard Beach section of Queens on Aug. 2, 2016. Prosecutors said she was partially clothed, had been strangled and her remains indicated she had been sexually abused. (They argued at trial Mr. Lewis had penetrated her with his finger.) Six months later, police arrested Mr. Lewis, based on the suspicions of John Russo, a police lieutenant. Mr. Lewis had attracted Lieutenant Russo’s attention three months before the murder, because he had been walking slowly through Howard Beach, wearing a hoodie on a sweltering day, stopping to look at houses and “acting suspiciously.” The next day, the lieutenant spotted Mr. Lewis again and asked some patrol officers to stop and frisk him. As the investigation into Ms. Vetrano’s murder dragged on without an arrest, Lieutenant Russo suggested to detectives they talk to Mr. Lewis. Police went to his home in East New York, Brooklyn, about three miles away from Howard Beach, and asked him for a DNA sample. Mr. Lewis agreed to give the sample, which matched DNA found on Ms. Vetrano’s neck and cellphone, as well as a mixture sample taken from her fingernails, prosecutors said. At trial, Mr. Lewis’s defense lawyer, Jenny Cheung, raised the possibility of “transference.” Mr. Lewis’s DNA could have ended up on Ms. Vetrano’s cellphone or neck if they had both touched the same surface at some point, she said. Mr. Lewis after his arrest repeatedly denied any involvement in Ms. Vetrano’s death. But after a four-hour interrogation, he told a Queens assistant district attorney in a videotaped interview that he “was beating her and was mad at her.” He also told detectives that he attacked Ms. Vetrano because he was angry that his neighbors had been playing loud music. He denied sexually assaulting her, and maintained she had drowned in a puddle, though an autopsy showed she was strangled. Defense lawyers stressed that Mr. Lewis was kept in a “windowless” interrogation room, and then a jail cell, for several hours before admitting to the crime. Mr. Lewis, who attended a school for students with learning disabilities, appeared at times confused on the videotape. He initially mistook a prosecutor for his own lawyer, and mumbled through some of his responses. The video shows him often pacing around and fidgeting when left alone. His lawyers said he had never spent a night away from home. But, Brad A. Leventhal, the lead prosecutor on the case, noted that Mr. Lewis’s cellphone contained downloaded images of the crime scene and that he had searched online for information related to “second chances.” He also had a hand injury the day after the murder that a doctor said was consistent with punching someone. “The evidence in this case, ladies and gentlemen, is overwhelming,” Mr. Leventhal said in his opening statement. For some jurors, however, it was not.",The New York Times
2018,"The Mystery of the Holiday Fruitcake, Solved!","Modern Love My father resembled a fruitcake. He also sent fruitcakes. Mine never arrived. A few years ago my father arranged to send me a mail-order fruitcake at Christmastime. Although I had a good job and owned an apartment in Manhattan, he feared my cupboards and refrigerator might be bare. I had recently moved from California, where my parents still lived in their suburban bungalow of 50 years, the house I grew up in. He wanted me to have a particular brand of fruitcake. Made in Texas, it was famous among fruitcake lovers — or, at least, among people who gave fruitcakes to those who were assumed to love them. “It reminds me of my mother’s,” he told me in a phone call. “Hers was really moist, with lots of raisins.” I later figured out that my grandmother’s version, which I never had the chance to taste, was probably a Depression cake, made without milk, sugar, butter or eggs, scarce commodities when he was a child. Born in 1932, he grew up during the Great Depression in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. On most Christmases, he received two gifts: a pair of homemade socks and a small sack of oranges. “My mother knitted the socks,” he said. “And those oranges tasted so good.” Ordering the fruitcake was his way of trying to take care of me from afar, in an era that, in his mind, may at any moment turn economically perilous. Regardless of my middle-aged status, I was still his son. “It should arrive the first week of December,” he said. “As soon as you get it, let me know what you think.” I would be going to California for Christmas, as I do every year, and I was looking forward to his gift and to sampling the flavors that transported him to his childhood. The first week of December passed with no sign of his fruitcake. Delayed by holiday mail, I assumed, or a backlog of orders. I knew there would be plenty to eat in California. In addition to my mother’s cookies, fudge and other treats, my father always gave my sister and me each a large bag of assorted foods he called, rather plainly, the “Food Bag.” He produced these from some secret spot only after all the other presents had been opened. One year I listed the contents of my Food Bag in a notebook. I wanted to remember the details to tell my friends, and I suppose as a record for myself, for the day when I might not get a Food Bag for Christmas. That year my bag contained a can of deluxe mixed nuts, a box of whole-wheat crackers, a Belgian chocolate bar, a stick of hickory-cured turkey sausage, a half-pound sack of California red pistachios, some English breakfast tea and many other items, including an “Oh Deer Super Dooper Reindeer Pooper Jellybean Dispenser” filled with jelly beans. I was 44 when my father gave me that Food Bag, and he was 72. His selections had no coherent theme, though the bags did have an uncanny but undeniable kinship with fruitcakes, featuring a little of this and that thrown together with intriguing results. The bags were so overstuffed that I often had to put most of the food in a box and mail it home. One year I assembled a few of the healthier items — sardines, rye crisps, dried apricots — and on the way to the airport made a special delivery of my own to the donation center of a local church. Fruitcake is a polarizing concept, a triggering word. People love it or hate it and like to debate whether it’s cake at all. In some ways, my father’s character resembled a fruitcake: whimsy and a little nuttiness mixed with a sweet foundation. When we were children and went to the local shopping mall, he liked to spritz on women’s perfume — all of them. This was before men’s cologne counters were common. Once they were, he would transform himself into pansexual bouquet of exotic fragrances. On our drives home, my mother would say, “You stink! What did you put on this time?” While working as a meat cutter in grocery stores, he was called Crazy Charlie by his co-workers and was known for workplace pranks, like pretending to lock someone in the walk-in meat freezer. But he also gave out instructions to customers who didn’t know how to roast lamb or make stuffing. When he came home from late shifts, he left candy bars under our pillow, thinking we might wake up wanting a snack. My father believed everyone was always hungry and needed to eat even if they weren’t. When we visited him in the hospital during a three-month stay — he was battling a vicious infection after heart surgery — he would ask if we had eaten and never fail to remind us the cafeteria would be closing soon. “At least get a cup of coffee,” he’d say. “Don’t worry about me.” A fruitcake, in his mind, was a perfect Christmas gift. The culinary jumble of jeweled fruits suggested an extravagance that belied its practicality: Fruitcake can fill your belly and has a long shelf life. In 2017, a fruitcake thought to have been brought on Robert Scott’s Antarctica expedition more than 100 years ago was discovered to be in “excellent condition.” On the day before my flight, the fruitcake still had not arrived. When my father called to wish me a safe trip, he said, “Did you receive it?” “Not yet,” I said. “It’s probably delayed in the holiday mail.” “Maybe it’ll be there today.” He fretted deeply about that lost fruitcake. When I arrived at my parents’ house, he said, “Did you get the fruitcake?” “No, but I’m sure it’ll be there when I go home.” As soon as the word left my lips, I realized that “home,” for them, was also a kind of triggering word. Because wasn’t this home? Wasn’t I home now, with my parents greeting me, asking if I was hungry after the long flight? Wasn’t New York only a stimulating adventure with an unscheduled end date? In my parents’ living room, a Christmas tree stood above piles of presents in glittery paper, and in the spare bedroom, my father, I knew, had hidden our Food Bags, concealed under large towels. He remained hopeful the fruitcake would come by New Year’s Eve, when I’d be back in Midtown Manhattan, humanity roaring from Times Square. January, February and March came and went with no fruitcake. Though my father continued to ask about it, I never once considered lying and telling him yes, the fruitcake finally arrived and was delicious. Instead I said, “That cake is orbiting earth, and sooner or later it will land.” “That’s a good one!” he said. His sense of humor never wavered, and as time went on he would bring up the perpetual journey of his fruitcake. “I wonder where it is now,” he’d say. “It’s taken a detour to Pluto.” He liked that one, too. “Do you want me to order another, in case it never comes?” “That’s O.K., Dad,” I said. “I’ll wait for this one. It’ll taste even better after touring the cosmos.” Early last December, nearly a year after my father died from a failing heart, I got a call from a staffer at the front desk of my apartment building. “You have a package,” he said. I went downstairs to pick it up. The brown box had a FedEx label with a return address in Texas. Riding the elevator back upstairs, I held the box with both hands. Though small, it was heavy and solid, as if its contents were indestructible. I shook the package but nothing moved. In my kitchen, I opened the box with a bread knife, and there it was: a decorative tin holding the fruitcake my father had wanted me to taste several years earlier. I lifted the tin cover and punctured the airtight plastic seal. The fruitcake before me was crowned with candied cherries, caramelized pecans and chunks of pineapple that had been dyed emerald green. I sliced into it, placing a big wedge on a plate. I made a cup of tea, as my father and his mother might have done. I sat down and ate the slice slowly, the only way one can eat fruitcake, really. It was as moist as my father had promised, and not too sweet. After finishing every speck, I wondered about the fruitcake my father had ordered so long ago. Was it still lapping the heavens? Had it hitched a ride on the rings of Saturn? Wherever it was, who on earth had sent me this one? I had ordered it for myself, of course. After my father’s death, I found myself grasping for every memory of him, every cologne-scented hint of his being. The confection of known and mysterious morsels embodied his desire for me to enjoy a simple and not-so-simple piece of cake — and to never go hungry. David Rompf is a writer in New York City.

2018,The N.F.L. Coaching Carousel Takes a Big Turn. Who’s Next?,"For the first time in 98 seasons, Green Bay fired a coach midseason. The search is on for Mike McCarthy’s replacement. There was a head coach fired before him, and there will be head coaches fired after him, but no firing this year can truly compare to the Green Bay Packers cutting ties with Mike McCarthy. It may sound like a take on the old breakup line, but the significance of the firing has little to do with McCarthy — it’s all about the team that fired him. In their 98 seasons, the Packers have had just 15 head coaches. One has his name on the team’s stadium (Curly Lambeau), one has his name on the Super Bowl trophy (Vince Lombardi), and another won five championships as a player (Bart Starr). None of the 14 coaches before McCarthy were fired midseason. Considering how rarely this position opens up, the Packers’ coaching vacancy might be one of the most coveted jobs in recent sports history. Josh McDaniels, currently the offensive coordinator of the New England Patriots, is the most obvious head coaching candidate. He has a more impressive résumé than several current head coaches do, he is considered a master of the modern N.F.L. offense, and he has shown an ability to work well with superstars. The wrinkle is that McDaniels shocked the N.F.L. world shortly after last season when he agreed to become the head coach of the Indianapolis Colts only to withdraw his name on the day the team announced the hiring. Indianapolis instead hired Frank Reich away from the Philadelphia Eagles, but the memory of McDaniels’s publicly embarrassing a franchise is surely seared into the minds of general managers throughout the league. Other N.F.L. coaches who might be considered include Vic Fangio, the defensive coordinator of the Chicago Bears; John DeFilippo, the offensive coordinator of the Minnesota Vikings; Kris Richard, a defensive backs coach who has revamped the Dallas Cowboys this season after having helped build the Legion of Boom secondary in Seattle; Eric Bieniemy, the offensive coordinator of the Kansas City Chiefs; and, in what would take a rather enormous leap of faith in terms of age and experience, Zac Taylor, the 35-year-old quarterbacks coach for the Los Angeles Rams. There are a few top candidates from the college ranks as well. Oklahoma’s Lincoln Riley, who is preparing for the College Football Playoff, is the most obvious candidate, but teams looking to make a splash on the level of the Rams, who hired Sean McVay when he was 31, will take a hard look at Kliff Kingsbury, who was recently fired as the head coach at Texas Tech. The 39-year-old Kingsbury has a career coaching record of just 35-40, but it was in his offense that Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes developed. Rumors have already swirled that several top college programs are interested in Kingsbury, and Fox Sports reported that McVay had approached him about finishing this season on the Rams coaching staff. So far, the only team on the coaching market besides the Packers is the Cleveland Browns, who fired Hue Jackson last month. That team has improved under the interim coach Gregg Williams, but the Browns’ ownership made it clear that it intends to explore its options this off-season. (One of those options is likely to be McCarthy). One obvious candidate on the hot seat is Marvin Lewis of the Cincinnati Bengals. The team has unraveled as this season has progressed, with the defense, Lewis’s specialty, being the biggest problem. The longtime coach has survived plenty of scares over the years while compiling a 130-119-3 record, but between the team’s collapse this season, his career playoff record of 0-7, and the reports that his contract for next season is a team option, it is seeming less and less likely that he can make it through another poor finish. At one point it seemed as though John Harbaugh of the Baltimore Ravens was in just as much trouble as Lewis, but a recent three-game winning streak has muddied the waters. The winning streak, and its relevance to Harbaugh’s job security, could be a hot issue in the coming weeks as Joe Flacco returns from injury. The team has been winning with the rookie Lamar Jackson starting in an offense that relies so heavily on quarterback runs that even Michael Vick expressed reservations about its long-term efficacy. Making the right choice between Flacco, a Super Bowl-winning quarterback who had been struggling before his injury, and Jackson, who may be winning largely because of teams being unfamiliar with his style, could be what decides Harbaugh’s fate. Other coaches who on the hot seat include Todd Bowles of the Jets, Dirk Koetter of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Steve Wilks of the Arizona Cardinals and Doug Marrone of the Jacksonville Jaguars. Depending on how the N.F.C. East shakes out, Jason Garrett of the Dallas Cowboys and Jay Gruden of the Washington Redskins could be in trouble as well. For most teams, the general manager (and sometimes the owner) will pick a new coach. Not so in Green Bay. Mark Murphy, the president of the Packers, will be the chief decision maker in the hiring of a coach. He consolidated power in January when he had Ted Thompson, previously the general manager, transition to a lesser role with the team. Murphy then promoted Brian Gutekunst to general manager, but Gutekunst reportedly agreed to have the coach report to Murphy, not himself. It was Thompson who hired McCarthy, so it is difficult to predict what direction the team will go with this rare vacancy. But whomever is hired will have the task of mending fences with Aaron Rodgers, one of the game’s most talented players, who has become highly frustrated as the team has consistently lost regardless of his level of play. “I’m just thinking about these next four games and realizing how important leadership is in the tough times, trying to get guys to dig deep and play with that pride,” Rodgers said shortly before the announcement of McCarthy’s firing on Sunday. “The conversations will take care of themselves down the line. I know my role is to play quarterback to the best of my abilities. That will be my focus the next four weeks, and then we’ll go from there.”",The New York Times
2018,"The N.F.L. Questioned Kareem Hunt, But Not About Cleveland","CLEVELAND — Several weeks ago, investigators from the N.F.L. sat down for an interview with Kareem Hunt, the star Kansas City Chiefs running back who was released by the team last week over an assault on a young woman at a Cleveland hotel and apartment building in February. The investigators wanted to ask Hunt about an allegation that he had punched a man in the face in June at a resort in Ohio, near where Hunt lives. Yet the questioners did not ask about the Cleveland incident, which, after surveillance video surfaced last week showing assault, has renewed intense public discussion of the league’s commitment to investigating and policing players’ off-field violence. Although the N.F.L. said it had been unable to obtain the video, the celebrity news site TMZ did so and published it, showing Hunt shoving and kicking the woman, Abigail Ottinger, then a 19-year-old student at Kent State University, in a hotel hallway. Neither of the episodes — the attack on Ottinger or the incident with the man at a Lake Erie resort — resulted in criminal charges against Hunt, or discipline from the league. But the narrow scope of the investigators’ recent questioning — at a time when the N.F.L. knew about the hotel attack but, it says, had not seen the video — points to the fits and starts of an N.F.L. inquiry that security experts who have worked with league say was less than rigorous and at times puzzling for a lack of a thoroughness. Four years after another damning surveillance video, of the Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice punching out his fiancée in a hotel elevator, blindsided the N.F.L., the Hunt incident also reveals how the league continues to struggle with challenges similar to those that plagued the Rice investigation. The former F.B.I. director Robert Mueller, whom the N.F.L. tapped to investigate its handling of the Rice matter, wrote in his report on that case that “the NFL should have done more with the information it had, and should have taken additional steps to obtain all available information” about the episode. The N.F.L. said its investigators had not spoken to Hunt about the hotel assault in February when they interviewed him this fall — in meetings than can sometimes last hours — because it was still gathering evidence. But an examination of the investigation shows that the N.F.L. relied on the word of the Chiefs, who had a vested interest in keeping a star on the field, and did not press to independently verify the account of the incident that Hunt gave to them. Those actions have left the N.F.L. trying to explain another high-profile stumble in its stated effort to take seriously accusations that its players have behaved violently, especially in cases involving women. An N.F.L. spokesman, Brian McCarthy, said in a statement that league investigators had had “multiple verbal conversations with Cleveland police officers and requested surveillance video immediately upon learning of the incident in February.” The league’s representatives also asked for any surveillance video from the Metropolitan at the 9, the upscale hotel and apartment complex where Hunt’s attack on the woman occurred. The management of the complex declined to turn over the video, the N.F.L. statement said. Yet the league did not seek to question Hunt about the suspected assault on Ottinger until after TMZ had published video of the incident last week. This account of the N.F.L.’s investigation is based on interviews with more than a dozen people, including team and league officials, law enforcement officials, witnesses to the incident and people with knowledge of the N.F.L.’s security procedures. Most of these people requested anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the case. The N.F.L. first learned about the incident at the 9 on Feb. 12, two days after it occurred, when a Cleveland police officer contacted Patrick Foran, the league’s longtime security representative in Cleveland. The league has a network of investigators in each city where its teams are located. These investigators, like Foran and an associate, James Davidson, are separate from the investigators employed by each team. The N.F.L. does its own investigations because teams often have an incentive to protect their players. “The team has their goal, which is to keep the player on the field, while the league wants to protect its brand,” one former team security officer said. Over the next few days, Foran and Davidson obtained the police incident report and sent it to the league office in New York. The Cleveland police said this week that they had begun an internal investigation to determine how and why a department employee provided the report to the league seemingly without going through official channels. Once the league had the report, N.F.L. officials in New York then told Foran and Davidson to find out whether the 9 had video of the incident and, if so, to request it. But the 9 declined to turn over any video. Tony Quintal, an executive at the company that manages the 9, cited a company policy under which surveillance footage is given only to the police. Quintal said the league had never asked to interview any employees of the complex who had been working that night. N.F.L. security representatives also tried to obtain surveillance video from the police, the league said, but the police did not have it. No one had major injuries, and the police had classified the incident as a misdemeanor assault, not serious enough for an officer to attempt to obtain the video. Cooperation from the local police with the N.F.L. and its teams varies by jurisdiction, but in general, the police are eager to help the league. It is not uncommon for a team security officer to receive a call from a local police officer about a player’s transgression, a former team security officer said. Often, he said, a team security officer will pick up the player from the police station, and no charges will be filed. In the case of Hunt, the N.F.L. conducted preliminary interviews with witnesses in February, but little appears to have happened between the initial efforts in February and this summer, when investigators from the N.F.L. reached out again to people involved in the February incident. Those calls might have been spurred by a new allegation against Hunt: that he had punched a man on June 3, in the island village of Put-in-Bay, Ohio, at the Bay Lodging Resort. The N.F.L. declined to comment on the interviews about the June incident. On Monday, TMZ reported that Hunt had also been named in a police report after an attack at a nightclub in Kansas City, Mo., in January, when a man said that Hunt and a number of other people had beaten him. Hunt was not charged; in fact, no arrests were made. A spokesman for the Kansas City Police Department, Sgt. Jake Becchina, said the N.F.L. had never contacted him about the January incident. One witness to the incident in February in Cleveland said a league security official had called him during the summer. This person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said he did not remember the name or the title of the person he spoke to. He said the investigator had asked him typical questions about what transpired that night and about what he had seen. The person said the investigator had told him that the league had talked to other witnesses but that Ottinger and a friend who was also there that night had not been interviewed. The league also asked the Chiefs what they had learned. The investigation remained open because the league was still hoping to speak with other witnesses, according to a person familiar with the league’s inquiry. The N.F.L. preferred to have everything in hand before approaching Hunt, though former security officials said that was not always how the league operates. One possible reason that TMZ was able to obtain videos when the league did not is that TMZ pays for them. TMZ reportedly paid almost $90,000 for the elevator video of the Ravens’ Rice punching his fiancée in the head. TMZ did not respond to a request for comment on how it had obtained the surveillance video from the 9. Hunt’s agent, Dan Saffron, did not respond to multiple calls and emails requesting comment about his client and the investigation. Ottinger did not respond to emails or a message left at her parents’ house outside Cleveland, and attempts to contact her through family members were unsuccessful. Other witnesses named in the police reports about the incident either declined to comment or did not respond to numerous messages. The N.F.L.’s investigators made their first formal efforts to speak with Hunt directly in late summer, when it contacted the Players Association to request a meeting with him about the incident in June. Approaching the Players Association is part of the league’s investigative protocol; it allows the player to be accompanied to an inquiry by a union representative. That interview finally occurred this fall, before the release of the video that showed Hunt kicking Ottinger as she lay on the ground in the hallway at the 9, but events of that night were not discussed, according to people with knowledge of the interview. Dan Williams, a spokesman for the city prosecutor’s office in Cleveland, declined to say whether prosecutors were pursuing the case or anticipated bringing charges. He also would not say whether Ottinger had asked to press charges or whether prosecutors had spoken to her or to Hunt. As for Hunt, he cleared waivers after the Chiefs released him, and no team has claimed him. He is on the commissioner’s exempt list, meaning he is ineligible to play even if he is signed, and still faces a potential suspension for violating the league’s personal conduct policy.",The New York Times
2018,The N.F.L. Was Soaring. Then a Familiar Demon Reared Its Ugly Head,"On Pro Football Kansas City Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt seemed to embody an N.F.L. that had been regaining its footing after a period of sliding ratings and fan anger over player protests during the national anthem. The league has enjoyed higher-scoring games, better television ratings and the emergence of several exciting young players like Hunt, who has been a force behind the Chiefs’ ascension the last two years. Now, Hunt has come to embody something else about the league: Its recurring problem with players’ abusive conduct off the field and a penchant for giving second chances to those who play well despite a professed intolerance for off-field transgressions. And so the N.F.L., the nation’s richest and most popular sports league, again finds itself under scrutiny for something other than touchdowns and tackles, having to answer for the reality that some teams will sign troubled but talented players as long as they can tolerate the bad publicity. On Friday, a graphic video emerged of Hunt shoving a woman, before and after she struck him in the face, and kicking her when she was on the ground during an altercation in a Cleveland hotel in February. The Chiefs quickly announced they would release him, and Hunt was later suspended indefinitely from playing by the league. Both the league and the Chiefs said they had investigated the episode immediately after it occurred. But no criminal charges were filed, and no disciplinary action was taken at the time. The N.F.L. and the Chiefs said they had not seen the hotel video, which TMZ obtained and posted. The N.F.L. did not interview Hunt because none of the alleged victims would speak to the league. Instead, the league relied on the Chiefs, who were told by Hunt that no violence had occurred, according to a person briefed on the investigation who was not authorized to discuss its specifics. Hunt was involved in another violent episode in May, when he punched a man in the face, but again, the police did not file charges, and the Chiefs took no action against him. Also last week, Reuben Foster, a linebacker, was released by the San Francisco 49ers after being arrested on domestic violence charges, but was then almost immediately hired by the Washington Redskins. Foster is suspended from play and practices but can work out and attend team meetings. Doug Williams, the former player and current Redskins executive, was roundly criticized when he described Foster’s arrest as “small potatoes” in a radio interview. He later apologized. Experts who have advised the league said teams were foremost focused on winning, and the league and teams preferred to handle situations that might require discipline internally, keeping matters under wraps as long as possible. If the bad behavior is exposed, teams adopt a crisis response approach to clean it up. “They hold everything close to the chest,” said Rene Redwood, who has advised the league on issues of race and abuse. “When it becomes a consistent problem, and holding the information doesn’t seem to remedy it, they try to get through it with another public relations activity.” The league in recent years has sought to project intolerance for off-field misconduct. In 2014, after several star players — including Ray Rice, Adrian Peterson and Greg Hardy — were suspended after they had been charged with physical abuse or domestic violence, the N.F.L. beefed up its investigation unit and said it would no longer rely solely on the police or whether charges had been filed when assessing possible misconduct. Yet self-reflection and scrutiny have never been this league’s strong suit — it’s a multibillion-dollar business trying to survive and thrive amid questions about head injuries and the changing dynamics of television — and some players are penalized only a few games, if at all, for their misconduct. They often get signed by teams that cross their fingers and hope the players behave. “It sends a troubling message because there’s a lack of consistency,” said Mark Conrad, who teaches sports law and ethics at Fordham University. These episodes are “a validation of the continued problem the league has with this issue, that individual teams will prioritize their need for certain players despite questionable behavior off the field.” Indeed, Clark Hunt, the Chiefs’ co-owner and chief executive, said this summer that he was hopeful that Kareem Hunt had learned from his past. “I’m sure he learned some lessons this off-season and hopefully won’t be in those kinds of situations in the future,” he said. On Sunday, Kareem Hunt apologized but also asked for another chance to play in the N.F.L. “I was in the wrong,” Hunt told ESPN. “I’m asking for forgiveness and I definitely believe I deserve forgiveness.” Coach Andy Reid said little about the situation after Kansas City’s 40-33 win over the Oakland Raiders on Sunday, which bumped their record to 10-2. “As we’ve done in the past, we handle it within and we handle it with the person affected,” Reid said. Players have due process rights under the collective bargaining agreement and can be falsely accused, of course. Yet the league also has been burned by relying on incomplete police investigations, so it has come to do its own digging to determine if penalties are warranted, even if no criminal charges are filed. Still the N.F.L., lacking the authority of law enforcement, has had trouble gathering evidence and getting the cooperation of those making accusations. The police in Cleveland were also limited in what they could do. A spokeswoman for the Cleveland Police, Sgt. Jennifer Ciaccia, said that detectives do not pursue cases like Hunt’s, which was classified as misdemeanor assault. To file charges, the accuser would have had to go to the city prosecutor’s office, which she did not do. Sergeant Ciaccia did not say whether the N.F.L. had asked her department for the video of the altercation. But she said the department never had the video, and that “to my knowledge” the police never saw it. “The video may have been released by the hotel,” she added. Even so, the cases of Foster and Hunt are as much about how their teams gave them the benefit of the doubt more than once. Kyle Shanahan, the 49ers coach, told reporters that the team didn’t need to wait for the legal process to conclude before deciding to cut Foster. But Foster has been part of several other troubling episodes. He was sent home from the scouting combine two years ago because of an altercation with a hospital worker. He was accused of domestic violence during the off-season, but his former girlfriend — the same woman from the most recent accusations — recanted the accusation. Foster was suspended for the first two games of this season because of a misdemeanor gun charge and a misdemeanor marijuana possession charge that was dropped. In October, Foster had another run-in with his former girlfriend, but no arrests were made. It was only after Foster was arrested at the team hotel on a misdemeanor domestic violence charge hours before a game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers that the 49ers cut him. “Too many things have happened, and we’ve tried to help him out a lot,” Shanahan said. “And I know he has been trying, too. But this was a mess-up that it doesn’t matter whether he did or not.” The Redskins did not share the 49ers’ regrets. Two days after Foster was cut, the Redskins claimed him off waivers. Williams, the team’s senior vice president of player personnel, said he hoped that Foster would turn himself around in Washington, where many of his former teammates from the University of Alabama play. “Nothing is promised to Reuben, but we are hopeful being around so many of his former teammates and friends will eventually provide him with the best possible environment to succeed both personally and professionally,” he said. Even after the Redskins were criticized for picking up Foster before his legal case played out, Williams said that he was still worth the hassle. “Basically what you’re doing here is you’re taking a high-risk chance,” Williams said. “The high risk was the beat-up that we’re going to take from the PR. We understood that from a PR standpoint, and we’re taking it.” The Chiefs were willing to take the criticism for Hunt’s actions in a hotel in Cleveland in February. But once the video surfaced, there was no other way to spin the story, no matter how valuable Hunt is to the Chiefs’ Super Bowl ambitions. “If it’s a particularly valuable player, they’ll cross their fingers and hope he changes his behavior,” said Kim Gandy, the president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence who advised the league several years ago. “Sometimes crossing their fingers works, and sometimes it doesn’t.” Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misidentified the player who was suspended for the first two games of the season.

2018,"The Nets, Playing at Home, Wrestle the Spotlight From the Lakers","Nets 115, Lakers 110 LeBron James’s first game in New York wearing purple and gold had all the fanfare of a big game even if the standings said otherwise. On his first possession against the Nets on Tuesday night, James drove hard to the basket, rose to the rim with a one-handed tomahawk slam — only to be rejected by 20-year-old Jarrett Allen. “He’s in his 20s; I’m in my 30s. It takes me a little longer to warm up,” James said after the Lakers fell to the Nets, 115-110. “That’s fine with me. He’s a shot blocker. He can get a block. It happens. It’s probably all over social media. T hat’s cool.” Though many in the sold-out Barclays Center came to see the King James version of Showtime, the Nets stole the spotlight, starting with Allen’s block. According to ESPN Stats & Information, it was the ninth time in James’s career he has had a dunk attempt blocked, and it came on his 1,850th try. “That’s a hell of a list to be on,” Allen said. “He’s an amazing player. I got the chance to do it, so I’m on the list forever now.” [Jarrett Allen Refuses to Be on LeBron’s Poster] The Nets have won six consecutive games, the longest active winning streak in the N.B.A., and the team’s longest winning stretch since the 2014-15 season. The win against the Lakers added a bit of credibility to the Nets’ run, which included Sunday’s rout against Atlanta when the Nets scored a season-high 144 points. The Nets have been without the injured Caris LeVert, their leading scorer, for a month. With the rookie Rodions Kurucs replacing Allen Crabbe in the lineup as a result of Crabbe’s knee injury, the average age of the Nets’ starters was just shy of 23. One of those young guys, D’Angelo Russell, reminded the Lakers why they selected him with the second overall pick in the 2015 draft before trading him to the Nets two years later. “D’Angelo is an excellent player,” Magic Johnson, the Lakers’ president, had told reporters after introducing Russell’s replacement, Lonzo Ball. “He has the talent to be an All-Star. We want to thank him for what he did for us. But what I needed was a leader. I needed somebody also that can make the other players better and also that players want to play with.” Russell issued a rebuttal Tuesday night when he made a critical 3-pointer with a little more than 22 seconds remaining to put the Nets ahead, 113-107. He finished with a team-high 22 points and tied his career high of 13 assists. “He hurt us,” Lakers Coach Luke Walton said. “He’s a talented player, and we know that. He had a big-time game tonight. That’s why this team has won six games in a row. They have a lot of different guys that can hurt you.” Even unlikely ones like the journeyman Jared Dudley, who added 13 points off the bench. “He’s that guy you play with at the park,” Nets Coach Kenny Atkinson said. “He’s got tattered sneakers; he’s like 42 years old. You want that guy when you go to the park. You want Jared Dudley on your team because the I.Q. is off the charts and he plays so hard. He’s been a pleasant surprise. We weren’t expecting this.” The same might be said of the Nets. Less than two weeks ago, the team looked to be headed in the opposite direction, struggling with injuries and an eight-game losing streak. But an overtime victory against Toronto, the East’s top team, ignited the Nets’ run. Atkinson said the difference was the team’s confidence and willingness to share the ball. “I think once it steamrolls, you start getting a couple then a couple more,” he said. “You can see the spirit on the bench.” During momentum swings, and standout plays by James, it seemed as if it were a Lakers home game. Clearly, James was the main attraction. An hour before tipoff, dozens of reporters stood in the middle of the Lakers’ locker room waiting for King James to hold court. It never happened. “LeBron doesn’t talk in the pregame,” a Los Angeles-based reporter said. Singing, however, was not off the table. James turned up “Can’t Nobody Hold Me Down” by Puff Daddy and Mase and belted out the lyrics. Until the music was lowered to accommodate Tyson Chandler’s interview with reporters. “Hurry up, Tyson,” James said. “You’re messing up my wave.” Once the game began, though, the interruptions continued, starting with Allen’s block. It says something about these Nets that a second-year player like Allen does not care if he is dunked on. That’s why he contests shots — even slams from the great ones. Allen has had this mentality since he was 13. “If you go up and you block it, you’re going to be on the highlight,” he said. “You get dunked on, you’re going to be on the highlight. So just go up and protect the rim.”",The New York Times
2018,The New 50s: Far From Retirement,"After Chip Conley sold Joie de Vivre, the boutique hotel company he created and ran for about 24 years, his life took an unexpected turn. At 52, he was sought out by Brian Chesky, the then-31-year-old chief executive of Airbnb, for advice on how to turn the fledgling home-sharing start-up into a major player in the hospitality field. For the next four years, Mr. Conley worked at Airbnb, toggling between being a mentor and an intern in a sometimes baffling new role — a “modern elder,” as he put it. As a veteran hospitality executive, he was used to being the “sage on the stage.” But as a newbie in the tech sector, he was often the oldest person in the room, learning from colleagues who were young enough to be his children. In a new book, “Wisdom at Work,” Mr. Conley writes that everyone working past middle age today needs to become a modern elder, simultaneously sharing wisdom while embracing fresh ideas and ways of thinking. I think Mr. Conley’s on to something. It used to be, 50 was a time to begin thinking about retirement. But today, many people in their 50s — myself included — plan to work two or even three more decades. To become modern elders, we have to find new ways to stay relevant and keep our minds open, skills fresh and humility intact. While I’m determined to become a modern elder, I know it won’t be easy. After all, most of us won’t be getting a phone call from a tech chief executive seeking our counsel. So I started looking for approachable role models I could learn from, and I found plenty. Some did their homework and went back to school for jobs where there are known shortages — like nursing or teaching in STEM fields. Some found their way through volunteering or attending specialized fellowships or boot camps. Others teamed up with younger partners to lead new ventures. Most, it seems, did a combination of all these things. Sharon Lewis, an independent consultant on consumer habits, was doing scouting work for the cultural forecasting firm sparks & honey when she heard about the company’s new cultural apprentice program. The apprenticeship was designed to bring together millennials and people with 30 years of professional experience to work on, among other things, a report on the future of work. Ms. Lewis decided to sign up for the 16-week program, which offered only a modest stipend, as a 60th birthday present to herself. “The idea of working around so many younger people was exciting and invigorating,” she said. “I feel wiser, more well-rounded and updated, and I’m almost in withdrawal now,” she said. She especially appreciated the mutual mentoring. “We’re just not competing with one another because we’re at different life stages.” Kevin Walker, 55, made several big changes after being laid off from a 24-year career in utilities in New York. He moved to Denver and started TurtleWise, a technology platform matching people seeking answers to life and career questions with mentors willing to provide advice. Mr. Walker met Kevin Freund, 31, at a conference hosted by Mentor Colorado. The two are passionate about the role of mentors and brainstormed ways to build Mr. Walker’s company. “Being around Kevin is analogous to the kind of mentoring we’re doing with the platform,” Mr. Freund said. “I get little bits of wisdom dripped on me.” Within six months of their first meeting, Mr. Walker asked Mr. Freund to join the company as chief operating officer. Shortly after that, Mr. Walker had to return to a full-time job to bolster his finances so he turned over the daily management of the company to Mr. Freund. Mr. Walker says he is still totally committed to the ideals that led him to start the company and remains only a phone call or video chat away should his younger friend need his counsel. But with two young children at home, Mr. Walker has turned the company into a “side hustle,” something he said he learned from millennials. The two stay in close touch now that Mr. Walker lives in Los Angeles and Mr. Freund is still in Denver. Kimberly Strong, 52, kick-started a career pivot by giving back. After retiring as head of diversity and inclusion at Target in 2016, she wanted to become an angel investor, supporting women-led initiatives and serving as a mentor to younger women, especially women of color. She discovered Pipeline Angels, which offers boot camps for people interested in supporting ventures led by women and non-binary femmes, and she joined one of their cohorts this summer. Ms. Strong says the program has provided speaking opportunities, judging roles at pitch summits, and the chance to hone her investing skills. “My end game is to eventually be on a Fortune 1000 corporate board, and Pipeline gave me the opportunity to serve on start-up boards and gain experience,” she said. And she’s been able to mentor young female founders. “Basically, I’m the auntie to the start-ups,” she said, and the beneficiary of “reverse mentoring.” Despite these promising stories, I hear a lot from people over 50, even over 45, who are doing all the right things but still not finding successful midlife transitions. Ageism is rampant — and internalized, with midlifers questioning our own ability to succeed in a world where youth is prized. And while there are many new offerings to help people make late-career transitions, moving into an encore career still requires an immense amount of creativity and persistence. I have learned two things from my interviews about making these transitions easier. First, and most obviously, it helps to have a financial safety net. So volunteering or refreshing skills while still employed, collecting severance or a pension, or having a partner who provides an income or health insurance, all make a big difference. It is far more daunting without that kind of cushion. Second, the attitudes of younger colleagues are just as important as our own when we think about finding new roles in a rapidly transforming workplace. Shortly after reading Mr. Conley’s book, I met Charlotte Japp, a 28-year-old with an infectious passion for bringing older and younger people together. Ms. Japp was so desperate for older mentors in her first job at Vice Media that she started an intergenerational networking event series called Cirkel. “My colleagues and I had this joke about what would happen to us when we turned 34, because Vice’s target market was 18 to 34,” she told me, adding that “no one in the office, not even my bosses’ bosses, was over 40.” This struck Ms. Japp in a personal way given that both of her parents lost their jobs when they were about 50. Her father’s experience as the sole breadwinner in the family at the time is particularly etched in her memory. Over an extensive text strand, Ms. Japp explained the philosophy behind Cirkel. She told me there were many times she wanted advice on how to do something — from technical things like how to put a video treatment together, to “political maneuvering like how to confront a manager about a difficult situation with a colleague.” She just needed someone older and more experienced to ask. The word Cirkel comes from the Swedish for circle. “I believe Sweden is the culture behind great design,” she said. “Instead of minimalist furniture, though, I’m using it to describe good design in the culture and society.” Ms. Japp got right to the heart of one of the main points Mr. Conley makes in his book. At a time when we can Google the answer to just about anything, it’s important to remember that some things come only through lived experience. And there’s a certain magic when older and younger learn from, and with, each other. Because of an editing error, a photo caption in an earlier version of this article misstated the age of Charlotte Japp, who started an intergenerational networking event series called Cirkel. She is 28, not 27.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The New Fight for Democracy,"My choice for the year’s second most significant story. Opinion Columnist This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. While much of the country was focused on Donald Trump’s shocking victory in the presidential election two years ago, Republicans in North Carolina were attempting a brazen power grab. After their nominee — the sitting governor — lost re-election in November 2016, Republicans in the state decided to weaken the governor’s office. The state legislature passed two bills stripping the governor of some powers, and the outgoing governor, Pat McCrory, signed them. In doing so, McCrory and his allies rejected the peaceful transfer of power that is essential to democracy. They instead chose the peaceful transfer of some power. In 2018, it became clear that this problem extended beyond North Carolina. Republicans in Wisconsin and Michigan followed the same strategy. Perhaps the most chilling aspect is that Trump had nothing to do with these power grabs. Most of the leadership of the Republican Party in each state decided that their overriding goal was partisan power. [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] Along similar lines, Republicans in many states also pushed to make voting more difficult. They closed polling places, reduced voting hours and introduced ludicrous bureaucratic hurdles — like requiring Native Americans who have no street address to have one in order to vote. The struggle over American democracy is my choice for the year’s second most significant news story. It’s a struggle that goes to the core of American ideals and that will affect politics for years. Fortunately, it’s also a struggle that has now been joined. This country has the beginnings of the pro-democracy movement that it needs. In Florida, 65 percent of voters — which means large numbers of Democrats, Republicans and independents — approved a ballot initiative restoring the voting rights of people who had been convicted of a felony. In Missouri, 62 percent of voters approved a law to reduce corruption and gerrymandering. Pro-democracy initiatives also passed in a few other states. At the federal level, House Democrats have promised to make electoral reform the subject of the first bill they offer, after taking control next month. Voting fairness isn’t simply a Democrat-versus-Republican story. In New Jersey, state Democrats recently pushed for an inequitable new gerrymandering plan — until progressive activists beat back the plan. Gerrymandering remains a problem in other blue states, like Illinois and Maryland. Across parts of the West, meanwhile, Republican officials have supported an expansion of voting by mail. But if both parties deserve some blame, they don’t deserve anywhere near equal blame. The efforts to restrict voting (and the attempts at cheating) have come overwhelmingly from Republicans, while the efforts to expand voting access have come mostly from Democrats. The reason is obvious enough. Many Republicans have come to believe they will lose fair elections with high voter turnout. In 2019 and beyond, I’ll be rooting for more Republican leaders to decide they can win elections the old-fashioned way: By persuading more voters that they deserve to win. Until they do, I hope voters across the political spectrum will punish Republican politicians who decide they care more about power than democracy. They’re going down a very dangerous road. For more, Eric Levitz has a piece in New York magazine called, “The GOP’s 2018 autopsy: Democracy is our enemy.” In The Atlantic, Anne Applebaum explains that the struggle for democracy is even more intense in Europe.

2018,The New Normal: It’s a Buyer’s Market,"With the luxury real estate market in a funk and the rest of the market weakening, what works now? Price cuts, sweeteners and pop-up yoga classes. CreditCreditRobert Wright for The New York Times Three guests arrived for the recent opening of a three-bedroom rental in the Sutton Place neighborhood of Manhattan, with an asking price of $12,589 a month. But no one brought a checkbook — likely on account of the yoga pants. The visitors were there for a pop-up fitness class led by hOM, a start-up that holds social and wellness events in unused office spaces and vacant apartments. Such is the state of New York’s luxury housing market, where repurposing, rebranding and, crucially, re-pricing luxury apartments has become the new normal. Amid a glut of new inventory, deals are still happening, but not before buyers and renters exact their pound of flesh. And with continued uncertainty about the economy, rising mortgage rates and the prospect of higher taxes looming, the market isn’t likely to improve soon. So what hath the buyer’s market wrought? Price cuts are deepening, and agents expect more sellers to bend next year. Some developers are negotiating sweeteners, like offering to pay transfer taxes or common charges for a year or more. The rental market shows improvement, but uncertainty remains. And the slowdown has convinced a growing number of developers to get creative with empty apartments — enlisting tech start-ups that flip unleased rental units for extended-stay travelers or turning unused living rooms into makeshift amenities. Others have doubled down on high-end marketing, while some have delayed listing properties altogether. Even film and TV crews are in on the act, as location scouts turn increasingly to empty luxury apartments for inspiration. Through the first three quarters of the year, 84 percent of ultraluxury listings — the priciest 10 percent in Manhattan — sold below the original asking price, up from 65 percent in 2015, when the market was riding high, according to StreetEasy. The median price cut remained unchanged at $500,000, which could suggest sellers need to cut deeper still, said Nancy Wu, an economic data analyst for the company. “It feels worse when you’re out in the trenches,” said Donna Olshan, the president of Olshan Realty, which puts out a weekly report on contracts signed on properties seeking $4 million and up. That segment has taken an average of 441 days to go into contract so far in 2018, the longest stretch since at least 2013, when similar homes spent 172 days on the market. Through Dec. 2, $4 million-plus homes were reduced on average by 9 percent before a contract was signed, but Ms. Olshan believes that after sellers make additional concessions, the actual discount is closer to 15 or 20 percent. She predicts that 2018 will finish with 6 to 10 percent fewer $4 million-plus contracts signed than last year, when 1,172 were signed, and roughly 20 percent fewer than during the peak year of 2013. The broader Manhattan sales market has also shown weakness. In the third quarter, resales, which make up about 85 percent of sales, spent an average of 104 days on the market, 11 percent longer than during the same period last year, according to a report from the brokerage Halstead. The median sales price fell to $1.1 million in the third quarter, down 4.5 percent from a year earlier, according to Douglas Elliman. Overall, there were 6,925 units for sale, up 13 percent from a year ago. Some are taking aggressive steps to jump-start sales. Last month, the luxury developer Extell announced that it would pay three years of common charges on its one- and two-bedroom apartments and up to five years on three- to five-bedrooms that go into contract before the end of the year — a sizable incentive, considering the company owns some of the most expensive condos in the city, including the upcoming 179-unit Central Park Tower in Midtown. Prices there are expected to start at $1.5 million for a studio, according to filings with the state attorney general’s office. The most expensive units have not yet been revealed, but the annual common charges for a five-bedroom asking $78.1 million would be $127,596, according to the filing, or almost $638,000 over five years. Extell ran a similar promotion in some buildings last year, but has since extended the offer to its entire portfolio, said Tamar Rothenberg, a senior vice president with the company, adding that the push was partly prompted by a “significant amount of product” on the market. In many cases, however, winning concessions from sellers is like pulling teeth. “It’s very hard to tell an owner who wants $8.5 million that it’s worth $6 million,” said Frances Katzen, an agent with Douglas Elliman. “They don’t want to hear it, and they usually end up firing the agent.” But cut they must. Nikki Field, an agent with Sotheby’s International Realty, represents the second brokerage to work on selling the 10,000-square-foot, triplex penthouse at 212 Fifth Avenue, in the NoMad neighborhood of Manhattan. In 2016, it languished at $68.5 million. Ms. Field and her team came on the following year and raised the price to $73.8 million, but by this November they had re-listed it for $62.8 million, an $11 million discount. In addition to lowering the price, they furnished the formerly raw space with more than $5 million in furnishings and art, from luxury brands like Fendi Casa and Bugatti Home to works by Carroll Dunham, the painter and father of the actor Lena Dunham. “And I’m pretty confident this purchaser will buy every inch of furnishings,” said Ms. Field, adding that she has seen strong interest since the price drop. If the property sells for close to the current asking price, the sale will top the downtown record of $59 million, set earlier this year with the sale of a West 24th Street penthouse, said Jonathan Miller, an appraiser. “However you boil it down, it’s all about price,” said Robert Dankner, the president of Prime Manhattan Residential, who notes that most new units on the market would benefit from a price cut of at least 10 percent. At 100 Barclay, an Art Deco condo conversion in TriBeCa, where sales began in 2015 and where the developer is still unloading new units, Mr. Dankner is listing a three-bedroom resale for $4.09 million. His clients, who bought the apartment in 2017 for $4.35 million, will be taking a loss at that price, but they have agreed to Mr. Dankner’s strategy, because they are competing with similar but more expensive new units in the same building, not to mention the broader market. “You have to be nimble enough, and eat some humble pie,” said Mr. Dankner, who first listed the unit in September for $4.65 million, and has since dropped the price four times, by increments of 3 to 4 percent. He said he was confident they would have a deal in the next few weeks. With new competition coming to market, coupled with general buyers’ hesitance, time is of the essence for sellers. “Asking too much and passing that three-month point is death,” said David Walker, the chief executive and a founder of the brokerage Triplemint. His agency has recently urged clients, especially those with homes priced over $4 million, to hold off officially listing their properties for about a month, while Triplemint quietly builds interest and gets feedback from prospective buyers. The hope is to get qualified bidders, and a sense of the property’s real worth, before wasting days online. To find motivated prospects, the agency aggregates user data from its website and pulls from a mix of third-party subscription services to narrow down a list of likely buyers. Mr. Walker would not reveal the sources of the data, but similar strategies have mined consumer purchases to find people who might be more likely to buy real estate because of a major life event like marriage or pregnancy. “None of these things mattered in 2017, when the market was stronger,” he said. Softness in Manhattan’s luxury market has helped the rental market in recent months, but there is still cause for concern. In October, the rental vacancy rate fell to 1.49 percent, the lowest level for that month in nine years, according to a Douglas Elliman report. But that also marked the 41st consecutive month in which the share of landlord concessions had increased over the previous year. Some 41 percent of leases included sweeteners for renters, like a month or more of free rent, up from 28 percent in the same period last year. And over the next several years, more than 22,000 rentals are expected to be built in Manhattan, about half of them currently in some stage of construction, according to Nancy Packes Data Services. In some cases, hard-to-sell condos are seeking renters in the short term, which adds more competition to the rental market, said Jennifer M. Stutz, of Olshan Realty. While the rental market improved last quarter, she said, heading into 2019 “it’s still up in the air.” The uncertainty has allowed companies like Blueground to get a foothold in New York. The company signs one- to three-year leases on luxury apartments, many of which would have otherwise sat vacant on the market, and then flips them, fully furnished, at a premium for the traveling business class. Blueground, which was founded in Athens, Greece, near the height of the country’s economic crisis in 2013, already has 230 units in New York, from major property managers like Rose Associates and Related Rentals, and up to 20 units in a single building. “We bring them a new type of demand,” said Alexandros Chatzieleftheriou, a founder and the chief executive of Blueground, noting that the softening market has been a boon for business. For instance, the company leased a one-bedroom apartment in Chelsea that might have rented unfurnished for $5,000 a month. It signed a multiyear agreement on the unit, outfitted the space with stylish furniture and amenities like a stocked bar cart and espresso machine, and now rents the space for roughly $6,000 a month. The developer fills an otherwise empty unit, and Blueground turns a profit. “What I was paying in hotels was substantially more,” said Jared Anderson, 36, who lives in Florida, but travels to New York weekly for his work at a furniture company, and signed a one-year lease on the space. “I would say it’s pricey, but you get what you pay for,” said Ali Kole, a cosmetics consultant from Boulder, Colo., whose company paid for her one-bedroom in the same building, for $6,450 a month — shorter stays have higher premiums. No complaints otherwise: After a three-month stay, she leased another unit in the building for three more. (The company’s apartments are not regulated like Airbnb units, because the shortest lease agreements are for one month.) Other start-ups, like hOM, the yoga and social events planner, have given developers and landlords another use for vacant space. At Aalto57, the luxury rental tower in Sutton Place, residents attending an intimate yoga class sat in lotus position, barefoot on the new hardwood, facing an expensive Bertazzoni gas range in a luxury three-bedroom apartment. The unit was listed in November for $12,589 a month, and is offering two months of free rent. The events are a way to boost tenant retention in the building, said Francesca Loftus, the company’s chief executive. Property managers pay hOM a subscription fee, from $2,100 to $30,000 a month, to plan events for residents in amenity spaces and unused apartments. The company currently holds about 50 classes a day, in more than 50 residential buildings in New York. (The majority of the classes are in residential buildings, with about a third in unused apartments.) “There’s this sort of word-of-mouth marketing benefit,” said Scott Marino, the executive director of multifamily management for Rose Associates, the property manager. Residents who take classes in such units might someday want to upgrade, he said. Other builders have developed an affinity for Hollywood. The Durst Organization began fielding requests from movie and TV producers to film in its buildings about five years ago, said Jordan Barowitz, the company’s vice president of public affairs. “We’re seeing more interest in the residential side, as of late,” said Mr. Barowitz, adding that the company has brought in “well north of seven figures a year” through the agreements. Recent shoots at Via, the developer’s Far West Side luxury rental tower with an unusual pyramidal facade, have included Bollywood sagas and an upcoming Netflix project. The productions pay from $5,000 for a few hours in an amenities space or apartment to $100,000 for a multiday shoot, Mr. Barowitz said. Via leased its final units about a year and a half ago, Mr. Barowitz said, but it has had more vacancies recently, as several two-year leases expired. He stressed that the company’s growth in the film world isn’t tied to the strength of the rental market; it is simply an arrangement that has created another revenue stream. At the Hub, a rental tower in Downtown Brooklyn, a homegrown film director found inspiration in a vacant penthouse. Spike Lee recently filmed an episode of the forthcoming second season of the Netflix series “She’s Gotta Have It” in a two-bedroom apartment listed for $6,643 a month. That apartment, and the rest of the building, is now leased. Tim Stacker, the location manager for the series, said he had noticed an uptick in developers offering empty apartments for film shoots. “New developments are attractive to film and TV, because you don’t have to deal with existing tenants, the units are empty, it looks pristine,” said Douglas C. Steiner, the Hub’s developer, who is also the chairman of Steiner Studios, one of the largest film studios in the country. “I’m hoping not to have empty units,” Mr. Steiner said. But the film business hasn’t treated him poorly either, he added: “It’s found money.” For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

2018,The Not-So-Dumb Objects That Smartphones Have Led Us to Ignore,"Nonfiction CREATING THINGS THAT MATTER The Art and Science of Innovations That Last By David Edwards 270 pp. Henry Holt & Company. $30. FEWER, BETTER THINGS The Hidden Wisdom of Objects By Glenn Adamson 272 pp. Bloomsbury. $27 In 1912, Otto Rohwedder of Iowa began working on the first machine to slice a loaf of bread, paving the way in the 1930s for Wonder Bread to start packaging and shipping presliced loaves around the country. “The greatest thing since sliced bread” became the aphoristic stand-in for superb American innovation for good reason. Newly discovered chemical antioxidants slowed the bread’s fermentation and the development of plastic polymers allowed loaves to stay fresh even longer as they were transported. Before this, bread was local. If a wheat crop failed, people in that area would go hungry or even starve. In ""Creating Things That Matter,” David Edwards, an engineer, inventor and professor of a course in idea translation at Harvard, notes that it was commercial innovations, just like this one, built on the back of advancements in science and technology, that created a world better than at any other time in history. Great swaths of the human population could have access to abundant, relatively healthy food, increasing life expectancy and reducing infant mortality. These commercial innovations have broadened access to health care, education, clean water, information and entertainment. And yet, these world-historical transformations aren’t looking so good anymore: Growing plastic gyres float on the earth’s oceans choking marine life, and a landscape marred by pollution, deforestation and climate change leaves us with scarcely enough arable land to feed the population at the rate it’s growing. Our current system for innovating, Edwards says, “is falling short of addressing today’s challenges.” He offers a new model for creating things that can be hopeful, helpful — and commercially viable. In “Fewer, Better Things” Glenn Adamson, a former director of the Museum of Arts and Design in New York and author of several books on craft, views the suffering of the natural world through the prism of our increasingly tortured relationship to it. When we look up from our screens, we find we have lost our connection with the physical realm, which according to Adamson is the embodiment of our shared humanity. Objects, particularly well-made ones, contain intelligence in the form of “thousands of years of accumulated experiment and know-how.” By forfeiting an understanding and appreciation of objects — their materials, how they are made and why they are as they are — we forfeit the power they have to enhance our lives and to connect us with one another. If we were to love stuff more and better, Adamson holds, we’d want and waste less of it. Historically, innovation, according to Edwards, has followed two distinct models — commercial or cultural. The former, driven by profit margin and return on investment, changed the world and eased our lives but it is by its nature shortsighted and unable to act on long-term humanitarian goals. Capitalism can’t monetize what doesn’t yet exist — i.e. the future. Cultural creation, on the other hand, like art or theater, may more ambitiously attempt to change how we think or act, but its effects, when they can be discerned at all, are seen only after a duration of many years. We value the sort of innovation that has a more immediate and tangible effect — the sliced bread — while devaluing, and therefore failing to invest in, innovation whose contribution might not be obvious at first. Edwards sees this as a problem, and his solution is to return science and art — disciplines segregated from each other post-Newton — to their rightful place as a single endeavor he calls “aesthetic creating.” He came to this realization after having invented inhalable insulin, which despite being an improvement over injected insulin, wasn’t adopted, in part because it wasn’t offered in an aesthetically appealing way. As our basic needs have already been met, he says, we will only adopt new things, even ones that might solve world health issues, if we find them beautiful or attractive. Edwards proposes culture labs, spaces where creativity is encouraged, supported by a group and guided by mentors. Science should become more open-ended and personally expressive, and its explorations exhibited to the public, whose feedback could help guide development and evolution. Edwards’s own such space is the Artscience: Culture Lab and Café in Cambridge, where people can interact with and consume works-in-progress of his own and his students and collaborators. His work with inhalable technology led Edwards to invent aerated flavors, able to enhance one’s experience of drink or food, and then to create a mechanism that renders these invisible vapors into clouds of smoke, presumably increasing one’s delight in the cocktails on offer at the lab’s bar. As Edwards looks for solutions in clouds, Adamson would have us look to the ground. Literally. At one point, he offers a riveting tour of a Manhattan street corner starting with asphalt (“hot poured and rolled”) and the manhole covers (“round because a square or rectangular cover turned at the wrong angle would drop right into the hole”) and on up to building awnings (“formed of sheet metal using giant rolling and crimping machines” still fed by hand at an old factory in Brooklyn). Adamson, a scholar at the Yale Center for British Art, wants us to appreciate how the material world — all that implacable, inert stuff we are surrounded by — carries memories and an opportunity for empathy. The word “smart,” applied to phones and cars, implies that objects that don’t interact with us are “dumb” — both mute and unintelligent. But Adamson finds a banality in the hyper-flexibility of “smart” objects. He tells of one night when his niece slept over at his house and set out a little photo of her dog, Pepper. Why, he asks, when your phone has dozens of such pictures? The point of the phone, she says, isn’t to be a picture of Pepper, “while the point of the picture of Pepper is to be a picture of Pepper.” Physical objects possess richly specific, intrinsic characters, and can be repositories of meaning in ways that a powerful portal to the entire world cannot manage. Adamson is not so much anti-digital as he is pro-thing — to the point of being materially agnostic. He would like us to be curious and nonjudgmental about all physical objects. Adamson ties himself in knots trying to advocate for the fewer, better things of his own title, because “better things” are often handcrafted, expensive and, therefore, elitist. (William Morris and others have also wrestled with craft’s failure — after industrialization — to be democratic.) Yet as Adamson allows that “beauty” is culturally relative, it follows that “better” and “luxury” are likewise shifting targets. As someone once told me, “luxury is what one doesn’t have enough of.” In fact, Adamson talks of his grandfather growing up on a farm during the Depression without luxuries — having to make do, he says, with hand-split rail fences and homemade ice cream. My very idea of luxury! Creating value around — and a higher price tag on — labor-intensive handcrafted goods creates jobs in the developing world, and helps keep age-old traditions, cultures and communities relevant. Its processes are also usually more ecological than its industrial or technological counterparts. (Plus, the stuff is really beautiful if you ask me.) “The real test of an object’s worth lies not in its efficiency, novelty or even beauty,” Adamson says, “but in whether it gives us a sense of our shared humanity.” Edwards’s latest innovation allows us to digitally transmit aromas through a small device that plugs into our phone. Thus far, our phones have engaged only our senses of sight and sound, leaving our olfactory organs untapped. Edwards’s hope is to offer the scientifically proven metabolic and calming health benefits of scent to us, on demand, even as we sit stressed out at work. Maybe one day, if widely adopted, this technology might, after the inevitable scented spam and fart pranks dissipate, revolutionize global food and medicine delivery systems. In the meantime, as Adamson might suggest, we should step outside and smell the roses.",The New York Times
2018,The Octomom Has Proved Us All Wrong ,"The happy household of a onetime tabloid curiosity. LAGUNA NIGUEL, Calif. — The 9-year-olds have matching button noses; toothy grins; roaming, smiling eyes. Noah and Josiah are Nordic blond and fair, Nariyah and Maliyah olive and deeply brunette, and their four brothers — Jonah, Jeremiah, Isaiah and Makai — run the gamut. Octuplets. “Hand me the spoon,” said Maliyah, standing at the stove. “I’m already mixing the potatoes,” Josiah said. The children moved in unison, weaving around the tight kitchen and adjacent living room of their three-bedroom Orange County townhouse while their mother checked on their brother Aidan, 13, who has autism. One kid chopped veggies, one boiled water, one readied the silverware and on and on. “Be careful with that,” warned Amerah, 16, supervising while thumb scrolling. Twelve-year-old Calyssa was coloring quietly while the eight hustled like “Top Chef” contestants. A fat gray-striped cat named Penelope slinked by. Two teenage brothers were playing Fortnite in another room. A boogie board was propped up on a wall with chipped paint; a giant stuffed Minnie Mouse rested along a row of couches. A pumpkin-spice candle flickered at a dinner table, which despite the size of the family somehow had only two chairs. There are 14 siblings in all, so many that they eat in shifts. Some sleep on the couch. The octuplets are small for their age, but they’re polite, they cook, they’re vegan, they read two books a month and do their homework without being prompted. In spite of all of the horror stories in the tabloids since birth, they’re model fourth graders. How did she do it? In 2008, Natalie Suleman was implanted with 12 embryos by Dr. Michael Kamrava, a Beverly Hills fertility specialist who had also implanted her for all six of her previous in vitro pregnancies. It was hard to believe the octuplets all came from the same father — an unidentified sperm donor — and even harder to process that Ms. Suleman didn’t know she was having so many babies at once. But that’s what she says. It took 46 scrambling doctors and nurses to perform the C-section when Ms. Suleman went into labor at 31 weeks. The babies weighed between 1 pound 8 ounces and 3 pounds 4 ounces. Six boys and two girls. Never before had so many been born at once and survived, a medical marvel overshadowed by its treatment in the supermarket glossies. Ms. Suleman played the callous brood mare, a cartoon character called the Octomom. She spent hundreds of thousands on plastic surgery to resemble her idol Angelina Jolie, the magazines accused: a single mom on food stamps, a crazy who’d do anything to build a family. In other words, a character perfect for our so-called reality era, when circus sideshows become the main act. It wasn’t surprising that Ms. Suleman cashed in. But when the money ran out, she turned desperate: a short-lived pornographic film career, stripping, boxing. A suit by Gloria Allred followed accusations of child endangerment and exploitation, and Ms. Suleman went on “Oprah” and “Dr. Phil” to shore up her side. Public interest eventually waned, and tasked with caring for so many, Ms. Suleman said, she turned to booze and Xanax from 2011 to 2013, before briefly checking into rehab. During this time, friends and family helped take care of the children. “I was pretending to be a fake, a caricature, which is something I’m not, and I was doing it out of desperation and scarcity so I could provide for my family,” she said on the phone in October. “I’ve been hiding from the real world all my life.” “I’m at work on a book,” she said, one 13 years in the making. She hopes it will set the record straight. “That’s why I want to do this interview. I’ve been writing this manuscript since graduate school.” “I was the classic victim,” Ms. Suleman said at her home in November, a day before the worst wildfire in California history turned the skies red. A victim of having an alcoholic father, she said, a victim of having been an only child, hungry to fill that void. A victim of fate since she couldn’t conceive naturally. Most of all, she said, “I was misled by my doctor.” Ms. Suleman said she only wanted twins, but that Dr. Kamrava, a graduate of Case Western Reserve University with 30 years of experience, pushed her to consent to implanting additional embryos while she was strapped to a gurney and under the influence of heavy narcotics. “He told me we lost six embryos, he said they were expelled out of me, and that’s why he wanted to implant another six,” said Ms. Suleman, who grew up in nearby Fullerton, Calif. She has a B.S. in child development and worked for a state mental hospital for three years before suffering an injury that resulted in over $80,000 in disability payments. A subsequent family inheritance of $60,000 helped fund her IVF. Dr. Kamrava has said she pressured him into the multiple rounds of implants, an accusation echoed recently by David Shofet, a rabbi and a childhood friend of the doctor. “Michael invented a technique where every egg could be fertilized — that was his problem,” Rabbi Shofet remembered. “He told me he suggested to her not to keep all of them, but she said no.” January is the octuplets’ birthday. They’ll be 10. Ms. Suleman said the doctor has had no contact with her or the children. Dr. Kamrava, an Iranian national, lost his United States medical license in 2011. Unable to practice, he left the country after a failed medical-board appeal in 2016. At least two doctors believe that he is teaching his methods abroad. (Attempts to reach Dr. Kamrava were unsuccessful.) “Most doctors would not do something like that just because the patient will do it,” said Dr. John Zhang, who faced similar criticism for helping create a three-parent baby this year. Medical guidelines suggest a woman in her 30s should be transferred no more than two embryos at once, but it’s not law. “Human reproductive technology is very lightly regulated,” said Dr. Jeffrey Kahn, the director of Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics. Insurance companies don’t always cover IVF, which adds to the lack of regulation. “If a third-party payer wasn’t involved, there’s no assessment,” Dr. Kahn said. The guidelines are there for health reasons. Multiple embryos are more vulnerable: Twins are 12 times more likely to be born prematurely, 16 times likelier to have low birth weight and five times likelier to have respiratory complications. One of Ms. Suleman’s children is severely autistic, another is on the spectrum, and many are small for their age. With a stomach so swollen that it broke her ribs, could she really have been so unaware? Shouldn’t the doctor have known better? It’s a he-said-she-said, but anyone might wonder: Why implant six times the suggested limit? “I was selfish and immature,” said Ms. Suleman, now 43. She doesn’t admit fault, she wouldn’t change the past, she loves her angels too much. But she admits to an ever-consuming “need for more.” “I never wanted the attention,” she said, somewhat contradictorily. She said that hospital staff breached her records and sold her out to the media: “There were helicopters flying over the hospital while I was giving birth.” Her answers kept zigzagging. “I have PTSD from all the reporters coming in over the years. I would take whatever I could back in the days, and I would let them in. I was spiraling down a dark hole. There were no healthy opportunities for Octomom. I was doing what I was told to do and saying what I was told to say. When you’re pretending to be something you’re not, at least for me, you end up falling on your face.” Ms. Suleman won’t reveal how much she was paid by The National Enquirer or Star, maintaining: “Octomom was media created. I believe most media is filtered and fake. They created this caricature.” With a nervous laugh, she said, “Once I finally ran away from all of the pretending, I was able to be me.” But physically at least, that “me” has been irrevocably transformed. “My back is broken because of the last pregnancy,” Ms. Suleman said, damage exacerbated by years of running half-marathons. The whole family, she said, would run a 5K after Thanksgiving. Sipping alkaline water and crouching at the foot of the table, she listed her ailments with a kind of pride: “Four out of the five discs in my lumbar spine are ruptured, herniated fully. Think of a jelly doughnut being squashed, and it hits nerves, causing bilateral sciatica. And I have irreparable sacral damage. And I have peripheral neuropathy. I haven’t felt my toes on my foot on the right side for many years, and my fingers are numb all the time every day. The pregnancy caused it. The eight. My size, my abdomen was all the way out here.” She stretched a hand for emphasis. There’s also what Ms. Suleman calls her genetic predispositions: migraines and endometriosis. Despite agony every day, she says she won’t take traditional medicine. “I’m a raw vegan, and I perceive pharmaceuticals to be poison.” she said. She relies on prayer, and home exercise. “If I didn’t climb 40 miles a week on the StairMaster, which acts as a buffer, then I’d be completely incapacitated.” She seems fit, head to foot in Nike, but contorted she looked uncomfortable. “I can adjust the pain based on my posturing,” said Ms. Suleman, who has a raspy voice, clearing her throat. “I’m not sick, I don’t get sick. I think it’s from being loud and yelling for what feels like the last 18 years. I have 14 children!” The children don’t get flu shots, but they do see doctors and have been vaccinated. “But my kids don’t get sick, and neither do I,” she said. “Well — you know my daughter, my teenager, she got a cold, but that’s about it. From Day 1, I’ve been giving them healthy food all the time. I hate cooking. I am not domestic.” Ms. Suleman said that she is working full-time as a counselor, but then added that she is focusing on family and relies on government assistance and “international photo shoots.” As with other statements she made, it was hard at times to get an entirely clear picture. She doesn’t date, she said, and she doesn’t have contact with the men who donated sperm to achieve her dreams. She did have breast augmentation, which she regrets, but she called the Angelina Jolie accusations false. So is the child endangerment. She said Protective Services is among her strongest supporters. If they believed she was a danger, they would have taken the children. (According to Ms. Suleman, her representative beat Ms. Allred’s suit; Ms. Allred declined to comment.) Ms. Suleman does have clear social phobias, but she isn’t the monster the public may expect. There’s a fragility to her that makes one want to root for her, and then there are her children, who appear to be thriving. “They’re the only surviving eight octuplets in the history of mankind,” Ms. Suleman said, beaming. “I’ve raised them to be wide-awake.” Their mother’s sex tape, her drug use, “we talk about everything,” Ms. Suleman said. “They know, they went through it with me. It’s a huge weight lifted off of all of them when I went back to who I was. We were struggling financially, but it was such a blessing to be able to be free from that. Those were chains.” For a time, her manager was a pornographic film star who led her into the XXX world; if Ms. Suleman puts that in her book, it could be a great guilty read. “I wanted to quit, but my manager said, ‘If you do, I’m reporting you to welfare for fraud.’ I gave my bank account to her to control because I was so overwhelmed and busy managing my family. Checks that were forged — minimum $60,000 was stolen in six months. And she was selling stories left and right. She was a predator.” What about their father? “Maybe the kids will meet him at 18, the donor,” Ms. Suleman said. “I don’t know.” “She’s been fighting for our family for 10 years now,” said Amerah, who’s like a second mother to the eight, which is what everyone calls them. Like her siblings, she has a preternatural responsibility. Not many teenagers would put up with sleeping on a couch or accepting such choices. “No matter what, she’s never going to give up and I know that,” Amerah said. The children themselves live largely insulated. “Most of my friends don’t know about the eight,” Amerah said. “When they were born, I was in elementary school. I would get questions about everything. But I would answer and say it’s my mom and my family. I was a little confused about that. I get that you’re interested, but I wouldn’t intrude on your family, why intrude on mine?” Joshua, the 15-year-old gamer, said: “Some of my friends don’t have any siblings, so they want to know what it’s like. It’s nice to have someone to play with, but it can be overwhelming at times.” Days begin at about 6:20 with a one-woman car pool — in a battered Ford E-350 Super Duty van she calls “the dump truck” — and caretaking. After school: cleaning, chores, bed by 8:30. Saturday family fun nights with vegan junk food and TV are a treat, but most outings aren’t as a group. “She’ll get anxiety, everyone staring, so she’ll take whoever’s behaving the best. There’s ups and downs,” said Amerah, who hopes to be an orthopedic surgeon and have a large family of her own. “Not 13, 14 kids,” though, she said. “Four. That’s big enough.”",The New York Times
2018,The Oil Industry’s Covert Campaign to Rewrite American Car Emissions Rules,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter. When the Trump administration laid out a plan this year that would eventually allow cars to emit more pollution, automakers, the obvious winners from the proposal, balked. The changes, they said, went too far even for them. But it turns out that there was a hidden beneficiary of the plan that was pushing for the changes all along: the nation’s oil industry. In Congress, on Facebook and in statehouses nationwide, Marathon Petroleum, the country’s largest refiner, worked with powerful oil-industry groups and a conservative policy network financed by the billionaire industrialist Charles G. Koch to run a stealth campaign to roll back car emissions standards, a New York Times investigation has found. The campaign’s main argument for significantly easing fuel efficiency standards — that the United States is so awash in oil it no longer needs to worry about energy conservation — clashed with decades of federal energy and environmental policy. “With oil scarcity no longer a concern,” Americans should be given a “choice in vehicles that best fit their needs,” read a draft of a letter that Marathon helped to circulate to members of Congress over the summer. Official correspondence later sent to regulators by more than a dozen lawmakers included phrases or sentences from the industry talking points, and the Trump administration’s proposed rules incorporate similar logic. The industry had reason to urge the rollback of higher fuel efficiency standards proposed by former President Barack Obama. A quarter of the world’s oil is used to power cars, and less-thirsty vehicles mean lower gasoline sales. In recent months, Marathon Petroleum also teamed up with the American Legislative Exchange Council, a secretive policy group financed by corporations as well as the Koch network, to draft legislation for states supporting the industry’s position. Its proposed resolution, dated Sept. 18, describes current fuel-efficiency rules as “a relic of a disproven narrative of resource scarcity” and says “unelected bureaucrats” shouldn’t dictate the cars Americans drive. A separate industry campaign on Facebook, covertly run by an oil-industry lobby representing Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Phillips 66 and other oil giants, urged people to write to regulators to support the rollback. The Facebook ads linked to a website with a picture of a grinning Mr. Obama. It asked, “Would YOU buy a used car from this man?” The site appears to have been so effective that a quarter of the 12,000 public comments received by the Department of Transportation can be traced to the petition, according to a Times analysis. Gary R. Heminger, Marathon’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement that the company supported “sound fuel economy standards” and wanted to “help ensure they are achievable and based on existing technology.” He added, “We appreciate the administration’s willingness to conduct a thorough review in order to ensure future standards are achievable and will actually benefit American consumers.” A spokesman for Koch Industries, the energy conglomerate led by Mr. Koch, said the company had “a long, consistent track record of opposing all forms of corporate welfare, including all subsidies, mandates and other handouts that rig the system.” The oil industry’s campaign, the details of which have not been previously reported, illuminates why the rollbacks have gone further than the more modest changes automakers originally lobbied for. The standards that the Trump administration seeks to weaken required automakers to roughly double the fuel economy of new cars, SUVs and pickup trucks by 2025. Instead, the Trump plan would freeze the standards at 2020 levels. Carmakers, for their part, had sought more flexibility in meeting the original 2025 standards, not a categorical rollback. The Trump plan, if finalized, would increase greenhouse gas emissions in the United States by more than the amount many midsize countries put out in a year and reverse a major effort by the Obama administration to fight climate change. The energy industry’s efforts also help explain the Trump administration’s confrontational stance toward California, which, under federal law, has a unique authority to write its own clean-air rules and to mandate more zero-emissions vehicles. California has pledged to stick to the stricter standards, together with 13 other states that follow its lead. But President Trump’s plan challenges California’s rule-writing power, setting up a legal battle that threatens to split the American auto market in two. That is a prospect automakers desperately want to avoid. But for gasoline producers like Marathon, a shift toward more efficient vehicles poses a grave threat to the bottom line. In October, the company acquired a rival, Andeavor, making it the biggest refiner in the United States, with sales of 16 billion gallons of fuel a year. Even while doubling down on gasoline, Marathon has projected an environmentally friendly public image. “We have invested billions of dollars to make our operations more energy efficient,” Marathon said in a recent report. The company’s Twitter account recently highlighted a gardening project and the creation of a duck pond at one of its refineries. On a conference call with investors last week, Mr. Heminger, the Marathon chief executive, was already counting the extra barrels of fuel a Trump rollback would mean for the industry: 350,000 to 400,000 barrels of gasoline per day, he said. “However, you have another side who doesn’t want to pivot away” from the stricter rules, Mr. Heminger said. “So we have a lot of work to do to keep this momentum going.” Marathon began its outreach to the Trump administration early, asking to meet with Scott Pruitt at the Environmental Protection Agency soon after he became its administrator in early 2017. Marathon had been a top donor to Mr. Pruitt in Oklahoma, a state where oil is so prominent that a well stands on the grounds of the capitol building. “Our CEO, Gary Heminger, would be very glad for an opportunity to visit with the Administrator,” a Marathon lobbyist wrote in an email to Mr. Trump’s transition team on May 8, 2017. “I believe this would be a constructive dialogue.” The E.P.A. helps oversee fuel economy rules along with the Transportation Department. Mr. Pruitt was scheduled to meet with the Marathon chief at least twice — once in June 2017 as part of a meeting with the board of a powerful fuel-industry group, American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, and again in September for a more private talk, according to emails and schedules released in a lawsuit filed by the Sierra Club. A Marathon spokesman, Chuck Rice, said Mr. Heminger did not discuss auto-efficiency rollbacks with Mr. Pruitt. An E.P.A. official did not respond to a question about whether the auto rules were discussed. Marathon then turned its focus to Congress, hiring the firm Ogilvy Government Relations to lobby legislators in Washington on fuel-economy standards, according to Ogilvy’s disclosure forms. The firm did not respond to a request for comment. Over the summer, Marathon representatives also approached legislators about an industry talking-points letter, according to six people familiar with that effort. The file properties of a Microsoft Word version of one letter, provided by a Congressional delegation, show that it was last edited by a Marathon lobbyist, Michael J. Birsic, on June 11, 2018. Mr. Rice of Marathon said the company did not write the letter, and the company declined to say who did. It did not offer an explanation for Mr. Birsic’s digital fingerprint on the document file. Nineteen lawmakers from the delegations of Indiana, West Virginia and Pennsylvania sent letters to the Transportation Department that included exact phrases and reasoning from the industry letter. The lawmakers’ letters, sent in June and July, all make the point that oil scarcity is no longer a concern. The Trump administration’s proposed rollback echoes the post-conservation theme. While energy conservation is significant, the proposal says, the downside of additional petroleum consumption would be dwarfed by the rollback’s benefits. Representatives from the three state delegations either declined to comment or did not respond to requests. Senator Tom Carper of Delaware, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, criticized the industry’s campaign. “It appears as though oil interests are cynically trying to gin up support in Congress for the weakest possible standards to ensure that cars and SUVs have to rely on even more oil,” he said. “If this attempt is successful, the outcome will be a blow to the auto industry, consumers, and our environment.” The Facebook ads, featuring Mr. Trump waving alongside the message, “SUPPORT OUR PRESIDENT’S CAR FREEDOM AGENDA!,” appeared the week after the administration made public its fuel economy plan in August. At least 10 times during the two-month public comment period on the plan, the ads, which did not state their oil industry origins, asked people to write to the government to back weaker emissions standards. Public comments matter in federal rule-making. The law requires that citizens’ views be taken into account before a rule is finalized. “File an official comment to SUPPORT our President’s plan for safer, cheaper cars that WE get to choose,” read one ad, which ran for seven days in early October. The ad leads to a page that provides basic language to submit. More than 3,300 of the 12,000 public comments that D.O.T. has made public contain language identical to that petition, an analysis of the files showed. The campaign was a product of the fuel and petrochemical manufacturers trade group, widely known as AFPM. However, neither the Facebook ads nor the site identified the industry group. Instead they name a group called Energy4US, which describes itself as “a coalition of consumers, businesses and workers” promoting affordable energy. Energy4US has close ties to the industry group. According to internet domain records, Victor Adams, listed as an AFPM web manager, registered Energy4Us.org in 2015 using his work email address. Energy4US lists the group as a coalition member, along with about 50 other groups including energy interests, labor groups, a sheriff’s association and even a recreational fishing alliance. The AFPM board includes representatives from Exxon, Chevron, Phillips 66, Marathon and Koch Industries. The companies all referred queries to the group. Derrick Morgan, a senior vice president at AFPM, said the group “regularly works with policymakers, coalition groups and individuals to promote shared goals,” and also will “lead and join groups like Energy4US.” The Department of Transportation said it was “generally aware” that there were groups urging the public to make comments through online campaigns, but said it does not regulate them. House bill 1593 is just eight words long: “To repeal the corporate average fuel economy standards.” Koch Industries, a petroleum empire with interests as diverse as gasoline, pipelines, fertilizer and Stainmaster carpets, is the bill’s sole corporate backer. The measure, which would eliminate fuel standards altogether, is not expected to go far. But it underscores the company’s stance on the matter. And Koch interests are fighting that battle not only in Washington but increasingly in statehouses and even local policy meetings nationwide. In Dearborn, Mich., at a September meeting on the Trump fuel-efficiency rollbacks, Annie Patnaude of Americans for Prosperity, a Koch-funded group, spoke in favor. “This is a step in the right direction to protect consumers and workers against government mandates that would limit choice,” she said. In Iowa, Americans for Prosperity joined the fight over whether to make it easier for gas stations to install chargers for electric vehicles. In Illinois, it discouraged state officials from considering subsidies for electric vehicles. And last month an Americans for Prosperity representative trekked to a public hearing in Colorado, where regulators were thinking about becoming the 13th state to follow California’s stricter standards. The representative, Shari Shiffer-Krieger, a field director for the group, argued that people in the rugged state wanted SUVs, not tighter emissions rules. “Coloradans deserve much better,” she said. The oil industry lost that fight. Colorado allied itself with California. But Americans for Prosperity said fights like these get to the heart of its free-market philosophy. “We believe in a level playing field so all Americans have the equal opportunity to succeed,” said Bill Riggs, a spokesman for the group, in a statement. The organization will keep fighting “mandates that unfairly pick winners and losers in any industry,” he said. On August 6, a Marathon lobbyist, Stephen D. Higley, emailed a Wisconsin state representative an explainer of American fuel economy law. The memo didn’t mince words. “It’s a relic,” the memo said, particularly at a time when the United States was “poised to become the largest oil producer in the world.” The Wisconsin representative, Mike Kuglitsch, participates in the American Legislative Exchange Council, a Koch-funded group that helps companies write model legislation for state lawmakers to use as a basis for their own laws. Emails obtained by the Times show that Marathon has been working with members of the legislative exchange council to build support for the Trump fuel-efficiency rollback in state legislatures and to denounce California’s power to write its own rules for cars. The emails were made public under Wisconsin’s open records law to Documented, a watchdog group that tracks corporate influence in public policy. California’s special authority could effectively split the American auto market in two, since 13 other states — representing roughly 35 percent of nationwide car sales — have agreed to follow California’s stricter rules. That means automakers might find themselves making cars to two competing standards. “Who should decide what cars and trucks consumers should buy, consumers themselves or unelected bureaucrats in Sacramento, California or Washington, D.C.?” the memo sent by Marathon said. In a statement, Bill Meierling of the legislative exchange council said that mandating fuel economy was a rule that “many state legislators believe doesn’t make sense for working Americans.” Just days after the emails between Marathon and the Wisconsin lawmaker, some 1,500 state legislators and other officials from across the country gathered in New Orleans to cheer on Elaine Chao, the Secretary of Transportation, at the legislative exchange council’s annual convention. Marathon sponsored the event. The Transportation Department was determined to cut government regulations, said Ms. Chao, a former fellow at the Heritage Foundation, which has received Koch funding and has long opposed the fuel economy rules. Mr. Trump’s proposed rollback, she said, “ranks as one of the most significant regulatory reforms that this administration is undertaking.” The room erupted in applause.

2018,The Original Ronaldo Adjusts to the Owner’s Box,"MADRID — It took the former World Cup winner Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima only weeks to realize that he would have to choose his words carefully now that he was a team owner. A short time after he spent roughly $30 million to become majority owner of the Spanish first-division club Real Valladolid in September, and made that rarest of transitions for a player of his stature, Ronaldo turned up for a game at Real’s Estadio José Zorrilla. From the directors’ box, he watched as winger Keko fluffed a scoring chance with only the goalkeeper to beat. Feeling he had something to offer, Ronaldo sought Keko out after the match. He told him to hold his nerve in such situations, to wait for the goalkeeper to make the first move. “It’s easy to say when you’re Ronaldo,” came the reply. “I stopped speaking,” Ronaldo said. “I will not tell them what I think anymore. “For me, things were very easy.” In a two-decade career that included scoring both goals in Brazil’s 2002 World Cup final victory, Ronaldo was a goal scoring phenom; a world player of the year at age 20, he made the name Ronaldo globally famous long before there was a Cristiano Ronaldo. His imprint on the current generation of stars is undeniable. He remains an idol for today’s generation of players, from Zlatan Ibrahimovic to Manchester United’s rugged midfielder Marouane Fellaini. England striker Harry Kane has said he regularly seeks out clips of Ronaldo, arguably soccer’s first icon of the internet age, to hone his own skills. Ronaldo’s purchase of 90-year-old Valladolid this summer might also show them there is more to post-career work than coaching roles or television punditry. “I think it’s beautiful if they do,” Ronaldo said last month of buying a club. “I hope that I start a moment to bring more player investment into football.” Since the top players all now earn salaries larger than the profits of medium-sized companies, there are signs that they may follow the lead of Ronaldo and David Beckham, who heads a group that owns Inter Miami, the Major League Soccer franchise set to debut in 2020. Barcelona defender Gerard Piqué has set up a sports investment fund with his teammates Lionel Messi and Cesc Fàbregas; the three have known one another since they were in the club’s youth program. “I talk to him about business; we still have to meet to discuss more,” Ronaldo, said of Piqué. Ronaldo, 42 and a father of four, traces his own interest in business to his first days in soccer. Born into a poor family that lived in a two-room house in Bento Ribeiro, a working class suburb of Rio de Janeiro, he became the family’s principal breadwinner at 15, when he moved 200 miles north to sign his first professional contract with the Belo Horizonte-based club Cruzeiro. He made his professional debut at 16. “I was obligated to start very early to manage myself, to manage my money, to manage my family,” he said in an interview with The New York Times, his first major interview since taking over Real Valladolid, in an office he has recently moved to on Madrid’s Calle Serrano. The imposing boulevard, lined with designer stores, upmarket restaurants and some of the most expensive apartments in Spain, is about 5,000 miles from Bento Ribeiro. It might as well be a different universe from the town where he learned the game, where poorly constructed cinder-block houses are tightly packed one against the other, and the idea of a luxury store would be considered fantasy. The life soccer has afforded Ronaldo was unimaginable when he was growing up. Some of the stars he played with couldn’t cope with the riches they made in the game, he said, recalling several examples of former teammates who have lost fortunes and are once again living in poverty. “I was afraid about that and decided to learn everything I could, do the best I could, have the best opinions in the marketing so I could better,” he said. In addition to buying Valladolid, he is also setting up a business called Family Office Concierge R9 that will handle players’ financial affairs, so they can continue to profit from their careers into retirement. “We are trying to do for them what I did for me: Make sure they have a long life with all the money they’ve got,” he said. Ronaldo said he had been curious about business from the days he was a gaptoothed teenager making life difficult for defenders unable to match his skill, his instincts and his pace. Business managers and sports marketing executives surrounded Ronaldo from his earliest days in Brazil and then in Europe, from his first steps at PSV Eindhoven in the Netherlands to his membership in Los Galacticos, the constellation of stars assembled at Real Madrid. He paid close attention to what they did, he said, especially executives at Nike, the American sporting goods colossus that continues to invest in his brand. At Real Madrid, Ronaldo played alongside Beckham, Zinedine Zidane and Luís Figo in an era when the team’s president, Florentino Pérez, tried to build a squad that was both a championship team and a sports marketing machine. Ronaldo’s Madrid teams failed to win the European game’s biggest prize, the Champions League, but they left an imprint of celebrity sizzle on the sport that endures. “I think the world of marketing and money in football was changed because of that,” he said. Since he stopped playing in 2011, Ronaldo has focused on self-improvement and building a diversified business empire. He was among the leaders of the committee that organized the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, working closely with several of the Brazilian soccer executives later charged with corruption by American investigators. (One of the men has been jailed in the United States, and two others still face charges; they deny the accusations against them, but Ronaldo offered his own verdict. “They did a horrible thing to football — they stole it from the people, ” Ronaldo said. “They stole the magic, the happiness.”) Diving into business full time, he built a sports marketing company as part of a joint venture with the world’s largest advertising group, WPP. The business operated for four years, and then Ronaldo purchased the sports marketing company Octagon’s Brazil operation. Those endeavors led to a friendship with the WPP founder Martin Sorrell, who convinced him to try living in London. Ronaldo lived there for three years, learning English along the way. He then moved to Madrid, where he lives with his girlfriend and is devoting most of his time to Valladolid, a club that Ronaldo’s personal brand and soccer standing significantly outshines. The club, located 120 miles north of Madrid, has won only one major trophy — in the now defunct Spanish league cup in 1984. The immediate aim, Ronaldo said, is to stay in the top division and to continue rubbing shoulders with the likes of Barcelona and Real Madrid. The long-term goal is to prove himself as an owner who “can do football better.” A wander around the satellite office in Madrid offers clues that much of the project remains in its infancy. A metal version of Valladolid’s crest is the only sign of decoration on the bare white walls in the entrance hall, while other rooms feature empty shelves and newly acquired chairs and desks waiting for occupants. Ronaldo himself sits at a desk with little more than a laptop and some stationery for his company. He will not divulge many details of his plans for Valladolid, but there are signs that much of the focus will be on leveraging his fame and his links to Brazil so he can profit in the $6 billion player-transfer market. Within months of taking over, Ronaldo has almost tripled the number of scouts at Valladolid, to 15, and he says he is looking to add another six. “There is a huge business in that, I think,” said Ronaldo, whose own transfer rights were first purchased for $7,500 in 1992 by two Rio businessmen. He is also planning to invest in Valladolid’s academy, to unearth and develop local talent. And then there is Ronaldo himself. Though he now carries many more pounds on his sturdy frame than he did in his playing days, Ronaldo still possesses star power capable of stopping traffic in cities around the world. Smartphone-wielding fans continue to pester him for photographs with the same vigor they pursue the current generation of stars, and a documentary film crew has shadowed Ronaldo for the past year, ahead of the release of a big-budget film on his life. Years after he stopped playing the game, he explained, his biggest strength — in business, at Real Valladolid and possibly one day in soccer governance — continues to be his own brand. “I couldn’t be here without me,” he said. An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the former World Cup winner and majority owner of Real Valladolid. He is Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima, not Ronaldo Luíz Nazário de Lima.",The New York Times
2018,The Origins of the Times Square Ball Drop,"Times Insider It started out as fireworks and dynamite to promote the new New York Times Building, and eventually evolved into the famous ball drop. CreditCredit On Dec. 31, 1904, hundreds of thousands of revelers gathered in Midtown Manhattan, near the newly constructed New York Times Building. Then, as the clock struck midnight, there was an explosion of dynamite — and the tower appeared to catch on fire. But the flames were controlled and very much intentional. In fact, they were the idea of The Times’s publisher, Adolph S. Ochs, who was hoping to show off the company’s new building. “No more beautiful picture was ever limned in fire on the curtain of midnight,” The Times reported the next day. “From the four corners of the skyscraper lambent flames played. From base to dome the giant structure was alight.” The sight was “a torch to usher in the new born, a funeral pyre for the old which pierced the very heavens,” The Times wrote. By 1905, the city blocks around the new building — Times Square, named after The Times — had already become a New Year’s Eve destination. A description from that first New Year’s Eve celebration in The Times could have been written in any year since: “As early as 9 o’clock the square was packed, and when the time approached when another year should be inscribed upon the century book the crush was so great that progress was well nigh impossible in any direction.” Over the last 114 years, the festivities have swelled into a global event. The police close off the area to traffic in the afternoon to control the crowd, and an estimated 1.2 billion spectators tune in on TV. For years, the Times Square Alliance, the co-organizer of New Year’s Eve in Times Square, has selected honorees for the year-end celebration. Following a deadly year for reporters, photographers and other media workers — at least 60 were killed worldwide, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists — the event’s organizers have announced that the 2019 party will celebrate journalism and press freedom, and that the committee will be its official charity honoree. “In a place that is synonymous with news and home to multiple national news broadcasts, and which itself was named after a newspaper (which started the New Year’s celebration here in 1904), no theme could be more apt as we enter 2019,” Tim Tompkins, the president of the alliance, said in a statement. But the celebration was not originally so high-minded. In the last years of the 19th century, The Times was struggling. Mr. Ochs, who bought the paper in 1896, spent the early years of his tenure dragging it back from the brink of bankruptcy. Slowly, things turned around. By 1902, Mr. Ochs had decided to move the paper’s downtown headquarters, on 41 Park Row, north to the intersection of Broadway and Seventh Avenue, which was then named Longacre Square. The Times was set to move to its new home on New Year’s Day, 1905, and Mr. Ochs wanted to christen the new building with a show. (The Times also ran a 40-odd-page special section in the first issue of 1905 describing the building in meticulous detail — down to architectural renderings of the tower’s subbasement.) For the New Year’s Eve fireworks, The Times hired Henry J. Pain, a chemist who had done the pyrotechnic displays for the presidential inauguration of William McKinley. It was not the first time the building had served as a beacon. Before the paper’s staff had even moved into the new building, Mr. Ochs had begun experimenting with ways to use the tower. In November 1904, The Times announced the winner of that year’s presidential election with searchlight signals on top of the 412-foot building: A steady light pointed west meant that Theodore Roosevelt had won, according to a decoder published before the election. On Dec. 31, 1904, the paper ran a small front-page advertisement inviting readers to the corner of 43rd Street and Broadway that night to celebrate “the removal of The New York Times to its new building.” And celebrate they did. “Every known device for making noise was pressed into service,” The Times reported. “There were horns of all shapes and sizes — horns which wailed with an almost human note and horns which carried an ear-shattering volume of sound. One of the favorite kinds of horns was fashioned in the semblance of a champagne bottle and gave forth a series of notes which sounded the scale from top to bottom. There were long horns and thin horns, thin horns and stout.” The following year, the Times Tower celebration again included explosives. But by New Year’s Eve of 1907, The Times replaced the fireworks with a 700-pound, electrified ball that would be lowered from the top of the Times Building, setting off a century-long tradition. A version of the ball would be dropped almost every year thereafter. Doris Burke contributed research.",The New York Times
2018,The Otherworldly Beauty of a Dying Sea,"The Dead Sea is falling by more than a meter a year, and paradoxically, its destruction is revealing an eerie, enchanting world below the waters. Jake Ben Zaken steered his boat along the western shore of the Dead Sea, cut the motor, and bobbed amid the white towers of salt rising out of the turquoise water. Just last year, many of these circular towers, their bumpy surfaces now glistening in the afternoon sun, were beneath the water in this shrinking salty lake. “I look for the beauty in this environmental crisis,” said Mr. Ben Zaken, whose Salty Landscapes boat tours take travelers out onto the surface of the Dead Sea, where the water level is falling by more than a meter a year as human consumption depletes its sources. “I’m trying to the see the light, because the darkness is always there.” The tours — the only current commercial option for boating on the Dead Sea — are part of a tourism industry that, paradoxically, is growing, even as the sea, famous for its highly salinated water, mud and minerals and for being the lowest place on earth, dries up. “The Dead Sea is truly a unique phenomenon, one that has drawn explorers and scientists for a long time,” said Yehouda Enzel, head of the Fredy and Nadine Herrmann Institute of Earth Sciences at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. “But now the landscape around it, and under it is exposed more and more.” Because it is not connected to an ocean, the Dead Sea is not technically a sea, but a lake. For the last 60 years, it has been shrinking as the surrounding populations of Syria, Israel, Jordan and the West Bank have depleted its main water sources — the Jordan River and Sea of Galilee (also a lake) — and as fertilizer and chemical companies in both Israel and Jordan evaporate its water to extract minerals, scientists say. The surface area of the lake has contracted by about a third to its current 630 square kilometers, according to the Geological Survey of Israel. LEBANON SYRIA Sea of Galilee Jordan River Mediterranean Sea West Bank JORDAN Jerusalem Mitspe Shalem Dead Sea GAZA STRIP Ein Gedi Ein Bokek ISRAEL EGYPT 50 Miles By The New York Times Hotels and spas that once lined the waterfront are now hundreds of meters from the shoreline, and some resorts and beaches have been forced to close in recent years because of the thousands of sinkholes that have resulted from the drying up of the water and the ground around it. Fences with signs warning of sinkholes line much of the western coast, whose dry brown expanse is also dotted with abandoned date palm groves, closed roads, and shuttered buildings, including a defunct gas station. In many places the shoreline is covered with crusts of salt. Pillars and blobs of salt rise from the shallow edges of the water. The eerie, yet enchanting, landscape is increasingly drawing visitors. In 2017, the number of overnight stays in Israeli hotels on the Dead Sea rose 35 percent compared to 2016, according to Israel’s Central Bureau of Statistics. Betting on continued growth, Israel’s tourism ministry recently spent 500 million shekels, or about $135 million to renovate beaches, and build a waterfront walkway at the resort area of Ein Bokek on the Dead Sea’s southern basin, where a new shopping mall opened in November. Two new hotels are also in the planning stages, the first significant development in more than 30 years. The southern basin — always shallower than the deep northern basin where Mr. Ben Zaken runs his boat trips — would be completely dry now if the companies harvesting salts and minerals from the Dead Sea didn’t pump water into it, according to scientists. In Jordan, where the number of tourists rose about 8 percent in 2017 compared to 2016 and is on track to increase at a similar rate in 2018, a new Hilton Hotel opened last year on the Dead Sea, and $1.5 billion joint Kuwaiti-Jordanian government project is underway to build more hotels, an amusement park and other tourism infrastructure along the seashore. While the northern basin will likely not disappear any time soon, it is expected to become shallower and to lose an additional 10 percent of its surface area in the next 50 years, said Nadav Lensky, the head of the Geological Survey’s Dead Sea Observatory, which researches evaporation and other dynamics of the sea. The falling water level also means that the salinity of the water has increased, and since the 1980s, the water has become so concentrated that crystals of salt now accumulate on the bottom in a process called halite precipitation. “The Dead Sea is the only place in the world where we see this phenomenon in modern time,” Mr. Lensky said, explaining that millions of years ago, halite precipitation in many of the deep saline lakes that once covered the earth led to the creation of massive, thick salt deposits in places like Poland’s Wieliczka salt mines and the oil-rich Delaware Basin under Texas and New Mexico. It is also halite precipitation that has created the salt sculptures that first began peeking out above the surface of the Dead Sea about 10 years ago, Mr. Lensky said. Because the shape, size and number of salt crystals piling up on the sea bottom vary with the water’s salinity, evaporation rate and temperature, the resulting structures also vary in shape, he said. With much of the sea’s western shore off limits because of sinkholes, Mr. Ben Zaken’s blue and red Dutch-made boat — named Nefeli after a cloud nymph in Greek mythology — is the only way to see this otherworldly salty landscape up close. “It was like being on the moon,” said Natali Tamir, a smartphone photography instructor from Tel Aviv who was inspired to take the boat ride in October after seeing photographs that one of her students had taken on a previous tour. “I have been to the Dead Sea many times and was aware of what was happening there, but on this boat I suddenly understood how dramatic it is, and how sad it is seeing things that won’t be there in five years.” The tours, which require advance reservation, leave from the Dead Sea shore near the Mitzpe Shalem settlement on the Israeli-occupied West Bank, about 45 miles from Jerusalem. A one-and-a half-hour tour is 180 shekels ($48) and a three-hour tour is 250 shekels ($67) per person. The boat holds up to 12 people. Bobbing among the salt towers, Mr. Ben Zaken pointed out similar structures on the shore, where the water has receded, now brown and gray, and some toppled over. “Those are dead,” he said, before starting up the boat’s engine and motoring past islands of salt that resembled heaps of melting snow or piles of shiny pearls. Mr. Ben Zaken, 54, -who lives in Mitzpe Shalem, served in Israel’s Navy and worked on a commercial crab boat in Alaska. He cranked up the motor and headed to deeper water. The salt formations faded into the distance, as did the desolate brown beaches beyond them. Across the water to the east rose Jordan’s pink Abarim mountains. “I am all alone out here,” Mr. Ben Zaken said as he reached a speed of about 25 knots, fast enough to leave a wake on the water, which reaches depths of about 1,000 feet. Aside from a scientific research boat located several miles south near Ein Gedi, and not visible from here, Mr. Ben Zaken’s Nefeli — and the fleet of kayaks he began operating last year — were the only vessels on the Dead Sea. Military restrictions, a constantly-receding shoreline and expensive maintenance to prevent salt buildup on the bottom of vessels all make boating here difficult, and contributed to the closing about 15 years ago of a large wooden ship named Lot’s Wife (she famously turned into a pillar of salt in the Bible) that took groups of tourists out on the water, Mr. Ben Zaken said. But historical texts and archaeological finds of ancient anchors and harbors indicate that the Dead Sea had a thriving maritime culture for thousands of years. “Like any other sea, it should have boats,” said Mr. Ben Zaken, who bought his first boat in 2011, when he was working as an auto mechanic, then waited two years for military permission to start using it and build up a tour business. Last year, he added kayak tours, bought a second boat, and is looking to hire an additional skipper to meet growing demand. Out on the water, Mr. Ben Zaken slowed his boat near what looks like a wall of brown stairs on a nearby shore. “Each one of those steps is a year of losing water,” he said. Continuing south, the last stop on tour was his kibbutz’s Mineral Beach resort, which was forced to close in 2015 after a large sinkhole opened up, swallowing up palm trees, the parking lot and some buildings. The air smelled like sulfur, and the water was the color of pea soup. The lifeguard stand had collapsed onto the gray sand, and empty lounge chairs sat under thatch palm huts. Mr. Ben Zaken pointed to a wooden shed that used to serve as his boat house. After the beach closed, he lost access to the boat shed, and now has to launch his tours from a point further south, reachable only with an off-road vehicle. At the end of each day, he pulls his boat out of the water, loads into on a trailer, then hauls it with a tractor more than half a mile through the desert, over dry land that was once underwater, and rinses the salt water off the boat each night.

2018,The Paper Published a Holiday Books Guide in 1851 — and Every Year Since,"Inside the List Thanks to the holidays, book sales soar in November and December. People often turn to gift guides — like The Times’s most recent edition — for inspiration. It’s been that way for a while. In 1851, the year it began publishing, The Times ran two holiday gift-book guides — one for adults, which recommended such titles as “The Women of Early Christianity” and “Legends of the Flowers” (“imaginary conversations between lilies, jasmines, violets and the rest”), and one for children, which highlighted “Queer Bonnets” (“a story with a very excellent moral for these days of lavish dress”) and “Contentment Is Better than Wealth” (“admirable tales for young folks”). Beautifully illustrated books were popular then; the paper noted plenty of “heavy cream-tinted paper, broad margins and the finest engravings,” “luxurious bindings” and “extremely rich and elaborate illustrations.” At first, the gift books were largely nonfiction — many of them special editions and keepsakes — but as the years passed, The Times began to include more fiction. In 1877 a popular illustrated novel called “One Summer” topped the holiday list: “The plot turns on an accident to a young man from his eye coming in contact with the umbrella of a maiden.” By 1897, the paper declared that sumptuous, costly Christmas books, those “resplendent quartos and folios,” were “attractive to look at, but impossible to read,” and made a conscious shift away from them: “This year’s holiday books are books meant to be read — books not for a season, but for a year or a life.” [ Looking for the perfect gift? Dip into the paper’s Holiday Books issue.] By 1906, the holiday books guide had grown so large that it had to be split into two issues. An article in the paper that year stated, “We take no little pride in our double Holiday Book Number, which … will comprise 56 pages, and in the rich variety and value of its contents this special number certainly surpasses any previous achievement in literary journalism.” When The Times first began following New York City book sales in the early 20th century, it was clear that the paper’s holiday book guide had an impact at the cash register. Though it is impossible to make that kind of correlation these days, a quick look at social media indicates that many people use The Times’s Holiday Books package when shopping. As of this moment, there are nine titles from that issue on the paper’s extended best-seller list.

2018,The Paris Accord Promised a Climate Solution. Here’s Where We Are Now.,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter. World leaders struck an agreement three years ago in Paris to avert the worst effects of climate change, accepting not only that greenhouse gases were dangerously heating the planet, but also that every single country needed to do its part to curtail emissions. Now, emissions are rising in the United States and China, the world’s two largest economies. Other countries are backsliding on their commitments. The world as a whole is not meeting its targets under the Paris pact. As diplomats meet in Katowice, Poland, this week to bring the deal into effect, the world’s 7.6 billion people face mounting risks from more severe and more frequent floods, droughts and wildfires. The Paris Agreement, it seems, is only as good as the willingness of national leaders to keep their word. “We have the ways,” António Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, said this week in Katowice. “What we need is the political will to move forward.” Champions of the accord point out that the diplomatic process is alive and well and that all of the world’s 195 countries are still in the deal, including the United States, which can exit only at the end of 2020. The science is sharper than before on the dangers of unchecked emissions, and a great many countries, including the poorest, are pushing for more ambitious targets. The Katowice talks are facing a Saturday deadline, and Mr. Guterres has visited twice to push diplomats to bridge their still-large differences on the details of a “rule book” that will allow countries to implement the Paris Agreement. “To waste this opportunity in Katowice would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change,” Mr. Guterres said. “It would not only be immoral, it would be suicidal.” How did we get here? Things started to change with the election of Donald J. Trump. Less than six months after taking office, he announced the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement. At home, his administration has pushed to overturn pollution regulations, making it far less likely that the United States will meet its Paris pledge to cut emissions sharply by 2025. In August, an effort in Australia to transition away from coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, resulted in the ouster of the prime minister. The man who succeeded him, Scott Morrison, endeared himself to the industry by bringing a lump of coal into Parliament. In November, Brazilians elected Jair Bolsonaro, who had pledged to promote agribusiness interests in the Amazon forest, the world’s largest carbon sink. In Poland, the host country of the latest United Nations talks, the right-wing president, Andrzej Duda, opened the negotiations by saying flatly that his country did not intend to abandon coal. Other leaders face their own domestic difficulties. Emissions in China have grown for the past two years, signaling the difficulties of shifting the country away from its coal-dependent industrial economy. Germany is having a hard time moving away from lignite because of political opposition in the country’s coal-rich east. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, faces unrest at home over a layer cake of taxes that working-class people say burdens them unfairly. All the while, the science has become clearer. A United States government report issued last month concluded that if significant steps were not taken to rein in global warming, it would put a huge dent in the American economy by century’s end. And an exhaustive report issued weeks before by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, compiled by hundreds of scientists from around the world convened by the United Nations, said emissions would have to decline significantly by 2030 for the world to avoid a world of worsening food shortages and wildfires. “The I.P.C.C. has sounded many alarms, and the world just keeps smashing the alarm and keeps on sleeping,” said Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, founder of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, on the sidelines of the talks in Katowice. The world as a whole is not on track to meet the broad goal it set for itself in Paris: to keep the increase in global temperatures “well below” 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, over preindustrial levels. Under the agreement, each country put forward a voluntary pledge to curtail its own emissions. So far, those voluntary pledges have not been sufficient. New data made public in Poland this week by the group Climate Action Tracker estimated that current climate policies put the world on pace for somewhere around 3.3 degrees Celsius. “If we are serious about the Paris Agreement, we need to see different numbers,” Petteri Taalas, head of the World Meteorological Organization, told the delegates in Katowice this week. He noted that global emissions had risen in 2018. The negotiations in Katowice are aimed at setting out the rules by which countries will regularly update their emissions-reductions pledges and assess one another’s progress. But even those technical discussions about the rule book have been bogged down by intense political differences. “We are in a planetary emergency and the longer we waste time in the negotiating room not acknowledging this fact, we do so at the cost of our people and our communities,” a statement from a bloc of poor countries, led by Ethiopia, urged on Thursday. For its part, even though the United States has said it intends to withdraw from the Paris deal, the country has still sent a delegation to the negotiations. “These global energy and environmental policies will have an impact on U.S. interests, and we want to make sure we protect those so they’re not hamstringing economic growth, innovation, entrepreneurship in the U.S.,” said Wells Griffith, Mr. Trump’s international energy and climate adviser. The Trump administration pointedly refused to embrace the United Nations’ scientific report, siding with three other major oil- and gas-producing countries — Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait — to block a resolution in Poland to “welcome” the report. To be sure, the Paris pact, and the growing scientific clarity about global warming, has spurred countries and businesses to reorient themselves. From shipping to fast food to insurance, companies are setting their own targets to reduce carbon footprints. Solar and wind energy is expanding rapidly. Within the United States, a number of cities and states have dissented from the Trump administration’s planned exit and created their own local plans to green their economies. Christiana Figueres, the former United Nations climate chief who led the Paris negotiations to their conclusion in December 2015, argued that the pact had set into motion a fundamental transformation of the global economy away from fossil fuels. It would be naïve, she said, to not expect pushback. “Not to fall into Pollyanna land here, one has to recognize that of course there are huge, huge very powerful, very well endowed vested forces that are very threatened by this,” Ms. Figueres said in a podcast streamed on her website. “Let’s not get paralyzed by that,” she said.

2018,The Passionate Humility of Solomon Dumas,"This Alvin Ailey dancer — the first to go from AileyCamp to the main company — has had a breakout season with leading roles in two major premieres. CreditCreditIke Edeani for The New York Times A dancer isn’t always born a dancer. Sometimes a mother has to step in. Growing up on the South Side of Chicago with his single working mother, Solomon Dumas was involved in community theater and interested in the arts. But dance wasn’t much of a presence in his life until his mother signed him up for AileyCamp, when he was 12. “She made me go,” Mr. Dumas said. “My mother kept me busy. There wasn’t a lot of idle time. She kept me in programs.” AileyCamp turned out to be a good choice. “After that camp, I was completely obsessed,” he said. “We learned discipline through dance and we started each day with affirmations. I remember receiving a souvenir program book, and I had never seen so many beautiful people in my life. I said, Oh my gosh, they look like me. Or I want to look like them. There was this elegance, this sophistication. And that was something that I needed to see at that time.” Mr. Dumas, nearing his third year in Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, is the only member to have started as an Ailey camper and gone on to join the main company. (AileyCamps — there were 10 in 2018 — are summer day camps for ages 11-14.) “I didn’t realize I forced him,” his mother, Beverly Rogers, said laughing. “It was just he went wherever I said to go. He never complained. He may have grunted a little bit, but I didn’t pay that any attention.” Ms. Rogers can’t say that she knew he was a dancer or an actor as a child, but recalled that before he could walk, whenever he heard music, he would bounce. At 30, Mr. Dumas seems to have retained some of that bounce. Even when seated for an interview in the lounge at New York City Center — where the Ailey company’s season continues through Sunday — his body was full of vibrations that extended to slender fingers drumming rhythms on a table or gesticulating into the air. It’s an energy that has been radiating from the stage this season, a spectacular one for Mr. Dumas, who danced leading parts in new works by Ronald K. Brown (“The Call”) and Rennie Harris (“Lazarus”). [Read our review of “Lazarus,” a Critic’s Pick.] Created as part of the company’s 60th anniversary, and each in its way a homage to Ailey, they are two of the most important and affecting dances of the year — not just at the Ailey company, but period. They’re meaningful, even masterly additions to the repertory, giving the company something to sink its physical and emotional weight into. That came through in the dancing, which was full of reverence and urgency. In both premieres, Mr. Dumas showed his range, his unforced strength and his quiet, simmering power. He isn’t flashy; his grounded presence is what makes him so beguiling. Robert Battle, the company’s artistic director, said he had been especially moved by Mr. Dumas this season. “I almost didn’t recognize him in a good way,” Mr. Battle said. “He’s kind of a chameleon.” The circumstances under which Mr. Dumas performed the lead in “The Call” were stressful. The morning of its premiere was just an ordinary day — hectic, but ordinary — when he noticed that Masazumi Chaya, the group’s associate artistic director, was watching company class. That was odd enough, but stranger still was that Mr. Chaya was watching him. [Read our review of “The Call,” a Critic’s Pick.] It turned out that Jamar Roberts, scheduled to dance the lead, was injured, and Mr. Brown, the choreographer, wanted Mr. Dumas to take over. Mr. Dumas was panicked. He didn’t know the steps; his focus had been on his part in the dance’s trio. “I had to basically learn it within an hour,” Mr. Dumas said. “I was like, ‘I’m not ready, I’m not ready.’” But Mr. Brown pulled him aside. “When he asked me, I couldn’t say no,” said Mr. Dumas, who used to be a member of Mr. Brown’s company. “You don’t say no to Ron.” The two first worked together when Mr. Dumas was a student at the Ailey school. After Mr. Dumas completed two years with Ailey II, the company’s junior division, he joined Mr. Brown’s troupe. “I just waited my turn,” Mr. Brown said. Mr. Dumas knows about waiting his turn: His path to the main company hasn’t been a direct one. After his AileyCamp experience, he attended the Chicago Academy for the Arts as well as at the Russell Talbert Dance Studio, where he continued his training after school. There, his focus was ballet. “I was in the studio until about 9 p.m. every day, even sometimes on Sundays.” Before he trained at the Ailey school, he was briefly a member of Garth Fagan Dance. After leaving Mr. Brown’s company, he was weighing his options: He was an instructor at Barry’s Bootcamp, and had started acting classes. But there was an Ailey audition and he decided to go. It was his fifth try, and there was only one male spot open. “I always thought if I got into the company it would be during this mass exodus when there were maybe four spots,” he said. “I never thought that I would be the one guy. Because I wasn’t the tall guy. I wasn’t the leggy guy. I was never that dancer known for the tricks and the things you would associate Ailey with.” Yet for Mr. Brown, he has a kind of passionate humility. “He goes for broke, but not like he’s trying to impress you — and not like he even knows,” he said. “He takes over the stage and is still kind of unassuming. He doesn’t dance small and he doesn’t apologize when he’s dancing. It’s like butter and fire at the same time.” This season, Mr. Dumas said he was grateful to spend so much time in the studio with choreographers like Mr. Brown, Mr. Harris and Twyla Tharp, who worked with him closely on “The Golden Section” (1981). The day she arrived was a memorable one. “I open the piece and as soon as I went across the floor, she stopped the music,” he said. “I said, Oh God, this is the most embarrassing thing. She came to me and said: ‘Look at me. You’re holding back.’” He started over; she stopped the music again and told him again, more firmly, that he was holding back. “And then I did it” — he snapped his fingers — “I don’t know what clicked in. She said, ‘That’s what I’m talking about.’ She kind of broke me down.” Ms. Tharp worked with the company for a week and spent so much time with Mr. Dumas that Mr. Battle said he wondered, “Is she going to take him and leave with him?” She taught him about daring: The difference between simply performing a role and dancing like you’re not afraid to fall down. But while Mr. Dumas is enjoying such challenges, he said he’s not one of those dancers who plans to stay in the company for 20 years. “Hell, no,” he said, laughing. But “only because there are so many other things that I want to do dance-wise — and everything else.” At the same time, he knows that, well, you never know. He said he was shocked when Mr. Battle hired him. “I did have an emotional moment because I thought back to being an Ailey camper,” he said of learning the news in Mr. Battle’s office. “I still have his handkerchief. He told me that he liked my dancing and that he had no idea that I was coming. There were no preconceived ideas or notions — I wasn’t on the radar. I just came in and he said, ‘Wow — O.K., I’ll go with him.’ I’m so glad he took the chance.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Patrician President and the Reporterette: A Screwball Story,"My faithful correspondent, Poppy Bush, scribbling and typing notes through decades of history. Opinion Columnist Nobody understood our relationship — least of all us. It was, admittedly, odd. “I like you,” the first President Bush wrote me once, after he was out of office. “Please don’t tell anyone.” In decades of correspondence, he tried to figure out why we stayed in touch, beginning one note “Darn you Maureen Dowd” and mischievously observing in another, “Sometimes I found it better around my family to go ‘Maureen who?’” At times, typing on what he called “my little IBM,’’ he signed off “Con afecto, GB,’’ or if I was writing critically about his sons, “Con Afecto, still, just barely though! gb.’’ Or “Love” scratched out and replaced with the handwritten rebuke, “not quite there yet.” I come from a line of Irish maids who worked for the first families of America, the Mellons and the Gores, wealthy, aristocratic families like the Bushes. George Herbert Walker Bush, known by his childhood nickname of Poppy, was cared for by maids and chauffeured to kindergarten at Greenwich Country Day School. His idea of cursing like a sailor entailed unleashing a string of epithets like “Golly!” “Darn!” and “Oh, shoot!” His father was a Wall Street banker turned Connecticut senator who was straight out of central casting: craggy, 6-foot-4, wearing gray worsted suits even in warm weather. My brothers, Michael and Martin, teenage pages at the Capitol in the ’50s, were in awe of him. Michael was in the Senate mail room one day when the young man sorting letters held up one addressed to the Connecticut senator and mused: “You just know a guy with a name like Prescott Bush is not driving a bus.” If the Clintons are the careless Tom and Daisy Buchanan and Barack Obama is a Camus-like figure of existential estrangement and Donald Trump is a flimflam man out of “Huckleberry Finn,’’ H.W. was Bertie Wooster, an airy WASP propelled to the top by the old boys’ network. In another life, I probably would have been serving President Bush his vodka martini, made to perfection with a splash of dry vermouth, two olives and a cocktail onion. But I came along just as the old world of Ivy League white men running everything was breaking up. My mom had applied for a job as a reporter at The Washington Post in 1926 and had been told by a gruff city editor that it was too rough a trade for a young lady. But by 1988, I could be The New York Times White House reporter. And that was a shock to the system for H.W. He was all noblesse oblige and I was all class rage. He was clearly expecting someone with a name like Horatio Farnsworth III, a Harvard man who would bat around the finer points of the North Atlantic alliance over highballs on Air Force One. And he got a newfangled, irreverent “reporterette,’’ as Rush Limbaugh called us in those days, who was just as focused on character and personality as politics and policy. At dinner one night, President Bush’s pollster, Bob Teeter, had a couple of martinis and got frank with me: “We just don’t see you as The New York Times White House reporter. We see you more at a newspaper like the New York Daily News or the Chicago Tribune.” Dumbfounded, I stammered, “You mean because I’m a woman with an ethnic, working-class background?’’ Yes, Teeter replied. And thus began the screwball story, spanning decades, mystifying everyone, of the patrician president and the impertinent reporter. I wrote a lot about how the preppy with the striped watchband transformed his blue-blooded Yale background to seem more red-blooded Texas, putting Tabasco sauce on his tuna fish sandwiches, wearing cowboy boots emblazoned with “GB,” listening to the Oak Ridge Boys and Reba McEntire, and pretending that pork rinds were his favorite snack rather than popcorn. He protested that his mesquite side was genuine. “Can I name drop right here?” he wrote me once. “I am mad about Reba and she likes me, too — so there!” Fortunately, H.W. was too gracious to hold my background and writing style against me for long. He adapted and treated me with utter fairness and kindness, even when I dubbed him “goofy” for bouncing around like Tom Hanks in “Big,” an irrepressible boy in a dignified man’s body. “Ants on a hot pan,’’ the Chinese christened him, for his frenetic personality. What other commander in chief wore a bunny tie on Easter and a pumpkin tie on Halloween? Who else would sit in the White House reading women’s magazines with his wife and then look up to ask, “Bar, what’s a bikini wax?” Who else would go to the magic shop near the White House and fill his office with items like a red rope that turned white, a calculator that squirted water and cash on a string so you could yank it back when someone tried to pick it up? He also had a crystal ball with a disembodied voice that gave Delphic answers to questions about tax increases: “The images are cloudy. Have someone else ask.” Who else would send me a Polaroid of himself wearing a T-shirt that said “Broccoli Lover”? Or a picture of himself and Barbara parodying that famous attenuated Al and Tipper Gore convention kiss? Who else would jump out of a plane on his 90th birthday, years after he began using a wheelchair? Waiting for her husband on the landing pad of their church in Kennebunkport, Barbara dryly noted that if the parachute didn’t open, at least they wouldn’t have to go far for the funeral. Poppy wasn’t perfect. I recoiled when he beat Michael Dukakis with the race-baiting Willie Horton campaign designed by Lee Atwater and Roger Ailes. And again when he sent his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, to Beijing for a secret midnight champagne toast with the leaders who perpetrated the Tiananmen Square massacre. And again when he didn't do nearly enough to combat the AIDS epidemic. And again when his White House directed the defense of his Supreme Court nominee, Clarence Thomas, that tried to discredit Anita Hill. Unlike President Trump, who does his own wet work, the Bushes took the more refined route of outsourcing their ends-justify-the-means moves. But, as politicians go, 41 had many good qualities. Most of the time, he tried to do the right and decent thing, as he saw it, to act for the good of the country and the world. He earned his sobriquet from his biographer Jon Meacham: “The Last Gentleman.” Covering H.W.’s White House was wildly different than covering Donald Trump’s. A Trump day bursts with a fusillade of huge news stories, often starting at dawn with a crazy tweet and usually involving the amorality, criminality and vulgarity of the president and his circle. I could go for months without getting a juicy story out of 41’s White House. It was often hard to even break into the paper — unless we discovered that the president showered with his dog, Millie, or that Millie was suffering from lead poisoning from licking the White House paint. In the absence of stories about impeachment, porn stars and white-collar criminal transgressions, I was left writing about Bush-speak, 41’s tangled syntax. At a Knoxville high school, when he was asked about ideas to improve schools, he replied: “Well, I’m going to kick that one right into the end zone of the Secretary of Education.’’ Sometimes he forgot and read his stage directions, like: “Message: I care.” As Lance Morrow wrote in Time magazine, the president treated words as “perverse, buzzing little demons that need to be brushed away periodically like flies.” This did not help H.W. in debates with Bill Clinton, which is why he was caught impatiently checking his watch. He once tried to dismiss a reporter who asked about his role in the Iran-contra scandal, chiding: “You’re burning up time. The meter is running through the sand on you, and I am now filibustering.” He went past dialoguing with other world leaders to “trialoguing.” He often quoted some advice from his mother, using it for all occasions: “So tomorrow there’s going to be another tidal wave, so keep your snorkel above the water level.” He shunned personal pronouns because his beloved mother, Dorothy, always warned him not to gloat or focus on “the big I.” Asked what the Malta summit with Mikhail Gorbachev would mean for the world, Bush replied: “Grandkids. All of that. Very important.” In his State of the Union message, he asked: “Ambitious aims? Of course. Easy to do? Far from it.’’ Once on his beloved cigarette boat, the Fidelity, he told me, “Can’t act. Just have to be me.” Dana Carvey mocked the president by standing in front of the Berlin Wall on “Saturday Night Live” and intoning: “Before Bush, wall. With Bush, no wall.’’ Bush, who loved to laugh and who traded barbershop jokes with his Secretary of State James Baker and his image wizard Sig Rogich, ended up putting a tape of Carvey mimicking him in his presidential library. (His fondness for dirty jokes grew antiquated, colliding in the end with the #MeToo wave, for which he apologized.) After 43 became president, 41 wrote to Time’s Hugh Sidey with a self-deprecating comparison to John Adams, the only other president whose son also became president: “A prolific reader, he loved the classics, prided himself on his ability to speak Latin, and had a library of extraordinary proportions. I couldn’t wait to stop studying Latin. Big difference there between me and John.” I wrote about Bush’s grueling schedule, not of governing but of sporting: shooting, casting, jogging, putting, pitching, lobbing, boating, diving and body surfing. I dug up the dirt on his floating backhand, unsteady putting stroke and a basketball shot that his son Marvin called “an ugly air ball.” Many a summer morning at 6 a.m., I could be found on the Kennebunkport golf course, sitting cross-legged and watching Bush play “aerobic golf’’ or “golf polo.” He complained in one of his “blue notes’’ from the Oval to his press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, that I was sitting in a “hinayanistic” Buddha pose on the first tee, “off meditating in Sri Lanka.” It was giving him the yips. He worried I was trying to figure out “what makes this crazy guy tick.” Once, to pay him back for all the break-of-day golf games, I thought it would be funny to wear a “Jesse Jackson for President ’88” cap and a “Bob Dole for President ’88” T-shirt on the course. As H.W. came hurtling down in his golf cart toward the ninth hole, I was waiting for him to see my get-up and laugh. But he didn’t look my way. His golf partner, his oldest son, then known as “Junior” and the Roman candle in the family, did look, though, and leveled a fierce glare at me. “No worries,” I comforted myself. “Jeb’s the comer. Junior’s the black sheep.” H.W. used sports as a way to do personal diplomacy, playing horseshoes with heads of state at Camp David or driving them maniacally on his motorboat at Kennebunkport. (Francois Mitterrand begged off, saying he’d get mal de mer.) I was in the press contingent when 41 took Hosni Mubarak to his first baseball game to see the Baltimore Orioles. The crowd cheered as Ted Williams, who was in the stands, was introduced and then reacted in flummoxed silence when the announcer boomed “the president of Egypt — Mubarak.” One of the only things that 41 ever boasted about was when he began hilariously claiming, after he got out of office, that he had coined the phrase “You da man” in the ’60s. “He maintains he was inspired to shout it to the Houston Astros’ Rusty Staub as he rounded third base following a home run, and it slowly caught on from there,’’ Doro Bush wrote in her book on her dad. I interviewed President Bush about popular culture and he accused me of doing a “psychoanalytical” piece and trying to put him “on the couch.” I found out that Greer Garson was his favorite actress, that he had had a crush on Doris Day as a teenage Navy pilot in World War II, that he loved glee club music, that he was a bust at the fox trot, and that he once dozed off while watching the Ronald Reagan movie “Santa Fe Trail.” I didn’t spare the journalistic rod. When I took my mother, who was on crutches, to a White House Christmas party, President Bush kissed her sweetly. On the way home, she said, “I knew he had a cold, but he was so handsome, I just went for it.’’ Then she glowered at me, muttering, “I don’t want you to write anything mean about that man ever again.’’ Somewhere along the way, H.W. and I grew to appreciate each other. “We have a love-hate relationship,’’ he told me when I ran into him in 2001 at a book party in Georgetown. “I talk to my shrink about it.” He knew that I knew he was kidding; he avoided introspection at all costs, often ending debates in the White House by saying “I’m president and you’re not.” Like the current occupant of the White House, 41 was obsessed with The New York Times. (Both men’s fathers read the Times.) But while he tweaked the liberal press — a 1992 bumper sticker said “Annoy the media, re-elect Bush” — Poppy understood we are not the Enemy of the People. His critiques were more along the lines of this one in a note he sent me: “Booh!, editorial page.’’ When I asked the ex-president if he would like to meet with our editorial board, he replied, “Only after 3 root canal jobs. Thanks anyway.’’ He reminisced in one note that Arthur Sulzberger Jr. had covered his campaign a bit in 1980: “We liked him, but then he got to be an editor then top gun — publisher. A lib, yes, but not a mean one.’’ H.W. wrote that he was not as anti-press as his sister, Nancy Ellis, who had once excoriated the Taylors, who used to own the Boston Globe. “I am not like my beloved sister, who has re-cancelled her Boston Globe subscription four different times,’’ he said, “and who took on one of the sacred Taylor family in a letter-to-the-ed as a ‘Droopy Drawers.’’’ He would complain when I used the “d word” (dynasty) and when he thought I was making the family sound elitist, telling me to lay off the “legacy crud’’ and “the Gatsby stuff,’’ fretting that it could hurt Jeb. He told me to ignore his stationery with the drawing of the posh Kennebunkport compound. He sometimes signed off sardonically, “Sincerely, My Excellency, GHWB, Eastern Elitist.” Mostly, he agonized about how strange it was that we stayed in touch when I was so hard on W. about the invasion of Iraq. (Even though H.W. and I both believed that ousting Saddam would cause more trouble than containing him.) “Where do you and I stand,’’ he pondered. “It is not hate (underlined). How can I feel a warm spot in my heart for someone who day in and day out brutalizes my son? I don’t know but I do. End of Confession — Con Afecto, GB #41.” Another time, he wrote: “I don’t like it that you don’t like my oldest son; but it’s a bit of a stand off cuz he doesn’t like you either. But then he doesn’t know you as well as I do. Time may heal.” Jean Becker, 41’s lovely chief of staff, joked that the former president and I needed “couples counseling.” Sometimes, H.W. talked about his “madness Richter scale” or declared himself “double dip angry” with me after a tough column on W. “You see, I like this exchange with you, but, as confessed before, I get angry with you!’’ he wrote. Another time, he teased: “Now I am off to the clinic to take a little Prozac, stretch out, and get some shrinkster to figure out this love/hate thing about you that plagues me.’’ At one point, he pleaded: “Do not prescribe shock therapy.’’ He said he preferred to keep his advice to his eldest son private, noting: “I am even very careful around close friends having learned that the propensity to leak is stronger than the sex drive.” Once, in return for being on a panel at the Bush Library — we had to wait until Barbara was out of town because she was peeved about my W. columns — 41 gave me a copy of a book which was the closest he got to a memoir, “A World Transformed,” written with Scowcroft. The inscription said it was “better than Sominex if you ever need a tranquilizer.’’ And he trepidatiously gave me a quirky, raffish, 11-page typed parody of my Bush parodies portraying W. as a Boy Emperor being controlled by his malevolent regents, Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld. His satire was laced with “forsooths,’’ “lyres,’’ “nobles and peasants,’’ “courtiers,’’ “verilys” and other Old English touches. It was funny, bringing alive the fantasy court of Bushland with Poppy as “the old warrior king”; “Queen Bar”; “King Prescott of Greenwich, now in heaven”; “Princess Doro”; “Earl Jeb of Tallahassee”; “Lady Dowd, charming princess of Op-ed land”; “Queen Hillary of Chappaqua""; “Sir Algore”; “Maid Monica” frolicking with “King Bill” in the Oval Office, ushering in “a new permissiveness, a new standard that confuses the old man.” And there was George of Crawford, “the new King” who took the throne after “the Battle of Chads in November.’’ But an even funnier thing that happened in the course of this unique relationship came after the ascension of W. — whom 41 sometimes referred to in his notes as “my boy, Quincy.” In 2006, 43 made a rare trip to Kennebunkport one weekend for a wedding, a christening and a funeral, and I went with the press corps. I was surprised when Karl Rove called me to tell me he was involved in a cloak-and-dagger plot with Bush senior, who wanted to meet me for coffee but didn’t want his son to find out because it would irritate him. The former C.I.A. director who liked to sign his notes at the agency, “Head Spook,’’ still had some tricks up his sleeve. I loved the idea of one president with a Secret Service detail sneaking around behind the back of another president with a Secret Service detail, when they were both staying in the same family compound in the small Maine town. Talk about Skull and Bones skulduggery. We didn’t pull it off, but I liked the derring-do of it, recalling the days when President Bush used to try to lose his security detail when he was careering around in his speedboat in Maine. After he was out of office, I sent H.W. and Barbara books and small Christmas mementos. Once, I told my assistant, Ashley Parker — now a Washington Post White House reporter — to send him a glasses case embroidered with a lobster. She got distracted and sent him some cheap drugstore hand warmers that you put inside gloves. Naturally, since we’re talking about the most polite man who ever lived, I soon got a thank-you note for the 50-cent present: “I shall use the handwarmers as Pres. Obama comes in and we Bushes leave town,’’ he said. When my mom died at 97 in 2005, he sent me a kind email that made me cry. “It hurts to lose a parent,’’ he wrote. “It hurts an awful lot. When my own Mom died I went up to Greenwich to check on her. She was close to death and her breathing was so labored that I literally prayed to God, as I knelt right there by her bed, that she would go on to heaven. She was prepared to do just that. “I hope your own Mom had a peaceful passing; and that she felt joyous about going on to heaven. Heck with politics. Heck with the NYT and all my hang ups about” it. I flew down to Houston to have lunch with H.W. in 2011. “Did you come because you think I’m going to die?” the then 87-year-old in a wheelchair asked me as we dined at his favorite pizza dive. No, I replied. I told him I was enlisting to go with him on his ninetieth birthday parachute jump. He spoke fondly of Bill Clinton and respectfully of President Obama. Then I asked him about Donald Trump, who was leading the birther charge against Obama. Neither of us could have imagined then that Trump would dispatch H.W.’s long-nurtured dreams of his son Jeb becoming president with two words: “low energy.” At the mere mention of Trump’s name, 41 made a face. “He’s an ass,’’ he snapped. When Trump began plowing his way through Republican rivals, H.W. was known to throw his shoe at the television set. The narcissistic, amoral, vulgar reality-TV president and the modest, principled, classy, old-world president could not be more different. With Poppy, there was decency and sweetness. “Put it this way,’’ he wrote me once. “I reserve the right to whine, to not read, to use profanity, but if you ever get really hurt or if you ever get really down and need a shoulder to cry on or just need a friend — give me a call. I’ll be there for you. I’ll not let you down. “Now, go on out and knock my knickers off. When you do, I might just cancel my subscription.” A selection of Maureen Dowd’s articles about George H.W.

2018,Opinion | The Pedestrian Strikes Back,"Officials in several countries are getting the message: Cities are about people, not cars. Contributing Opinion Writer In many of the major cities of the world, it has begun to dawn even on public officials that walking is a highly efficient means of transit, as well as one of the great underrated pleasures in life. A few major cities have even tentatively begun to take back their streets for pedestrians. Denver, for instance, is proposing a plan to invest $1.2 billion in sidewalks, and, at far greater cost, bring frequent public transit within a quarter-mile of most of its residents. In Europe, where clean, safe, punctual public transit is already widely available, Oslo plans to ban all cars from its city center beginning next year. Madrid is banning cars owned by nonresidents, and is also redesigning 24 major downtown avenues to take them back for pedestrians. Paris has banned vehicles from a road along the Seine, and plans to rebuild it for bicycle and pedestrian use. Yes, car owners are furious. That’s because they have mistaken their century-long domination over pedestrians for a right rather than a privilege. The truth is that cities are not doing nearly enough to restore streets for pedestrian use, and it’s the pedestrians who should be furious. Many American cities still rely on “level of service” (LOS) design models developed in the 1960s that focus single-mindedly on keeping vehicle traffic moving, according to Elizabeth Macdonald, an urban design specialist at the University of California, Berkeley. “Hence improvements for other modes (walking, cycling, transit) that might increase vehicle delay are characterized as LOS. impediments,” she and her co-authors write in The Journal of Urban Design. The idea of pedestrians as “impediments” is of course perverse, especially given the word’s original meaning: An impediment was something that functioned as a shackle for the feet — unlimited vehicle traffic, say. The emphasis on vehicle traffic flow is also a perversion of basic social equity, and the costs show up in ways large and small. Vehicles in cities contribute a major portion of small-particle pollution, the kind that penetrates deep into the lungs. (The percentage can reach as high as 49 percent in Phoenix and 55 percent in Los Angeles. It’s just 6 percent in Beijing, but that’s because there are so many other pollution sources.) People living close to busy roads, particularly infants and older people in lower-income households, pay most of the cost in respiratory, cardiovascular and other problems. A 2013 M.I.T. study estimated that vehicle emissions cause 53,000 early deaths a year in the United States, and a study just last month from Lancaster University in Britain found that children with intellectual disabilities are far more likely to live in areas with high levels of vehicle pollution. Among the smaller costs: Most people in cities from Bangalore to Brooklyn cannot afford to keep a car, and yet our cities routinely turn over the majority of public thoroughfares to those who can. They allow parked cars to eat up 350 square feet apiece, often at no charge, in cities where private parking spaces rent for as much as $700 a month. And they devote most of what’s left of the street to the uninterrupted flow of motor vehicles. But that’s not really such a small cost, after all: It means that we often cannot afford room for parks or shade trees, which other studies have repeatedly shown to be an important factor in the health and mental well-being of residents. Even when car-mad cities leave enough room on the side to squeeze in trees, they tend to be miniaturized, lollipop versions of what street trees used to be. Hardly anyone plants the towering oaks or maples that used to intertwine their branches overhead and make the sidewalks feel like a leafy grove in the heart of the city. Urban walking has thus deteriorated from a civilized pleasure to an overheated, unshaded, traffic-harried race to a destination. It’s like what the art historian Vincent Scully once said about the demolition of the old Penn Station and its replacement by the commuter hell squeezed beneath Madison Square Garden: “One entered the city like a god; now one scuttles in like a rat.” Happily, some urban planners are waking up to the idea that we can, in fact, do better. Copenhagen has already largely accomplished the shift in focus from vehicles to human beings, thanks considerably to a 40-year campaign by the architect and urban thinker Jan Gehl. I was stunned during a recent visit to the city center when an armada of bicycles actually came to a stop at a red light and waited patiently for pedestrians to cross. I was accustomed to the United States, where cyclists often pay no attention to traffic laws, and cars turn right on red with little regard for either cyclists or pedestrians. Stopping for pedestrians in crosswalks that are not controlled by traffic lights is a legal requirement in only nine states and the District of Columbia. Maybe we can’t turn every street into a pedestrian paradise. Urban planners in London now follow a sort of zoning plan, with some streets developed primarily for moving vehicles, and others focused on the richer (and more retail-friendly) urban life of the pedestrian. In this country, Berkeley’s Professor Macdonald and her co-authors have recently published a simple system for urban planners to identify — and presumably prioritize — factors that make streets pedestrian-friendly. For instance, on large arterial roadways, walkers feel comfortable only if the sidewalks are at least 15 feet wide. But we don’t have to wait for governments to wake up to the idea that a street without pedestrians is, as Mr. Gehl put it, “like an empty theater: Something must be wrong with the production since there is no audience.” City residents can stage their own lessons in livability. The “Walk Your City” movement, for instance, provides a tool kit for neighborhood organizations to post signs giving the distance on foot or by bike (with directions via scannable QR code) to local attractions: “It’s just a 10-minute walk to …” a nice park, a sunset viewpoint, a great art museum. Since its start in 2012 in Raleigh, N.C., “Walk Your City” has spread to more than 400 communities in 55 countries. Likewise, the Better Block Foundation helps neighborhoods stage pop-up events to demonstrate their potential to become more livable, with bike lanes and curb extensions (known as “bump-outs”) in place of parking spaces, and lots of benches, bus stop shelters, kiosks, sidewalk cafes and playgrounds. Sadly, pop-ups aren’t permanent. These temporary displays come down again after a few days. But seeing the possibilities sometimes leads city leaders to make the vision a reality. This is the fundamental common sense rule: Cities and their streets are about people, not cars, and all urban design should think first about the only transit equipment that comes factory-standard for the average human being — our feet.

2018,Opinion | The Pentagon Doesn’t Know Where Its Money Goes,"The military finally submits to an audit, and the results are poor. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. After decades of ducking the legal requirement that it undergo a thorough financial audit, the Pentagon finally opened up its books to 1,200 outside accountants and analysts. The report was recently completed, and here’s the good news: The Army Corps of Engineers (most of it, anyway) and the Military Retirement Fund passed the audit. The bad news: The Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines and most other divisions failed, which means they were unable to show that they were properly keeping track of their finances and assets. The Pentagon has long prided itself on being a “can do” organization, firmly committed to protecting the nation. But when it comes to husbanding the billions of taxpayer dollars that pay for the vast military establishment, defense leaders have had less exacting standards. “We failed the audit,” Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan told reporters with a curiously nonchalant air. “We never expected to pass it.” The Pentagon failed the audit largely because there are serious gaps in the financial controls that guide it, the world’s largest military organization. It has $2.7 trillion in assets (weapons, bases and such) and $2.6 trillion in liabilities (mostly the costs of military personnel and retirees). Basically, the auditors couldn’t account for where all the money went because of flaws in information technology systems. That laxity — and the prospect of tax dollars flowing to boondoggles — would be concerning at any time. But it is especially worrisome when the federal budget deficit has skyrocketed to $779 billion — and the military is insisting it needs more money. In a way, Mr. Shanahan’s attitude is understandable. The Pentagon is an enormous bureaucracy — three million people, 15,700 aircraft, 280 ships, 585,000 facilities at 4,700 sites worldwide, an annual budget of $700 plus billion — and some experts say that expecting a clean bill of health on the first audit was never realistic. Yet the Pentagon had nearly three decades to prepare for this accounting Judgment Day. While federal agencies were mandated by Congress in 1990 to begin performing annual financial audits, the Pentagon resisted for so long that it became the last one to comply with the law. Private companies, accountable to shareholders, couldn’t get away with that. But audits are hard work; most defense officials aren’t business experts; and to some, bookkeeping and other management operations just aren’t a priority in wartime, which since Sept. 11, 2001, has been a permanent state. Most important, the Pentagon is skilled at bucking Congress, which is what it did all those years. This, even though the Government Accountability Office, a government watchdog, put the Defense Department on its list of agencies vulnerable to fraud, waste and abuse in 2015. The Pentagon was granted a virtual blank check to fight terrorism, and it still gets most of what it wants. It accounts for more than half of the federal discretionary spending, with a budget greater than the military spending of the next seven countries combined, including China and Russia. So what did the audit — which cost some $413 million and covered every military asset, from buildings, fences, storage tanks, planes, computers, spare parts, invoices, purchase orders and contracts — find? There are major flaws in how the Pentagon handles its information technology. The flaws include failing to revoke the credentials of former employees and using systems that can be hacked. Officials said the auditors accounted for all major military equipment, even discovering $53 million worth of uninstalled missile motors at Hill Air Force Base in Utah that were cataloged erroneously as “not in working condition.” That’s an improvement from January, when defense officials acknowledged that they had lost track of 39 Black Hawk helicopters. But the Pentagon was found to lack the systems and controls needed to “provide assurance over the existence, completeness and the valuation of inventory and related property recorded in the financial statements.” In all, the audit identified 20 “material weaknesses” that “could adversely affect DoD’s financial operations.” They discovered ineffective payment systems, outdated financial management information technology systems, and an inability to substantiate that Pentagon real estate assets were properly cataloged and valued, among other complaints. The auditors estimated that the Pentagon made “improper payments” — which lacked sufficient or appropriate documentation or approvals — of $957 million in 2017 and $1.2 billion in 2018. While even that larger amount is a fraction of the overall Pentagon spending, such payments grew by 25 percent over those two years, a worrying trend that needs to be reversed. Anyone expecting the discovery of pilfered funds will be disappointed. The audit wasn’t looking for fraud — which generally refers to malicious illegal activities — and Defense Department officials said it found none. (Different audits examine different aspects of an organization.) Its purpose was to determine whether accounts could be reconciled, making the results less sexy, perhaps, but still important. The inability to accurately track how money is spent makes it impossible to know whether precious resources are going to the right places, undermining the Pentagon’s ability to be successful in its far-flung missions around the globe. But it would be misleading to imply that such an immense bureaucracy is not also experiencing actual fraud, abuse or waste. Cost overruns and performance issues with such major weapons as the F-35 fighter jet and missile defense systems have been well documented in the past, raising doubts about the Pentagon’s ability to responsibly manage taxpayer dollars. And the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction has spent six years documenting more than $400 million in questionable costs, unfinished projects and poorly executed programs, and pursuing 132 criminal convictions, in Afghanistan, the site of America’s longest-running war. Last month, for example, a former recruiter of language interpreters for the American military was charged in an alleged scheme to recruit unqualified interpreters to work with American combat forces in Afghanistan. And in September, the former owner of a now defunct marble mining company in Afghanistan was found guilty in federal court for his role in defrauding the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and defaulting on a $15.8 million loan. The unfavorable audit results come at an awkward time. A recent congressionally mandated study reached the alarming conclusion that despite all the money spent on defense, the United States today is so weakened that it “might struggle to win, or perhaps lose, a war against China or Russia.” The study also found that America’s military superiority and technological edge over those two major adversaries has eroded. The Pentagon, defense hawks in Congress and defense contractors relentlessly push for bigger military budgets and will continue to do so. The commission that did the study recommended future annual increases of 3 percent to 5 percent above inflation, which could give the Pentagon a budget of $972 billion per year by 2024, a cumulative increase of 44 percent over the current budget, according to Taxpayers for Common Sense. But throwing more money at the Pentagon doesn’t automatically make it more effective. Nor does it translate into better national security, as America’s “forever wars” in Afghanistan and elsewhere demonstrate. The nation needs to be more honest about the choices it is making (investing trillions more dollars in the nuclear arsenal is especially foolhardy) and realize that other investments — in diplomacy and development overseas, in job training and infrastructure projects at home — are also crucial to national security. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and his leadership team deserve credit for finally opening the books for an audit, thus providing a baseline against which the management of future spending can be measured. Before rushing to push Pentagon spending even higher, however, Congress, which has shirked its vital oversight role, would be well advised to make sure that critical reforms are undertaken by a stubbornly change-resistant bureaucracy, so Americans can be certain their tax dollars are being spent effectively.

2018,The People of Mbomo Tell Their Stories,"Footnotes In “Congo Tales,” a new book about the second-largest tropical forest in the world, the story of a people and their home comes alive. CreditCredit “Congo Tales,” a new book published recently by Prestel, began as a call to action to save the Odzala-Kokoua National Park in the heart of the Congo Basin, which is the second-largest tropical forest in the world after the Amazon, from the threats of climate change. It soon became a book about the stories of the people who live there. A team including Pieter Henket, a Dutch photographer; Eva Vonk, a Dutch producer; Steve Regis “Kovo” N’Sondé, a Congolese artist and philosopher; his brother Wilfried N’Sondé, a Congolese writer and musician; and a group of conservationists and researchers spent five years in the basin. There, they collected and translated the tales of the people of the Mbomo region. The stories were then edited by the N’Sondé brothers, a job suited to the pair who grew up with stories passed down from their grandmother. “These stories, through the values and symbols they carry, are our legacy,” said Kovo N’Sondé. “When I say our, I don’t only mean Congolese citizens or Bantu peoples, I mean mankind. These stories are all about wisdom, knowledge, ethical and aesthetic principles.” A project of this nature is bound to draw scrutiny and face skepticism about exploiting native peoples and rituals. But this collaboration offers an opportunity to grapple with what an ethical approach to storytelling might look like. “Storytelling is such a powerful thing with which we pass on information from generation to generation,” Vonk said. “Any authenticity I have gained is just by listening and not trying to explain.” Henket, who photographed the community members’ re-enactments of the stories, viewed his presence as more about offering technical expertise, such as lighting and composition. “What I wanted to do with the Mbomo people was to really let them tell the stories how they wanted to see it,” he said. Here are Henket’s comments on some of the photographs in the book and their accompanying stories. I took a portrait of the eldest people in the village because there is a saying that when the old people die it’s like a library of stories burning down. That whole concept on its own is already beautiful so we wanted to build on that. All Mbomo families have their own totem animals that represent them. We asked the kids about their family’s totem animal and how they would express it. After a week of shooting, the whole village got involved and everyone wanted to be a part of it. This girl came with this simple leaf and put it on top of her head and we asked “What are you?” and she said, “I’m a bird.” This boy came in wearing this dress with moons and stars on it. We asked him what totem animal he would be and he said, “I’m a butterfly."" We asked him: “How would you represent that?” Together with our art director, he made this butterfly costume. We wanted to keep this story, which symbolizes how the days of the week were established, light and very much fantasy, so we created this wooden moon. All the kids wanted to be a part of this picture, and they started to come out of the forest with their own hats and their own masks. It adds to the whole goal of them telling their own stories instead of telling them to do this or do that. This story is about a fish and a crocodile becoming best friends. One day the fish says to the crocodile, would you come over and stay at my house tonight? So the crocodile stays and they have an amazing night. But then the crocodile eats the babies of the fish and so the fish says to the crocodile, I thought we were best friends. I wanted to do a picture in the river with all the children as if they were little fish eggs. These are most of the children of the people who were involved in the project. The difficult part is deciding what parts of the story are important to tell. With photography you have to choose moments. I wanted to somehow show the fish eggs and I thought it would be a beautiful composition to have all these children sitting in the river bank. This story about a woman trying to escape an abusive relationship is very much about female power. The casting process was super fun for this one because while we were shooting there were always a few people who stayed around us. These girls, who were in that group, were tough cool girls, and I thought they would fit perfectly for this powerful image. The man in the middle is Bosco, and he is sort of the unofficial mayor of the village. This is a story about how all the young boys decide at one point that they want to take power from the elders so they kill all the elders. But then they realize you need the wisdom from the elders. This picture represents that realization with Bosco as the elder and his son looking at the camera.",The New York Times

2018,The Physical and Spiritual Art of Capoeira,"Our reporter and photographer went to Permangolinha, a three-day retreat where capoeira meets sustainable farming. VALENÇA, Brazil — The white-bearded, dreadlocked master and his bushy-haired student face off in an open-sided compound set amid cacao trees and coffee bushes. The two are in constant motion, swinging back and forth in what is called the ginga — the fundamental movement of the Brazilian combat game capoeira. At times, the way they feint and kick, and roll under and over and around each other, looks like choreographed dance. But then one side does something the other is not expecting, and it becomes clear that this is a game of strategy, not a planned dance. Mestre Cobra Mansa’s ginga transforms into the movement of a staggering drunk, then a marionette whose puppeteer has suddenly let the string go slack. Then he’s in a handstand. From there, a leg strikes out like a lightning bolt, stopping just short of hitting his opponent’s face. The circle of men and women surrounding the combatants are engaged in a hypnotic call-and-response song about an encounter with a dangerous snake. It’s intoned to the beat of Afro-Brazilian drums and the twang of single-stringed gourd instruments called berimbaus. “Valha-me deus, Senhor São Bento,” the circle intones in Portuguese, beseeching Saint Benedict for protection. The participants — Brazilians mostly, but also Uruguayans, Russians, Ethiopians and Puerto Ricans — have come to the 80-acre property of Mestre Cobra Mansa (or, Master Tame Snake) on the outskirts of Valença, a small coastal city in Bahia, for a three-day retreat called Permangolinha. Its name (and its purpose) are a mash-up of the sustainable farming system known as permaculture and Capoeira Angola, the capoeira style that Mestre Cobra Mansa, 58, teaches. The event also attracts masters friendly with Mestre Cobra Mansa, including Mestre Lua Santana, from the interior of the state; and Mestra Gegê, a rare female master who also teaches in Valença. Mestre Cobra Mansa, known to the government and few others as Cinezio Feliciano Peçanha, bought this property, now called Kilombo Tenondé, about 15 years ago and has transformed it from pasture to a permaculture practice, in which diverse crops are raised together in a setting that mirrors the interdependence of a forest. To him, it’s a way of bringing mostly urban capoeira practitioners — he grew up in the poor outskirts of Rio de Janeiro — back to the land, from which much of capoeira tradition emerged. The two practices are complementary. “In permaculture,” he said, “you interact with and care for the land. The culture of capoeira is to interact with and care for human beings. Permaculture doesn’t have the spiritual side — capoeira supplies that.” Capoeira developed out of the combat games that came to Brazil with African slaves. Couching their practice as dance, the slaves trained in capoeira as a form of resistance and self-defense. Even after Brazil abolished slavery in 1888, capoeira was viewed suspiciously by authorities and its practitioners often harassed or imprisoned. The creation of Capoeira Regional in the 1930s, a more formalized practice that imitated aspects of Eastern martial arts, complete with ranks and competitions, is usually credited for bringing it out of the shadows. Capoeira Angola follows a more originalist bent, focusing on cultural and spiritual aspects — but not without an element of show. “I don’t want simply to hit someone,” Mestre Cobra Mansa said. “It’s a balance between beauty and efficiency.” So is it a dance, a fight or a sport? “If a guy uses a ‘stingray’s tail’ move and kills someone, are you going to write about in the arts section?” Mestre Cobra Mansa said. “No, but it’s art!” Participants at Permangolinha, most of whom have practiced capoeira for years, are quick to note that its impact goes far beyond the physical game. “It’s everything,” said Elena Kilina, a 30-year-old Russian living in São Paulo. “It’s music, it’s instruments, it’s another language, it’s a lifestyle, it’s a philosophy. Capoeira for me is an inevitable part of life.” For Brazilians and other practitioners of African descent, capoeira can take on additional meaning. Like so much in the state of Bahia — music, cuisine, the syncretic religious practice known as candomblé, it is tied to Africa. Mestre Cobra Mansa named his property Kilombo Tenondé after the quilombos, communities founded by escaped slaves, that are entwined with capoeira as symbols of resistance. Ricardo René Díaz Ortiz, a 23-year-old on a Fulbright teaching fellowship in Brazil, calls capoeira “a tool for self-decolonization” the likes of which he had never come across in his native Puerto Rico. “To me capoeira becomes a way of connecting with an ancestry that was robbed from us.” “It’s tied to our African roots,” said Florentine Santos Machado, a 19-year-old from Valença who started practicing capoeira when her family lived in her mother’s native Germany. “It goes well beyond being a sport, because it doesn’t just involve the body. That’s where we get the idea of capoeira being something bigger. You see the importance of being connected to it.” Permangolinha’s two-dozen or so participants — the number ebbs and flows throughout the weekend — stay in simple bunk rooms or camp on the property. The main building has no restrooms; a large outhouse has water-free compost toilets and cold showers. Volunteers help cook hearty vegan meals mostly from what grows on the property, like butter collards for salad, and cupuaçu, a sourish, oblong cacao relative, for juice. There are workshops on things like berimbau-making and maintaining an agro-forest. Adalicio Manuel de Jesus, whose family has farmed the area for three generations, showed a group how he grafts branches of high-yield cacao trees to strong-rooted, pest-resistant ones, raising productivity without using pesticides. As rain pattered on the roof during a Saturday session, Mestre Cobra Mansa called for volunteers. “How many of you know the length of your leg?” he asked. Herlen Ramos Santos, a 39-year-old capoeirista stepped out. Mestre Cobra Mansa had him ginga in front of a chair, instructing him to kick out when thought he was exactly one leg’s length away. When he did, the middle of his calf came down on the top of the chair. His leg was considerably longer than he thought. Mr. Ramos Santos will bring that lesson home to Ilheus, a colonial city down coast, where he teaches free capoeira lessons. “As you evolve, you have the obligation to teach others as well,” he said. “It’s fundamental in capoeira that you don’t keep everything you learn to yourself.” Mestre Cobra Mansa also teaches malícia, which means “malice” but here refers to feints and trickery. He instructs his students to catch their opponents off guard, use their energy to your advantage. “The most beautiful move is not where you strike his face with your foot,” he tells them. “It’s when he strikes your foot with his face.” The high points of the weekend are the formal circles, known as rodas, on Friday and Sunday. “The roda is a ritual of confraternization,” Mr. Ramos Santos said. “Everyone together forms a whole, everyone becomes one. There’s no pre-established thought to what is going to happen — it’s the circle’s energy that conducts it, the musical energy.” “Entering the roda, for some people, is very hard,” Ms. Kilina said. “Capoeira teaches you how to face yourself. How people respond, how they attack, what’s their reaction to your aggression shows you who the person is. If someone makes me angry, I will provoke. It reveals you completely.” At the Friday night roda, students saw Mestre Cobra Mansa provoked. He was matched against his former student, Mestra Gegê (Maria Eugência Poggi e Araújuo), 45. The circle oohed as she landed a two-legged flying kick on him. He came at her furiously, and she hopped out of the roda, essentially conceding. “Would you have stayed?” she asked later. “Capoeira is about the postures we take toward life,” said Díaz Ortiz, the Fulbright fellow. “It’s about how we’re going to interact with the world. And that goes into permaculture or being vegetarian or what kind of job you have. How did you take the lessons you learned in the roda from the mestres, and use that to define your relationship to this society.” Produced by Alana Celii, Jolie Ruben and Rachel Saltz.",The New York Times
2018,"The Placenta, an Afterthought No Longer","An ephemeral organ, long dismissed merely as afterbirth, increasingly is viewed as critical to understanding the health and course of pregnancy. The placenta may be dismissed as “afterbirth,” deemed an afterthought in discussions about pregnancy and even relegated, literally, to the trash bin. But at long last it is beginning to get its due. In the past three weeks, scientists have published three significant studies of this ephemeral organ. One gave a detailed analysis of all the genes expressed, or converted into functioning proteins, in the placenta; another experimented with a way to silence that expression when it causes trouble. In the third, researchers created mini-placentas, three-dimensional clusters of cells, or organoids, that mimic the real thing in the lab, and can be used as models for studying it. In addition, at a recent meeting in Bethesda, Md., of the Human Placenta Project, several teams of researchers showed off sophisticated new techniques that enable the placenta to be studied in real time. That work could help doctors diagnose dangerous complications in pregnancy — including pre-eclampsia (a form of high blood pressure), preterm birth and fetal growth restriction — early enough to intervene. It might also help to reveal why boys are much more vulnerable than girls to disorders of brain development, including schizophrenia, A.D.H.D., autism, dyslexia and Tourette syndrome. “The missing link between complications during pregnancy and development of the fetal brain has been hiding in plain sight for a long time,” said Dr. Daniel R. Weinberger, director of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development in Baltimore, Md. “It’s the placenta.” [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] During the course of human pregnancy, the placenta grows from a few cells into an organ weighing more than a pound. It often is compared to an aggressive cancer. But a more apt metaphor might be a military invasion, as 90 percent of the placenta is made up of cells not from the mother but from the fetus. Early in gestation, the fertilized egg implants itself in the mother’s uterine lining and sends out a few cells to breach it. These foot soldiers produce proteins that disarm the mother’s defenses, destroy the smooth muscles that line her blood vessels and dilate and redirect the vessels to feed the embryo. As the placental beachhead grows, its cells specialize to do the work of heart, lungs, liver and kidneys until the fetus can fend for itself. Groups of cells exchange oxygen for carbon dioxide; provide nutrients and hormones; protect the fetus from harmful stress, germs and chemicals; and remove waste. This incursion fails as often as 20 percent of the time, and when it does, it can cause severe complications for the fetus, at birth and afterward. It may also forecast trouble for the mother’s health later in life: pre-eclampsia can portend heart disease and stroke, and gestational diabetes can signal later obesity and metabolic disease. “There is nothing in medicine that can return so much on an investment as a healthy pregnancy and delivery, because that has years and years of impact later,” said Dr. George R. Saade, chief of obstetrics at the University of Texas Medical Branch. “And placental health is critical to the health of a pregnancy.” Not all placentas develop equally. In the last few years Tracy Bale, director of the University of Maryland’s Center for Epigenetic Research in Child Health and Brain Development, has found that the placenta of a male fetus is more vulnerable to external stress than the placenta of a female fetus. This vulnerability, in turn, may transfer to the embryo, Dr. Bale said. Male fetuses typically are larger than females throughout gestation, but they also have higher rates of spontaneous abortions, stillbirth, premature birth and neurodevelopmental conditions. It’s not yet clear what makes female fetuses more resilient. But during the first trimester, 58 genes are expressed differently in male fetuses than in females, according to an analysis published in January, in the journal Biology of Sex Differences. Several of these genes are on the X chromosome. A female fetus has two X chromosomes and two copies of these genes, with one copy typically staying silent. But the analysis showed that many of these gene copies are activated regardless, and so they become a larger factor in female placentas than in males. (The more detailed analysis of gene expression published three weeks ago did not look at sex differences, but provides a framework for similar analyses.) In May, Dr. Weinberger’s team at the Lieber Institute looked specifically at genes implicated in schizophrenia. They found that many of these genes are abundantly expressed in the fetal placenta, and are activated at even higher levels when the pregnancy is under stress; the effect is more dramatic in male fetuses than in females. “We suggested that placentas of male fetuses seem to be more susceptible at a genetic level,” Dr. Weinberger said. “I’m very confident the same story is going to be there for autism, A.D.H.D. and other developmental behavioral problems.” Technological limitations have obscured the central role that the placenta plays in the health of both baby and mother. The placenta is a dynamic organ, but it usually has been studied by dissecting it after delivery. “That’s too late,” said Dr. Saade of the University of Texas. “It’s like studying cardiac disease or any other medical condition just by doing an autopsy.” Problems with the placenta often begin in the spiral arteries of the mother — the arteries that the fetus commandeers to feed itself. If they are blocked or too narrow, the fetus may not get enough oxygen and nutrients, and the mother’s blood pressure may spike toward pre-eclampsia. This can begin as early as the first trimester, but few tools are available to diagnose it at that stage. “The tests that are available today are all designed for the third trimester, and that’s way too late,” said Dr. Alfred Z. Abuhamad, chair of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk, Va. In 2014, the child-health division of the National Institutes of Health set out to find noninvasive methods to identify complications earlier. An infusion of $80 million into placenta research prompted Dr. Abuhamad and others to adapt technologies used in other fields, and has already provided valuable insights into early pregnancy. Some scientists are betting on magnetic resonance imaging scans, or M.R.I.s, as the most sensitive detectors of placental problems. They are using a method that measures oxygen levels in the blood; it is quick and, so far, seems to catch problems as early as the second trimester. Several teams worldwide are evaluating the technique, each in hundreds of women. But M.R.I. is not widely in use in obstetricians’ offices, Dr. Abuhamad said, in contrast with ultrasound machines, which would be a more practical option. Traditional ultrasounds can show the structure and location of the placenta, not how well the organ is functioning. But advances over the past five years have sharpened the machine’s focus. One enables the device to detect tiny blood vessels; another, called elastography, was developed to examine the liver, and can help measure the density of placental tissue. Dr. Abuhamad’s team is using these advances in ultrasound to chart placental health in about 500 pregnant women, including 300 at high risk of complications. They are collecting ultrasound data and blood samples from the women at eight time points during pregnancy to see which early features track with problems later on. Other teams are trying to identify particles the placenta may release into the bloodstream because that could lead to a simple blood test for diagnosing problems. And one group of researchers is developing an oximeter, a device that quantifies the light reflected back through layers of fat as a measure of blood oxygen. It will be at least five years before any of these tests makes their way to doctors’ offices. But when they are ready, they are likely to have a huge impact on obstetric practice, said Dr. Diana W. Bianchi, director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. “The way that prenatal care is currently structured, you hardly see your obstetrician in the first trimester,” she said. “And by the time you get to the third trimester, you’re seeing the obstetrician weekly.” Instead, when placental screening identified a problem, women might be encouraged to see their doctors frequently through the first trimester. “Knowing that this starts early in the first trimester,” said Dr. Abuhamad, “could we then intervene in the first trimester — identify early, intervene early and prevent the complications?” An earlier version of this article misstated the location of a recent meeting of the Human Placenta Project. It was Bethesda, Md., not Baltimore.",The New York Times
2018,The Planet Has Seen Sudden Warming Before. It Wiped Out Almost Everything.,"matter In some ways, the planet's worst mass extinction — 250 million years ago, at the end of the Permian Period — may parallel climate change today. Some 252 million years ago, Earth almost died. In the oceans, 96 percent of all species became extinct. It’s harder to determine how many terrestrial species vanished, but the loss was comparable. This mass extinction, at the end of the Permian Period, was the worst in the planet’s history, and it happened over a few thousand years at most — the blink of a geological eye. On Thursday, a team of scientists offered a detailed accounting of how marine life was wiped out during the Permian-Triassic mass extinction. Global warming robbed the oceans of oxygen, they say, putting many species under so much stress that they died off. And we may be repeating the process, the scientists warn. If so, then climate change is “solidly in the category of a catastrophic extinction event,” said Curtis Deutsch, an earth scientist at the University of Washington and co-author of the new study, published in the journal Science. Researchers have long known the general outlines of Permian-Triassic cataclysm. Just before the extinctions, volcanoes in what is now Siberia erupted on a tremendous scale. The magma and lava that they belched forth produced huge amounts of carbon dioxide. Once in the atmosphere, the gas trapped heat. Researchers estimate that the surface of the ocean warmed by about 18 degrees Fahrenheit. Some researchers argue that the heat alone killed off many species. Others believe that the warmth reduced oxygen in the ocean, asphyxiating the species living there. Rocks from the mass extinction appear to have formed when at least some of the ocean was lacking oxygen. In previous research, Dr. Deutsch has explored how living animals adapt to temperature and oxygen levels in the seas. Animals with a fast metabolism need a lot of oxygen, for example, and so they can’t live in parts of the ocean where oxygen falls below a certain threshold. Warm water makes the challenge even more difficult. Warmer water can’t hold as much dissolved oxygen as cold water. Even worse, warm water can also increase an animal’s metabolism, meaning it requires more oxygen just to stay alive. Cod, for example, are not found below a latitude running roughly from New England to Spain. South of that line, warmth and low oxygen are just too great for the species. Dr. Deutsch and Justin Penn, a graduate student, recreated the world at the end of the Permian Period with a large-scale computer simulation, complete with a heat-trapping atmosphere and a circulating ocean. As the Siberian volcanoes flooded the virtual atmosphere with carbon dioxide, the atmosphere warmed. The ocean warmed, too — and according to the model, it began losing oxygen. Some parts lost more than others. On the surface, for example, fresh oxygen was produced by photosynthetic algae. But as the ocean warmed, its circulatory currents also slowed, the model demonstrated. Oxygen-poor water settled to the bottom of the oceans, and before long, the deep was gasping. Rising temperatures and plunging oxygen must have made huge swaths of the oceans uninhabitable. Some species survived here and there. But most disappeared completely. “Everything was losing a lot of habitat, creating the risk of extinction,” said Dr. Deutsch. “But the risk was actually higher in places that were cold. That was a bit surprising.” You might expect that animals near the Equator would be at a greater risk, because the water was warm to begin with. But Dr. Deutsch’s model suggested a very different kind of apocalypse. Animals in oxygen-rich cold water could not handle the sudden drop, while those in tropical waters were already adapted to poor oxygen. And the cold-water species could not find refuge elsewhere. To test their simulation, the researchers teamed up with Jonathan Payne and Erik Sperling, paleontologists at Stanford University. They dug into a huge online database of fossils to chart the risks of extinction at different latitudes during the catastrophe. When they were done with their analysis, they sent their graph to Seattle. Dr. Deutsch and Mr. Penn compared it to the prediction from their computer model. They matched. “This was the most exciting moment of my scientific life,” said Dr. Deutsch. Michael Benton, a paleontologist at the University of Bristol in England, who was not involved in the study, said that it resolved the roles of heat and oxygen as causes of the mass extinction. “This makes a clear case that, of course, the two are linked,” he said. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] The new study offers an important warning to humans over the next few centuries. The Siberian volcanoes ultimately delivered much more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than we will ever emit by burning fossil fuels. But our annual rate of carbon emissions is actually higher. The carbon we released over the past two centuries already has made the atmosphere warmer, and the ocean has absorbed much of that heat. And now, just as during the Permian-Triassic extinction, the ocean is losing oxygen. Over the past fifty years, oxygen levels have declined by 2 percent. “The way the Earth system is responding now to the buildup of CO2 is in the exact same way that we’ve seen it respond in the past,” said Lee Kump, a geoscientist at Penn State University. Just how much warmer the planet will get is up to us. It will take a tremendous international effort to keep the increase below about 4 degrees Fahrenheit. If we proceed to use up all the fossil fuels on Earth, it could warm by as much as 17 degrees Fahrenheit by 2300. As the ocean warms, its oxygen levels will continue to drop. If ancient history is any guide, the consequences for life — especially marine life in the cooler parts of the ocean — will be disastrous. “Left unchecked, climate warming is putting our future on the same scale as some of the worst events in geological history,” Dr. Deutsch said.",The New York Times

Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. David Byrne’s 2018 tour put his whole band in choreographed motion, a spectacle that rivaled the Talking Heads’ 1983 extravaganza filmed as “Stop Making Sense.” One rave review — “‘ … The Best Live Show of All Time’ — NME” — supplies the title for an EP recorded live in Brooklyn. Even without visuals, “Everybody’s Coming to My House” sheds the nervous, paranoid overtone of the studio version on Byrne’s 2018 album, “American Utopia.” While the lyrics envision ceaseless surveillance and interaction, the sheer funkiness makes it sound like one big house party. JON PARELES An arrestingly beautiful lead single from the forthcoming third album by American Football, lonely titans of 1990s emo. Mike Kinsella sings like a nudge, a suggestion: “What’s the allure of inconsequential love?” he wonders, at a low enough volume that you know he doesn’t know the answer. All around him, bells peal and guitars swarm and the song gets tense, but only in an internal way. From the outside, there’s no sweat at all. JON CARAMANICA It’s been a challenging … five(?) years for Robin Thicke: that Miley performance, the dissolution of his marriage, the death of his father, the crumbling of his claim to celebrity. Just this week, he was ordered to pay restitution to the family of Marvin Gaye as part of the final resolution of the “Blurred Lines” lawsuit that accused him and Pharrell Williams of pilfering the key elements of that song from Gaye’s “Got to Give It Up.” After all that, a retreat from the spotlight for good would be understandable, and perhaps advisable. But now comes “Testify”: gentle, self-lacerating, studiously vulnerable. A rather lovely acoustic guitar ballad — one that moves him toward adult-contemporary R&B, a natural new home — “Testify” is essentially a litany of failures, shortcomings, disappointments. He lists them sweetly, not defiantly. They are who he is now. These are his confessions. CARAMANICA “Tell Me It’s Over” is a nearly pure retro move for Avril Lavigne. It’s a can’t-leave-you song — “Every time you touch me/I forget what we’re fighting about” — that harks back to early 1960s soul and girl groups, with a slow-rolling 12/8 beat, wall-of-sound orchestration and a fully belted chorus. The 21st-century tipoff, and spoiler, is the ratchety trap high-hat sound that’s likely to make it sound dated rather than classic. PARELES Not to be confused with Ella Mai, Ego Ella May is a singer and songwriter from London who’s on the jazzy side of the neo-soul spectrum, with a fine-line soprano and a penchant for zigzag chromatic melodies. In “Table for One,” she works through the loneliness and disorientation of a breakup — “I try to reprogram my mind/there’s no change” — to eventually decide “I don’t mind at all/I’ll be fine on my own.” Her backup band is live and improvisational in the studio, suddenly stirring up gusty, slightly cluttered crescendos and then settling back down, turning the song into an unfinished narrative. PARELES Knobs, keyboards, monochrome monitors galore. Analog synthesizer geeks should thrill to this video of “All Hail the Silence” by the duo of the keyboardist and producer BT (Brian Transeau) and the singer and songwriter Christian Burns, whose mission is to record electronic pop without computers. This is the synthesizer version of recording with vintage guitars and tube amps; what once was futuristic now seems homey. PARELES A sturdy and concise pop-soul number masking as a country song, “Heart’s Having a Hard Time” is a sharp introduction to Filmore, a rising country singer with a voice that never flirts with tension. Instead, he’s a gentle mope, peaceful in his resignation to hurt, even though his words capture a sadness that’s potent and pained: It shouldn’t be so tough for meto change my lock screenbut it’s sinking inthat I don’t get to kiss that smile no more CARAMANICA Jason Palmer is one of the great, fine-tuned improvisers of his generation, but the 39-year-old trumpeter, who lives in Boston, remains underrecognized by the jazz public. His newest album, “Fair Weather,” probably won’t correct the issue: It’s out on Newvelle Records, a label that operates entirely on a subscription model, requiring buyers to purchase a full year’s worth of records in order to receive anything. But this video for the title track — a skating, five-beat retrofit of the old ballad “Moonlight Becomes You” — offers a sense of Palmer’s powers: his way of quietly recasting the harmonies of a tune, and gently pulling a rhythm section together around him as he improvises. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO The Canadian songwriter Jean-Sebastian Audet released a 2017 album under the name Un Blonde; now he’s recording as Yves Jarvis. The disorientation only begins there in “Fruits of Disillusion,” a wispy, wavery, deliberately ambling three minutes of low-fi psychedelia. The track begins as a gentle drone with feedback woven in, offers a spoke-sung verse that suddenly sprouts harmonies and wanders off to an unsteady beat. It’s a rumination on “constant change” that’s secure in its own fragility. PARELES The DJ and producer Kid Koala dissolves the beat in the series of recordings he calls “Music to Draw To.” His second installment is “Io,” based on the Greek myth of a mortal priestess who attracted the ardor of Zeus and the wrath of his wife, Hera. “All for You” is a serenely awe-struck lullaby, with Trixie Whitley’s hushed, hazy voice sounding just earthy enough amid shimmering, cyclical chords. PARELES Triptych Myth was a trio led by Cooper-Moore, a lion of the downtown music scene, in the early 2000s, when he’d just ended a yearslong hiatus from playing the piano. “Finding Fire,” recorded in 2005 but not released until this week, is the band’s third and ostensibly final album, and it is a continental statement: widely varied in terms of textures and tones, unfolding like an epic novel, with various stories converging into one. The album finds Triptych Myth — featuring Tom Abbs and bass and the ever-potent Chad Taylor on drums — in tender, slowly mutating dialogue with Cale Brandley, a reeds player and vocalist. On “Sunset Park, After the Sun Sets,” Brandley starts on the ney, a Middle Eastern flute with a chalky tone, and moves to the alto clarinet, improvising in miniature filigrees and small, tumbling phrases as the trio creates a pebbly path below him.

2018,"The Playlist: Emo’s Past Meets Its Future, and 9 More New Songs","Hear tracks by Meek Mill, Jacob Collier, Cactus Blossoms and others. Every Friday, pop critics for The New York Times weigh in on the week’s most notable new songs and videos — and anything else that strikes them as intriguing. Just want the music? Listen to the Playlist on Spotify here (or find our profile: nytimes). Like what you hear? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. Many threads of emo get woven together by the savvy pop producer Benny Blanco on the eerily effective “Roses,” from his new album “Friends Keep Secrets.” First comes Juice WRLD, the leading petulant emoter in hip-hop, his voice an exhausted peal: “Still feeling dead when I think about you/I can’t do a damn thing when I’m without you.” Then comes Brendon Urie — frontman for Panic! at the Disco — who arrives with an almost sensual, R&B take on heartbreak, groaning, “Every look you give it’s like I’m see-through.” This successful collaboration across generations and styles is a reminder that they were never that far apart to begin with. JON CARAMANICA Here’s nothing more or less than a euphoric three-minute New Orleans funk romp from one of the city’s long-running bands: a backbeat, some bluesy harmonica, a rowdy horn section, a busy tambourine and Miss Charm Taylor sassily declaiming, “It’s something in the beat/that makes me feel so free.” No further explanation needed. JON PARELES A virtuoso singer and multi-instrumentalist, Jacob Collier raids musical tombs, yanking ideas from across the natural world. But he doesn’t stir everything into a chilled-out groove; instead he shines a bold light on every trick he uses, moving from reference to reference as if flipping tabs on a browser. This is beat-driven music that’s meant for headphone listening, not the dance floor. On “With the Love in My Heart,” you might catch a few direct references: to J Dilla-influenced jazz drumming, the wagging synths of 1980s funk (à la Zapp & Roger), high-school drumlines. The track comes from “Djesse, Vol. 1,” a new album he recorded with the Metropole Orkest. This is the first in a four-disc package that Collier plans to release, one album at a time, over the coming year. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO “Championships,” Meek Mill’s first full-length statement following his release from jail earlier this year, didn’t fully capture what makes him so invigorating as a rapper. He’s an orator, and anything that prevents him from talk-rapping — namely, the dictates of song construction, especially when it comes to working within a melodic framework — is a distraction. So it’s appropriate that the most vital Meek Mill moment of this cycle comes on this freestyle, part of Funkmaster Flex’s ongoing series. He begins with a stroke of comity, speaking about reconciling with Drake, and then exuberantly raps over “Back to Back,” the song Drake used to dismantle him so effectively three years ago: “My old opps, they super mad, we left them pouring Henny up/‘Cause they homies got whacked, we bought Maybachs/Came through they strip, no tint, laid back.” But it’s later in the 10-minute performance that Meek Mill’s talents truly shine through. He’s become something of a cautionary tale, and he wants to warn others. For about five minutes, much of it aimed directly to the camera, he raps about the futility of the drug game, about the hopelessness that leads to poor decisions. “They tried to bury us, ain’t know that we was seeds/We had to trap, ain’t get no toys on Christmas Eve/Play that corner made you rich, what we believed,” he raps, with understanding and exhaustion. And then he goes on, telling people that there’s another way. JON CARAMANICA The sound is retro but the words are up-to-the-minute in “Please Don’t Call Me Crazy,” by the Cactus Blossoms, who have the vocal harmonies, reverb guitars and rockabilly backbeat of the Everly Brothers but live in the present. Singing over echoey guitars and a few chords, they confront digital life as lived now: “Computer in your pocket/Nobody has to know,” they sing. “What you want/not what you need.” PARELES ÌFÉ is a Puerto Rican electronic group led by a high priest of the Afro-Caribbean religion of Santería; a bembe is a drum-driven Santería ritual. But “The Tearer (Bembe)” is far from folkloric. The steady but ever-varying beat mixes percussion, piano, synthesizer and quick hisses of white noise behind rapping, singing and, about halfway through, an Auto-Tuned woman’s voice leading a traditional-sounding call-and-response. The song glances at current events as it praises Oya, “she who tears,” the Yoruba goddess of storms, winds and transformation; the video presents her Marvel Comics equivalent, Storm of the X-Men. But what makes the track compelling is the beat. PARELES Holly Herndon is an electronic composer who often uses her speaking and singing voice; Jlin is a producer and D.J. who has pushed the skittish momentum of Chicago’s footwork into even more hectic abstractions. “Godmother” was generated without editing by Spawn, an artificial-intelligence device that was trained on Herndon’s voice and Jlin’s tracks. It unleashes Herndon’s vocal syllables as percussion for a kind of hissy, feminine, multilayered, glitchy beatboxing, human input dispensed with inhuman timing. PARELES After the death of his wife, Iraida, Eddie Palmieri found himself revisiting the songs they had shared in their youth. Eventually, it led the Latin music eminence into his next project: “Mi Luz Mayor,” an agile record featuring big-band arrangements of old Afro-Caribbean dance numbers and boleros. At the center is Palmieri’s scathing piano. On “Quimbombo” — originally recorded by Willie Colón and Hector Lavoe — the vocalist Herman Olivera volleys with his backing chorus in a gleeful paean to okra stew. The vocalists and orchestra offer a sunnier, smoother take than the original recording (closer to the Hermanos Moreno version), but Palmieri has another thing in mind. His piano teases against Olivera’s vocals with subtle displacements until he finally breaks into a full-on solo, laying waste to the song’s simple four-chord pattern. RUSSONELLO Of course late-career Toby Keith would find poignancy at the intersection of deflated bluster and a stubborn clinging to the past. “Don’t Let the Old Man In” is from the new Clint Eastwood film “The Mule,” about an older military veteran turned drug carrier. Keith’s song is slow, grounded, with an air of tragedy that gives way to defiance. CARAMANICA “Liberty City” was on the 1983 debut album by Mark Stewart and Maffia, a post-punk band that topped funk and dub-reggae vamps with atonal spoke-sung vocals, noise and free-jazz horns. Its lyrics still apply 35 years later, in an era of hypercapitalism — “Struggling to pay the rent/The main worry’s job security/The busier you are the less you see” — and in this new video, Mehmet Sander’s choreography groups a team of dancers to punish themselves on a Sisyphusean slope.

2018,Opinion | The Postal Worker’s Christmas ,"My grandfather was part of a long tradition of postal workers who sacrificed Christmas Eve with their families to deliver holiday packages. Ms. Anderson is the director of the Global Economy Project at the Institute for Policy Studies. Every year on Christmas Eve, my extended family gathers for a meal that can be served at the last minute, whenever we’re ready to eat. This tradition of cold salads, ham balls and cookies goes back to my mom’s childhood. My mother’s father was a North Dakota postal employee, so on Christmas Eve, she never knew when he would get home. He was determined to keep working, my mom would tell us, “until every Christmas package that could be delivered would be delivered.” He started working for the Postal Service in 1911, and family lore has it that he sometimes had to trudge through the snow on horseback to deliver the mail. As in my grandfather’s day, today’s postal workers have a mandate to provide universal service, delivering mail and packages to every American household at uniform rates, no matter where they live. That mandate has helped bind our vast nation. This principle of affordable universal service is under threat. This year, the White House Office of Management and Budget recommended selling the public Postal Service to a private, for-profit corporation. On Dec. 4, a Trump task force on the postal system followed up with recommendations for partial privatization and other changes that would reduce services and raise delivery prices, particularly for rural communities. Specifically, the task force urges the Postal Service to change its pricing system to maximize profits on commercial package deliveries. This would be a major blow to families who buy products online and live along high-cost delivery routes. We’re not just talking about Hawaii and Alaska. Private carriers already impose surcharges, as high as $4.45 per item, for package deliveries to approximately 53 percent of the nation’s 42,000 ZIP codes. These surcharge areas are home to about 70 million people, according to our calculations, in rural areas, small towns and suburbs. If the Trump task force has its way, customers in these areas would no longer be able to turn to the Postal Service for surcharge-free, lower-cost rates on most of these routes. Small businesses hoping to send mail or packages to these places would also suffer. Rural communities would also be more likely to lose their local post offices. The task force wants to get rid of a law prohibiting the closing of rural post offices solely because they’re running a deficit. The Postal Service would also have the green light to reduce delivery days from six to five or even fewer days per week and expand the use of cluster mailboxes to replace door-to-door delivery. These and other proposed service cuts would shrink the number of good postal jobs — jobs that have long supported this country’s middle class. My grandfather’s 47 years of steady Postal Service employment protected the family from the Great Depression and paid for my mom’s teacher training. A generation earlier, my great-grandfather supported his family delivering the mail from Westerly to Newport, R.I., lugging his loads first onto a train and then a ferry. He got the position after the Civil War, when the government created jobs for Union Army vets like him by expanding free delivery service. Today, military reservists and veterans make up more than 18 percent of the Postal Service’s 640,000 employees. Although these jobs sustain families and communities across the country, the Trump task force calls for eliminating postal workers’ right to collective bargaining, which would very likely lower their pay. So what’s behind this cutthroat cost-cutting? The Trump task force report claims that the Postal Service is a financial disaster. In fact, its operations are funded through postage, not tax dollars. Every day, the Postal Service delivers more than 400 million letters and packages at rates that are just a fraction of those in other rich countries — including the European nations that have privatized their postal operations. The “losses” the Trump task force points to are a result of a congressional mandate to pay about $5.5 billion per year to fund future retiree health benefits 75 years in advance — a burden no other agency or company faces or could afford. Without this burden, as the task force itself makes clear, the Postal Service would have been in the black for the past six years. While refusing to end this onerous mandate, the task force opposes the post office’s efforts to raise new revenue. The Postal Service has proposed expanding into check-cashing, bill payment and other financial services that could raise new revenue. These would be low-cost, reliable options for consumers without access to traditional banks, and they are services that post offices in other countries have provided for many years. But the task force opposes this move, arguing that the Postal Service can’t compete effectively with banks for this business. This year, as my family gathers for our traditional Christmas Eve meal, we will remember our ancestors’ hard work — and hope that our country’s Postal Service will continue to thrive for many more generations.

2018,"The Power of One Family’s Story, More Than a Year After Hurricane Harvey","Times Insider Readers of the New York Times Magazine article about the Daileys, “Lost in the Storm,” found Wayne on social media and reached out in droves. Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. In August 2017, I went to Houston Methodist Hospital to report on the health impacts of Hurricane Harvey: a tiny cut that marinated in floodwaters and became a raging infection; a displaced chemotherapy outpatient whom staff members scoured the city to locate and bring in for care. Some workers had lost their own homes, and the chief of the heart failure and transplant division, who is under 5 feet tall, walked through floodwaters up to her chin to get to work. (Billions of dollars of fortifications had protected Methodist and other Texas Medical Center hospitals from flooding, but they became islands for a time.) Hospital executives, among the most empathetic I’ve ever met, camped in their offices and distributed hugs, encouragement and bonuses. The crisis extended as the storm moved east, disabling other hospitals, and ambulance crews transferred their patients to Houston. An email about a patient from a different hospital shifted my focus, because her story offered a window into many of the most critical aspects of the region’s hurricane response. Our projects can take us in unexpected directions, and we often do not know what the result, or the impact, of an investigation will be when we begin. Cassandra Dills-Dailey, known as Casey, had undergone surgery to remove a benign adrenal tumor at Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center. A doctor newly graduated from medical school discharged her before the storm hit, sending her home without a critical steroid medication. A young mother of two boys, Casey fell critically ill after floodwater surrounded her home. Her husband, Wayne, tried to save her, phoning 911 several times starting early one afternoon until late the following morning. Call takers were overwhelmed and local first responders lacked high water vehicles and watercraft. Wayne and others turned to the internet and social media to ask for help. Regular citizens with boats arrived before emergency medical workers did, but it was already too late. I spent months learning about the Dailey family’s ordeal, studying each layer of the systems that might have saved Casey’s life and the lives of others who died in similar circumstances. The family wanted answers, and they allowed me and the photographers Andrew Burton and Ilana Panich-Linsman to accompany them through the difficult days after Casey’s death in the hopes that telling her story might help others. Wayne had recorded videos on his phone during the disaster and was willing to share them, as well as her medical records. For a reporter, remarkable openness like this makes it possible to depict events in a richer way. The investigation showed that response systems in Harris County (with more than 4.5 million residents) — one of the most flood-prone parts of the United States in recent years — failed to effectively prioritize those who needed lifesaving medical help in the aftermath of a major natural disaster. Furthermore, Casey’s death was never attributed to the storm by local medical examiners. That is emblematic of the widely varying practices used to account for disaster deaths. The lack of standardization robs us of a common understanding of each emergency’s most profound toll and deprives some families of the federal funeral assistance they are entitled to receive. My colleagues and I documented this problem from the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico to the 2018 hurricanes. In Casey’s case, dispatching a helicopter might have saved her. But per the official system, that would have required a complex, multi-step process involving communication across various agencies. It did not happen. Realistic disaster drills might have surfaced this issue and led to streamlined procedures whereby 911 call takers could connect with helicopter dispatchers if local first responders were unable to help. Another way to solve problems of an imperfect system is to get creative and pivot. The month after the story about the Daileys was published, I witnessed this in Pender County, N.C. A teenager experienced a diabetic crisis in a neighborhood where the roads were cut off by swift-moving water unleashed by Hurricane Florence. His brother called 911, and within about 30 minutes the Coast Guard helicopter crew with whom I was riding was alerted to the case. We landed to pick up the boy minutes later, delivering him to a hospital in time to save his life. I went back to Pender County to report on how that had occurred. A communications expert at the county’s emergency operations center had improvised, establishing direct communications with a federal air operations branch in the state capital. In Texas that same month, Wayne Dailey was undergoing what he described as “the most surreal thing I’ve ever experienced in my life.” Readers of the Magazine article and listeners to our podcast The Daily, which later released a two-part audio version of Casey’s story produced by Annie Brown, had found Wayne on social media and reached out in droves, offering kind words and financial donations to the family’s once languishing GoFundMe campaign. The funds restored their trailer home’s water service, which had been cut off, and allowed Wayne to take ownership of the 16-year-old S.U.V. that he had been trying to purchase, which had recently been repossessed. Christian Brothers Automotive Corporation later donated a new Ford Flex S.U.V. to the family. A stranger in New England who had co-founded a chain of urgent care clinics offered Wayne a job. (It was in a state far from Texas, so he did not accept it.) Wayne received the support with enormous appreciation and a measure of guilt. He had felt terrible about not being able to save Casey. He listened to the podcast many times, finding it “kinda soothing,” he wrote in a text. “My heart and mind are constantly telling me everyone has to know how Casey lost her life.” Wayne’s mother, Darlene Zavertnik, urged readers to do more than donate. “Our greatest wish is to be a catalyst for change,” she wrote to donors. “I encourage you to understand how the emergency system in your area operates. Don’t wait until it is too late. There are many lessons to be learned from our story. Awareness and knowledge are the first step.” If reporters like me only expose what went wrong without including evidence that solutions, too, might exist, we risk imparting a false sense of inevitability. Sometimes we learn about those solutions and write about them in later stories, and sometimes our reporting allows us to incorporate them into a single story. What seems like a small detail might resonate in unanticipated ways. For example, well into production on the Magazine story, the editor, Luke Mitchell, allowed me to add a sentence about innovations that included the fact that in Charleston County, S.C., people could provide information to 911 online. I learned later that several 911 directors reached out to Charleston’s 911 director for more information. One was John Dejung from Dane County, Wis. Hurricane Harvey had awakened him to the possibility that his 911 system, one of the largest in a state prone to ice storms, blizzards and tornadoes, might get “so bogged down or debilitated that we might want to rely on alternatives to phones.” Dane County set aside $10,000 in next year’s budget for the purchase of a system that will allow people to reach 911 online if necessary in a major disaster. That alone would likely not have saved Casey’s life, but it may save someone’s. There are myriad ways in which we and the infrastructure and systems we rely on remain unprepared to contend with the natural disasters that seem to arrive ever more frequently and catastrophically. All of us have a stake — and arguably a role — in fixing the most critical problems. But to justify making personal, professional or governmental investments, we need to understand what it looks like when we don’t. Like Wayne, I want to trust that there is value in human empathy, in accountability, and in the practice, from time immemorial, of reconstructing our human tragedies in the form of narratives and sharing them.

2018,Opinion | The Power of Supreme Court Choices,"A combative approach from George H.W. Bush put Clarence Thomas on the court and and has been embraced by Mitch McConnell and other Republicans. Contributing Opinion Writer It’s not hard for a new president, in concert with Congress, to erase a predecessor’s legislative, regulatory and diplomatic accomplishments. It’s a president’s Supreme Court legacy that lasts. Many retrospectives on the life of President George H.W. Bush, who died last Friday, noted that one of the two men he named to the court, Clarence Thomas, is now in his 27th year as a justice and, at age 70, is on track to become one of the longest-serving Supreme Court justices in history. Justice David H. Souter, who in 1990 became President Bush’s first Supreme Court appointee, has received much less attention in recent days, perhaps because he retired nine years ago and has avoided the spotlight ever since. The soft-spoken New Hampshire judge never became a lightning rod except to those on the right who, while thrilling to Justice Thomas’s hard-edge originalism, were sorely vexed by Justice Souter’s modestly progressive jurisprudence. While one became an icon, the other became the object of a negative mantra: “No more Souters.” My goal here is not to appraise the two Bush 41 justices. It’s to compare the approaches — one conciliatory, the other, confrontational — that in the space of a single year (July 1990 to July 1991) produced such different nominees. Those approaches remain today as contrasting archetypes for how to fill a Supreme Court vacancy. Of course, Supreme Court nominations are bound to reflect the priorities of the individual who serves in the White House, and the first President Bush, whose primary focus was on foreign policy, simply wasn’t very interested in the Supreme Court. So in July 1990, when Justice William Brennan had a stroke and retired abruptly and unexpectedly on a Friday afternoon, the president acted with dispatch to get the pesky distraction of a sudden court vacancy off his desk. It took all of a single weekend. On Monday afternoon, having interviewed Mr. Souter and another potential nominee, Judge Edith Jones of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, President Bush announced his choice. The president told reporters that he had not taken “the litmus test approach” and had not questioned the nominee about his views on abortion or anything else. “I have too much respect for the Supreme Court for that,” President Bush said. He added that he expected the nominee’s credentials to carry the day in the Democratic-controlled Senate. “We’re not bracing for some horrendous fight with the United States Senate,” he said. And that was that. President Bush made his choice at the urging of a Republican senator from New Hampshire, Warren Rudman. Senator Rudman was David Souter’s longtime mentor, having preceded him as the state’s attorney general; later, he engineered his appointment first to the New Hampshire Supreme Court and then to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. President Bush’s chief of staff, John Sununu, a former New Hampshire governor whose hard-right conservatism contrasted sharply with Senator Rudman’s more traditional brand of New England Republicanism, praised the Souter appointment as “a home run for conservatives.” But he had ample reason to know that was not the case. In fact, according to rumor at the time, Mr. Sununu had privately urged the appointment of Judge Jones, a deeply conservative and polarizing figure on her court, where she still serves. A Jones nomination would most likely have engendered a “horrendous fight” reminiscent of the battle over President Ronald Reagan’s nomination of Judge Robert Bork, whom the Senate had rejected less than three years earlier. President Bush saw no reason to go down that road. The vote to confirm Judge Souter was 90 to 9. The scenario was much different the following year. On June 27, 1991, the final day of the Supreme Court term, Justice Thurgood Marshall announced his retirement. Once again, President Bush wasted no time. Given the need to prevent the Supreme Court from reverting to an all-white body, as it had been before Justice Marshall’s arrival in 1967, and given the extreme scarcity of conservative African-Americans then in a position to be nominated, there was one obvious choice, and he was sitting in his judicial chambers a mile from the White House. Barely two years earlier, President Bush had named Clarence Thomas to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. That appointment had been widely seen as an effort to place the young lawyer, only 41 at the time, in the launch position for the Supreme Court. It took only four days after Justice Marshall’s retirement announcement for President Bush to select Judge Thomas, describing him “the best man for the job on the merits.” The nomination was understood in ideological as well as racial terms; as head of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Clarence Thomas had given a series of speeches that underscored his conservative credentials, which he attempted to disavow during his confirmation hearing. The nomination was instantly controversial and bitterly contested well before Anita Hill’s allegations against Judge Thomas, her former boss, became public — a fact often forgotten in accounts of the nomination. Democrats who had been skeptical of the choice of David Souter, about whom they knew little, to succeed Justice Brennan, the court’s leading liberal, were aghast at the prospect of Judge Thomas, about whom they knew a good deal, being elevated to Thurgood Marshall’s seat. Before Anita Hill’s emergence, the Senate Judiciary Committee had concluded the confirmation hearing with a 7-to-7 deadlock on a resolution that would have sent the nomination to the Senate floor with a positive recommendation. (The committee moved the nomination forward without a recommendation.) The eventual confirmation vote was 52 to 48. Poles apart, the Souter and Thomas nominations offered templates for the presidencies that followed. Democrats have shied from confrontation, while Republicans have generally embraced and even sought it. President Trump declared on his final campaign swing before the midterm elections last month that “this will be the election of Kavanaugh.” It’s impossible to imagine President Bill Clinton declaring before the 1994 midterms that “this will be the election of Stephen Breyer,” his middle-of-the-road Supreme Court nominee who was confirmed that year by a vote of 87 to 9. President Obama expected that his first Supreme Court nominee, Judge Sonia Sotomayor, would have an easy bipartisan path to confirmation. She most likely would have except for the stated goal of Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, to block the president at every turn. Senator McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, persuaded the National Rifle Association to oppose the nominee and, in a first for a Supreme Court nomination, to “score” the vote, making it a part of the potent annual report card the NRA issues for every member of Congress. As a result, Republican support for Judge Sotomayor quickly melted away, and she received only seven Republican votes. Addressing the Federalist Society in Washington last month, Senator McConnell, now the majority leader, was unabashed in describing the current Republican strategy — to go as far to the right as a bare majority will sustain. Explaining why he abolished the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees, he said, “No Republican president could get the kind of nominee we’d want with 60 votes.” Bipartisan appeal? A sin. The narrowest possible victory? A validation. Such an aggressive program is bound to falter occasionally, as it did last week when Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the lone black Republican in the Senate, announced that he would vote against confirming Thomas Farr to a Federal District Court seat in North Carolina. Mr. Farr, nominated a year ago, drew sustained criticism for his connection to the racist campaigns of Jesse Helms, the former North Carolina senator, and for his legal guidance of the state Republican Party’s vote suppression strategy. The seat is the longest-unfilled judicial vacancy in the country, the Senate having refused to confirm President Obama’s successive nominations of two African-American women. But as the Kavanaugh confirmation (50 to 48) exemplifies, President Trump is winning much more than he’s losing, with an astonishing 29 judges confirmed to the federal Courts of Appeals so far and others slated for confirmation after the new Senate convenes in January. Across all his federal court nominations, the president has chosen two dozen former Supreme Court law clerks, including 10 who clerked for Justice Thomas — more than for any other justice. The legacy continues. Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.

2018,The Power of the Yellow Vest,"The high-visibility garment that has become synonymous with the French protests is an ingenious modern uniform of rebellion. Someday the “gilet jaune,” the fluorescent yellow hazard vest that has become synonymous with the French outcry over fuel prices, growing income inequities and much more, will end up in a museum as one of the most effective protest garments in history. Whoever chose it (and no one is claiming authorship, just as no one has stepped forward as a leader of the movement), and for whatever reason, instinct or insight, it was a potent idea. So effective, in fact, that on Tuesday the French president, Emmanuel Macron, announced that fuel taxes would not be raised. There hasn’t been such a compelling sartorial symbol of revolt since the Sans-culottes seized on their trousers as the point of visual difference with the aristocracy during the French Revolution. That’s probably not a coincidence. The yellow vest is immediately visible in all of the pictures of the protests, peaceful or not, and impossible to miss even on the small screens of social media. It is easy to slip on over any outfit, and instantly transformative. It is widely understood as a distress signal. It is associated with industries of the working class, like construction. And it, or a garment very much like it, has been owned by all French motorists since 2008, when a law went into effect requiring car owners to keep a high-visibility garment in their vehicle in case of problems. (Other European countries have similar laws.) Little wonder the protests have spread to Belgium: The uniform of this revolution is as accessible as the frustration and fury. In Serbia, a deputy for the opposition party showed up at the parliament and warned: “We want normal gas prices, or else you’ll get yellow vests on the streets of Belgrade and Serbia.” The vest is also notably inexpensive to acquire (available on Amazon.fr for €5.90, or about $6.70). And it’s so ubiquitous that even those who aren’t officially part of the movement can seem to take part. Witness the glee on social media when President Macron disembarked for the G-20 summit in Argentina only to be met by airport workers wearing … bright yellow hazard vests. It’s better than any soapbox. “Historically, and presently, dress practices have been and are being used to debate what it means to be a citizen, what it means to belong, or not to belong, to a certain body politic,” said Erin K. Vearncombe, a lecturer at Princeton University who specializes in the cultural anthropology of dress. “Often, these practices are used by individuals that have not been included in the body politic, to contest political structures and bring about change.” Hello, Yellow Vests in their yellow vests. And yet it is getting harder and harder to use clothing as this kind of tool, or find the kind of clothing that can function as this kind of tool. The clear demarcations of class and values traditionally associated with dress have been eroding for a long time now, because of both the general social revolt against formality and fashion’s own tendency to co-opt and thus denature so many of what were once the outfits of the outsiders and the disenfranchised. The torn denim and tie-dye of the hippie generation have been absorbed by street wear and the runway; the leathers and berets of 1968 embraced by Dior; the skulls and safety pins of the British punks adopted by Alexander McQueen and Versace. It’s impossible to take a garment seriously as a cry of rage or despair once it has hit the haute couture catwalk. Which is too bad, because clothes have played important supporting roles in the narrative of revolt and extremism, whether right or left, for centuries. Recently more than ever. The suffragists settled on color — white, green, purple — to represent their demands and characters. (As we all now know, since Hillary Clinton directly referred to the practice in her campaign.) More recently, the pink pussy hats worn during the Women’s March in 2017 served as a visual stalking point, as did the black dresses worn at the Golden Globes in support of #TimesUp and the black garb adopted by female lawmakers at President Trump’s first State of the Union. The black boots, sweats, pants and ski masks of the Antifa movement are a more broad-based and free-floating signifier of anarchy. Still, black is so ubiquitous and so open to interpretation, it somewhat undermines its ability to be an effective protest garment. It’s momentarily powerful but not specific enough for the effects to linger. That explains, in part, why “many of these practices do not translate into the nomenclature of the movements in the way that yellow vests did, pretty much immediately,” Dr. Vearncombe said. You can count such transcendent wardrobe totems on one hand: the Sans-culottes, the Brownshirts. (It may seem wrong to lump the Brownshirts with the others, but it was a political movement identified by clothing.) So what made the difference? In part, the accessibility of the yellow vest itself. But the decentralized nature of the movement also probably played a part, making the vests even more important as a unifying thread and call to arms. Protest movements without such a uniform seem to be the exception in modern times, and can be less effective for it. Occupy Wall Street, in 2011 lacked a visual cohesion. Protesters had many looks, a sprawl that was mirrored in the range of their grievances. “The dressed body within the body politic is often the only opportunity underrepresented individuals have to participate in negotiations of citizenship, but it’s an amazing opportunity, too,” Dr. Vearncombe said. “It is every day, it is participatory, it is collaborative and democratic.” It should not really come as a surprise that France — the country that spawned the Sans-culottes, where la mode is considered part of the culture and the patrimony as well as an instrument of regime change — understands this. It is not an accident that during the most recent Yellow Vests riot, the windows of French stores like Chanel and Dior were smashed. (Ironically, in 2008, when the yellow vest law was first introduced, the Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld appeared in an ad touting its lifesaving capabilities.) A dress for a dress. Once again clothes have come to represent the difference between the haves and the have-nots. Alissa Rubin contributed reporting from Paris.",The New York Times
2018,The Power of the ‘Little Comment’ in Mother-Daughter Relationships,"Both loving and barbed, it uses a kind of weaponized casualness to criticize, but with complete plausible deniability. “Another theme park? My goodness!” reads the text from my mother. Although, perhaps, rather than a text, I should be calling it a “subtext.” She is referring to the desperate outing that I am about to embark on with my three boys, ages 8, 5 and 10 months, in order to avoid spending one more minute listening to them arguing in the house. A close reading of my mother’s message reveals rich and multilayered depth of meaning. The “my goodness!” (complete with jaunty exclamation mark) keeps the tone light, while the use of “another” neatly undercuts that levity, conveying disapproval. The overall take-home message: I spoil the kids. This text is a classic of the genre I think of as the “Little Comment,” the signature mode of communication of a certain type of close relationship between a mother and her adult daughter, especially when that daughter has children of her own. The Little Comment is the product of the female socialization that insists that we be the ones to handle the emotional busywork of life, but prevents us from tackling any of it directly. Both loving and barbed, it uses a kind of weaponized casualness to criticize, but with complete plausible deniability. You know that you are dealing with a “Little Comment,” as opposed to just a comment, when on hearing it you feel a stab of either irritation or self-loathing (or more often, an uneasy blend of the two). But at the same time, a perfectly reasonable response to any objection or hurt feelings would be an innocent, “What do you mean?? I’m just saying …” and then repeating the same statement in an entirely different, newly defanged tone. Examples of the Little Comment might include, “Oh! The full fat kind?” “Isn’t it interesting how he isn’t wearing a coat?” and “Do children watch their iPads at the table now?” In the right context and tone, even an “oh dear” can qualify. Although I bristle, my mother is actually showing amazing restraint. The Little Comment is really the recourse of the powerless. People always say that being a grandparent is all of the fun parts of parenting with none of the grind. But the flip side of this deal is that grandparents also have all of the adoration with none of the agency. My mother loves my kids just as much as I do, is every bit as invested in their happiness and success, yet she has no genuine say in their upbringing. She can’t decide how many theme parks they visit, or whether they wear a coat, or how much television they watch, or how to respond when they call their brother a “poopy diaper.” She sees my absurd helicoptering, my bookshelf groaning with parenting books, my inexplicable inability to get my kids through a single dinnertime without a tantrum. At best she can hope only to influence from the sidelines like a low-ranking medieval courtier. At both its best and its worst, the mother-daughter relationship can at times be as close as two humans can get to telepathy. With two people who are both heavily socialized to anticipate and meet everyone else’s emotional needs, the dynamic can become a kind of high-alert empathy, each constantly attempting to decode what the other might be thinking, hypersensitive to any change in pitch or tone, like a pair of high-strung racehorses. My mother understands me better than anyone, and I crave her approval more than anyone else’s. I could recite her entire value system if I were in a coma. Every meal needs a salad, music is good and sport is suspect, children should learn a stringed instrument, sleeping late is a moral failing. She doesn’t actually need to criticize. She did her job so effectively 30 years ago that now she need only raise an eyebrow and I fill in the blanks on autocomplete. In our case, all this is intensified because we live 6,000 miles away from her, having moved to California from Britain when our oldest son was a baby. Her visits are highly charged for us both. For her, staying with us is a once-a-year opportunity to spend time with her beloved grandchildren. For me, it’s my chance to prove to her that I have a handle on parenting, to get her to provide the answer to the question that claws away at me for the rest of the year. Am I a good mother? Can I ever be a mother like she was? As soon as she arrives from the airport, I am on edge waiting for things to unravel. I know it’s only a matter of time before my kids start behaving in ways that would have been unthinkable for me growing up. It doesn’t take long. Solly’s haunted Lego spy-base doesn’t conform to the overly ambitious picture in his head and he hurls it across the room in a fit of fury. His brother Zeph calls him an idiot, enraging him further. The baby starts crying. “I see everyone is getting very angry” I bleat, desperately quoting from some positive parenting article I read online. Solly storms off. “Oh dear,” says my mother. I am crushed. The uncomfortable truth is that my defensiveness comes not from disagreeing with her assessment of my parenting, but from the painful shame of agreeing. Like many people, before I had my own children, I thought I would be better at this, that I would be a mother like my own mother was. Strong and sure-footed, enforcing calm and respect armed with nothing more than the prospect of a strongly worded expression of disappointment. My mother didn’t need extravagant sticker charts or parenting podcasts to get us to put our socks on. In my memory, we didn’t have tantrums over “transitions” or throw forks at our siblings or need participation trophies to put a plate in the dishwasher. Whatever the elusive balance of indulgence and firmness, love and limits that makes a great parent, my mother knew it instinctively. She had the invisible sorcery of quiet authority, always kind, never needing to shout or threaten. She knew when coats and candy and comfort were in order and when they should be withheld. She knew the exact number of theme park visits that would ensure a happy and productive life. I’m furious with her because I want to be her. It’s a strange evolutionary misstep that even the most powerful and noble of all the human emotions can, in any given moment, be trumped by irritation. But really, perhaps this is the ultimate compliment. I can push back and prickle, safe in the cozy belief that all the questions, big and little, still have answers, and that my mother knows what those answers are. And I try not to think about the unbearable day when she will be gone and I will have to come up with my own answers, and no comment will ever be Little again.

2018,Opinion | The Presidency or Prison,"What happens if re-election is Trump's best hope of avoiding an indictment? Opinion Columnist Donald Trump — or, as he’s known to federal prosecutors, Individual-1 — might well be a criminal. That’s no longer just my opinion, or that of Democratic activists. It is the finding of Trump’s own Justice Department. On Friday, federal prosecutors from the Southern District of New York filed a sentencing memorandum for Michael Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer, who is definitely a criminal. The prosecutors argued that, in arranging payoffs to two women who said they’d had affairs with Trump, Cohen broke campaign finance laws, and in the process “deceived the voting public by hiding alleged facts that he believed would have had a substantial effect on the election.” The filing emphasized the way Cohen’s actions subverted democracy. “While many Americans who desired a particular outcome to the election knocked on doors, toiled at phone banks or found any number of other legal ways to make their voices heard, Cohen sought to influence the election from the shadows,” prosecutors wrote. And he didn’t act alone, but “in coordination with and at the direction of Individual-1.” In other words, lawyers from the Justice Department have concluded that Trump may have committed a felony that went to the heart of the process that put him in office. [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] Trump’s potential criminality in this case, which raises questions about his legitimacy as president, creates a dilemma for Democrats. Assuming prosecutors are right about Trump’s conduct, it certainly seems impeachable; a situation in which a candidate cheats his way into the presidency is one the founders foresaw when they were designing the impeachment process. As George Mason argued at the Constitutional Convention, “Shall the man who has practiced corruption, and by that means procured his appointment in the first instance, be suffered to escape punishment by repeating his guilt?” But in our current moment, removing the president through impeachment is essentially impossible, given that at least 20 Senate Republicans would have to join Democrats. Representative Jerrold Nadler, the New York Democrat who will soon lead the House Judiciary Committee, told me he wouldn’t consider impeachment proceedings without at least some Republican support. There is certainly no appetite among congressional Democrats to pursue impeachment over a campaign finance case, particularly while the special counsel investigation into Russian collusion chugs on. This leaves us in a dangerous situation. Under Justice Department guidelines, sitting presidents can’t be indicted. Ex-presidents, however, can. Experts on both the left and the right believe that if Trump is voted out of office in 2020, before the five-year statute of limitations on campaign finance violations runs out, he could find himself in serious legal jeopardy. The conservative Andrew McCarthy, a former prosecutor in the Southern District of New York and frequent Trump defender, wrote on Fox News’s website on Sunday, “The president is very likely to be indicted on a charge of violating federal campaign finance laws.” Representative Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat and former prosecutor, told me, “This president has potential prison exposure.” The 2020 presidential election was always going to be extraordinarily ugly, but one can only imagine what Trump will do if the alternative to the White House is the big house. “It’s dangerous,” said Swalwell, who worries that Trump could become even more erratic, making decisions to save himself that involve “our troops or internal domestic security.” Ordinarily, you know that a democracy is failing when electoral losers are threatened with prison. But Trump’s lawlessness is so blatant that impunity — say, a pardon, or a politically motivated decision not to prosecute — would also be deeply corrosive, unless it was offered in return for his resignation. There’s simply no way around it — as long as Individual-1 is on the ticket, the 2020 election is set to be a banana republic-style death match. Trump will almost certainly try to criminalize his opponent — crowds at his rallies have taken to chanting “Lock her up” at the mention of virtually any Democratic woman’s name. And Democrats won’t be able to uphold the general principle that in American elections, losing doesn’t mean personal ruination, because for Trump it will and it should. There are ways to lower the stakes somewhat. Nadler told me he plans to introduce legislation that would freeze the statute of limitations for crimes committed by presidents, so they could be charged when their terms end. Such a law would at least mean that Trump couldn’t evade justice forever just by winning re-election. That would mitigate the peril to our democracy, but it wouldn’t come close to eliminating it. Our best hope may lie in the emergence of irrefutable evidence of further presidential crimes, enough to finally test the tolerance of at least some fraction of Republicans. “The story’s not over yet,” Representative Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat and former constitutional law professor, told me. “We’re just at the beginning of it. After two years of hearing people say we were all trigger-happy on impeachment, now I’m hearing we’re all constitutional fraidy-cats. Give us a chance to do the fact investigation and figure out what happened.” Fair enough. But if the president has committed felonies, we also have to figure out how Republicans might be induced to care.

2018,Opinion | The President’s Field Trip to the Forever War,"“Thank you for your service,” but spare the details, please. Mr. Gallagher is an Iraq war veteran. As far as incursions into combat go, President Trump’s brief trip to Iraq last week is not likely to make any future leadership manuals. “What we had to go through, with the darkened plane, with all windows closed,” he said of his descent in a dimmed Air Force One to an airstrip at Al Asad Air Base. “I’ve never seen anything like it.” That’s actually pretty vanilla as these things go, a far cry from corkscrewing into Baghdad International to evade surface-to-air missiles, let alone crossing the Alps on a war elephant. But, after two years as commander in chief and a steady stream of complaints for not having done so, Mr. Trump did visit American troops stationed in a war zone. It didn’t take long for many of the same people who criticized him for never making that presidential pilgrimage to express disdain for how he did it. His Iraq trip came in the wake of his announcement of a troop withdrawal from Syria, and coincided with a report in The New York Times on how his deferment for bone spurs during the Vietnam War might have come about. Cable news packed itself full with retired generals, foreign policy experts and seasoned journalists who’ve been to the proving grounds of war and found the president in contempt. The visit was likened to a campaign rally. “Cadet Bone Spurs” trended on Twitter. Thinkers ranging from Noam Chomsky to Bill Kristol made cases for remaining in Syria in some capacity. Even on Fox News, the morning host Brian Kilmeade said, “Nobody thinks ISIS is defeated,” pushing back against Mr. Trump’s initial argument for withdrawal from Syria. It’s true that the president brought a lot of this criticism upon himself. But there’s also something perverse about the fierce blowback he received. I’ve found myself wondering if he’s facing this tempest for another reason — because he dared suggest scaling back the reach of the American military-industrial complex. Mr. Trump has a strange relationship with the military. He loves the parades, the star-spangled pomp and surrounding himself with generals’ stars. Until the generals speak, at least. For instance, see the letter of resignation from Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis — and the way it sped up his departure. The Iraq trip was a prime example of the superficiality of how this president sees the military. The seemingly staged images of Mr. Trump with kitted-up special operators in the Asad chow hall are both exploitative and goofy. And it seemed a bit convenient that so many “Make America Great Again” red hats happened to be at an air base in the middle of desolate Anbar Province. Mr. Trump tends to recoil from the messy particulars, like understanding Purple Hearts aren't something to congratulate soldiers for, or reading through complex foreign policy briefings. He channels a vague sense of gratitude for service members — one that neatly mirrors the vague gratitude of many Americans. This president embodies our republic’s earnest yet shallow understanding of military service, all the while acting as a reminder of the limited mass appeal of service itself. Less than one percent of Americans wear the uniform these days. Bone spurs? In 2018, who actually cares, beyond those who had to go to Vietnam in the stead of kids like Donald Trump? Our country has had ample opportunity to elect a Vietnam veteran as president. It has chosen not to, time and time again. It’s not a coincidence our three boomer presidents (Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Mr. Trump) all managed to avoid service in Vietnam. Nor is it coincidence that veterans like John McCain and John Kerry had their service records used against them on the presidential campaign trail. Even Al Gore, who spent a few months in Vietnam as an Army newspaper reporter, got closer to battle than the man who defeated him, Mr. Bush, who spent his service time stateside on Air National Guard bases. In so many ways, Mr. Trump is not a cause of diminishing respect for the military, but a symptom of it. So it is with 21st-century America and war. “Thank you for your service,” but spare the details, please. Last month, I attended a retirement ceremony at Fort Knox, Ky., for the platoon sergeant I served with in Iraq. A photograph of Mr. Trump glowering greets people at the visitors’ center there, next to the stern, cool-eyed image of (the soon departing) Secretary Mattis. We celebrated that evening with my friend’s family over dinner and drinks, and talk gradually turned to the world. I asked my friend what changes he’d noticed over his 20-plus years of military service — how different presidents have shaped his career, his multiple combat deployments. “It’s been the same for us for a long time,” he said. “Republicans in charge, Democrats in charge — hasn’t really mattered much, to be honest.” A few years ago, the author and Vietnam veteran Karl Marlantes told me in an interview, “We’re not behaving like a republic,” and his words return to me a lot when I read war news. Something is broken in our system if the machineries of war endure all strategies and policy changes, if only for the sake of enduring. There are legitimate reasons, both related to national security and humanitarian interests, to remain in Syria, as one example — our Kurdish allies pre-eminent among them. But when questions like “How long?” and “How many?” and “What’s the objective?” get swallowed up by a defense industry that essentially answers with, “We’ll handle it,” it’s no wonder that the American citizenry doesn’t engage with its military much beyond surprise homecomings at football games. It’s also no wonder that nearly half of Americans believe the war in Afghanistan has “mostly failed,” according to a recent Pew poll, despite Secretary Mattis and others continually making the case that staying there will help prevent another Sept. 11. It’s no wonder the American citizenry elected a president with an isolationist bent who reflexively distrusts elites and experts. And in Mr. Trump’s defense — not a line I thought I’d ever write — it’s many of those same elites and experts who got us mired in a war that now costs us $45 billion a year to begin with. Should we remain in Afghanistan? Should we stay in Syria and Iraq? Both as a combat veteran and a citizen who tries to stay informed of his nation’s foreign policy, I can honestly answer only: I don’t know. I’m not privy to top-secret briefings, nor do I earn a living by making grand predictions on matters of war and peace. I do know this, though: The way forward should involve more transparency, not less. Then citizens will be better able to hold our elected officials accountable for the decisions they have our military leaders execute. As it stands now, Americans seem to care so little or are so convinced of the necessity of permanent war that our military is still fighting overseas based on congressional authorization from 2001. That’s not good enough, not even close. The American public has been conditioned to believe that foreign war is necessary, even vital, to maintaining our way of life. Forcing those in power to explain why — beyond easy, histrionic references to Sept. 11 — would go a long way toward moving beyond this forever war. In the meantime, our commander in chief continues to be both baffled by and obsessed with our men and women in uniform. It’s crass. It’s clownish. It’s unbecoming. In 2018, it’s also unquestionably American.

2018,Opinion | The Problem With Banning Pornography on Tumblr,"The decision has taken away an essential platform for some women and members of the L.G.B.T.Q. community. Ms. Powell is the former head of communications for Google. This week, the social networking site Tumblr banned the very thing that drove many people to its site: adult content. Many cheered that Tumblr had finally caught up with the times, echoing anti-pornography policies adopted by Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and others. But there was another set of voices you might not have heard — the voices of women and the L.G.B.T.Q. community — who pointed out that this change will destroy a safe space for self-expression, discovery and connection. While we can get hung up on debating what kind of content should or shouldn’t be allowed on a particular platform, none of that alters an equally important but less-visible problem: When tech companies tackle large-scale problems with large-scale solutions, underrepresented groups are often further marginalized as a result. The change in Tumblr policy seems to have been born from a reasonable concern. In this case, child pornography was discovered on the platform. There is, of course, a big difference between child pornography and adult content, but Tumblr may have decided that the only way to effectively filter out the former was to eradicate the latter. Or it may simply have decided that moderating pornography was too expensive. Whatever the case, Tumblr said that it was all in favor of creative expression and deep community, but that it would ban all adult content — specifically, all “images, videos, or GIFs that show real-life human genitals or female-presenting nipples,” and any content depicting sex acts. This is not the first time a social media or blog platform has banned adult content. Twitter, Facebook, and many other platforms all prohibit pornography. But in the United States, we seem to ignore public debate about the censorship of sex and the human body, reflecting the American tendency to get more offended by the sight of a female-presenting nipple than by guns, hate speech or violence. While all efforts must be made to eradicate illegal content on Tumblr, it’s important to acknowledge that underrepresented groups have carved out safe spaces on the platform. Tumblr has thrived in part thanks to its unique identity as a place for adult content. Young women dominate the platform, and many turn to it as a place to find more empowering, female-centric takes on pornography and the female body. On Tumblr, one could find pages dedicated to celebrating bodies of all types, could browse sophisticated fetish images curated from a female perspective, and could find GIFs and videos that — unlike most mainstream pornography sites — depict female pleasure. Some of Tumblr’s users spoke out against the company’s decision, like Vex Ashley, a performer who makes pornography, who tweeted, “I can’t tell you how important it is for work about and with sex to have space to exist next to work about every other part of human experience.” She used Tumblr to socialize and network, and as a place to share videos, images and behind-the-scenes photos. Similarly, many in the L.G.B.T.Q. community have said the adult content on Tumblr provided a space to connect with those with similar interests and to explore sexuality without judgment. “If not for tumblr i probably wouldnt have realized or even accepted the possibility of me being gay/trans,” said one trans Tumblr user (who goes by the Twitter handle of @nonsensecodons). The problem isn’t just about agreeing on what kind of content to allow on a platform, or whether adult content is a positive or negative force in society. It’s also that tech companies like Tumblr make statements about wanting to be a positive place for diverse communities, all the while not truly understanding these communities and allowing their algorithms to target their adult content. To be fair, it is a hard nut to crack. Platforms with millions of users need algorithmic solutions to solve issues like content regulation at scale. The problem is, machines are not yet very good at nuance. Can Tumblr’s artificial intelligence tell the difference between a curated page of visual erotica and violent sexual imagery the same way a trained human could? Probably not. There are many examples of Tumblr’s A.I. making mistakes, in which non-explicit fan art, pictures of a person’s hands, a cartoon image of two men kissing and a vigorous, sweaty game of Ping-Pong set off the platform’s A.I. filters. Tumblr has said there will be an appeals process staffed by real live humans, but the human part seems like an afterthought, as it so often does with tech companies. While there is no perfect solution, there are many steps Tumblr could take if it truly wanted to support these communities. A more nuanced policy could be developed and then implemented through greater short-term investment in more human moderation and long-term investment in A.I. Without the ability to judge nuance at scale and to distinguish between empowering versus damaging content, Tumblr has adopted a policy that destroys communities who are among its greatest fans.

2018,The Question for France: Where Do the Yellow Vests Go From Here?,"PARIS — The Yellow Vest tornado has created a political vacuum in France. The government of President Emmanuel Macron is weakened. The opposition parties are discredited. And the populist uprising itself proclaims its disdain for politics. Who or what will fill that void is now the biggest question facing France. Even though the protests have dwindled — Saturday’s were about half the size of the previous week — the Yellow Vest movement, and the anger that animates it, remain very much alive. Political groups are now jockeying to see who will be the first to seize the movement’s energy, and whether it can be given a more organized and coherent shape. Capturing the support of even part of the movement would be a potential political bonanza. Even after the violence of their protests in December, the Yellow Vests still enjoy broad popular backing, double or triple that for Mr. Macron. “This movement is very important, the most important since May ’68,” said Gérard Grunberg, a political scientist at Sciences Po. “It’s not dead. It would be foolish to say so.” Still the number of protesters dropped sharply on Saturday from preceding weeks, with 38,600 taking part, compared with 66,000 last weekend and 282,000 in the initial protests on Nov. 17, the French Interior Ministry said. In Paris on Saturday, 2,000 took to the streets, compared with 4,000 last week. The police detained 179 people in Paris, and there were scuffles when demonstrators attacked officers on the Champs-Élysées. One person died in a car accident during a Yellow Vests protest in Perpignan. And on Friday night, demonstrators decapitated an effigy of Mr. Macron in the southeastern city of Angoulême. For now, the only way to glean hints of a potential direction for the Yellow Vests and who might capitalize on the movement is by watching the notably few political figures who have not been chased from France’s traffic roundabouts, the emblematic redoubts of the movement. One is François Ruffin, a documentary filmmaker turned maverick lawmaker, who was way ahead of the curve in expressing uncompromising rejection of Mr. Macron. “You are hated, Mr. Macron,” he wrote in a much remarked-on opinion piece in the newspaper Le Monde just before the former investment banker’s election in May 2017. Mr. Ruffin wrote then that he was merely reporting the sentiment he had picked up in the working-class neighborhoods of their mutual hometown, the depressed northern city of Amiens. “You are hated, you are hated, you are hated,” Mr. Ruffin wrote then. Mr. Ruffin sits in Parliament today as a member of the far-left party La France Insoumise, or France Unbowed, led by the longtime political firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon. But it is far from certain that Mr. Ruffin’s relative acceptance among some Yellow Vests portends an embrace of the left. Both the far left and the far right have been largely unwelcome in what remains of the dwindling Yellow Vest outposts — the government is clearing them out — on the roundabouts. Parties linked to both tendencies show polling gains from Yellow Vest supporters, but so far not significant ones. Their leaders have made supportive noises, notably Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right party formerly known as the National Front, but have stayed off the roundabouts for the most part. The National Front was renamed this year as the Rassemblement National. As for Mr. Macron and his minions, they have stayed away, too. In fact, beyond the Yellow Vests’ shared economic hardships and resentment, if there is one thing uniting this heterogeneous revolt of France’s unhappy, it is hatred of Mr. Macron. “Macron resign!” “Macron Louis XVI!” or “Macron, Come Out If You Are a Man!” and other slogans far less polite have punctuated Yellow Vest gatherings. A number of their encampments feature mock guillotines dedicated to the president. One of Mr. Macron’s trademarks was scorn for predecessors who yielded to pressure from the streets. Now he has done exactly that in a series of concessions, though the Yellow Vests appear to be unimpressed by these “crumbs,” as they are deemed by some. “They are ridiculous, and they are false,” Paul Marra, a Yellow Vest representative in Marseille, said on Thursday. “When you say you are going to raise the minimum wage, you don’t do it with smoke and mirrors.” Many of the Yellow Vests say they eschew politics and don’t even vote. The latest Yellow Vest demand — citizen referendums — bypasses conventional politics altogether. Yet it is abundantly clear that this ostensibly nonpolitical protest is actually political to its core. The leftist Mr. Ruffin brushed off any suggestion that he would profit politically from Yellow Vest approbation, or even that he wants to. “What happens to them now? It doesn’t interest me,” Mr. Ruffin declared in an interview in his spartan parliamentary office this week. Yet last week he embarked on a national tour of the roundabouts, a trip few have dared to attempt. The Yellow Vests’ national spokesmen — Mr. Marra and a counterpart in Toulouse, Benjamin Cauchy — are skeptical of the filmmaker, suggesting that even this novice politician is not virgin enough for them. Local press accounts suggest he was well received, though he did not put on a yellow vest. Wary as they may be of each other, there is clearly kinship, with sentiments that overlap. “For me, it’s a miracle simply that it’s existed,’’ Mr. Ruffin said of the movement. ‘‘I’ve been watching this France of silent suffering for 20 years.” Mr. Ruffin rose to prominence in 2016 with “Merci Patron!” (“Thanks, Boss!”), a popular and cheeky Michael Moore-style sendup of Bernard Arnault, the head of the luxury group LVMH and the richest man in Europe. The film’s underlying edge of rage at the privileged resonated deeply then, and does so especially now. Mr. Ruffin went to the same rigorous Jesuit high school as the president, La Providence. He didn’t know Mr. Macron then, though his younger sister was in the same class. Mr. Ruffin stayed in scruffy Amiens and became the struggling editor of a countercultural leftist newspaper, Fakir; Mr. Macron went to Paris, piled up prestigious degrees, worked at the Rothschild bank, and quickly gained the favor of the powerful. “He’s the incarnation of the elites,” Mr. Ruffin said. “He’s spent 18 months exacerbating the tensions in society.” He acknowledged that Mr. Macron’s predecessors in the French presidency had also quickly become disliked figures, but asserted that with Mr. Macron it was worse. “There’s an air of contempt in his whole relationship to the people,’’ Mr. Ruffin said. ‘‘And people feel this.” The sense that France is out of joint, fiscally and economically, generating deep resentment among the country’s millions of have-nots, permeates Mr. Ruffin’s film. That same sense led him to become one of the earliest supporters of the Yellow Vests, calling for citizens to back the movement’s Nov. 17 protest more than two weeks before, in a video filmed in his kitchen in Amiens. “There’s an underlying anger,” Mr. Ruffin said in the Oct. 30 video. “How can we take our revenge? Say no to Macron!” he said. “There’s a sentiment of fiscal injustice that has penetrated this country!” Two and a half weeks later, the rage exploded on the streets. Last week in his office in Parliament, Mr. Ruffin warned that, whatever the political future of the Yellow Vests, the upheaval was not over. “The institutional crisis isn’t finished yet,” he said. “There will be more developments. The French Revolution lasted six years. We haven’t heard from the banlieues yet,” the largely immigrant suburbs. “We haven’t heard from the unions yet.” As for the Macron government, “they’ve given in because of what happened on the Champs-Élysées,’’ he said. ‘‘And I regret it. But that’s the way it happened.”",The New York Times
2018,The Race Is On to Protect Data From the Next Leap in Computers. And China Has the Lead.,"SAN FRANCISCO — The world’s leading technology companies, from Google to Alibaba in China, are racing to build the first quantum computer, a machine that would be far more powerful than today’s computers. This device could break the encryption that protects digital information, putting at risk everything from the billions of dollars spent on e-commerce to national secrets stored in government databases. An answer? Encryption that relies on the same concepts from the world of physics. Just as some scientists are working on quantum computers, others are working on quantum security techniques that could thwart the code-breaking abilities of these machines of the future. It is a race with national security implications, and while building quantum computers is still anyone’s game, China has a clear lead in quantum encryption. As it has with other cutting-edge technologies, like artificial intelligence, the Chinese government has made different kinds of quantum research a priority. “China has a very deliberate strategy to own this technology,” said Duncan Earl, a former researcher at Oak Ridge National Laboratory who is president and chief technology officer of Qubitekk, a company that is exploring quantum encryption. “If we think we can wait five or 10 years before jumping on this technology, it is going to be too late.” Quantum computing is based on quantum mechanics, the science that explains the strange behavior exhibited by extremely small particles of matter. With traditional computers, transistors store “bits” of information, and each bit is either a 1 or a 0. Those are the fundamental slices of data that tell a computer what to do. When some types of matter are extremely small or extremely cold, they behave differently. That difference allows a quantum bit, or qubit, to store a combination of 1 and 0. Two qubits can hold four values at once. As the number of qubits grows, a quantum computer becomes exponentially more powerful. Like quantum computing, quantum encryption relies on the nonintuitive behavior of very small objects. The codes that keep data secret are sent by photons, the tiniest particle of light. With the right equipment it is easy to tell if they have been tampered with, not unlike the seal on an aspirin bottle. If carried out properly, the technique could be unbreakable. There is no guarantee that a viable quantum encryption network could be built over long distances. But if it does happen, China’s willingness to experiment and put government, academic and commercial resources behind the effort could have a big payoff. The country has invested tens of millions of dollars building networks that can transmit data using quantum encryption. Last year, a Chinese satellite named Micius, after an ancient philosopher, managed a video call between Beijing and Vienna using quantum encryption. A dedicated quantum communication network between Beijing and Shanghai was also put into operation last year, after four years of planning and construction. For now, quantum encryption works only over a limited distance. The satellite link between Beijing and Vienna stretched this limit to a record 4,630 miles. On the ground, using optical fiber lines, the ceiling is about 150 miles. Among China’s investments in quantum encryption, the Micius satellite has received the most attention. The University of Science and Technology of China, the government-backed university that helped launch Micius, led the construction of the ground network, which spans about 1,200 miles — perhaps a hint of aspirations for drastic improvement. The governments of Anhui and Shandong Provinces, through which the fiber-optic network passes, together invested $80 million in the project. Like all major infrastructure projects in China, the plans have had high-level support from the Chinese government. This main line is being extended to other cities and regions. The goal by 2030 is a Chinese-built network for sharing quantum encryption keys across the globe. Some security experts question the effectiveness of quantum encryption. Because it is so new, it has not been put through anywhere close to the rigorous testing that would give it a stamp of approval from skeptical cryptographers. But Chao-Yang Lu, a professor of physics at the University of Science and Technology of China, said the Beijing-Shanghai quantum network was a significant upgrade. With communications sent by traditional means, eavesdroppers can intercept the data stream at every point along a fiber-optic line. A government could tap that line just about anywhere. Quantum encryption cut the number of vulnerable spots in the Beijing-Shanghai line to just a few dozen across 1,200 miles, Professor Lu said. “We admit that it’s an intermediate solution,” he said. “It’s not the final solution. But it’s already a huge improvement in terms of security.” In the United States, the government and industry have viewed quantum encryption as little more than a science experiment. Instead, researchers have focused on using ordinary mathematics to build new forms of encryption that can stand up to a quantum computer. This technology would not require new infrastructure. But now, spurred by activity in China and recent advances in quantum research, some in the United States are playing catch-up. Qubitekk, a Southern California start-up, is working to secure power grids in Tennessee using the technology. A second start-up, Quantum Xchange, is building a quantum encryption network in the Northeast, hoping to serve Wall Street banks and other businesses. Researchers at Stony Brook University on Long Island are preparing a third venture. Small start-ups like Qubitekk are unlikely to match the millions of dollars in infrastructure already created in China for quantum encryption. But many experts believe the more important work will happen in research labs, and the Department of Energy is funding a test network in Chicago that could eclipse the kind of systems deployed in China. The Los Alamos and Oak Ridge National Laboratories are working with Qubitekk to secure power grids with quantum technology, and Quantum Xchange is moving equipment into 60 Hudson Street, the old Western Union telegraph hub, which now serves as an internet hub for Lower Manhattan. Quantum Xchange is building a quantum encryption link between Manhattan and Newark, with plans to connect big banks operating in the two cities. Eventually, it hopes to extend this network up and down the East Coast. At places like the University of Chicago, researchers hope to go a step further, exploring what are called quantum repeaters — devices that could extend the range of quantum encryption. “We’re not there yet,” said David Awschalom, a professor at the University of Chicago who oversees much of the university’s quantum research. “But I am confident this will happen in the next couple of years.” Quantum communication techniques require new hardware. This includes vast networks of fiber lines — and perhaps satellites — as well as specialized devices capable of detecting individual photons of light. As Qubitekk worked on quantum encryption networks, it could not obtain the special light detectors it needed to do the work. The start-up originally bought detectors from a small manufacturer in New Jersey, Princeton Lightwave. But in April, this lone American manufacturer handed the detector business over to a company in China, RMY, and Qubitekk’s supply line ran dry. RMY has promised hardware to Qubitekk but recently told it that, because of production issues, additional detectors won’t be available until March. Small companies in Europe are selling somewhat similar detectors, and labs across the globe are developing a more advanced type of hardware. But for now, supplies, particularly in the United States, are slim.",The New York Times
2018,The Race for Alaskan Oil: 6 Key Takeaways,"For more than a generation, opposition to drilling has left a 19-million-acre wildlife refuge in Alaska largely unscathed. But the region is on the cusp of major change as Washington speedily rolls back protections. FAIRBANKS, Alaska — The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of the most pristine landscapes in the United States. But that may soon change as the Trump administration seeks to exploit an untapped trove of oil beneath its coastal plain. Since Congress approved a measure last December to open the coastal plain to oil exploration, the Department of the Interior has been charging ahead with a plan to sell drilling leases as early as next year. Trucks weighing 90,000 pounds could begin rolling across the tundra even before then to conduct seismic tests that help pinpoint oil reserves. The hurried approach has alarmed some government specialists and environmentalists, who say that risks to wildlife and damage to the tundra are not being taken seriously enough. And it comes as the Trump administration moves more broadly to exploit fossil fuels in Alaska and beyond, erasing restrictive policies that were designed to protect the environment and address global warming. The New York Times examined how, in the space of about a year, the refuge’s coastal plain — known as the 1002 Area — went from off-limits to open for business. Here are six takeaways. In 1960, Congress set aside millions of acres of land in northeast Alaska for wildlife protection, but the discovery of oil reserves around Prudhoe Bay in 1968 suggested such riches may also exist elsewhere, including under the coastal plain. Ever since, Alaskan lawmakers have been at the forefront of a push to allow oil exploration in the plain. In 1980, Congress passed conservation legislation that left an opening for eventual oil and gas development there, but over the years opponents blocked repeated attempts by Alaskans — and Republicans — to proceed. While Alaskans generally favor drilling in the state, a poll last year by researchers at Yale and George Mason Universities showed that 70 percent of registered voters nationwide opposed it in the reserve. There is also the question of whether additional domestic oil production is even necessary in the United States, especially in the Arctic — where it is costly to produce — as the world needs to eventually wean itself off fossil fuels. The 2016 election brought about a rare opportunity. With Republicans controlling Congress and the presidency, the opening of the refuge to oil exploration became an urgent priority for Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, and others in her party. Democrats in the Senate still had the ability to filibuster any legislation that would directly authorize drilling, so Ms. Murkowski found an end run. She engineered a provision in last December’s tax overhaul bill that characterized oil exploration on the coastal plain as a way to grow federal revenues. The bill passed the Senate on a straight party-line vote. When President Trump signed it into law with much fanfare, he was also authorizing drilling in the refuge. In preparing to see through the new authorization, the Department of the Interior, which has jurisdiction over federal lands, filled key jobs with appointees who were committed to oil exploration and had deep connections to Alaska. A former Washington lobbyist, David Bernhardt, was appointed deputy Interior secretary. In 2014, he had represented the state of Alaska when it sued the federal government over its refusal to review oil exploration plans for the refuge. Another top appointee, Joe Balash, had served as Alaska's commissioner of natural resources at the time of the lawsuit. Officials with the Interior Department pledge to conduct an impartial process, but environmental groups fear the new appointees are pursuing a predetermined outcome. Before it can begin selling leases to drill for oil, the Interior Department is required by law to conduct environmental studies to help identify and address potentially negative consequences. The studies are typically time-consuming and involve extensive public engagement. But the Trump administration has moved to fast-track them. The biggest and most important of the studies is on pace to be completed in half the usual time, and only one public hearing has been held outside Alaska. Opponents fear that cutting corners could jeopardize the environment or put wildlife, such as polar bears, in harm’s way. They point to problems associated with seismic testing in the mid-1980s. But the Interior Department says that its procedures have improved since then, and that the environmental reviews can be conducted more speedily this time because of previously collected scientific material. Big-name oil companies have been largely absent from the public discussions about tapping oil reserves on the coastal plain, but a lesser-known company called Arctic Slope Regional Corporation has taken a leading role. The corporation, one of 13 formed in the 1970s to foster economic development among Alaska’s indigenous population, stands to enjoy a windfall from oil development, in part because it separately owns rights to drill on 92,000 acres within the coastal plain. The corporation, which has been a key financial backer of Ms. Murkowski, ramped up its lobbying efforts in Washington under the Trump administration. The role of A.S.R.C., a private company that counts 13,000 Alaska Natives as it shareholders, has become a flash point in the debate between Native communities over the fate of the coastal plain. Natives who live in the coastal area, many of whom are A.S.R.C. shareholders, generally support oil development. Other Natives who live south of the refuge oppose drilling. They fear it would disturb the migration of porcupine caribou, animals they have hunted for centuries for food. Drilling proponents of drilling have never been this close to achieving their goals, but even the most optimistic among them say actual drilling is a decade or more away. The potential headwinds are formidable. For one, environmental groups are closely watching every step of the process, and lawsuits are likely. And Democrats will soon control the House of Representatives, and are pledging to make aggressive oversight of the leasing process a priority. For its part, the Interior Department says it is using extreme care, knowing full well the challenges ahead.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Race to Dam the Himalayas,"Hundreds of big projects are planned for the rivers that plunge from the roof of the world. Mr. Amrith is the author of the forthcoming book “Unruly Waters,” a history of how water has shaped South Asia. Along the banks of the Godavari River, near the city of Rajahmundry in the eastern India state of Andhra Pradesh, stands a museum built in the memory of Sir Arthur Thomas Cotton. As commissioner for irrigation there in the 1840s, Cotton brought water to Andhra’s parched lands, turning them into India’s rice bowl. An engineer in the East India Company’s army, he did this by restoring and expanding an ancient network of dams and canals along India’s great southern rivers: the Kaveri, the Krishna and the Godavari. Motivated by a belief that science would pave the way for rural capitalism, he envisaged a landscape transformed. And so it was. But his dreams didn’t stop with those projects. In the 1870s, Cotton proposed building a series of canals to connect Himalayan rivers to the southern tip of India and another to connect the Brahmaputra with the Yangtze through Assam and Yunnan. A stingy British colonial government dismissed his plans as unrealistic. Nearly 150 years later, the dream persists. It is like a ghost behind contemporary India’s plan to link some of its biggest rivers, at an estimated cost of nearly $90 billion. India is not alone in its ambitions. Hungry for energy and threatened by an acute shortage of fresh water, other Asian nations are competing to harness the power of the Himalayan rivers, on which more than half a billion people depend directly for sustenance. More than 400 dams are under construction, or planned for the coming decades, in Bhutan, India, Nepal and Pakistan; at least 100 more have been proposed across the Chinese border in Tibet. If the plans come to fruition, this will be one of the world’s most heavily dammed regions. But these projects will aggravate international tensions. They carry grave ecological risks. To understand why their backers cast caution aside, it helps to look to history. When India became independent in 1947, large dams promised to even out the vagaries of a monsoon climate that provides more than two-thirds of the country’s annual rainfall. These projects held out the prospect of increasing food production in a part of the world where the memory of famine still stung and where the partition of India from Pakistan left both countries feeling they had lost valuable agricultural land. For new Asian nations, these bold engineering projects symbolized their attainment of political freedom and embrace of modernity. When he surveyed the Bhakra Nangal Dam in 1956, India’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, declared that “these are the new temples of India, where I worship.” Dam building was a global obsession. In the 1950s, the World Bank began financing multipurpose water projects in the developing world that combined irrigation, power generation and flood control; by the end of the 20th century, the bank had lent billions of dollars to dam projects. American engineers roved the world selling their hydraulic expertise. So did their Soviet counterparts, who advised the enormous program of dam construction in Mao’s China. In that era, India and China sought to learn from each other. In 1954, two of India’s leading engineers embarked on a two-month tour of China’s water projects and found that the Chinese were working at a pace, and on a scale, that dwarfed India’s ambitions. India’s dam fever reached a peak in the 1970s and ’80s. Roughly half of the more than 3,500 large dams built in India from 1947 to 2000 were constructed between 1970 and 1989. The total number of large dams built in China after 1949 is estimated at more than 20,000. But the 1970s were also when the benefits of dams began to be questioned. In a landmark 1982 report, the pioneering environmentalist Anil Agarwal and his colleagues at New Delhi’s Center for Science and Environment highlighted the huge numbers of people displaced by water projects. It became a rallying cry for India’s environmental movement. And despite the sums spent on large dams, they contributed ever less to India’s irrigation as millions of farmers turned, instead, to exploiting groundwater through electrified pumps. This was a more readily accessible source of irrigation water at the command of individual farmers — at least those who could afford the pumps. Estimates for the number of people displaced by dams in India since 1947 vary from 16 million to 40 million. If these projects were inspired by dreams of equality, India’s large dams have instead entrenched some of the most intractable forms of inequality. Those most likely to be uprooted, and least likely to be compensated for their loss of land and livelihood and the rupture of their bonds of community, are marginalized indigenous communities. Even so, government leaders, engineers and private contractors remain wedded to the promise of large dams. The Himalayas are the next frontier. Until the 1980s, the upper reaches of the great Asian rivers appeared too remote and too expensive to engineer. New demands for water and electricity changed the calculus of costs and benefits. So did new infrastructure. From 1960 to 1980, the Himalayan nations built 6,200 miles of road in the region, making it more accessible for dam builders. The steep drops as the rivers descend from the mountains augment their hydropower potential. But the Himalayan projects are especially risky, for three reasons. The first is geopolitical. Taken together, the Himalayan rivers flow through at least 16 countries. In the absence of coordinated planning, dam building becomes a zero-sum game in which downstream users lose out. India fears the construction of a large dam on the Chinese side of the border would affect the flow of the Brahmaputra; Bangladesh, in turn, would bear the consequences of Indian dams on the same river. The potential for conflict looms. Major river systems originating in the Himalayas, where many countries are racing to build dams.

The Himalayan region contains an extraordinary concentration of biodiversity. An estimated 660 square miles of forest will be submerged or damaged by the planned dam projects. The snow leopard, the brown bear, the snow trout and the golden mahseer fish are among the threatened mountain species endangered by these plans. And the third relates to natural hazards. The dam projects are at risk of collapse from earthquakes in this seismically active region and of breach from flood bursts from glacial lakes upstream. The risks are likely to intensify with climate change as areas of the Himalayas warm faster than many other parts of the world. As the glaciers melt more quickly, the Himalayan rivers are projected initially to swell and then, by midcentury, to experience diminished flow. Ecologists and environmental campaigners charge that the new dam projects have not taken climate change adequately into account in their calculations of river flow, silt loads and energy potential. Dams also threaten to intensify flooding downstream during intense downpours when reservoirs overflow. At stake is not just the siting or approval of this or that dam — it is a whole worldview. Ramaswamy Iyer, India’s water resources secretary in the 1980s, was once a big supporter of dams, but toward the end of his life he turned skeptical. The fundamental problem he identified was the persistence of a “colonial” approach to water engineering, going back to the legacy of Arthur Cotton. It had bequeathed to India a Western tradition, to which Iyer had no objection, “but also the underlying Promethean attitude to nature,” which he viewed with suspicion. Are there viable alternatives? On a local level, there are. The journalist Meera Subramanian has reported on the restoration of arid Rajasthan’s water supply through an ecologically sensitive series of small dams. But is an agglomeration of small projects enough? Dam supporters invoke the scale of Asia’s energy needs, population and threatened water shortages to argue that only colossal solutions can work. Yet in India, as elsewhere in the region, the problems of both water and power are problems of their unequal distribution as much as of aggregate availability. There doesn’t need to be a binary choice between local solutions and coordination on a larger scale, especially if that coordination reaches beyond national borders. A spirit of caution, wedded to environmental impact assessments with more teeth, better coordinated between the federal and state levels, would help to avert the most flagrant environmental risks. A more open and democratic discussion of resettlement and compensation is needed to reckon honestly with who bears the costs of these schemes. Even minimal attention to the repair and restoration of existing dams, canals, pipes and power lines will lessen the number of dams needed, because large amounts of generated power, as well as irrigation water, are lost to leakage. Better regulation of groundwater use and a concerted policy of recharging depleted aquifers will do more for water security than large reservoirs. There are few reasons for optimism about international solutions to shared water problems in a region that is heavily militarized, and where many borders are contested. But countries in the region have much to gain in committing to transboundary water management. Support and pressure from civil society organizations can help. One area where they can be effective is in pushing for greater transparency of information in a context where data on river flow, for example, is guarded as a state secret. The Third Pole, a London- and New Delhi-based nonprofit focused on environmental threats in the Himalayas, has embarked on an ambitious project to make such data open source. These initiatives can build on foundations that already exist between scientists and activists who work across borders to address shared threats. Faced with the prospect of catastrophic climate change, we need to better understand the benefits and dangers of 20th-century ideas about harnessing great rivers before damming even more of them.

2018,The Rams Have Misplaced Their Magic. Have the Eagles Found Theirs?,"Eagles 30, Rams 23 The Rams were already behind by 10 on Sunday night when Jared Goff dropped back, looking to get his team back into a game against an Eagles squad it was expected to dominate. Instead, he stumbled, dropped the ball, gathered himself briefly and then threw an interception. It was a play that perfectly summed up the Rams’ performance for most of Sunday’s game, as Los Angeles looked thoroughly outclassed at home in a 30-23 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, a matchup they had entered as double-digit favorites. It was the second consecutive loss for the Rams (11-3), who have gone from being 9-0 with home-field advantage in the playoffs a virtual lock to hoping they can hold off the Chicago Bears to keep their first-round bye. The Eagles (7-7) kept the smallest sliver of hope of overtaking Dallas in the N.F.C. East, and they remain very much alive for a wild-card berth as they trail Minnesota by just percentage points for the conference’s final playoff spot. “It’s very satisfying,” Coach Doug Pederson of the Eagles said at his postgame news conference. “Our backs have been against the wall for the last few weeks. Hopefully this gives us momentum for the rest of the season. Our goals are still in front of us.” On Sunday, thanks to the hard work of the Eagles, nothing seemed to work for the Rams. Goff’s passes were regularly off the mark, and two were intercepted. Todd Gurley struggled to establish the run game. And Los Angeles’s defense, with so many stars, could not stand up to a Philadelphia offense that was being led by the backup Nick Foles. Things went so poorly for Los Angeles that even one of the team’s most reliable plays, a fake punt by the All-Pro Johnny Hekker, failed. His 7-yard throw to KhaDarel Hodge, initially ruled a first down, was overturned when it was revealed the ball had briefly touched the turf as Hodge gathered it to his chest. But it was Goff’s ugly interception that all but decided the game in Philadelphia’s favor. After the turnover, the Eagles offense got the ball at the Rams’ 12 and needed just two plays to score on a 2-yard run by Wendell Smallwood Jr., opening up a 17-point lead. “We are doing things that are uncharacteristic of us,” Coach Sean McVay said. “Guys are making decisions and mistakes we typically haven’t seen. This wasn’t good enough, and it’s a tough pill to swallow.” As much as things went wrong for Los Angeles, it all broke right for Philadelphia. With Foles starting at quarterback after Carson Wentz fractured a vertebra in his back, the team seemed energized. An interactive calculator that lets you explore every team’s path to the N.F.L. playoffs. Foles, continuing the strong connection he showed with Alshon Jeffery last year, completed 24 of 31 passes for 270 yards. The prime beneficiary was Jeffrey, who had eight catches for 160 yards, but the offense also got a solid contribution from Smallwood, who rushed for 48 yards and two touchdowns. In an on-field interview after the game, Foles, who took over from an injured Wentz and led his team to the Super Bowl title last year, did not play along when NBC’s Michelle Tafoya said the situation was starting to feel eerie. “Not trying to think about it,” Foles said. “Just trying to stay in the moment with this.” Smallwood was far more willing to entertain the comparison to last year, crediting Foles with keeping the team together in Wentz’s absence. “That’s a guy with true character,” Smallwood said of Foles. “We’re just comfortable with him back there. We don’t feel like anything has fallen off.” The Rams, who had a great start last year only to be overtaken by Philadelphia, were nowhere near the offensive juggernaut they appeared to be earlier in the season. They got 339 passing yards from Goff and 124 yards from scrimmage from Gurley, but they also had three turnovers, which was too much to handle with the team’s defense struggling. After falling behind by 30-13 in the third quarter, the Rams did mount a comeback attempt, with Gurley’s second rushing touchdown bringing the deficit down to just 7 points. But in the end, they had dug too deep of a hole for themselves and were unable to climb out. The last gasp of real hope came late in the fourth quarter when the Eagles were forced to punt, but JoJo Natson, trying to return the punt for Los Angeles, fumbled without even sustaining any contact. The Rams got a break when Jake Elliott missed a 53-yard field goal, and while Goff drove his team to Philadelphia’s 18, his final pass as time expired sailed well out of Josh Reynolds’s reach. After the game, Goff, well aware of the season beginning to spiral out of his control, tried to maintain some optimism about the team’s future. “It’s good to go through some adversity at some point,” Goff said. “Going through it now, and in the position we are in with the playoffs — we have to be urgent about getting these things fixed.” He then added, “These things are very fixable.”",The New York Times
2018,The Ravens’ Down-to-Earth Approach Is Unnerving the N.F.L.,"On Pro Football OWINGS MILLS, Md. — The Baltimore Ravens are the 7-6 team that absolutely no one in the N.F.L. wants to play in the postseason next month. In a copycat league, the defiant Ravens have become the feared, eccentric nonconformists — radical thinkers who make the rest of the league nervous and jumpy. With good reason. In the modern N.F.L., just about every team has made the passing game the principal focus of its offensive attack. Indeed, the deities of the league this season are quarterbacks, who routinely throw as many as 35 or 40 times a game. The high priest of the movement is Kansas City’s Pat Mahomes, who threw 53 passes last weekend against the Ravens. But about a month ago, Baltimore handed its starting quarterback job to Lamar Jackson, a rookie whose strength is running the football. Jackson had 26 carries and 119 rushing yards in his first game. Since then, the Ravens have become a 1970s throwback, running the football 60 percent of the time, or more, with Jackson leading the way. This iconoclastic strategy — it helps to also have the N.F.L.’s top-ranked defense — quickly produced a three-game Ravens win streak, which rescued the team’s season. And then, last weekend, in a featured, must-see game at Kansas City, the Ravens ran the football nearly 73 percent of the time in the first half, a stunning run/pass ratio for even a grind-it-out high school football team. The Ravens ended up outplaying Mahomes’s ascendant Chiefs for a good part of the game and had the lead late into the fourth quarter. Yes, Baltimore eventually lost by 3 points in overtime, but the result sent a thunderbolt through the rest of the league’s Super Bowl contenders, whose defensive coordinators simultaneously had the same thought: Wait, we might have to play these guys? And how far back do we have to go to find a defensive game plan for stopping a run-first team with a run-first quarterback? Or, as Tampa Bay Coach Dirk Koetter, whose team is the next Ravens opponent, said in the past week: “You can’t just reach down in your desk drawer and pull out the same defensive game plan from last week. This is a totally different deal. Totally.” Such angst is music to the ears of Baltimore Coach John Harbaugh, whose job seemed in jeopardy until Jackson became a starter in the wake of a hip injury to the longtime Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco in early November. Harbaugh relishes opponents feeling uncomfortable as they prepare for his team. “When a team sees our style for the first time and doesn’t have a chance to work on it all throughout the year, of course it’s going to be challenging for them,” Harbaugh said, with a smile. Here’s how committed Harbaugh is to the recent changes he has made. Flacco, an 11-year Baltimore veteran and a Super Bowl most valuable player, is healthy again this week. Harbaugh was not moved; on Wednesday he announced that he was sticking with Jackson. The overarching question is whether the Ravens’ new offensive approach can be sustained. In the past, other N.F.L. teams have prospered, at least for periods of time, with running quarterbacks at the helm. But the prospect of serious injury to the most pivotal offensive player always loomed. There is a reason the average career of a top N.F.L. running back is years shorter than that of the average quarterback. Those who make it their primary job to run the football take a merciless pounding. Michael Vick, a four-time Pro Bowler from 2002 to 2010, holds the N.F.L. record for most rushing yards by a quarterback. Asked Tuesday if Jackson can run the football as frequently as he has so far and still avoid injury, Vick said: “I don’t think you can keep that pace up for the long term. This is a desperate situation; the Ravens needed to stack up some wins to save the season. Lamar and the Ravens are doing whatever they can to get to the playoffs.” But Vick, now a Fox analyst, would not tell Jackson to change his approach. “His style is why they drafted him, and you can get hurt standing in the pocket, too,” Vick said. “And let’s remember that almost every quarterback in the league is running and trying to be mobile.” Still, Vick insisted that at some point you have to limit the exposure to big hits. “You just don’t want to accumulate too much punishment; it adds up,” he said. “When you tuck the ball and run upfield, the chance for injury probably goes up 25 percent. You don’t want to risk that too often.” On Wednesday, Harbaugh admitted that running the football 60 percent of the time was a bit much. “That’s a high number,” he said, but he added with a little grin: “Hey, it could get higher, though, you never know — the way we’re playing and the way games go.” Harbaugh continued: “In Baltimore, running the football has always been a big part of the Ravens and a big part of our personality, too.” Emphasizing the ground game has other advantages. It’s easy to mount longer drives, which keeps the defense on the sideline and rested. “Anyone who doesn’t understand that a ball-control offense helps the defense, doesn’t really know football,” Baltimore safety Eric Weddle said. “When a defense is on the field for 20 percent less time than it normally is, it’s obvious the defense is going to play better.” And the Ravens’ commitment to the run is not solely based on Jackson’s forays on run-pass option plays or designed runs. Baltimore is giving the football to its running backs more often, too. While Jackson’s 71 rushing yards led Baltimore against Kansas City, his teammates Gus Edwards and Kenneth Dixon ran for 67 yards and 59 yards. In fact, the Ravens’ dominant ground game has seemed to lift the morale of the entire Baltimore roster. Guard Alex Lewis insisted the offensive linemen are delighted to spend more of their time aggressively charging forward in run-blocking schemes instead of protectively pass-blocking. “It’s human nature to want to go forward instead of going backward,” Lewis said. “And a good running game means you’re winning the battle up front in the trenches. It also wears out the opposition. “Late in games, you can see it in their eyes. They’re gassed.” Vick, in fact, wondered if the Ravens aren’t trendsetters. “Maybe this could be something that transforms the game, where more teams go to a run-oriented style,” Vick said. “I think that would be really cool, man.” They are the unconventional, even radical 7-6 Baltimore Ravens. The end of their run might not be predictable or successful, but no one wants to play them in January.",The New York Times
2018,"The Real People Who Lobbied for Justice Reform: A Son, a Widow, an Expectant Mother","Some of the most effective lobbyists for the criminal justice bill now before Congress know the prison system intimately — because they have been locked up themselves, or have had loved ones behind bars. Their pitches are replete with details grounded in reality, from the scarcity of tampons in prison to the hardships of visiting a parent incarcerated hundreds of miles from home. They have written letters, appeared in videos, spoken at rallies and worked the corridors of power, sometimes at the invitation of the White House. They have visited one-on-one with powerful senators. Their lobbying helped win President Trump’s endorsement for the bill, which would reduce some sentences, expand anti-recidivism programs and improve conditions for inmates. And they have pressed Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, to allow a vote. [Read about how Senator Mitch McConnell finally agreed to bring the bill to the floor.] Many of the lobbying efforts were organized by the advocacy groups Families Against Mandatory Minimums, based in Washington, and #Cut50, based in California. Here are three of their stories: “Imagine with me: You’re about to turn 13, and your entire life you have to live knowing you may not see your dad for a really long time,” Kendall Williams said into a microphone at a rally in July outside the Capitol, on the eve of another birthday celebrated with only one of his parents. Kendall’s father, Keith Williams, is serving more than 22 years in prison after being accused of drug conspiracy, money laundering and gun possession. He has been imprisoned for all of Kendall’s life. An estimated 2.7 million American children have a parent in prison, a situation that is linked to higher rates of poverty, lower educational attainment and a host of other ills. “You eventually communicate with him, and build a relationship, but the more the relationship builds, the farther apart it feels you are,” Kendall said at the rally. “And eventually, all you want to do is give him a big hug, to comfort him and let him know that you still love him. But you can’t — because you’re 500 miles apart.” That day in Washington, traveling with his sister and his mother, Danielle Williams, was Kendall’s first visit to the capital from their home in Tuscaloosa, Ala. The family attended a session about how to lobby Congress before they went to see aides to Alabama’s senators about the criminal justice bill. “It’s so important for us, because we’re actually living it,” Ms. Williams said on Wednesday. “In no way are we saying our loved ones shouldn’t be incarcerated. We’re just asking that they have just sentencing, just treatment.” The bill’s provisions concerning credit for good behavior could advance her husband’s release date by several months. But in a telephone interview, Ms. Williams said her husband had expressed skepticism that anything would come of the efforts in Washington. “I think they get in this mode where it’s like nothing happens for so long that they think, ‘Will it make a difference?’” Ms. Williams said of inmates like her husband. In late November, Senator Doug Jones of Alabama became a co-sponsor of the bill. Ron Cupp was serving 17 years for his role in a Virginia drug ring when he was diagnosed with colon cancer. He asked for compassionate release, which is supposed to allow very sick or old prisoners to die at home, but it is granted very sparingly and approval can take months. He died at age 55, still waiting for an answer. Before his death, he extracted a vow from his wife, Debra: “Promise me, promise me that you’ll fight for this.” “And I said, ‘All right, buddy,’” she recalled. “That was the one thing I could do to really honor him.” Less than two years later, Ms. Cupp, 60, of Goodview, Va., walked Washington’s hallways and huddled with aides to her state’s two senators, who support the bill. “I’m not sure they really knew the impact that it makes on the families, and how much you have to go through sometimes,” Ms. Cupp said of the aides. “I just think they got to see it from a very personal level that they can’t get from reading an article.” Under the bill, prisoners with terminal illnesses could receive an in-person family visit within seven days of receiving their diagnosis, and the Bureau of Prisons would be required to process requests for compassionate release within two weeks of receiving them. Though Ms. Cupp said she had tried before her husband’s death to persuade lawmakers to intervene in his case, the rites and rituals of Washington lobbying were still largely new to her when she took her story to the Senate. Ms. Cupp, whose frustrations with the federal government still run deep, saw her hopes for quick legislative action fade — and then be revived again this week. When Pamela Winn, 50, of Atlanta, was taken to a privately managed prison to await trial on medical fraud charges, she was six weeks pregnant. She was given no prenatal care, she said, and was shackled when she was being transported, which kept her from being able to break her fall when she tripped trying to climb into a van. She said she requested medical attention, but there were significant delays, and she miscarried. A spokesman for the Geo Group, which runs the prison, said there were no grievances or other records that would substantiate her allegations. When Ms. Winn finally reached a hospital, she said, the nurse who treated her, unable to locate her fetus, asked for the linens that Ms. Winn had bled on — only to be told that the prison staff had discarded them. “It had to be the lowest point in my life, to think that my child, my baby, was thrown in the trash like nothing,” Ms. Winn said. Since serving her sentence, Ms. Winn, formerly a nurse, has become an advocate for banning the shackling of pregnant women. Though in 2008 the Bureau of Prisons greatly restricted shackling during labor and delivery, and in 2014 the use of restraints generally on pregnant inmates, those policies have not yet been enshrined in law. The criminal justice bill before Congress, known as the First Step Act, includes such a provision. In the spring, Ms. Winn was invited to the White House by Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and a proponent of criminal justice reform. “I’m going to tell you exactly when it was — we were there the day before, or two days before, Kim Kardashian went,” Ms. Winn said, referring to Ms. Kardashian West’s successful request for clemency for a 63-year-old woman imprisoned for a nonviolent drug offense. “I did speak to him directly about what had happened to me,” she said, referring to Mr. Kushner. “He said that he agreed with me, and he wasn’t aware that these things were happening — which is mostly what I get when I talk about what happened to me, that people aren’t aware that these things are going on.”",The New York Times
2018,The Real-Life Effects of Trump’s Environmental Rollbacks: 5 Takeaways From Our Investigation,"For nearly two years, President Trump has pursued an aggressive, far-reaching effort, lobbied for and cheered on by industry, to free American business from what he and many of his supporters view as excessive environmental regulation. The consequences are starting to play out in noticeable ways in communities across the United States. An investigation by The New York Times showed how Mr. Trump’s deregulatory policies are starting to have substantial impact on those who experience them close up — and often are economically dependent on the industries the president is trying to help. Here are five takeaways: President Barack Obama made protecting the environment a big part of his legacy. His administration, over eight years, carefully developed rules designed to clean up the environment, deter climate change and protect against dangerous chemicals. Many were completed in the final stretch of his presidency, often in ways that bypassed Congress. But industry consistently balked at those regulations, calling them an overreach, duplicative and unnecessary, unleashing a backlash that has informed Mr. Trump’s approach. So, with equal decisiveness, Mr. Trump has sought to undo his predecessor’s agenda by blocking, delaying and killing measures. The Trump administration cited its rollbacks as a victory and the fulfillment of a campaign promise. The rapid change in policy direction shows how both presidents used their expansive executive powers — but for very different outcomes. The early impacts of the Trump rollbacks are beginning to emerge across the country, from California to North Dakota, Texas and West Virginia. The Times visited the communities facing these changes, and found that local residents and business leaders are often divided. Some believe that the Obama administration went too far in imposing new environmental demands, while others worry that the changes the Trump administration is making will hurt their families, in particular their children. The geographic diversity of the places grappling with the trade-offs highlights how pervasive the connections are between natural resources, health and economic opportunity. In the vast farmlands of central California, day care centers have to take account of pesticide-spraying schedules. The local government’s revenues on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in North Dakota have grown to $330 million from $20 million over the last 15 years because of vast fossil fuel reserves that can now be pumped from the ground using fracking. National forests 400 miles away can be clouded with haze produced by a coal-fired power plant near Houston. No parts of the federal government during the Trump era have been more aggressive in rolling back rules than the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department, which between them regulate much of the intersection between the environment and the economy. Together their rule changes have touched nearly every aspect of environmental protection, including air pollution caused by power plants and the oil and gas industry, water pollution caused by coal mines, and toxic chemicals and pesticides used by farmers nationwide. In short, what is at stake is the quality of the air we breathe and the food we eat, the cleanliness of the rivers that flow past us, and the pace at which the climate is changing. Two years after Mr. Trump took office, the policy shifts are not nearly complete; dozens of other rules have been targeted for rollback. After decades of legislation and regulation, the environment in the United States continues to get cleaner. What has changed under Mr. Trump in most cases is the pace of improvement, which has been slowed in a number of key areas compared to what it would have been if the Obama rules had been preserved. If there is a single industry that has been at the center of the fight — both during the Obama expansion of rules and the Trump rollbacks — it is coal. Mr. Obama targeted the industry as a way to combat climate change. Mr. Trump has defended and promoted it as part of his populist political and economic strategy. Mr. Trump’s approach has been to slow demands for further steps to curb air and water pollution caused by coal-burning power plants. The tug-of-war involves coal mines as well, which were ordered by Mr. Obama to take steps to help clean thousands of miles of rivers and streams, only to be told by Mr. Trump that these measures were no longer necessary. What has not changed is the decline of coal — both coal mines and coal-burning power plants. Even as Mr. Trump has used his executive powers to help the industry, coal production in the United States continues to decline. As the Energy Department announced this month, the country’s coal consumption for 2018 is “expected to be the lowest in 39 years.” The decline is mostly a result of power plants shifting away from burning coal. At the core of the fight between environmentalists and the Trump administration is a debate over a simple question: How much improvement is enough? By some measures — such as overall emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, two major air pollutants that cause smoke and haze and a variety of health ailments — environmental quality in the United States has continued to improve in the Trump era. That is in large part because of the rapid closure of more coal-burning power plants. But the pace of those declines would almost certainly have been greater had Obama-era policies continued. So what is happening in the United States is a slowing of the pace of progress — not a return to the era, before the E.P.A. was created in 1970, where a river in Ohio caught fire. Another factor is that environmental change happens slowly. So the real impact of the Trump-era policies may not be fully apparent until years after Mr. Trump leaves office.",The New York Times

INVISIBLE The Forgotten Story of the Black Woman Lawyer Who Took Down America’s Most Powerful Mobster By Stephen L. Carter Illustrated. 364 pp. Henry Holt & Company. $30. “It is the curse of historians … to judge the past by the norms of the present.” Stephen L. Carter, a Yale Law School professor and the author of, among many other works, the novels “The Emperor of Ocean Park” and “New England White,” has good reason to make this blunt judgment early in his latest book, which is devoted to his grandmother Eunice Hunton Carter. Her privileged life and her career as a prosecutor constitute a more complicated narrative than the one contemporary readers may expect of an African-American woman who lived during the first half of the 20th century. Eunice Carter died in 1970, when Stephen was in high school; he remembers her as “a stern and intimidating woman of advanced years.” But in “Invisible,” which is as much a biography as a reconstruction, Carter has a more urgent mission than retrieving fond family memories: He is explaining, with success and with the clarity of distance, why Eunice was such an extraordinary figure. Her existence so defies retrospective wisdom that when a heavily fictionalized version appeared briefly on the HBO series “Boardwalk Empire” it prompted incredulous, mocking comments charging that the character — a black woman prosecutor, in large part responsible for the arrest and conviction of a Lucky Luciano-like mobster — was pure anachronistic fantasy. But she wasn’t. Eunice Carter did spearhead the strategy that brought down Luciano in 1936, reasoning correctly that prostitution rackets in Harlem, and how they were organized, might be the means of achieving his downfall. Carter was only the second woman in the history of Smith College to receive a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in four years; she graduated from Fordham Law School, started her own practice and joined the New York City special prosecutor’s office run by Thomas E. Dewey. She was the only woman and the only African-American among Dewey’s hires, brought in, according to one historian, for “her command of Harlem pool halls as well as Albany committee rooms.” Carter likely drew inspiration from her parents, William and Addie Hunton. Brilliant and accomplished, they traveled widely as key early figures in the Y.M.C.A. Eunice and her younger brother grew up, in large part, away from each other and from their parents — she was, according to family lore, “their father’s favorite,” despite years of separation — though they did spend a formative year and a half together in Germany with Addie. (Their journey home to America landed their mother in some trouble when the white woman traveling with them was detained, not realizing what a segregated world awaited them.) African-American newspapers lauded Eunice’s professional accomplishments as a prosecutor and public figure, noting her success working with Dewey with particular pride, but they were perhaps even more interested in covering her personal life. The Chicago Defender described her wedding to Lisle Carter, a successful dentist, as “a very impressive ceremony” and “the topic of discussion among society folk.” Just a year earlier, she had been a bridesmaid at the most important social event in Harlem, the wedding of Madame C. J. Walker’s granddaughter. Carter’s upward career climb was especially impressive in that overt racism didn’t thwart her choices. But she could never quite escape its noxious hold on American society, whether it was being paid far less than her white male peers on Dewey’s staff or being passed over, in favor of a rival, for a prestigious judicial appointment. Most personally painful, however, was her brother’s fervent belief in communism, which landed him in prison at the height of McCarthyism and led her to realize that her career had reached not a glass ceiling but a glass cliff. Carter’s portrayal of his grandmother is full of love and admiration, though it sometimes tips into overt speculation about her thoughts and emotions (“although Eunice was known for her poker face, she would not have been human had she not chafed at her exclusion”). Mercifully, “Invisible” escapes hagiography in favor of cleareyed portraiture, even when matters don’t fit comfortably into it. This is especially true when Carter chronicles the fissures in her marriage (including the possibility of a long-running affair with the jazz musician Fletcher Henderson) and the deep estrangement between Eunice and her brother, which was not fully repaired by the time both died, within 10 days of each other. A keen sense of loss permeates the book, grief for a ruptured family whose members could not be reconciled. “Invisible” is not only a personal restoration project; it’s the reclamation of a key figure in recent American history whose accomplishments “beat ceaselessly against the artificial but nearly impregnable barriers that whiteness built.” Eunice Hunton Carter’s story is a reminder, in her grandson’s words, that “if you listen with the ears of history and optimism, you can hear the inner supports” of those barriers “starting to slip.” Above all, it proves that one can’t shoehorn lives like Eunice’s into bite-size stories of triumph. Struggle demands nuance. Truthful narratives demand complexity. Stephen L. Carter has revived his grandmother’s voice when we most need it, and with utmost urgency.",The New York Times
2018,"The Redskins Aren’t Very Good on the Field. Off It, They’re Even Worse.","On Pro Football When negotiations to keep the federal government open through Christmas collapsed last week, so did the latest attempt to build a new N.F.L. stadium in Washington. The federal government is perhaps the rare entity in the nation’s capital that is more dysfunctional than the region’s pro football team. At 7-8, Washington will miss the playoffs for the 15th time in the 20 seasons since Dan Snyder bought the team in 1999. Alex Smith, the 34-year-old quarterback the Redskins signed for $111 million this off-season, fractured his tibia and fibula in November, then spent a month in the hospital fighting off an infection. The team’s current quarterback is Josh Johnson, who had last started a game in 2011 before taking over for Mark Sanchez — who had last started a game in 2015 — in Week 15. With precious little salary cap room, next year’s outlook on the field isn’t any rosier. But it is also the constant self-inflicted, off-the-field controversies and indignities that have drained many fans in Washington of any enthusiasm they once had for the team. “The fan base is just worn down, frustrated, completely fed up with the front office,” said Eric Bickel, a longtime fan and host of the “Sports Junkies” morning radio show in the area. “This was once a proud, heritage-filled franchise. There is a large percentage of the population here that has no experience with that.” This year has been more of the same. In May, The New York Times reported on the increasingly risqué and uncomfortable work environment for Washington Redskins cheerleaders. They had been sent to events that included a booze-filled outing on the yacht of a season-ticket holder; sponsors and ticket holders had been invited to a photo shoot in which cheerleaders were topless; and cheerleaders felt they had been forced to accompany sponsors to a nightclub. After an internal investigation, the team implemented a number of changes in its cheerleading program, though two former cheerleaders said it wasn’t nearly enough to eliminate a culture of harassment. Then in November, after the San Francisco 49ers released linebacker Reuben Foster following his third arrest of the year — his second on domestic violence charges — Washington was reportedly the only team to put in a waiver claim for him. The team offered shifting explanations to an exasperated fan base about how much due diligence it had done on Foster. Doug Williams, the senior vice president of player personnel, said the team had had a number of conversations with Washington players who had been teammates of Foster’s at Alabama. But two of the five former Alabama players on the Redskins roster said they had not talked to the front office. In a radio interview, Williams played down Foster’s legal problems. Afterward, he apologized to the team and “especially the ladies of this area and across the country” without specifying what he was apologizing for. The team also did not contact the police in the Tampa area — the site of Foster’s most recent arrest — to find out more about what he had been accused of. In the latest example of Washington’s off-field problems, safety Montae Nicholson was arrested this month and charged with assault. Video of the incident seemed to show Nicholson knocking a man out cold. Tony Wyllie, a spokesman for the team, declined to make Snyder or any executives available for an interview for this article. Whether because of the team’s lackluster play on the field or the constant embarrassments off it, fans are staying away. The team used to claim that it had over 200,000 fans on a season ticket waiting list. But before this season, it announced that there was no season ticket waiting list, and over the last several years the Redskins have ripped about 10,000 seats out of FedEx Field, their home in suburban Maryland. Entering their final home game of the season, on Sunday against the Eagles, Washington averaged fewer than 61,000 fans, 27th in the N.F.L. FedEx Field has been only 74 percent full this season, the lowest percentage in the league. Fans aren’t particularly motivated to watch at home, either: The team’s local television rating ranks 22nd in the league. All of this is happening as the team is trying to replace FedEx Field, which is just 21 years old, newer than the stadiums of 10 N.F.L. teams. The only location within Washington that makes any sense for a new home is the site of Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, simply referred to locally as R.F.K., where the team played for 35 years until 1996. The site is on land owned by the National Park Service, which has leased it through 2038 to Events DC, a quasi-public organization that manages several Washington sports sites. Building a stadium that the team would play in for the next few decades would require either that the District of Columbia government own the site, or a longer lease. This month, The Washington Post reported that team and District of Columbia officials were attempting to have a provision added to the federal funding bill that would have extended the lease to 99 years. But a number of powerful lawmakers have objected to both the plans and the team’s name, which many consider a racist slur, and the efforts died along with the funding bill. Events DC doesn’t seem to be excited to get the team back. “At Events DC, we remain agnostic regarding which long-term anchor scenario may occur on the site and are instead prioritizing the short-term development program — currently: multipurpose recreational fields,” Gregory O’Dell, the president and chief executive of Events DC, said in a statement. In the meantime, Larry Hogan, the governor of Maryland, has been negotiating a land swap with the Department of the Interior to secure a new stadium site and keep the team in Maryland. He told reporters that the team would have to pay for construction of its stadium, however. “We are not going to build a billionaire’s stadium, either,” Hogan said. None of this — poor play, muddled stadium plans, off-field controversies — is anything new. Things were bad enough back in 2010 that Washington City Paper, the local alternative weekly, published an article about Snyder that it billed as “an encyclopedia of the owner’s many failings.” They included selling bags of expired airline peanuts to fans, firing a beloved announcer and suing a 73-year-old grandmother and season ticket holder. Snyder later sued City Paper and the article’s author, Dave McKenna, before dropping his suit. Washington last won a Super Bowl in 1991 and has not won a playoff game since the 2005 season. Since Snyder took over, the team is 139-179-1 and has not won more than 10 games in a season. “The only time really where there was a sense of peace and somewhat harmony was the Joe Gibbs Two era,” Bickel said, referring to Gibbs’s second stint as head coach, from 2004 to 2007. “And while it wasn’t overly successful, Joe did bring a calmness and a stability to the franchise that they didn’t have.” Forget winning. At this point, Washington fans are nostalgic for a time free of the tumult of bad headlines and constant embarrassments. They might be waiting for a while.",The New York Times
2018,The Relentlessness of Modern Parenting,"Raising children has become significantly more time-consuming and expensive, amid a sense that opportunity has grown more elusive. Parenthood in the United States has become much more demanding than it used to be. Over just a couple of generations, parents have greatly increased the amount of time, attention and money they put into raising children. Mothers who juggle jobs outside the home spend just as much time tending their children as stay-at-home mothers did in the 1970s. [Coming soon: A newsletter for parents with evidence-based guidance and personal stories for a transformed life with kids. Sign up to get NYT Parenting in your inbox every week.] The amount of money parents spend on children, which used to peak when they were in high school, is now highest when they are under 6 and over 18 and into their mid-20s. Renée Sentilles enrolled her son Isaac in lessons beginning when he was an infant. Even now that he’s 12, she rarely has him out of sight when he is home. “I read all the child-care books,” said Ms. Sentilles, a professor in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. “I enrolled him in piano at 5. I took him to soccer practices at 4. We tried track; we did all the swimming lessons, martial arts. I did everything. Of course I did.” While this kind of intensive parenting — constantly teaching and monitoring children — has been the norm for upper-middle-class parents since the 1990s, new research shows that people across class divides now consider it the best way to raise children, even if they don’t have the resources to enact it. There are signs of a backlash, led by so-called free-range parents, but social scientists say the relentlessness of modern-day parenting has a powerful motivation: economic anxiety. For the first time, it’s as likely as not that American children will be less prosperous than their parents. For parents, giving children the best start in life has come to mean doing everything they can to ensure that their children can climb to a higher class, or at least not fall out of the one they were born into. “As the gap between rich and poor increases, the cost of screwing up increases,” said Philip Cohen, a sociologist at the University of Maryland who studies families and inequality. “The fear is they’ll end up on the other side of the divide.” But it also stokes economic anxiety, because even as more parents say they want to raise children this way, it’s the richest ones who are most able to do so. “Intensive parenting is a way for especially affluent white mothers to make sure their children are maintaining their advantaged position in society,” said Jessica Calarco, a sociologist at Indiana University and author of “Negotiating Opportunities: How the Middle Class Secures Advantages in School.” Stacey Jones raised her two sons, now in their 20s, as a single mother in a working-class, mostly black neighborhood in Stone Mountain, Ga. She said she and other parents tried hard to give their children opportunities by finding affordable options: municipal sports leagues instead of traveling club teams and school band instead of private music lessons. “I think most people have this craving for their children to do better and know more than they do,” said Ms. Jones, who works in university communications. “But a lot of these opportunities were closed off because they do cost money.” “Parent” as a verb gained widespread use in the 1970s, which is also when parenting books exploded. The 1980s brought helicopter parenting, a movement to keep children safe from physical harm, spurred by high-profile child assaults and abductions (despite the fact that they were, and are, exceedingly rare). Intensive parenting was first described in the 1990s and 2000s by social scientists including Sharon Hays and Annette Lareau. It grew from a major shift in how people saw children. They began to be considered vulnerable and moldable — shaped by their early childhood experiences — an idea bolstered by advances in child development research. The result was a parenting style that was “child-centered, expert-guided, emotionally absorbing, labor intensive and financially expensive,” Ms. Hays wrote in her 1998 book, “The Cultural Contradictions of Motherhood.” And mothers were the ones expected to be doing the constant cultivation. The time parents spend in the presence of their children has not changed much, but parents today spend more of it doing hands-on child care. Time spent on activities like reading to children; doing crafts; taking them to lessons; attending recitals and games; and helping with homework has increased the most. Today, mothers spend nearly five hours a week on that, compared with 1 hour 45 minutes hours in 1975 — and they worry it’s not enough. Parents’ leisure time, like exercising or socializing, is much more likely to be spent with their children than it used to be. While fathers have recently increased their time spent with children, mothers still spend significantly more. Ms. Sentilles’s mother, Claire Tassin, described a very different way of parenting when her two children were young, in the 1970s. “My job was not to entertain them,” said Ms. Tassin, who lives in Vacherie, La. “My job was to love them and discipline them.” Of her grandchildren, Isaac and his three cousins, she said: “Their life is much more enriched than mine was, but it definitely has been directed. I’m not saying it doesn’t work. They’re amazing. But I know I felt free, so free as a child. I put on my jeans and my cowboy boots and I played outside all day long.” “My job was not to entertain them. My job was to love them and discipline them.” Claire Tassin, 75 “There’s this sense that something is wrong with you if you aren’t with your children every second when you’re not at work.” Renée Sentilles, 52 The new trappings of intensive parenting are largely fixtures of white, upper-middle-class American culture, but researchers say the expectations have permeated all corners of society, whether or not parents can achieve them. It starts in utero, when mothers are told to avoid cold cuts and coffee, lest they harm the baby. Then: video baby monitors. Homemade baby food. Sugar-free birthday cake. Toddler music classes. Breast-feeding exclusively. Spraying children’s hands with sanitizer and covering them in “natural” sunscreen. Throwing Pinterest-perfect birthday parties. Eating lunch in their children’s school cafeterias. Calling employers after their adult children interview for jobs. The American Academy of Pediatrics promotes the idea that parents should be constantly monitoring and teaching children, even when the science doesn’t give a clear answer about what’s best. It now recommends that babies sleep in parents’ rooms for a year. Children’s television — instead of giving parents the chance to cook dinner or have an adult conversation — is to be “co-viewed” for maximum learning. At the same time, there has been little increase in support for working parents, like paid parental leave, subsidized child care or flexible schedules, and there are fewer informal neighborhood networks of at-home parents because more mothers are working. Ms. Sentilles felt the lack of support when it became clear that Isaac had some challenges like anxiety and trouble sleeping. She and her ex-husband changed their work hours and coordinated tutors and therapists. “Friends are constantly texting support, but no one has time,” she said. “It’s that we’re all doing this at the same time.” Parenthood is more hands-off in many other countries. In Tokyo, children start riding the subway alone by first grade, and in Paris, they spend afternoons unaccompanied at playgrounds. Intensive parenting has gained popularity in England and Australia, but it has distinctly American roots — reflecting a view of child rearing as an individual, not societal, task. It’s about “pulling yourself up by your bootstraps,” said Caitlyn Collins, a sociologist at Washington University in St. Louis whose book, “Making Motherhood Work: How Women Manage Careers and Caregiving,” comes out in February. “It distracts from the real questions, like why don’t we have a safe place for all kids to go when they’re done with school before parents get home from work?” In a new paper, Patrick Ishizuka surveyed a nationally representative group of 3,642 parents about parenting. Regardless of their education, income or race, they said the most hands-on and expensive choices were best. For example, they said children who were bored after school should be enrolled in extracurricular activities, and that parents who were busy should stop their task and draw with their children if asked. “Intensive parenting has really become the dominant cultural model for how children should be raised,” said Mr. Ishizuka, a postdoctoral fellow studying gender and inequality at Cornell. Americans are having fewer children, so they have more time and money to invest in each one. But investment gaps between parents of differing incomes were not always so large. As a college degree became increasingly necessary to earn a middle-class wage and as admissions grew more competitive, parents began spending significantly more time on child care, found Valerie Ramey and Garey Ramey, economists at the University of California, San Diego. Parents also began spending more money on their children for things like preschools and enrichment activities, Sabino Kornrich, a sociologist at Emory, showed in two recent papers. Rich parents have more to spend, but the share of income that poor parents spend on their children has also grown. In states with the largest gaps between the rich and the poor, rich parents spend an even larger share of their incomes on things like lessons and private school, found Danny Schneider, a sociologist at the University of California, Berkeley, and colleagues in a May paper. Parents in the middle 50 percent of incomes have also increased their spending. “Lower socioeconomic status parents haven’t been able to keep up,” he said. Besides having less money, they have less access to the informal conversations in which parents exchange information with other parents like them. Ms. Jones recalled that one of her sons liked swimming, but it wasn’t until he was in high school that she learned about swim teams on which he could have competed. “I didn’t know because I don’t live in a swim tennis community,” she said. “Unfortunately colleges and universities tend to look at these things as a marker of achievement, and I feel like a lot of kids who have working-class backgrounds don’t benefit from the knowledge.” Race influences parents’ concerns, too. Ms. Jones said that as a parent of black boys, she decided to raise them in a mostly black neighborhood so they would face less racism, even though it meant driving farther to many activities. This is common for middle-class black mothers, found Dawn Dow, a sociologist at the University of Maryland whose book, “Mothering While Black: Boundaries and Burdens of Middle-Class Parenthood,” comes out in February. “They’re making decisions to protect their kids from early experiences of racism,” Ms. Dow said. “It’s a different host of concerns that are equally intensive.” Experts agree that investing in children is a positive thing — they benefit from time with their parents, stimulating activities and supportive parenting styles. As low-income parents have increased the time they spend teaching and reading to their children, the readiness gap between kindergarten students from rich and poor families has shrunk. As parental supervision has increased, most serious crimes against children have declined significantly. But it’s also unclear how much of children’s success is actually determined by parenting. “It’s still an open question whether it’s the parenting practices themselves that are making the difference, or is it simply growing up with college-educated parents in an environment that’s richer in many dimensions?” said Liana Sayer, a sociologist at the University of Maryland and director of the Time Use Laboratory there. “I don’t think any of these studies so far have been able to answer whether these kids would be doing well as adults regardless, simply because of resources.” There has been a growing movement against the relentlessness of modern-day parenting. Utah passed a free-range parenting law, exempting parents from accusations of neglect if they let their children play or commute unattended. Psychologists and others have raised alarms about children’s high levels of stress and dependence on their parents, and the need to develop independence, self-reliance and grit. Research has shown that children with hyper-involved parents have more anxiety and less satisfaction with life, and that when children play unsupervised, they build social skills, emotional maturity and executive function. Parents, particularly mothers, feel stress, exhaustion and guilt at the demands of parenting this way, especially while holding a job. American time use diaries show that the time women spend parenting comes at the expense of sleep, time alone with their partners and friends, leisure time and housework. Some pause their careers or choose not to have children. Others, like Ms. Sentilles, live in a state of anxiety. She doesn’t want to hover, she said. But trying to oversee homework, limit screen time and attend to Isaac’s needs, she feels no choice. “At any given moment, everything could just fall apart,” she said. “On the one hand, I love my work,” she said. “But the way it’s structured in this country, where there’s not really child care and there’s this sense that something is wrong with you if you aren’t with your children every second when you’re not at work? It isn’t what I think feminists thought they were signing up for.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Republican Assault on Democracy,"letter The sociologist Todd Gitlin says the rollback has been going on for decades. To the Editor: Re “The G.O.P. Goes Full Authoritarian” (column, Dec. 11): Paul Krugman is demonstrably right that “the G.O.P. is an authoritarian party in waiting” and that “the G.O.P., as currently constituted, is willing to do whatever it takes to seize and hold power.” But not just currently. Rollbacks of democracy have been central to Republican rule for the better part of two decades. The Republicans’ contempt for democracy was enthroned when their Supreme Court majority overrode Florida’s legal election procedures to install George W. Bush as president in 2000. Ohio’s Republican secretary of state, Kenneth Blackwell, was already carrying out ballot restrictions in 2004. In the years since, with the spread of Republican control in the states and the Supreme Court’s rollback of federal voting rights in Shelby County v. Holder (2013), voter purges, minority vote suppression and extreme gerrymandering have accelerated. The G.O.P. has needed no lessons from Viktor Orban, Hungary’s dictator. The Republican Party hasn’t been waiting. It’s been speeding. Todd GitlinNew YorkThe writer is a professor of journalism and sociology at Columbia University.",The New York Times
2018,The Return of Bleecker Street,"A once-luxe stretch of the West Village that, until recently, was pocked with empty storefronts, is starting to return to its old glory. “Did you ever see ‘Gilmore Girls’?” said Rachelle Hruska MacPherson, the founder of Lingua Franca, an Instagram-born line of cashmere sweaters, hand-stitched with punchy and political sayings like “booyah” and “i miss barack.” Ms. MacPherson was seated in a sunny corner of Bonberi Bodega, a wellness blog turned health food market adjacent to her own store on Bleecker Street, both of which opened earlier this fall. “This street reminds me of that show,” she said, waving to a passer-by outside. “A small town that’s full of cool, vibrant people doing interesting things.” Yes, Bleecker Street — specifically the quaint, five-block stretch in the West Village that until very recently was so pockmarked with empty storefronts that it was described in The New York Times as looking like “a Rust Belt city” — is alive and kicking, once again. Gone are the big-name luxury labels like Marc Jacobs, Michael Kors and Ralph Lauren. The last of the bunch, Brunello Cucinelli, closed its doors in October. In their stead are young, digitally native brands, many of them run by women. Aside from Lingua Franca and Bonberi, there is Hill House Home, Margaux, the Daily Edit, St. Frank, Huckberry, Naadam, Slightly Alabama and Buck Mason. They are a well-curated mix of small brands with big ideas, and beloved online customer bases, eager to experience them in real life. This was exactly the thinking of Brookfield Properties, the real estate company behind Brookfield Place, the commercial complex in Lower Manhattan. Last April, after exorbitant rents and a dearth of shoppers had driven out most of the businesses along an expanse of Bleecker, Brookfield bought four retail properties with seven storefronts, and immediately set to work rethinking the landscape. “Bleecker was never meant to be Fifth Avenue 2.0,” said Sara Fay, the vice president for marketing at Brookfield Properties. “We wanted brands with a social media following that they could leverage, and continue their engagement with.” With the help of the creative strategy firm Skylight, Brookfield brought in Lingua Franca, Bonberi, Slightly Alabama (an online leather accessories label) and Prabal Gurung (the lone traditional fashion house) and worked out short-term lease agreements as well as revenue shares, the specifics of which remain undisclosed. Hill House Home, a bedding and bath line that led the way, was not part of the Brookfield plan. The line opened its bricks-and-mortar space at 395 Bleecker Street just over a year ago on a leap of faith. Back then, the block was pretty bare, save for Magnolia Bakery and Bookmarc, the last vestige of Marc Jacobs’s six-shop empire. “Almost everyone was like, ‘Don’t do this,’” said Nell Diamond, its founder. But she lived in the West Village and loved Bleecker Street, and in touring its vacant spaces she found that rents had dropped from their late-2000s high of $500 to $600 per square foot to $200 to $300. And despite the dire landscape, she did not believe retail was dead. “Bad retail is dead,” said Ms. Diamond, whose business has grown fast since its introduction in 2016, buoyed by a new generation of shoppers. Instagram has been especially important. “That’s basically where all the magic happens for us,” she said, noting that she conducts polls on Insta Stories before offering products like $88 white Turkish cotton towel sets debossed with the words “Soap” and “Water,” released last month. Her store, as she sees it, is like a community center, where customers can not only feel the product, but also discover “test” items like the cotton nightgowns she is thinking about offering in the spring. There are also artisanal designs from other small brands, like Paul Arnhold’s handblown glassware and Ann Marie Murray’s porcelain boxes hand-painted with “LOL.” Customers may even witness a broadcast of Ms. Diamond’s weekly podcast, “One Quick Thing,” about women and work. And they will be welcome at her book club, which she plans to start in the new year. “The store is important for a million aspects,” Ms. Diamond said. “The last of which is sales.” Such is a common chorus among her new neighbors, most of whom rely mainly on online sales and so are able to use their jewel-box spaces for feel-good projects and happenings. “Our followers want something more than what we’re selling,” said Nicole Berrie, the founder of Bonberi, at 384 Bleecker. In addition to charcoal toothpaste, gingham shopping totes from Trademark and her cultish “dulse Caesar salad,” Ms. Berrie has been holding an evening talk series called Wellness Wednesdays. Featured guests have included the green skin-care expert Tata Harper and the colonics guru Gil Jacobs. Since opening Lingua Franca, at 382 Bleecker, on election night, Ms. MacPherson has had Jessica Yellin, a former CNN reporter, conduct the news (via Lingua Franca’s Insta Stories) from the store’s couch, and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has signed copies of her new children’s book, “Bold & Brave.” Earlier this week, Ms. MacPherson released a sweater collaboration with Focus Features for its Ruth Bader Ginsburg biopic, “On the Basis of Sex,” which opens on Christmas Day. A portion of the sales of the sweaters, which say, “all rise,” will be donated to the American Civil Liberties Union’s women’s projects. “The stores that are opening up all have strong values — they’re adding something meaningful — and that makes people want to shop,” said Matthew Scanlan, a founder of Naadam, a three-year-old online knitwear company that offers cashmere clothes responsibly sourced from, and manufactured in, Mongolia. Spurred by news of Brookfield’s takeover, he opened his store at 392 Bleecker Street in September. “It’s such a beautiful street,” Mr. Scanlan said. “It just needed the right retail.” Stocked with $75 cashmere sweaters (hot tip: a new batch of olive, oatmeal and ginger-colored ones arrived this week) and hot cocoa on the weekends, the store has been doing brisk business. “Way above what we projected,” he said. Making Naadam feel all the more cozy is its congenial relationship with other brands on the block. Lingua Franca has long used its sweaters, and Huckberry, a men’s shopping website that opened its store at 383 Bleecker Street a month ago, sells them. “When they do well, we do well,” Mr. Scanlan said. That kind of connective tissue exists among many of the brands, giving the street an even greater sense of community. Before Margaux, a ballet slipper label started by Alexa Buckley and Sarah Pierson, opened its doors at 387 Bleecker Street in July, Hill House Home held a trunk show for the line. St. Frank, an online home goods store at 373 Bleecker Street that works with artisans all over their world, helping to sustain their craft, collaborated with Lingua Franca on a collection of pillows. Bonberi provided Hill House Home with its Drink the Sun green juice for an event. And Cynthia Rowley, the self-described O.G. of the block, having been there since 2005, sold Lingua Franca sweaters in her store when the label was introduced. “It’s super-exciting what’s going on now,” said Ms. Rowley. She was devastated when her designer friends closed shop, she said, and her hope is for at least one of them to return: “My dream would be for Marc Jacobs to come back, with his grunge collection.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Return of Paganism,"Maybe there actually is a genuinely post-Christian future for America. Opinion Columnist Here are some generally agreed-upon facts about religious trends in the United States. Institutional Christianity has weakened drastically since the 1960s. Lots of people who once would have been lukewarm Christmas-and-Easter churchgoers now identify as having “no religion” or being “spiritual but not religious.” The mainline-Protestant establishment is an establishment no more. Religious belief and practice now polarizes our politics in a way they didn’t a few generations back. What kind of general religious reality should be discerned from all these facts, though, is much more uncertain, and there are various plausible stories about what early-21st century Americans increasingly believe. The simplest of these is the secularization story — in which modern societies inevitably put away religious ideas as they advance in wealth and science and reason, and the decline of institutional religion is just a predictable feature of a general late-modern turn away from supernatural belief. But the secularization narrative is insufficient, because even with America’s churches in decline, the religious impulse has hardly disappeared. In the early 2000s, over 40 percent of Americans answered with an emphatic “yes” when Gallup asked them if “a profound religious experience or awakening” had redirected their lives; that number had doubled since the 1960s, when institutional religion was more vigorous. A recent Pew survey on secularization likewise found increases in the share of Americans who have regular feelings of “spiritual peace and well-being.” And the resilience of religious impulses and rhetoric in contemporary political movements, even (or especially) on the officially secular left, is an obvious feature of our politics. [Never be uninteresting. Read the most thought-provoking, funny, delightful and raw stories from The New York Times Opinion section.] So perhaps instead of secularization it makes sense to talk about the fragmentation and personalization of Christianity — to describe America as a nation of Christian heretics, if you will, in which traditional churches have been supplanted by self-help gurus and spiritual-political entrepreneurs. These figures cobble together pieces of the old orthodoxies, take out the inconvenient bits and pitch them to mass audiences that want part of the old-time religion but nothing too unsettling or challenging or ascetic. The result is a nation where Protestant awakenings have given way to post-Protestant wokeness, where Reinhold Niebuhr and Fulton Sheen have ceded pulpits to Joel Osteen and Oprah Winfrey, where the prosperity gospel and Christian nationalism rule the right and a social gospel denuded of theological content rules the left. I wrote a whole book on this theme, but in the years since it came out I’ve wondered if it, too, was incomplete. There has to come a point at which a heresy becomes simply post-Christian, a moment when you should just believe people who claim they have left the biblical world-picture behind, a context where the new spiritualities add up to a new religion. Which is why lately I’ve become interested in books and arguments that suggest that there actually is, or might be, a genuinely post-Christian future for America — and that the term “paganism” might be reasonably revived to describe the new American religion, currently struggling to be born. A fascinating version of this argument is put forward by Steven D. Smith, a law professor at the University of San Diego, in his new book, “Pagans and Christians in the City: Culture Wars From the Tiber to the Potomac.” Smith argues that much of what we understand as the march of secularism is something of an illusion, and that behind the scenes what’s actually happening in the modern culture war is the return of a pagan religious conception, which was half-buried (though never fully so) by the rise of Christianity. What is that conception? Simply this: that divinity is fundamentally inside the world rather than outside it, that God or the gods or Being are ultimately part of nature rather than an external creator, and that meaning and morality and metaphysical experience are to be sought in a fuller communion with the immanent world rather than a leap toward the transcendent. This paganism is not materialist or atheistic; it allows for belief in spiritual and supernatural realities. It even accepts the possibility of an afterlife. But it is deliberately agnostic about final things, what awaits beyond the shores of this world, and it is skeptical of the idea that there exists some ascetic, world-denying moral standard to which we should aspire. Instead, it sees the purpose of religion and spirituality as more therapeutic, a means of seeking harmony with nature and happiness in the everyday — while unlike atheism, it insists that this everyday is divinely endowed and shaped, meaningful and not random, a place where we can truly hope to be at home. In popular religious practice there isn’t always a clean line between this “immanent” religion and the transcendent alternative offered by Christianity and Judaism. But clearly religious cultures can tend toward one option or the other, and you can build a plausible case for a “pagan” (by Smith’s definition) tradition in Western and American religion, which in his account takes two major forms. First, there is a tradition of intellectual and aesthetic pantheism that includes figures like Spinoza, Nietzsche, Emerson and Whitman, and that’s manifest in certain highbrow spiritual-but-not-religious writers today. Smith recruits Sam Harris, Barbara Ehrenreich and even Ronald Dworkin to this club; he notes that we even have an explicit framing of this tradition as paganism, in the former Yale Law School dean Anthony Kronman’s rich 2016 work “Confessions of a Born-Again Pagan.” Second, there is a civic religion that like the civic paganism of old makes religious and political duties identical, and treats the city of man as the city of God (or the gods), the place where we make heaven ourselves instead of waiting for the next life or the apocalypse. This immanent civic religion, Smith argues, is gradually replacing the more biblical form of civil religion that stamped American history down to the Protestant-Catholic-Jew 1950s. Whether in the social-justice theology of contemporary progressive politics or the transhumanist projects of Silicon Valley, we are watching attempts to revive a religion of this-world, a new-model paganism, to “reclaim the city that Christianity wrested away from it centuries ago.” These descriptions are debatable, but suppose Smith is right. Is the combination of intellectual pantheism and a this-world-focused civil religion enough to declare the rebirth of paganism as a faith unto itself, rather than just a cultural tendency within a still-Christian order? It seems to me that the answer is not quite, because this new religion would lack a clear cultic aspect, a set of popular devotions, a practice of ritual and prayer of the kind that the paganism of antiquity offered in abundance. And that absence points to the essential weakness of a purely intellectualized pantheism: It invites its adherents to commune with a universe that offers suffering and misery in abundance, which means that it has a strong appeal to the privileged but a much weaker appeal to people who need not only sense of wonder from their spiritual lives but also, well, help. However, there are forms of modern paganism that do promise this help, that do offer ritual and observance, augury and prayer, that do promise that in some form gods or spirits really might exist and might offer succor or help if appropriately invoked. I have in mind the countless New Age practices that promise health and well-being and good fortune, the psychics and mediums who promise communication with the spirit world, and also the world of explicit neo-paganism, Wiccan and otherwise. Its adherents may not all be equally convinced of the realities that they’re trying to appeal to and manipulate (I don’t know how many of the witches who publicly hexed Brett Kavanaugh really expected it to work), but their numbers are growing rapidly; there may soon be more witches in the United States than members of the United Church of Christ. What ancient paganism did successfully was to unite this kind of popular supernaturalism with its own forms of highbrow pantheism and civil-religiosity. Thus the elites of ancient Rome might reject the myths about their pantheon of deities as just crude stories, but they would join enthusiastically in public rituals that assumed that gods or spirits could be appealed to, propitiated, honored, worshiped. To get a fully revived paganism in contemporary America, that’s what would have to happen again — the philosophers of pantheism and civil religion would need to build a religious bridge to the New Agers and neo-pagans, and together they would need to create a more fully realized cult of the immanent divine, an actual way to worship, not just to appreciate, the pantheistic order they discern. It seems like we’re some distance from that happening — from the intellectuals whom Smith describes as pagan actually donning druidic robes, or from Jeff Bezos playing pontifex maximus for a post-Christian civic cult. The 1970s, when a D.C. establishment figure like Sally Quinn was hexing her enemies, were a high-water mark for those kinds of experiments among elites. Now, occasional experiments in woke witchcraft and astrology notwithstanding, there’s a more elite embarrassment about the popular side of post-Christian spirituality. That embarrassment may not last forever; perhaps a prophet of a new harmonized paganism is waiting in the wings. Until then, those of us who still believe in a divine that made the universe rather than just pervading it — and who have a certain fear of what more immanent spirits have to offer us — should be able to recognize the outlines of a possible successor to our world-picture, while taking comfort that it is not yet fully formed.

2018,The Return of the ‘Bad Boys’ of Chinatown,"Their friends call them the Chinatown kai doy — Taishanese for “bad boys.” They shot pool, rode motorcycles, and wanted to be James Dean. People would cross the street when they saw them, finding them just a little too rambunctious for comfort. It has been a while since the bad boys of Chinatown made anyone nervous. The hair they used to grease into pompadours has turned white; and instead of cigarette packs, they carry photos of their grandchildren. On a recent Saturday the gang — or what remains of it — was gathered at Yee Li, a restaurant at Elizabeth and Bayard Streets, reminiscing about the old days. They were there at the behest of the original kai doy, Danny Moy and Soy Chu, who for the past 17 years have organized annual reunions at the restaurant. Mr. Moy and Mr. Chu have been friends since before they hung out at pool halls, growing up in the area during the 1940s and ’50s. In those days, Chinatown was small, just 10 or so blocks around Mott, Pell, and Doyers Streets. There were only about 5,000 people in the neighborhood, and everyone knew one another. Children were often left unattended. “I lived in 56,” said Larry Lau, 76, a retired commercial artist, referring to 56 Mott Street. “Danny and Lungie lived down the hall. We ruled the first floor. When other kids had to go in or out of the building, they used to run past the first floor, hoping to not bump into us.” Mr. Lau, like those squeezed around the banquet tables in Yee Li, felt a strong connection to Chinatown, though most of them had moved away during the 1960s. Some had driven in to the reunion from Connecticut, or New Jersey, or even Virginia; Mr. Moy flew in from California. One fellow, 77-year-old Sammy Lum, had stayed in the neighborhood. He made the trip from across the street. Over 10 courses of Cantonese food — jellyfish and roast pork; fried shrimp and gai lan — they traded memories of childhood exploits. How they played kick the can on Pell Street and stickball by the Tombs prison. They knew all the underground tunnels in Chinatown; got in fistfights with the kids from Little Italy. Sometimes, they trekked up to Central Park to go fishing. “And do you know where we got the worms to go fishing?” Mr. Lau said. “We dug them from the mayor’s front lawn.” Mr. Moy, 76 — an energetic talker with a booming voice known among friends as “the mayor of Chinatown” — pointed out people in the crowd. This was Constance, he said, indicating a woman seated to his left; they dated when he was 17, but her father forbade her from seeing him. That was Tracy, whose father used to own this restaurant; before that, it was a bar. George Kwong was called “Sleepy,” for how he looked after a few beers, and Donald Chin was “the Duck.” That was Lungie — Henry Eng — nicknamed after the Taishanese word for “dragon,” because he was the best dragon dancer. Mr. Moy and Lungie were especially close because they were both mixed-race and adopted. Once as children, they got in trouble after they bored a hole in the wall between their apartments, hidden behind the couch, through which they used to talk. As teenagers in the ’50s, Mr. Moy and his friends formed the Jade Club on East Broadway, in a space now occupied by the Golden Unicorn Restaurant. It was a place to host record hops and dances, closer to home than other socials hosted by the Chinese student associations at Hunter College or Columbia University. They played rock ’n’ roll records, and practiced Latin dancing — there was a craze for Latin music sweeping the city back then. Young people from other Chinese communities — in Washington, D.C., or the now-long-gone Newark Chinatown, or from as far afield as Jamaica or Cuba — came to their dances. Over the next decade, most of the crew left Chinatown. Mr. Lau and Mr. Moy joined the Army in 1961. (“I think every person in Chinatown was glad when we joined,” Mr. Lau said.) Others went to college, or found jobs, or they married and moved to the suburbs, settling in Long Island or New Jersey or Connecticut. But through the years, a sense of having experienced something special during their childhood in Chinatown has kept them close. The Chinatown they were born into was on the cusp of transformation. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which virtually ended Chinese immigration, was repealed in 1943, around the time the boys and their friends were born. For decades the act effectively kept Chinatown’s population frozen at around 5,000 people. Slowly the repeal ushered in a wave of acceptance for Chinese in America. When the last vestiges of the Exclusion Act were fully rolled back in 1965, Chinatown’s population exploded — some estimates put it as high as 150,000 — as new immigrants came from Hong Kong, Vietnam, Fujian Province in southern China, and elsewhere. The little Cantonese village became a melting pot. For this crowd, those changes are something to celebrate — a reflection of the improved status of Chinese immigrants. But they also mean that what made their childhood special — the intimacy of a tiny Chinatown, frozen by exclusion, where everyone knew your name — is largely gone. Mr. Moy, Mr. Chu and most of his friends were part of the first American-born generation in their families. Mr. Chu’s parents immigrated during the 1920s from Taishan in what was then called Canton — the region in southeastern China where, until the 1950s, a vast majority of Chinese in America came from. In Chinatown, Mr. Chu’s father worked as a cook, supporting seven children and a wife, squeezed into a one-bedroom apartment on Division Street. “We grew up without material things, and learned from growing up in the streets of New York City,” said Mr. Chu. He attended Stuyvesant High School, where he was one of just a few Asians at a school that is now 70 percent Asian. He went on to found a software company called New Year Tech and retired in Virginia. Mr. Moy was adopted as a baby by a prominent Chinatown couple. His father was the head of the influential On Leong Merchants Association, and his mother, who was born in Shanghai in 1919 and sold at age 6 to a traveling circus troupe, had performed as an acrobat with Barnum & Bailey Circus. After the Army, Mr. Moy spent 45 years working for a steel company called the Earle M. Jorgensen Company, becoming a vice-president of marketing, and eventually retired in California. Now once a year, Mr. Moy and Mr. Chu and their friends conjure the Chinatown of their youth. The impetus, Mr. Moy said, was 9/11. “I was living in California and I’d seen the towers come down, and it bothered the hell out of me,” he said. “I thought, ‘Well anything can happen.’ So I called up my buddy Soy and said we should get together. And I’ve made an effort to get everyone together every year since.” Over time, the logistics have changed as people have aged. Cancer, strokes, and other ailments have taken their toll; many of their friends are dead. “We’ve probably lost eight or nine guys who used to come to these,” said Mr. Moy. He himself had to delay this year’s reunion (it’s usually held in September) because of a hip replacement. Yet, even on a cold December evening, nearly 50 people made the effort to come out to Yee Li. Over the last course of the meal, Mr. Moy struggled to recall another game from his childhood: “I’m forgetting — what was it called in Chinese? The thing you kick, with the feathers on it? We used to make them out of newspapers and chicken feathers.” A waiter, passing by, called out in Taishanese, “That’s called gai mo yin.” It was a feather ball, also known as shuttlecock or Chinese hacky-sack. “That’s right!” said Mr. Moy, who looked satisfied. It was another piece of the past, restored. An earlier version of this article misidentified the location of Taishan. It is in southeastern China, not southwestern China.",The New York Times
2018,The Right Backdrop for Art Is Bold. Or Maybe It’s Neutral?,"THE FIX Hanging art is easy. It’s choosing the color that goes behind it that can be a little tricky. There’s nothing like art to bring life to your home, whether it’s a valuable piece you bought in a gallery, or a collection of street art you brought back from vacation. But before you hang it on the wall, consider the backdrop. The color you paint your wall is as important as the frame you select, said Donald Kaufman, a color consultant who has worked with the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles. If a frame is good, he explained, “it completely disappears” — and the same goes for the wall color. “You just don’t want to notice the wall color behind a picture,” Mr. Kaufman said. “You want it to feel like the picture or art is comfortable in its surrounding and allows you to participate with it intensely.” So how do you choose the right color for your art? We asked the experts for guidance. Begin by considering the entire room — the architectural details, the furnishings, the flooring and the amount of natural light the space gets — as well as the kind of mood you want to create. The goal, Mr. Kaufman said, is to find a wall color that will minimize any “discordant elements” that distract from the art. That’s something color consultants have to do even when they’re working with museums. When Mr. Kaufman developed a color scheme for the second floor of the American Wing at the Met, he said, he had to take into account several periods of American art, as well as varying lighting across galleries and architectural details like limestone wainscoting and light oak floors. The wall color he chose had to make “the stone look good without making the floor look bad,” he said, and also “neutralize the architecture,” allowing the curators to organize the paintings thematically. The color he settled on was “a medium, warm neutral,” he said, that “took its cue” from the stone, creating a cohesive environment that receded so artwork like Emanuel Leutze’s “Washington Crossing the Delaware” and John Singer Sargent’s “Madame X” came to the fore. His advice? First, create balance in a room by considering “how dark or light the color of the paint is,” he said, “before considering whether it’s red or green.” The color of the paint isn’t nearly as important as its intensity, he said, and how it affects the way various elements in the room work together. “Art tends to talk to other works of art, and you don’t want to miss that conversation,” he said, noting that the same goes for furnishings. “That’s what hanging art is about: It’s like having people over for a dinner party — who’s going to sit next to whom?” Jamie Drake, who founded the interior design firm Drake/Anderson with Caleb Anderson, offered another way of thinking about that. “Remember you’re choosing for your home, and your home isn’t a museum,” he said. “You may want your art to be the centerpiece, but it must exist as part of the whole room.” Now that you’ve taken the surroundings into account, focus on the art. But don’t try to match it. A matching background color won’t make the art stand out, said Ellen O’Neill, the director of strategic design intelligence for Benjamin Moore. Instead, she suggested, look for a subtle coordinating color “that draws the eye to the piece.” “The color of the wall that supports the collection — photography, oil portraits, even collages of objects — should serve as the backup singer,” she said, something that “flatters but does not distract.” For instance, Metropolitan, Benjamin Moore’s 2019 “color of the year,” she said, is often shown as a backdrop for vintage 20th-century portraits and landscapes. That’s because the mid-tone gray has blue-green undertones that can unify a variety of media and color combinations. And when the art is soft or muted, Ms. O’Neill said, a color like “Metropolitan freshens the presentation without upstaging it.” On the other hand, “if you are showcasing bold graphic pieces, a backdrop that provides contrast is preferable,” said Joa Studholme, the color curator for Farrow & Ball. That could mean using a pure white, which works well as a backdrop for contemporary art with strong colors, like a Warhol. But white walls “can be less sympathetic to more traditional art,” Ms. Studholme said. “If you hang an Impressionist painting against a white background, the radiance of the white can prevent the subtlety of the colors in the painting from being revealed.” So what should you choose instead? “You might want to think about a shade that is reminiscent of the era of the artwork, like Georgian-inspired Paean Black,” she said. In October, Christie’s used the dark, red-based color as a backdrop for paintings and porcelain featured in its sales brochure, while the inky Stiffkey Blue was paired with French furniture, lighting and sculpture. “Many representational pieces from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries look most ravishing against strongly colored walls, even lacquered ones,” Mr. Drake said, citing the example of his own bedroom, where Deborah Oropallo’s “Napoleon, 2001” hangs against deep gray lacquered walls. “The severity of the wall color, Benjamin Moore 2129-20 Soot, is a fantastic contrast to the light and exuberant palette in the artwork,” he said. Flat paints offer the least reflective finish, followed by matte, eggshell and gloss, which is highly reflective. “There are no hard and fast rules when it comes to choosing a finish to hang art against,” Mr. Drake said. “The art will tell you.” Mr. Kaufman, however, offered a word of pragmatic advice. “If you move your art around a lot, it’s easier to touch up flat finishes,” he said, adding, “the finishes I like the best are the flattest flat and the highest gloss.” Ms. Studholme recommended flat paint for highlighting watercolors and oils, because its lack of sheen allows the art, not the wall, to reflect light. With other types of art, a high sheen is preferable. “In very contemporary homes we are seeing the use of full gloss or estate eggshell on walls to complement bold pieces of sculpture, contemporary art and neon pieces,” she said, explaining that high-gloss walls “have a harder look to them, so create a stronger backdrop for these more graphic pieces.” “If you want to make a big show of a piece of art,” Ms. Studholme said, paint everything in a room the same color, including the trim and moldings, so you have “as few distractions as possible.” When the architectural details are the same color as the walls, they form a single backdrop that visually recedes, making the art the focal point. Or you could try the opposite strategy: Paint half the wall a different color. Paradoxically, that can also enhance the artwork. For example, “if you hang a landscape piece above a wall where the color changes from a strong tone to a lighter tone halfway up,” she said, “the artwork will command more attention.” She continued: “If you have wainscoting or a chair rail, then it is preferable to use a stronger tone on the lower part of the wall, leaving the artwork to sing on a lighter background on the upper walls.” That’s what a client of hers did in a vacation house on the southeastern coast of England, painting the wainscoting in dark-gray Mole’s Breath, with Ammonite, a much lighter color, above. It “made the room feel larger and more airy, as well as providing the perfect backdrop for a naïve oil of a local landscape,” she said. “This is a huge trend at the moment,” she added. “A lot of people are stopping the color randomly without a rail, to make a room open out — dark at the bottom and light at the top.” “Unless you have a very, very specific treasured piece of art, you’re probably not painting a room for one specific piece,” Ms. Studholme noted. “Sometimes neutral walls are the best way to give your artwork the attention it deserves.” And it’s surely the easiest way. If you have an eclectic mix of pictures, Ms. Studholme recommended choosing a dark charcoal gray, like Farrow & Ball’s Down Pipe. Or if you prefer white, she said, look for a pure white, like Farrow & Ball’s All White, which lacks the cold, blue undertones of a brilliant white. “Sometimes, the right choice is the simplest,” Mr. Drake said. “If you are displaying minimal works — think Dan Flavin neon sculptures, Donald Judd wall boxes — then dead, matte white is likely your only choice. When we do opt for white to show less demanding works against, we usually choose a textured finish: Venetian plaster, troweled finishes or other enrichments.” For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

2018,The Rise and Fall of Carlos Ghosn,"Mr. Ghosn, the ousted Nissan executive, wasn’t supposed to succeed in Japan, but he never expected to fail like this. He faces charges of financial wrongdoing at the company he helped save. CreditCreditKelsey Dake Carlos Ghosn was tired. At 64 years old, the chairman of an auto empire that spanned several continents and included Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi wasn’t bouncing back from jet lag the way he used to. Melatonin wasn’t working anymore, and he had bouts of insomnia, phoning his children in the middle of the night or going on long walks around his Tokyo or Paris neighborhood. He planned to retire soon, stepping back from spending his life on an airplane, albeit a luxurious one paid for by Nissan. Last month, just before Thanksgiving weekend, Mr. Ghosn headed to Tokyo to meet his youngest daughter and her boyfriend and attend a board meeting. He was scheduled to land at Haneda Airport at 4 p.m. The daughter, Maya Ghosn, 26, had spent most of her childhood in Japan and wanted to introduce her boyfriend, Patrick, to her favorite places. Bringing a boyfriend home is a common rite of passage, but a particularly intimidating prospect when growing up Ghosn — a child of one of the most romanticized and ruthless chief executives the global business community has ever seen. Ms. Ghosn had made a 7:30 dinner reservation at Jiro, the Michelin-starred sushi counter hidden in a basement in the city’s Ginza district. On the tarmac in Beirut, Lebanon, Mr. Ghosn opened WhatsApp and texted his four children on a group chain labeled “Game of Ghosns,” for his favorite TV show, “Game of Thrones,” the bloody HBO drama about dynasties under siege. “On my way to Tokyo! Love you guys!” Mr. Ghosn texted as his jet lifted off. He never made it to dinner. On Nov. 19, Japanese prosecutors surrounded Mr. Ghosn’s Gulfstream after its arrival and arrested him on allegations that for years he had withheld millions of dollars in income from Nissan’s financial filings. Ms. Ghosn was staying at her father’s corporate apartment, and when he didn’t show up she checked with his longtime driver at Nissan, who assured her his flight had probably been delayed. She texted: “Hey, just heard your flight got delayed. Please let me know when you land, worried about you.” [Breaking a silence, Mr. Ghosn’s daughters said they suspected that the charges against him were part of a revolt within Nissan.] Exhausted from jet lag, she took a nap. Patrick woke her when he saw a tweet about Mr. Ghosn’s arrest. “I was in shock,” she said in an interview. Minutes later, the doorbell rang. Two Japanese men in black suits slipped off their shoes to enter the two-bedroom apartment and showed Ms. Ghosn a brief note in English. “There is a case against your father,” it read, according to Ms. Ghosn’s account. “The Tokyo judge has warranted us access to search the house. We need a witness. Thank you for cooperating.” Fifteen men, also in suits, followed. They locked the front door, told Ms. Ghosn that they were prosecutors, warned the couple not to use their phones and suggested that they might tap the apartment. They rummaged through Mr. Ghosn’s drawers, studying family photos, Maya’s 10th-grade report card, personal letters, her parents’ divorce papers. “I wanted my dad to know that in this situation I was polite and handled it maturely, and I didn’t want to give them any reason to feel satisfied by an ounce of despair in my eyes,” Ms. Ghosn said. “But inside, I was shaking. I couldn’t stand up. I had to hold the wall.” Six and a half hours later, at 11:30 p.m., the men left. Worried that anything they said was being recorded, Ms. Ghosn and her boyfriend went into the bathroom, climbed into the shower fully clothed, turned on the water and whispered about what to do next. She called her siblings to figure out how to tackle Japan’s labyrinthine legal system. Told by the authorities that she was forbidden to contact her father, Ms. Ghosn waited at the apartment for nearly two days until an American lawyer working for her family called. “We got very clear instructions to leave as soon as possible for fear of being detained or interrogated to extort my dad,” she said. “So we got on the first flight out.” Carlos Ghosn wasn’t supposed to succeed in Japan, but he wasn’t supposed to fail like this. He first made headlines in 1999 when, in a nation known for its distrust of outsiders, Mr. Ghosn, a brash Brazilian-born and Lebanese- and French-educated engineer, showed up in sunglasses and a pinstripe suit with plans to carry out an American-style restructuring of a failing Nissan. The Japanese carmaker had $35 billion in debt, provided lifetime employment to a bloated work force and produced a fleet of the kind of cars you’d dread getting at the rental counter. Mr. Ghosn, then 45 and a vice president at Renault, had helped oversee a turnaround at the middling French automaker, which had agreed to spend $5.4 billion to buy a 36.8 percent stake in Nissan Motors. John Casesa, then a top auto analyst at Merrill Lynch, advised Mr. Ghosn to rent a house in Tokyo rather than buy one. “The widely held consensus was that he would fail, that Nissan wasn’t worth saving and it couldn’t be done,” Mr. Casesa said. At the time, Bob Lutz, the loquacious vice chairman of General Motors, assessed the deal this way: Renault would be better off “taking $5 billion, putting it on a barge and sinking it in the middle of the ocean.” But Mr. Ghosn, with his severe black eyebrows and puffed chest, was undeterred. He closed factories, slashed suppliers, laid off 14 percent of the work force and invested in design. Six years later, Nissan had surpassed Honda to become Japan’s No. 2 automaker, its market capitalization had quintupled and its operating margin had risen tenfold. Altima sedans, Titan pickup trucks and Murano S.U.V.s made Nissan a major player in the United States market — an achievement that Wall Street once deemed impossible. By the early 2000s, Mr. Ghosn was head of the Renault-Nissan alliance and the first person to simultaneously serve as chief executive of two Fortune Global 500 companies, the type of chief executive who even if you didn’t know how to pronounce his name (rhymes with phone), you’d know his products. The enigmatic “gaijin” (as foreigners are called in Japan) had achieved a status bestowed on only a handful of chief executives, akin, at least in Japan, to Steve Jobs, Warren E. Buffett or Elon Musk. Paparazzi swarmed. Fans asked for autographs. Japanese businessmen, eager to emulate the Nissan chief, inquired where Mr. Ghosn had bought his rectangular sunglasses and custom suits. In 2004, Emperor Akihito awarded Mr. Ghosn a Blue Ribbon Medal for his extraordinary contributions, making him the first foreign business leader to receive the honor. A manga comic book, “The True Story of Carlos Ghosn,” heralded a shadowy hero from a faraway land. Lebanon put Mr. Ghosn’s face on a postage stamp. But even as many in Nissan celebrated the comeback, others scoffed at Mr. Ghosn’s celebrity. From the start, he faced distrust from the Japanese policymaking and business establishment. The very idea of an outsider’s bringing free-market capitalism to Japan’s quasi-socialist corporate culture jabbed at historical wounds. “When MacArthur came after World War II, the Japanese just surrendered to his leadership,” a retired Nissan executive told Newsweek. Mr. Ghosn pulled on a white jumpsuit to tour factory floors, but beyond the photo ops, there were signs that his splashy — some would say autocratic — presence was out of sync with modest Japanese culture. In 2004, Mr. Ghosn grazed a motorbike while driving a Porsche in the Roppongi area of Tokyo, a haven for moneyed foreigners. (The couple on the bike had minor injuries.) The Japanese media groused that Mr. Ghosn wasn’t driving a Nissan. Then the man whose militant approach to cutting jobs (21,000, if you’re counting) earned him the nickname “Le Cost Killer” spent more than $200 million for Nissan to be a sponsor of the Rio Olympics in 2016, casting himself in the Olympic torch relay. He hopped between homes paid for by Nissan. In 2017, he paid a Lebanese artist and friend $888,000 to create a statue, “Wheels of Innovation,” for the entrance of Nissan’s Yokohama headquarters. (Having a lavish second wedding reception in Versailles the same year, with Marie Antoinette-themed costumes and, yes, lots of cake, did not help.) “He was a person who was above the clouds,” said Yuichi Ishino, who worked in Nissan’s finance department from 2002 to 2005. “No one dared to say anything that would confront his opinions.” The stickiest issue was always Mr. Ghosn’s pay. In Japan, salarymen slave away at the kaisha (or company) with a sense of communal pride almost as important as the salary. Last year, Mr. Ghosn made $16.9 million ($8.4 million from Renault, $6.5 million from Nissan and $2 million from Mitsubishi). That’s nearly 11 times what the chairman of Toyota, the world’s largest carmaker, earns but well below the $21.96 million paid to Mary Barra, the chief executive of General Motors. In 2008, the same year that Japanese law began requiring companies to disclose directors’ pay in their annual reports, Nissan’s shareholders voted to set an annual cap of about $27 million on compensation for all board directors combined. After that, Mr. Ghosn made the case to the public that he was underpaid — instructing Nissan to hand out background materials reminding investors and the news media that he made significantly less than his counterparts at other global automakers. At the company’s most recent annual meeting, in June, Mr. Ghosn stressed to shareholders that the company’s compensation policy was “designed to reward performance and to attract, promote and retain the best management talent in the auto industry.” He added that while Nissan tried to reward senior management “competitively,” the company remained “financially very disciplined.” Asked by the Financial Times that same month if he was overpaid, Mr. Ghosn laughed. “You won’t have any C.E.O. say, ‘I’m overly compensated,’” he said. Such brazenness rankled employees and the public in Japan. “Even when a company is a global multinational company, it’s still stamped by its country of origin and the place where it has its headquarters,” said Sanford M. Jacoby, a professor of management at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has studied Japanese corporate culture. The Japanese, he said, put more weight “on egalitarian policies of government and pay and other things.” In France, where the government owns a 15 percent stake in Renault, shareholders have also taken issue with Mr. Ghosn’s pay. “We believe that anyone making 240 times more than the minimum pay of his employees is out of control,” said Pierre-Henri Leroy, the head of Proxinvest, a French shareholder advisory group. In October, a whistle-blower inside Nissan said he had evidence that Mr. Ghosn had been instructing Greg Kelly, a top aide and a board member, and a small group of confidants at Nissan to effectively create two salary pots for Mr. Ghosn’s compensation. One pot would be paid in the current year and reported in the company’s annual report and securities filings. Another amount would be designated to be paid out after Mr. Ghosn left Nissan, according to a person familiar with Nissan’s internal investigation. The whistle-blower’s findings were sent to Hiroto Saikawa, the company’s chief executive, and an internal auditor. Nissan went to prosecutors with allegations that Mr. Ghosn, working directly with Mr. Kelly, who was once the head of human resources at Nissan, had underreported his income from 2009 to 2017, according to a person with knowledge of the internal investigation. Nissan’s investigation found that the underreporting had occurred when some of the compensation, though committed, was deferred and not reported in securities filings. Nissan also told prosecutors that it had evidence Mr. Ghosn and Mr. Kelly developed plans to pay Mr. Ghosn a further $124 million in cash and other financial instruments, some as compensation for a future advisory position for Mr. Ghosn. Hari Nada, a Nissan executive and confidant of Mr. Kelly’s, sent a private jet to fly him from Nashville to Tokyo for the same board meeting that Mr. Ghosn planned to attend. The two men were arrested hours apart. Mr. Kelly’s family said Mr. Nada had assured him that he would be back in Nashville by Thanksgiving, in time for scheduled neck surgery. Nissan would not comment about the Kelly family’s statements about Mr. Nada. Mr. Nada did not answer phone calls seeking comment. Mr. Kelly was released on Christmas after his family cited his ill health and posted bail of 70 million yen (about $640,000). His lawyer in Nashville, Aubrey Harwell Jr., said his client denied wrongdoing. Mr. Kelly and Mr. Ghosn “had conversations regarding legal ways they could defer compensation,” Mr. Harwell said. Mr. Ghosn, Mr. Kelly and Nissan itself all face charges they violated financial reporting laws. The company’s board removed Mr. Ghosn and Mr. Kelly as representative directors, positions with power to sign company documents. Thirty-two days after Mr. Ghosn’s initial arrest, when his release on bail appeared likely, the Japanese authorities rearrested him on new charges that he shifted personal losses during the 2008 financial crisis temporarily onto Nissan’s books. On Monday a court extended his detention until Jan. 11. That Mr. Ghosn may have deceived regulators while enriching himself runs afoul of cultural norms in Japan, where the public is more likely to forgive corporate cover-ups when executives appear to be protecting the company. “Although you don’t see it written down, there is almost a social consensus that ‘OK, you did your crime, but you did it for the company,’” said Seijiro Takeshita, dean and professor at the School of Management and Information at the University of Shizuoka. Or as Jesper Koll, who has worked in Japan for decades as an economist and is head of Japan for WisdomTree investments in Tokyo, said: “The one thing that Japan does not want and would never tolerate is personal greed.” Mr. Ghosn’s longtime driver has been out of touch since shortly after the arrest. The driver told the Ghosn children the day after their father was detained that the Japanese authorities had found his car in Tokyo. They tore up the leather seats and found only cat food. Mr. Ghosn’s chief of staff, Frédérique Le Greves, who arrived in Tokyo the same day as Mr. Ghosn, has not made any statement and returned to France after she learned of the arrest, a person close to the Ghosn family said. Their silence is one of many plot twists in the corporate saga. A person close to the family has started to call it “As the World Ghosns.” Under Japanese law, only Mr. Ghosn’s Japanese lawyer and representatives from the French, Brazilian and Lebanese Embassies have been allowed to visit or talk to him. Mr. Ghosn’s allies view his incarceration, with no foreseeable chance for bail, as revenge by Nissan (and, by extension, Japan) on a foreign adversary. He lives in a 16-by-10-foot cell with a tatami mat, a toilet in a corner and the lights always on, in the same facility that once housed the death-row inmates who committed a deadly sarin attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995. The frustration has led a few of Mr. Ghosn’s longtime friends in France to some extreme and possibly culturally insensitive metaphors. Two of them compared the meticulously planned surprise arrest to the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, which killed 2,400 Americans. Mr. Ghosn’s children have learned from his visitors that he has lost weight, at least 20 pounds. Prosecutors question him daily. Several requests to the jail authorities for a mattress were denied, but a Lebanese diplomat succeeded in getting him a thin cot and vitamin C pills. The books that Mr. Ghosn is reading in jail — including “When Things Fall Apart,” by Pema Chodron; “Teachings of the Buddha,” by Jack Kornfield; and “A Little Life,” a dark novel by Hanya Yanagihara — speak to his state of mind. He has been denied other items, including family photos, a pen and paper, dental floss (“He is a big flosser,” his daughter Maya said) and an iPod Nano loaded with music by his favorite, Phil Collins. Mr. Ghosn’s defenders, largely in the business community, contend that he is being treated harshly because he is a foreigner. They claim that the latest charge, rooted in dealings from 2008, was beyond the statute of limitations for Japanese citizens. According to Japanese law, the statute is tied not to citizenship but to how much time the accused has spent outside Japan. His defenders also said Japanese executives at Takata and Toshiba, who were embroiled in serious accounting scandals in 2014 and 2015, didn’t receive the same harsh treatment or any jail time. (Three executives from Olympus were detained for nearly six weeks in 2012 and convicted of accounting fraud but served no prison time.) “It seems really strategic. It’s a political fight,” said Ralph Jazzar, a banker in Paris and Mr. Ghosn’s first cousin. He recited an expression in French and then translated it: “He who wants to get rid of a great dog pretends the dog has the plague.” Mr. Jazzar and Mr. Ghosn grew up together in a middle-class neighborhood in Beirut. Mr. Ghosn, who was born in Rio de Janeiro, was 6 when his Lebanese father moved the family to Beirut. His sister, Claudine Bichara de Oliveira, said he was fascinated by cars at an early age. She remembers him lying in the back seat of the family car, “closing his eyes and guessing the kind of car just by hearing its horn.” From Lebanon, Mr. Ghosn went to Paris to attend France’s most prestigious schools, Lycee Saint-Louis and the Ecole Polytechnique. And then he worked his way up Michelin. Whether in Lebanon or France, Mr. Ghosn always assumed the role of the ambitious outsider. In 1989, he perfected his English and added America to his résumé, soon becoming the chief executive of Michelin’s North American operations. Mr. Ghosn moved his young family to Greenville, S.C. He took a road trip to see the Grand Canyon, Las Vegas and Los Angeles, studying the world’s largest tire market along the way. If there was any community in which Mr. Ghosn seemed to finally fit, it was the global elite, a coterie of chief executives and billionaire philanthropists who have yachts in the south of France and standing invitations to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. (“If Davos Were a Person, It Would Be Carlos Ghosn” was the headline of a Bloomberg profile last year.) Mr. Ghosn’s new wife, Carole Nahas, persuaded him to take ski lessons at age 60. Mr. Ghosn’s unabashed globalism clashed with the current era of inequality and off-with-their-heads isolationism. In 2015, Emmanuel Macron, then the French finance minister, criticized Mr. Ghosn, calling his $8 million salary at Renault “excessive.” Early this year, an auditor at Nissan began investigating the homes that a company subsidiary had bought for Mr. Ghosn’s personal use, according to a person with knowledge of the investigation. In an internal investigation, Nissan learned that a subsidiary set up in the Netherlands ostensibly to fund venture capital investments had been used to buy or rent corporate properties that Mr. Ghosn lived in when he traveled, according to a person familiar with the investigation. Nissan had invested 73 million euros (currently equivalent to about $83 million) in the venture, known as Zi-A, and Mr. Kelly was put in charge of it. In addition to a 5,400-square-foot flat in Paris’s elegant 16th arrondissement, Zi-A bought an apartment in Rio in 2011 for $6 million. (The Ghosn family planned to spend Christmas there this year with his ailing mother.) In Beirut, there is a salmon-hued mansion on a tree-lined street that Zi-A paid $8.75 million for in 2012, followed by $6 million in renovations and furnishings, according to a person briefed on Nissan’s investigation. Mr. Ghosn’s family said Nissan had known about the homes. “Over 19 years, the company put these things in place to maximize his productivity,” his eldest child, Caroline Ghosn, 31, said in an interview. Mr. Ghosn hasn’t been charged with any illegal activity related to his corporate residences. Caroline Ghosn said media accounts about the homes were part of Nissan’s and Japanese prosecutors’ efforts to “muddy the waters” in a public-relations campaign against her father. Nissan declined to comment, but a person familiar with its investigation said the fact that the Dutch subsidiary was buying homes rather than paying for car-related start-ups was among the red flags for internal auditors. The person also pointed out that Nissan did not have substantial operations in Beirut, the location of one of the disputed homes. “Do not take this as a coup d’état,” Mr. Saikawa, the current chief executive of Nissan, whom Mr. Ghosn had mentored, told reporters hours after the arrest. Mr. Saikawa said he felt “strong anger and despair” over Nissan’s findings, but analysts and investors closely watching the company believed that complicated interpersonal dynamics were at play. Critics inside and outside Nissan had started to question whether Mr. Ghosn’s star had faded. In recent years, sales had slowed. The miraculous turnaround he orchestrated started to stall. One former executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, summed up the new sentiment spreading inside the company as “What have you done for us lately?” Midway through a plan known as Power 88, which Mr. Ghosn unveiled to much fanfare in 2011, it became clear that Nissan would fall short of the ambitious targets he had set. He wanted Nissan to reach 8 percent profit margins and 8 percent market share in the countries where it operated. Dealers complained that they were losing money and that Mr. Ghosn’s big incentives to buyers to meet his targets were eating into their margins. They also grumbled that Nissan was selling too many vehicles to rental companies that then would flood the secondary buyers’ market. “They would sell cars in any manner and in any way without any regard for what the long-term implications were,” said Steve Kalafer, chief executive of a chain of auto dealerships in New Jersey. After 36 years of owning a Nissan dealership, Mr. Kalafer said, he sold it two years ago because he objected to Mr. Ghosn’s policies. Mr. Ghosn’s daughters said that in the past few years he had started on a succession plan to help cement his legacy and plan for his retirement. Mr. Ghosn explored what he called a “reimagining of the alliance” that would permanently bind Nissan and Renault. And he picked Mr. Saikawa, his close confidant, to succeed him as chief executive. “He is like Carlos Ghosn in many ways,” Patrick le Quément, a former head of design at Renault, said of Mr. Saikawa. “Not much feeling.” But as Mr. Ghosn sought to integrate Nissan’s operations more closely with Renault, maybe connecting them permanently, the relationship was getting shaky. Some Nissan executives, engineers and marketing staff began to resent what they saw as Renault’s unfairly piggybacking on Nissan’s technology, research and brand strength, according to three former managerial employees. The French saw things another way, accusing Mr. Ghosn of favoring the Japanese and Nissan and blocking Renault’s expansion into China, the world’s largest car market, to clear the field for Nissan. “We felt he was escaping us,” Mr. le Quément said. “A lot of decisions were being taken that were to the detriment of Renault.” Asked about merger discussions, a Nissan spokesman, Nicholas Maxfield, said, “It is true that the ‘Alliance 2022’ six-year plan announced last year calls for additional synergies and further convergence among member companies in specific operational areas.” As tensions grew, Mr. Ghosn mused about getting out. On his long walks around Tokyo when he couldn’t sleep, he would pass an old man playing the shakuhachi, an end-blown bamboo flute that dates to seventh-century Japan. Mr. Ghosn told his children that in retirement he hoped to learn how to play it. A Byzantine Empire buff, he said he also might write history books or lecture M.B.A. students. Then late in 2017, speculation spread that Mr. Ghosn and Mr. Saikawa’s relationship had become strained after Nissan faced accusations that it had been using uncertified technicians for vehicle inspections, leading to a recall and halts in production. Mr. Ghosn left Mr. Saikawa to take the blame. As the new chief executive offered a deeply apologetic bow, as is customary in Japan, and told a voracious news media that the carmaker had “done something inexcusable,” Mr. Ghosn was nowhere to be seen. Caroline and Maya Ghosn used to joke that Nissan was the “very demanding fifth child” in their family. To them, Mr. Saikawa’s statements (without an apologetic bow) the night of their father’s arrest were proof that his fall was akin to a palace coup. What doesn’t make sense to Mr. Ghosn’s friends and family is how the man with a preternatural talent for seeing around every corner — whether maneuvering through Japanese bureaucracy, managing French ministers or designing a midsize S.U.V. — didn’t see this coming. Maybe, they theorized, it was the jet lag and the 100 days a year he spent on an airplane, and that old man with the flute whom he saw himself becoming. Mr. Jazzar, his cousin, said Mr. Ghosn had failed, in the end, at the “P.Y.A.” approach to management: Protect Your Ass. “God only knows what is going on inside his head,” Mr. Jazzar said.",The New York Times

2018,Opinion | The Risks of Weakening the I.R.S.,"letter A tax lawyer warns of the consequences of cutting the agency’s budget, including lower tax revenues and cuts in social programs. To the Editor: Re “A Gutted I.R.S. Makes the Rich Richer” (editorial, Dec. 26): I have been a tax lawyer since 1974, having started my career as an Internal Revenue Service lawyer before moving to private practice. It has been clear to those who work with the I.R.S. that both Republicans and Democrats through the years have been trying to cripple the agency through a “death by a thousand (budget) cuts.” The purpose is obvious — to protect the rich from tax audits and collection. Both political parties have their friends and donors to protect, and those friends want a regressive flat tax. The I.R.S. cannot fairly enforce the current tax laws because it no longer has the resources to do so. As a result, “a flat tax would make the I.R.S.’s job easier,” goes the argument. We will get a more regressive tax system along with a weaker I.R.S. as time goes by, leading to lower tax revenues, higher deficits and eventually cuts in social programs. This is a train that we have long seen coming down the track. Joseph FalconeSouthfield, Mich.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Robots Have Descended on Trump Country,"They are leaving many ‘casualties of history’ in their wake. Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality. The growing use of work robots and the deployment of artificial intelligence have been most disruptive in just those areas of the country that provided President Trump with crucial margins of support in 2016. In a paper that was published earlier this year, “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from U.S. Labor Markets,” Daron Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo, economists at M.I.T. and Boston University, demonstrate that the Midwest and sections of the South have far higher ratios of robots to population than other regions of the United States. They calculate the job losses resulting from the addition of one robot in a “commuting zone.” Their bottom line: “one more robot in a commuting zone reduces employment by about six workers.” These job losses are concentrated in blue collar occupations such as machinists, assemblers, material handlers and welders. Workers in these occupations engage in tasks that are being automated by industrial robots, so it is natural for them to experience the bulk of the displacement effect created by this technology. The adverse effects of automation fall disproportionately on the voters who cast most of their ballots for Trump in 2016: White men, much more than women, and whites without college degrees. Donald Trump’s $1.5 trillion tax cut has increased incentives to replace workers with robots, contradicting his campaign promise to restore well-paying manufacturing jobs in the nation’s heartland. The Trump tax bill permits “U.S. corporations to expense their capital investment, through 2022. So, if a U.S. corporation buys a robot for $100 thousand, it can deduct the $100 thousand immediately to calculate its U.S. taxable income, rather than recover the $100 thousand over the life of the robot, as under prior law,” Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute and a specialist in tax policy, wrote me by email. I have addressed the impact of robotics on Trump voters in previous columns, but today I want to explore these developments in greater detail as tools to gather and analyze information have improved. One of the most striking developments in recent decades is the ongoing decline in work force participation among men, from 88.7 percent in July, 1947 to 68.7 percent in September, 2010, according to the Federal Reserve. This drop in participation has been sharpest for men without college degrees. In an email, David Autor, who is also an economist at M.I.T., explained the situation: We find that automation displaces employment and reduces labor’s share of value-added in the industries in which it originates. In the case of employment, these own-industry losses are reversed by indirect gains in customer industries and induced increases in aggregate demand. Overall, according to Autor, employment is growing steadily, and its growth in terms of number of jobs has not been discernibly dented by technological progress. But the sum of wage payments to workers is growing more slowly than economic value-added, so labor’s share of the pie of net earnings is falling. This doesn’t mean that wages are falling. It means that they are not growing in lock step with value-added. Automation and productivity improvements, Autor wrote, tend to grow the economic pie in aggregate while simultaneously considerably diminishing some slices and yet expanding others’ dramatically. Most new workplace technologies displace some worker tasks and entire jobs, devalue certain skills, and disrupt livelihoods. This is individually and socially costly and politically disruptive. E.P. Thompson, author of the classic work of British history, “The Making of the English Working Class,” described the brutality of economic transformation during the Industrial Revolution in Britain: The experience of immiseration came upon them in a hundred different forms; for the field laborer, the loss of his common rights and the vestiges of village democracy; for the artisan, the loss of his craftsman’s status; for the weaver, the loss of livelihood and of independence; for the child, the loss of work and play in the home; for many groups of workers whose real earnings improved, the loss of security, leisure and the deterioration of the urban environment. While there are parallels between conditions of workers during industrialization in England and during the deindustrialization of regions of this country now, one big difference stands out from a political vantage point: In England, workers turned sharply to the left while here they have moved sharply to the right. Autor identified a contemporary source of discontent. He noted that even if automation creates “an opportunity for every citizen to gain in theory,” that will almost never happen without forceful social policy and tax policy that spreads the gains and buffers the individual losses. Absent those policies (which the U.S. has little of in general, and even less so today than in earlier decades), losses will tend to be highly concentrated among displaced workers and in communities in which legacy employers are located. The major concern for the labor market in the United States, Autor wrote, is not the number of jobs per se, but the decline in labor’s share of value-added and, even more urgently, the steep falls in earnings among less-educated workers, which certainly have a technological origin. Acemoglu and Restrepo worry that the robot-related dislocations in automated industries will harm, and thus inflame, the discontent of key voters, even as jobs are created elsewhere. In their January paper, “Artificial Intelligence, Automation and Work,” they write: Last but not least, the development and adoption of productivity-enhancing AI technologies cannot be taken for granted. If we do not find a way of creating shared prosperity from the productivity gains generated by AI, there is a danger that the political reaction to these new technologies may slow down or even completely stop their adoption and development. This underscores the importance of studying the distributional implications of AI, the political economy reactions to it, and the design of new and improved institutions for creating more broadly shared gains from these new technologies. Acemoglu and Restrepo agree with Autor that greater use of robots in a commuting zone is likely to generate benefits for the rest of the U.S. economy by reducing the prices of tradable goods now produced using robots and by creating shared capital gains. But Acemoglu and Restrepo contend that even after calculating “these positive spillovers across commuting zones,” there are still “uniformly negative aggregate effects.” Their calculations suggest that one more robot per thousand workers reduces aggregate employment-to-population ratio by about 0.2 percentage points or, equivalently, one new robot reduces employment by about 3.3 workers and wages by about 0.37 percent (as opposed to 0.37 percentage points and 0.71 percent, respectively, without trade). I asked Acemoglu whether these findings challenge the economic argument that technological advance is almost always beneficial. He replied: It does challenge the conventional wisdom to some degree. But this conventional wisdom is really up for challenge. The view that technological change always and everywhere benefits most groups is completely devoid of historical context. This isn’t what has happened in history, this isn’t what has happened in the early 20th century. He cited key developments in the late 1890s and early 1990s: During mechanization of agriculture, we have also experienced rapid creation of new jobs and tasks in industry, both for production workers and for clerical workers. If it weren’t for these other changes, many of them technological and social in nature, mechanization of agriculture would have created much more hardship (and today we tend to forget how much hardship it did create in the first place). Acemoglu, Restrepo and Autor are not alone in exploring the economic and political consequences of robotics and artificial intelligence. Jeffrey Sachs, a professor of economics at Columbia, has a parallel take, writing by email: Until now, automation (robotics, machines more generally, smart systems) has mostly replaced activities that require brawn (agriculture, mining, lifting, warehousing) repetitive physical activity (assembly line, cutting/sowing), basic data management (ledgers, various logistics), while being complementary with complex management, human judgment, highly contextual activities. The demographic group most hindered by the rise of automation, Sachs wrote, “has been the proverbial white male with less than a college degree and living in rural and semirural areas.” Sachs believes that the next wave of job losses will be in basic business services (wholesale and retail trade, warehousing and transport) which will mean another hit for workers with relatively lower educational attainment. In terms of incomes, according to Sachs, “automation (including AI) will raise overall output but lower the earnings of some or even all workers, while raising the returns to many forms of capital.” Without the adoption of redistributive tax and spending policies, he argued, the old, the skilled, and the rich (who will make intergenerational transfers within families to their own children) will benefit at the expense of the young, the less skilled, and the poor. All of this seems to be underway. Jason Furman, a professor of economics at Harvard’s Kennedy School who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration, writing with Robert Seamans, a professor of management at N.Y.U., has a broader view of the positive and negative effects of automation and artificial intelligence. In their June 2018 paper, “A.I. and the Economy,” Furman and Seamans argue that, from a theoretical perspective, innovation has four effects on labor markets. The first is that “automation can directly displace labor in the affected sector.” Second is that “automation can create new jobs in new areas.” The authors note that “job losses at brick-and mortar department stores were more than made up for by new opportunities at fulfillment and call centers.” The third effect is that “higher incomes increase demand for jobs throughout the economy, including in ways that are not directly linked to technology. For example, the share of workers in leisure and hospitality in the United States has steadily trended upward as household incomes have risen, enabling people to afford more restaurants and travel.” And the fourth effect is that “technology may replace specific tasks rather than entire jobs — leaving substantial room for human employment in jobs that will be changed by worker’s having a new tool at their disposal.” Both the upside and the downside of artificial intelligence, Furman and Seamans point out, have “the potential to dramatically change the economy,” adding that On the one hand, the potential for increased productivity growth is welcome given the decades-long slowing in productivity growth in the United States and other advanced economies. On the other hand, the potential for AI-induced labor disruptions could potentially exacerbate existing problems in the labor force, including the decades-long decline in male labor force participation rate. The 2017 Trump tax cut not only boosted incentives for corporations to replace workers with robots, it has also created incentives for American companies to move production overseas, even as it directed resources toward “opportunity zones” in what the Trump administration defines as “neglected and underserved communities” — incidentally providing a bounty of lucrative grants, guarantees and breaks for real estate developers. While Trump is clearly attuned to the political power of white working class anger — in 2016 he ignited a blue-collar insurgency and mobilized white men in particular — his campaign rhetoric is also expedient. He is highly attuned to the agenda of the Republican Party he leads, not to mention the corporate establishment and its antipathy to corporate taxation. And it goes without saying that the tax cut was enormously beneficial to Trump and to his family — by conservative estimates he will personally save from $11 to $15 million annually and his estate will reap millions. The reality for the voters who believed in Trump is not so bright. Take two counties, Alger and Ontonagon, both on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, which voted overwhelmingly for Trump in 2016 (57-37 and 60-34). Two years later, their respective unemployment rates are 8.4 and 9.4 percent, compared with the low national rate of 3.7 percent. These two counties have median household incomes of $41,270 and $35,038, far below the national median, which is $61,372. On Monday, the Daily Mining Gazette in next door Houghton County, Mich., reported that the “opioid crisis has hit the Ontonagon County region hard” with “one of the highest opioid-related hospitalization rates in Michigan.” Andrew K. Shotwell, a local attorney, told the County Board that opioid use is increasing and that “Ontonagon in the top 10 for that in the state of Michigan.” The Gazette reported that prescriptions “rose from 65.6 per 100 people in the county in 2009 to 113 in 2016, more than the number of people.” E.P. Thompson, looking at 19th century England, put the plight of similarly technologically displaced people best: Their crafts and traditions may have been dying. Their hostility to the new industrialism may have been backward looking. Their communitarian ideals may have been fantasies. Their insurrectionary conspiracies may have been foolhardy. But they lived through these times of acute social disturbance, and we did not. Their aspirations were valid in terms of their own experience. Ontonagon County is at an extreme, but at the extreme, it illuminates the bleak dislocation much of Trump country has suffered. From 2000 to 2017, the county population plummeted from 7,818 to 5,881. Young people are leaving in droves: 36.4 percent of the population is 65 or older, more than twice the national average, which is 15.6 percent. 12.6 percent of county residents are under 18, compared with 22.6 percent nationally. Per capita retail sales, a measure of economic vitality, were $7,550 last year in the county, according to the census, compared with $13,443 nationally. These are men and women, to quote E.P. Thompson again, who “lived through these times of acute social disturbance.” If, Thompson continued, “they were casualties of history, they remain, condemned in their own lives, as casualties.” Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, professors at M.I.T. with a specialization in the economics of automation, are conducting a research project on “digital technologies and their impact on the earnings prospects of American workers.” They report that some of the news is clearly bad. The median American household earns less than it did fifteen years ago, labor’s share of national income peaked in the early 1980s and has been falling pretty steadily since then, long-term unemployment has emerged as a vexing problem, and start-ups are creating many fewer jobs than they used to. Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne of the Oxford Martin Program on the Impacts of Future Technology in Britain have estimated that about 47 percent of total employment in the United States is susceptible to computerization. They note that “wages and educational attainment exhibit a strong negative relationship with an occupation’s probability of computerization.” In addition, Frey and Osborne write that high-skilled workers have moved down the occupational ladder, taking on jobs traditionally performed by low-skilled workers, pushing low-skilled workers even further down the occupational ladder and, to some extent, even out of the labor force. In a separate study, Frey and Thor Berger, also of the Oxford Martin School, have found that “the bulk of low-skilled and low-income workers are now for the first time susceptible to computerization” adding that “workers with extraordinary social and creative skills will still remain in the work force in 2030.” Trump is convinced that he has extraordinary skills, boasting last month: “I have a gut, and my gut tells me more sometimes than anybody else’s brain can ever tell me.” At a moment like this, do voters want to be governed by a president who, as his first secretary of state publicly pointed out, is “undisciplined” and “doesn’t like to read” — and that was after calling him a “moron” behind closed doors? I would argue that we have been warned — the situation that obtains in the country today has to be grasped with the head as much as with the gut. I invite you to follow me on Twitter, @Edsall.

2018,"The Sabres Are Restoring Hope in Buffalo, but for How Long?","BUFFALO — Outside KeyBank Center, home of the Buffalo Sabres, three bronze statues of the so-called French Connection line recall a time when Rick Martin, Gilbert Perreault and Rene Robert led the team to its first appearance in the Stanley Cup finals in 1975. Since then, the Sabres have been back to the finals only one other time, in 1999, and the specter of Brett Hull’s foot-in-the-crease, Stanley Cup-winning goal for the Dallas Stars that year still haunts this team and the city. The Sabres have finished last in the N.H.L. standings three times since the 2013-14 season. They have not made the postseason since 2011. Even the Bills, the Sabres’ N.F.L. neighbors who wrote the book on sports heartbreak with four straight Super Bowl losses in the 1990s, ended a 17-year playoff drought last season. But hope, as shaky as it can be here, returned under Coach Phil Housley after a franchise-record-tying 10-game winning streak last month. Housley, the second-year coach, said the fans “ got that excitement and energy back, which is great for us because we feed off their energy.” But the fact is, the N.H.L. season is a marathon at 82 games. Buffalo (17-9-4) stumbled to five losses in a row after its win streak ended on Nov. 29 against the league-leading Tampa Bay Lightning. Signs that the winning streak might be a mirage were present. The Sabres won nine of those games by one goal, and seven victories came in overtime or in shootouts. And long regular-season winning streaks are not often markers of champion teams. Six times N.H.L. teams have had winning streaks of 14 games or more. Only the 1981-82 Islanders turned that momentum into a Stanley Cup, although most of those teams still had a strong playoff run. One exception was the Columbus Blue Jackets, who in the 2016-17 season were one win from tying the N.H.L. record of 17 straight victories. But down the stretch, the Blue Jackets lost six straight and were defeated in the first round of the playoffs. Look at the Sabres’ own history with 10-game winning streaks, a feat they had accomplished twice before. In 1983-84, Buffalo fell into a six-game winless streak soon after rolling up 10 straight wins. That team lost in the first round of the playoffs. In 2006-7, the Sabres started the season with 10 wins in a row and made it to the conference finals, losing to Ottawa. But Martin Biron, a former first-round draft pick by Buffalo, said this year’s Sabres had won the hearts of the city with their grit, pointing to a 5-4 comeback win over the Pittsburgh Penguins last month. “They were down, 4-1, in Pittsburgh and battled back,” said Biron, a former goaltender and now a television analyst with the Sabres. “This is a blue-collar community that really respects hard work and a no-quit attitude. That game really sent a good message to the fans.” The longtime Sabres forward Jason Pominville, who was reacquired last season, said he noticed the excitement around Buffalo when he took his 9-year-son, Jayden, to his hockey practices or games. “When I walked in, everyone’s like: ‘Nice job, nice job. Keep it up, it’s been fun,’” Pominville said. “I usually get recognized, but now it’s at another level.” This season is a sharp contrast to how last season ended in April, with center Ryan O’Reilly saying that the team was stuck in the mind-set of being “O.K. with losing.” Within months, O’Reilly was traded to the St. Louis Blues for three players and two draft picks, including a first-rounder. The Sabres’ fortunes turned around, according to Pominville, when the club won the draft lottery and selected the Swedish defenseman Rasmus Dahlin No. 1 over all. General Manager Jason Botterill overhauled the roster, adding forwards Vladimir Sobotka, Patrik Berglund and Tage Thompson in the O’Reilly trade and acquiring forwards Jeff Skinner and Conor Sheary and goaltender Carter Hutton. Skinner has 20 goals, entering Monday’s games two behind the league leader, Alex Ovechkin of Washington. “You could tell guys were excited because they were in town early before training camp, skating together, hanging out together,” Pominville said. The rebuilt Sabres are young, with 12 players 25 and younger, including 22-year-old Jack Eichel, the No. 2 pick over all in 2015, who leads the team with 36 points. Housley, a first-round draft pick of the Sabres in 1982 as a defenseman, talked with each player this past summer and then leaned on a few alumni for help in changing the culture of the team. He asked them to appear on camera in a video message to be delivered at training camp. Housley took aside Danny Gare, a two-time 50-goal scorer, at the annual Sabres alumni golf tournament and asked if he would talk about what it was like to make it to the Stanley Cup finals in his rookie year in 1974-1975. Gare spoke about the reception the team received after beating the Montreal Canadiens in the semifinals. “I remember coming back from Montreal and there were 10,000 fans waiting for us at the airport,” he said. “It was unbelievable. The big part of the video was to let the players know that this is a good town to play hockey in, if you’re winning.” In another move to reconnect to the past, photographs of Sabres greats were posted above each player’s locker stall. Housley continues to set the tone. In mid-October, after a 4-1 loss to the Vegas Golden Knights, he called a team meeting the next day in San Jose, Calif. “He was brutally honest with us,” Pominville said. “He held us accountable. I think it was good, and the boys responded the right way.” Although the Sabres lost to the Sharks, Housley’s message sank in. The next game, the Sabres routed the Los Angeles Kings, 5-1, which kicked off a three-game winning streak. “We slowly started playing better, and it led us to having that long winning streak,” Pominville said. The Sabres, who have the third-best record in the East, remain in playoff contention. But going into Tuesday night’s home game against Los Angeles, they understand there are emotional risks if their slide lasts much longer. “We don’t want to get those feelings back that we had last year,” Pominville said. Hutton, though, sees a difference in how teams prepare for the Sabres. “The days of taking the Buffalo Sabres lightly,” he said, “have come and gone.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Saudi Regime’s Other Victims,"The murder of Jamal Khashoggi has focused attention on Saudi Arabia’s human rights abuses. We need to remember all of the thousands in prison. Ms. Zoepf is a journalist who writes about the Middle East. In November 2015, I spent a couple of weeks reporting in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. It had been less than two years since my last visit to the country and just 10 months since King Salman’s ascension to the throne, but the mood among local activists and intellectuals had darkened considerably. On my final evening, my friend Fahad al-Fahad, a marketing consultant and human rights activist, offered to take me on a tour that, he suggested, might help to explain the new atmosphere. We drove to the Jaffali mosque, where, just outside, public beheadings are carried out, and where, earlier that year, Raif Badawi, another Saudi activist, had been flogged before hundreds of onlookers. Then we drove through the desert toward the village of Dhahban, where the Interior Ministry was building a massive new prison complex, which Fahad said was to help house the burgeoning population of Saudis convicted under the country’s broad counterterrorism laws. Under King Salman, Fahad explained, these laws were increasingly being used to lock up peaceful dissidents. “Every time my doorbell rings, I think someone has come to arrest me,” Fahad said. Dhahban Central Prison opened a few weeks after our visit, and many of the kingdom’s highest-profile detainees — including Mr. Badawi and his former lawyer, Waleed Abu al-Khair — were transferred there. Four months later, the arrest Fahad had been dreading finally came, and he was jailed at Dhahban, too. He is now serving a five-year prison term for “inciting hostility against the state” via tweets. His sentence includes a 10-year travel ban, which will begin following his release, as well as a lifelong writing ban. The killing of Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 has led to intensifying international scrutiny of Saudi Arabia’s powerful crown prince and day-to-day ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, and of his actions abroad. Though President Trump has stood by the crown prince, the Senate voted in November to advance a bill that would end American support for his military campaign in Yemen. Last week, Senate leaders demanded a briefing from the C.I.A. director, Gina Haspel, on the evidence surrounding Mr. Khashoggi’s murder; after meeting with Ms. Haspel, senior senators told reporters they were convinced that Prince Mohammed had ordered the killing. But despite continuing anger over Mr. Khashoggi’s fate, too little attention is being paid to the crown prince’s treatment of dissidents inside the kingdom, who often lack the resources to consider lives in exile, and who are now being imprisoned in record numbers. More than 2,600 Saudi dissidents, including prominent scientists, writers, lawyers and women’s rights campaigners, are in detention in Saudi Arabia, according to Prisoners of Conscience, a Saudi group that tracks political prisoners. Most were convicted under the kingdom’s counterterrorism laws, receiving sentences for such nonviolent offenses as “criticizing the royal court” and “ridiculing religious figures.” Few of these people are as well known in Western capitals as Mr. Khashoggi was, but their stories are no less important. Saudi Arabia was not always like this. Viewed from afar, Saudi kings may look like one long, undifferentiated line of autocrats. But the degree to which dissent is tolerated has fluctuated over time, depending on the temperament of the ruler and the pressures he faces. Though King Salman’s predecessor, King Abdullah, was often castigated by Western human rights groups, Saudi conservatives attacked him for encouraging public discussion of reform. In 2003, while he was still crown prince, Abdullah initiated a series of meetings that brought together representatives from diverse sectors of Saudi society to examine potential solutions to the kingdom’s problems. After becoming king in 2005, he gave hundreds of thousands of young Saudis scholarships to European and North American universities. By 2010, Saudis were among the world’s most avid users of social media, taking to Twitter and Facebook to campaign for greater rights and freedoms, particularly for women. But the spectacle of Arab leaders succumbing to the Arab Spring uprisings alarmed the elderly king and his advisers, leading them to wonder if they’d gone too far. The Saudi government tried to buy off the opposition, spending billions on public housing and higher salaries. It also imprisoned some of the most outspoken activists, including Mohammed Fahad al-Qahtani, Abdullah al-Hamid, and Mohammed Saleh al-Bejadi, founding members of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association who had steadfastly refused to be co-opted. After King Salman took the throne in January 2015, the pace of arrests accelerated. Executions spiked, reaching levels unseen for two decades. Alongside this crackdown came a deliberate shift in narrative, led by Prince Mohammed, who, within months of his father’s coronation, had been put in charge of oil, economic policy and the armed forces. Public discussion of social reform was sharply reduced. The national conversation about progress was now limited to technology and entrepreneurship. This new emphasis struck many Saudi intellectuals as cynical, calculated to impress Western visitors, who came away from meetings with the crown prince gushing praise. After the crown prince’s Vision 2030 plan to diversify the Saudi economy was announced in April 2016, pressure to toe the official line laid out in the vision became more aggressive. Crackdowns on activists grew even more severe. And it wasn’t just the Saudis who disagreed with Prince Mohammed who found themselves detained: The prince was leading an “anti-corruption” drive, but simultaneously overseeing the imprisonment of writers like Fahad, who had criticized official graft. At the same time that the government permitted women to drive, female right-to-drive activists, such as Loujain al-Hathloul and Eman al-Nafjan, were imprisoned. Last month, Amnesty International reported that some have been tortured. In the 18 months since Prince Mohammed became heir apparent, the message to those inside the kingdom has become clear: The prince’s need to control the narrative is so great that he will brutally suppress not only dissidents but also those who agree with him — should they dare to express their views in public. The intended message to outsiders is clear, too: Prince Mohammed is Saudi Arabia’s only hope and savior, a visionary bent on dragging his resistant subjects into the future. That narrative is now fraying. The killing of Mr. Khashoggi, a relatively mild critic of the kingdom, has exposed Prince Mohammed and the Saudi government’s intolerance of any kind of dissent. But the thousands of political prisoners should be part of the conversation, too, even if they didn’t write columns for major Western newspapers or were never popular dinner-party guests in Washington and London. Saudi Arabia’s allies — in particular the United States and especially Congress, since the Trump administration seems intent on giving Prince Mohammed a pass — must insist on the release of the kingdom’s political prisoners. The Khashoggi scandal has wrong-footed the Saudi leadership, significantly increasing the likelihood that such a demand will be acted upon. Western leaders who wish to avenge the murder should demand freedom for Mr. Khashoggi’s fellow dissidents. Prince Mohammed may not realize it, but his obsession with maintaining his image as the sole voice of Saudi progress is hobbling his own reform efforts. By releasing political prisoners and loosening restrictions on free expression, the crown prince would not only earn a great deal of good will and silence some of the calls to punish the kingdom, but he also would restore an organic, homegrown check on his power, thereby increasing his chances of achieving the social and economic reforms he claims to aspire to. My friend Fahad and his fellow dissidents are, like Mr. Khashoggi, Saudi patriots who want nothing more than to devote their energies and talents to their country’s advancement.

2018,The Scars of Family Separation,"Listen and subscribe to our podcast from your mobile device: Via Apple Podcasts | Via RadioPublic | Via Stitcher This week, “The Daily” is revisiting some of our favorite episodes of the year and checking in on what has happened since the stories first ran. Today, we’re going back to an episode from this summer, when we met Nazario Jacinto Carrillo, a farmer from Guatemala who was separated from his daughter at the United States border as part of the Trump administration’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants. On today’s episode: Caitlin Dickerson, who covers immigration for The New York Times, spoke with Mr. Carrillo. Background reading: Over the summer, officials deemed some families “ineligible” for reunification under court-ordered deadlines. Thousands of migrant children, including young children who had not been reunited with their parents and teenagers who crossed the border alone, are being held in more than 100 shelters in the United States. The family of Jakelin Caal Maquin, a 7-year-old girl who arrived in the United States from Guatemala with her father and died in Border Patrol custody this month, said the absolute lack of alternatives in their impoverished town drove them to make the journey.

2018,The Secret Behind the Living Wall of Brooklyn,"In Carroll Gardens, once the inflatable Santas and Nativity scenes go back into storage, a living facade of colorful leaves and evergreens — in an intriguing pattern — will continue to thrive. While many townhouses in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, are tricked out with glowing Santas and elaborate Nativity scenes, one homeowner has put forth a different decorative concept. Gennaro Brooks-Church, 47, a “green” builder, has covered his house with a patterned wall of plants. He maintains that it is one of the first living facades in New York. Instead of twinkling lights at his house, rhododendrons, brass buckle, sprinter boxwood and heuchera black pearl celebrate the onset of winter. When the inflatable Mickey Mouse elves go back into storage, Mr. Brooks-Church’s display, completed just before Thanksgiving, will last year-round, with minimal care. An added benefit: as opposed to sucking electricity, the plants will help insulate the home, reducing heating and cooling bills. The 600-square-foot green exterior is the latest addition to Mr. Brooks-Church’s show-home, which includes a stream on the roof. He lives there with his three children and the family dog. This is an edited and condensed version of a recent conversation with him. Q. What inspired you to create the wall? A. It was a spiritual thing. The magic of nature for me is really strong. People don’t realize how starved for nature they are in this city. I was reading a lot about global warming, and it was making me depressed. I decided I was going to create my own little world, and in that world, just do positive stuff. That’s why I created this oasis. I’ve wanted to do this for 10 years, but the technology wasn’t there.I mean, I had a lot of living walls fail on me. The learning curve has been huge. An interior wall has been going strong for seven years. I put a test wall outside for a year and a half and it worked. How does it survive the winter? We picked evergreens habituated to the Northeast climate of hot summers and cold winters. They go semi-dormant, but don’t lose their leaves. When spring comes they pop right back. The main thing is, I needed something to insulate the roots. They’re in a three-inch substrate of coconut coir, or fiber, and binder. The binder is some sort of silicon that is food-safe, safe to grow food in. I call them brownies because they look like brownies. They hold eight times their weight in water. I can go a week without watering and they are O.K. How much water do you use? This system is hooked into the water main, with horizontal irrigation along the roof and above and below the windows. The water is turned on for five minutes, twice a day. It’s kind of like having your kitchen faucet turned on. It’s definitely less than a shower. Won’t water damage the house? I built it so that the water never touches the brick. There is a two-inch space between the living wall and the brick. This allows air to flow. Keeps moisture away. The brick is no longer exposed to the elements, so it’s protected and will last longer. Why are you doing this? When I started my building company, I wanted to contribute to making New York City green. I do it through soil remediation and creating living walls. We bought this house in 2008, and it needed a gut renovation. I did all of it with salvaged materials. People found me online and asked me to renovate their houses. Flooring, kitchens, roofs, insulation, I did it all. I started doing facades. You’ve got limited options. Brownstone, wood paneling, siding, that’s it. They’re dead surfaces that contribute to the heat island effect. How much would a living wall cost a townhouse owner in New York City? About $60,000. That’s a lot, but it’s about the same cost to redo your exterior. Including the plants and irrigation, and six months’ free maintenance. After it’s been installed, we need to get up there twice a year to clean up and replace dead plants. It’s about $300 a visit. What are the pros and cons? My sex appeal has definitely increased. I’m on social dating apps and they love my living walls. We haven’t talked about the cons. The plants are living creatures. They require some attention. For example, if there is a break in the timer or clog in the irrigation lines. Some walls require almost no maintenance, and some require more. People are afraid of bugs and wildlife. But we need lots of bugs and birds and butterflies. Diversity should extend further than the color of your skin. It should be diversity of creatures. My secret desire is for a stork to make its nest on my facade. They make these really cool nests and come back every year. I’m dying for that to happen. Or a falcon. Besides attracting large nesting birds, what is your goal? For living walls to cover the city. Living walls are perfect for New York City. We have all this wall space and we aren’t taking advantage of it.",The New York Times

2018,The Secret to Buying the Perfect Diamond,"Wealth Matters Tom Taira, a co-founder of the auto website TrueCar, was in the market for a new diamond for his wife, Stephanie. He wanted to replace the one he had given her for their engagement 10 years earlier with the diamond and setting that he wished he could have afforded then. But finding a 2.8-carat emerald-cut diamond that would fit the new setting was not easy, and he certainly did not want to overpay. The price would be $35,000 for just the stone. Mr. Taira is not alone in his search. This is a popular time of year to buy a diamond for a holiday gift or an engagement ring. But the gemstone has become increasingly expensive. Demand for diamond jewelry throughout the world hit $82 billion in 2017, a record for the industry, according to the Diamond Producers Association, a trade group. Since 2005, when diamond production peaked, the number of diamonds being mined has been shrinking, which has allowed sellers to raise prices. “We basically found every diamond we could geologically,” said J. Grant Mobley, a diamond expert and trade lead for the Diamond Producers Association. “There are no new deposits, so prices are going to go up. But demand is going up, since China and India are becoming much more important to diamond jewelry.” But what’s good for the diamond industry can produce anxiety for the consumer. And the gems are always a tough purchase because most people buy a diamond only a few times in their lives, if not just once. Ryan Fennerty, an enterprise account director at General Assembly, the coding boot camp, had pocketbook concerns when he began shopping for an engagement ring for his girlfriend, Alisa. He wanted the best diamond his budget would allow. She had already picked out the setting, so it was up to him to find the stone that would fit. “My thought process was you needed an uncle who knew someone and that’s how you got a diamond,” Mr. Fennerty said. His uncle didn’t have a guy. So he began doing research and found that odd-size stones — say 1.47 carats, not the complete 1.5 carats — cost a bit less and fit into the ring setting and his budget of about $15,000. But he acknowledged that he was out of his depth when it came to knowing why similar stones were priced so differently. Despite different budgets, Mr. Taira and Mr. Fennerty shared a trait: fear of getting ripped off in the notoriously opaque diamond market. Both turned to Rare Carat, a two-year-old website that uses an algorithm to value different diamonds based on their qualities — size, cut or clarity, for example. The site has also recently added a tool that finds the best price for a particular diamond, because diamonds from one supplier can be offered across multiple retailers at vastly different prices. “Consumers are walking into stores blank,” said Apeksha Kothari, chief operating officer of Rare Carat, which aims to be the diamond version of Kelley Blue Book. “We want to empower our customer with information. They know so little about what they’re buying.” Like the travel site Kayak, Rare Carat is paid on a per-click basis; it does not make money off the final sale of a diamond. Two separate reports confirmed that buyers should be anxious when it comes to the price they are paying for a diamond. That exact diamond can often be found somewhere else for less. Katja Seim, professor of business economics and public policy at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, used the Gemological Institute of America certificate number on diamonds to search for price differences on the three leading online retailers — Blue Nile, James Allen and Brilliant Earth. Her research found that on average the price for the same diamond can be 12 to 21 percent higher on those platforms than at smaller retailers. Katja Seim, professor of business economics and public policy at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, found that on average the price for the same diamond can be 12 to 21 percent higher on those platforms than at smaller retailers. “With the advent of the internet, people thought this would be a much more equal marketplace, since you could figure out the cheapest one and go shop from there,” Dr. Seim said. “But with big purchases, people might be willing to pay more to shop at Blue Nile because the consumer likes the site.” In a separate report, the consulting firm KPMG found similar results: The price difference was 12 to 20 percent for the same diamond on these three sites. The consulting firm KPMG found that the price difference for the same diamond was 12 to 20 percent among three online diamond retailers. Ms. Kothari of Rare Carat, which paid for the two reports but was not involved in the research, said multiple retailers trying to sell the same diamond was just as common in brick-and-mortar stores. Given how expensive and varied diamonds are, it would be hard for one retailer to stock a whole array of them. “It’s a bit of a secret in the industry that the retailers themselves don’t really hold inventory,” she said. But those multiple listings give buyers an advantage, if they know how to exploit it. Conner Doyle, the director of business operations at Coronis Health in Novi, Mich., searched online and in stores assiduously for an engagement diamond, for which he had budgeted $15,000. His persistence caused one jeweler in Detroit to stop working with him. “I wanted to see 500 different diamonds and go through them,” he said. “That wasn’t an option at a store.” He began researching diamonds online, and went down a rabbit hole. The deeper he went, the more he saw significant differences in price for the same diamond. Then he figured out how to compare them. “I could find a diamond, grab that G.I.A. number and find all the retailers selling it,” he said. “There would be four or five retailers all selling it for a different price. It could be a $2,000 difference.” In the end, he paid $15,950 for the two-carat round diamond. “The biggest hurdle is not seeing it in person, not holding it,” Mr. Doyle said. “I don’t think it matters if you’re spending $5,000 or $25,000 — it’s a lot of money.” And it’s also not like shopping for shoes on Zappos. “You don’t buy four pairs and see which one you like,” he said. “Even though the sites have good return policies, you’re tying up a lot of money.” He was gratified when the diamond was appraised for $19,500. But for him, the true test will be when he proposes to his girlfriend in a few weeks. Mr. Mobley from the Diamond Producers Association took a more nuanced view of the price difference. Diamonds, he said, are not dependable, presentable cars that will get you safely where you’re going. Diamonds are imbued with the emotion of the moment when they are given. Their value is physical, emotional and, over time, sentimental. Quantifying that, Mr. Mobley said, does not always come down to which store has the cheapest gem. “It’s the total experience,” he said. “If you go to a jeweler with a great reputation and you pay $300 more, it’s all about that lifetime of service. You have to take that into account.” Mr. Taira’s search was more about paying the right price for the diamond he wanted. Complicating the effort, he was looking for a larger diamond in a perfect condition. The price difference could be as much as $4,000 among various retailers. In the end, he saw the same diamond from two different retailers and bought it from the one that offered it for about $1,000 less. “There wasn’t a standard markup,” he said. “One retailer could be lowest in one instance and highest in another case.” For Mr. Fennerty, the price matching and diamond comparison tools gave him peace of mind. After months of research using the Rare Carat tools, he ended up turning to a more traditional outlet: New York’s diamond district. “Normally, I’d want to run from the diamond district,” he said. “But I had all the data, and they were just physically there as the facilitators of the transaction. It was actually a pleasant experience.”",The New York Times
2018,The Secret to Good Health May Be a Walk in the Park,"Personal Health In Minneapolis-St. Paul, the nation’s healthiest urban region, almost everyone lives within a 10-minute walk of a good public park. Shouldn’t we all? Even though I was heading to a highly coveted job at The New York Times in 1965, I was heartbroken to leave Minneapolis, where I had begun my journalistic career two years earlier. Minneapolis was then, and still is, a slice of heaven for anyone who enjoys the great outdoors. According to an ambitious project of the Trust for Public Land, Minneapolis leads the nation’s metropolitan areas in providing the best overall access for the most people to well-equipped and serviced public parks and recreation. Its neighbor, St. Paul, is a close second. Not surprising, then, is the fact that Minneapolis-St. Paul is also ranked the healthiest urban region in the country. And no, their residents are not preserved by the cold! If anything, they are out there enjoying it — ice skating, cross-country skiing, sledding, cycling, running, walking, you name it. An analysis by the trust revealed that 96 percent of Minneapolitans and 98 percent of St. Paulites live within a 10-minute walk of a park, compared with 70 percent of residents in the 100 largest cities over all. New York City, with 99 percent of residents enjoying easy access to a park, playground, trail or other open area, ranks ninth overall in terms of public outdoor access when park size and other factors are considered. Despite its generally clement weather, Charlotte, N.C., with an average temperature of 60 degrees, 218 sunny days and only four inches of snow and 41 inches of rain a year, has the poorest overall access to public lands among the 100 major metropolitan areas studied. The analysis covered residents in 14,000 communities the Census Bureau designates as “urban areas,” which are where approximately 85 percent of Americans now live. Last year, in partnership with the National Recreation and Parks Association and Urban Land Institute, the trust started a noble initiative that could bring Minneapolis-type benefits to every resident in the country: access to “a high-quality park within a 10-minute, or half-mile, walk,” Adrian Benepe, senior vice president for the trust and former New York City parks commissioner, told me. Thus far, more than 220 mayors, including those serving most of America’s largest cities, have signed on to support the project, which has the potential to do as much or more for the nation’s physical and mental health than anything Congress might pass. “Parks are key to good, healthy cities,” Mr. Benepe said. “The connection between parks and health is well established.” A 10-minute walk can enhance physical fitness, reduce the risk of chronic disease and improve brain function, like learning and memory. The 10 minutes it takes to walk back home, not to mention the activity done in between, are a bonus. “Parks are the key to good public health and to the environmental health of cities,” Mr. Benepe said. Hanaa A. Hamdi, the trust’s public health director, says research has shown that community green spaces can reduce violent crime; counter stress and social isolation, especially for older adults; improve concentration for children with attention deficit disorder; enhance relaxation; and promote self-esteem and resilience. Dr. Hamdi said in an interview that 35 percent to 40 percent of health is determined by one’s physical environment, including public access to green spaces, outdoor recreation and community gardens. Accordingly, the trust is collaborating with hospitals and community health workers to foster investment in open spaces and create programs that counter physical and mental illness. One project, called Walk with a Doc, enlists physicians, nurses, nutritionists and social workers to take scheduled walks with patients with Type 2 diabetes to help foster healthier lifestyles. As an added benefit, Mr. Benepe said, “Parks mitigate the effects of climate change. Their trees absorb and store carbon and trap particulate matter on leaf surfaces. They absorb storm water runoff, keeping it out of sewers and countering pollution, and they reduce the impact of the urban island heat effect.” There are also untold social and community benefits linked to public park spaces. Friends of mine, Kathryn Morrissette and Michael Smith, each had a dog and met during off-leash hours in Prospect Park in Brooklyn. They married and became the proud parents of two boys, Dillon, 3, and Wyatt, 1, who now frolic in the park as well. It’s not enough for an area to have lots of parks if people can’t get to them without using public or private transportation, the trust maintains. “People have to be able to walk there,” Mr. Benepe said. “They can’t grow wings to fly over a highway or river.” Of the vast majority of Americans who live in cities and their suburbs, about two-thirds already have a park within a 10-minute walk. But that still leaves 110 million Americans who lack this access. Perhaps the biggest selling point for the nation’s mayors may be the fact that park access increases real estate values, which provides cities with a larger tax base. Along with Minneapolis and St. Paul, the trust’s analysis suggests that the most livable urban areas in the country are Washington, D.C., Arlington, Va., San Francisco, Portland, Ore., Cincinnati, Chicago and New York. About 99 percent of New Yorkers live within a 10-minute walk of a public recreation area primarily because “there are so many playgrounds,” a tribute, Mr. Benepe said, to the controversial “master builder” Robert Moses, under whose leadership park playgrounds increased from 100 in 1934 to 658 by 1960, and now number about 1,000. The city’s schoolyards, long characterized “by terrible sheets of asphalt and locked up during nonschool hours,” Mr. Benepe said, are being turned into inviting playgrounds that are open to the community evenings, weekends and holidays. Although the trust is currently focused on metropolitan areas, Mr. Benepe said he’s “worried about people who live in small towns, where the land is privately owned. It may be colored green on the map, but it’s not necessarily accessible.” The trust’s ParkScore index ranks metropolitan areas based on four factors: the percentage of residents living within a 10-minute walk to a park; the median size of local parks and percentage of city area they constitute; the dollar investment in parks per resident; and the availability of six popular park features: basketball hoops; off-leash dog parks; playgrounds; splashpads and other water-play structures; recreation and senior centers; and restrooms. Community leaders can use the trust’s ParkScore-generated maps to determine where new parks are most needed. And citizens can use the information on the trust’s website, parkscore.tpl.org, to encourage elected officials to provide more equitable access to quality parks.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Secret to Winning in 2020,"It’s the populism, stupid. Opinion Columnist Young or old? Female or male? White, black or Latino? The first stage of the 2020 presidential campaign — the jockeying stage — is underway, and Democrats are trying to figure out who the ideal candidate is. They’re asking the wrong questions, though. Demographic identity matters much less than people often imagine. Think about it: Would an algorithm meant to produce the ideal candidate have spat out any of the past three presidents — a 70-year-old, orange-haired reality-television star; a law professor with the middle name Hussein; or the son of a recent one-term president with the very same name? There is only one quality — beyond, of course, charisma — that Democrats should demand in their nominee. The Democrats need a candidate who can and will run as an economic populist. [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] They need a candidate who will organize the 2020 campaign around fighting for the little guy and gal. (And most of the potential Democratic nominees could do so.) It would be a campaign about Republican politicians and corporate lobbyists who are rigging the game, a campaign that promised good jobs, rising wages, decent health care, affordable education and an end to Trumpian corruption. The country doesn’t only need this agenda. It wants this agenda. A mountain of evidence shows that populism — the real kind, not the faux Trump version — is the Democrats’ most effective political strategy. Yet that evidence often gets obscured by less important issues, like a candidate’s race, sex or precise spot on a traditional liberal-conservative spectrum. I’ve written several recent columns about what a populist agenda should and shouldn’t include, and I’ll write more in the coming months. This column focuses on politics, not policy — to make the case that populism is a winning issue like no other. The first big batch of evidence is public opinion: On economic issues, most Americans are decidedly populist. More than 60 percent think taxes on upper-income people are too low, according to Gallup. Almost 70 percent say the same about corporations. A clear majority also favors expanded government health care, more college financial aid, a higher minimum wage and tougher anticorruption laws. When these issues come before voters as ballot initiatives, the results are equally clear. Minimum-wage increases often pass in a landslide, including in red states like Arkansas, Montana and Nebraska. Expansions of Medicaid also keep passing. In Missouri last month, 62 percent of voters approved a law to rein in the influence of lobbyists (a law that the state’s Republican leaders are now trying to undermine). These issues are politically potent because they unite the Democratic coalition and divide the Republican coalition. The Democratic base — including Africans-Americans, Asian-Americans, Latinos, young college graduates and middle-class women — leans populist, polling shows. But so do the white-working class voters who often swing 21st-century elections. Democrats still aren’t going to win a majority of the white working class. But they don’t need to. They just need to avoid getting crushed. When they do that, they win elections. Whether they were social moderates running in red states or proud progressives in safe districts, many of this year’s Democratic House candidates ran similar campaigns. They focused on pocketbook issues, not on Trump. They ran as advocates for working families. In southern New Mexico, Xochitl Torres Small talked about hard work and grit. In northeast Iowa, Abby Finkenauer’s campaign slogan was, “Fighting for Iowa’s Working Families.” In dozens of districts, Democrats campaigned on protecting people’s health insurance. And most of these candidates won. If Democrats repeat their 2018 performance in 2020, they will win the White House. A fascinating analysis of the midterms was published a few weeks ago. It focused on the fraction of people who voted for Barack Obama in 2012, Donald Trump in 2016 and a Democratic House candidate in 2018 — that is, the national winners in all three elections. This group is mostly white, mostly without a college degree and disproportionately rural, according to the analysis, by YouGov Blue and Data for Progress. On social issues, the group’s attitudes look pretty Republican. Many of its members think sexism isn’t that big of a problem, for instance. They express anxiety about demographic change and favor tighter border security. These are the sort of voters that some Democrats had written off as irredeemable racists. But that’s a terrible mistake. On economic issues, swing voters look decidedly un-Republican. They are even more populist than loyal Democrats. By a wide margin, they favor free college, a big expansion of Medicare and federal action both to reduce drug prices and to create jobs. “These voters want leaders who are going to look out for them,” Alissa Stollwerk of YouGov told me. Trump persuaded many voters that he was their ally by running a racially focused campaign. Democrats have already shown they can win back a meaningful share of them by running an economically focused campaign. It’s not just 2018, either. Populism has fared well as a political strategy over the last generation — a period, not coincidentally, when living standards for most Americans have risen with frustrating slowness. Trump’s populism is a mirage, but many voters believed it in 2016. He was the rare Republican who criticized free trade and seemed to care more about protecting Medicare than reducing the budget deficit. Trump managed to out-populist Hillary Clinton, and it’s a part of why he won. Four years earlier, Barack Obama was the populist candidate. He ran for re-election casting himself as the defender of working people and Mitt Romney as an out-of-touch rich guy. The 2012 Obama was “more populist than any major party presidential nominee in decades,” as a column in The Guardian put it. The 2008 Obama, of course, ran against the financial crisis occurring on George W. Bush’s watch. The Democratic president before Obama — Bill Clinton — ran as a populist, too. It’s true he also pitched himself as a centrist rather than a liberal. But populism isn’t the same as liberalism. Most voters don’t tote up all of a candidate’s policies and try to figure out his or her precise ideology. They care more about the values a candidate projects, and Clinton sold himself as an ally of workers. He gave the central economic speech of his 1992 campaign at Wharton, the elite business school in Philadelphia — during which he called the school “a powerful symbol of where our country went wrong.” Take that, fat cats. Contrast Bill Clinton and Obama with the Democrats who have lost a presidential election over the last generation: Hillary Clinton, John Kerry and Al Gore. Fairly or not, none of them figured out how to portray themselves as defenders of ordinary families. Finally, it’s worth glancing at other countries where, as in the United States, the middle class has been struggling lately. Populism has also been working, for both good and ill, in many of those places. In Britain, Brexit was a Trump-like triumph for populist politics. In France, President Emmanuel Macron is foundering because he hasn’t focused enough on the working class. Across Europe, alternatives on both the left and right are growing at the expense of establishment parties. Populism takes very different forms — from odious racism to sensible economics — but there is no other political style consistently succeeding in the Western world right now. There is more than one form that a Democratic populist can take. Franklin Roosevelt, the most successful populist of the past century, was an aristocrat. Bill Clinton and Lyndon Johnson were hardscrabble Southerners. Barack Obama managed to do quite well with much of the white working class despite having one big obvious difference from them. So the need to run a populist campaign in 2020 doesn’t point to any specific candidate. Yes, there are a few for whom populism would come easily, including Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. The same applies to Senator Sherrod Brown. While most Democrats were getting thumped in Ohio this year, his blue-collar style helped him win comfortably. Then there are other candidates for whom a populist campaign would be a natural outgrowth of their careers. Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota senator, has focused on the disturbing power of large corporations. Kamala Harris, the California senator, has proposed a huge middle-class tax cut. But almost every single one of the potential Democratic candidates could run a smart populist campaign. Take Beto O’Rourke. His record in the House was not especially populist.

2018,The Self-Described Jets Owner-in-Waiting Will Tailgate for Now,"The entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk, a fan of the Jets, would love to own the team someday. There are just two problems: The team isn’t for sale, and he isn’t rich enough. So here’s the plan. … Gary VaynerchukCreditCreditDemetrius Freeman for The New York Times EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Somewhere in the outer regions of the MetLife Stadium parking lot, Gary Vaynerchuk, the entrepreneur and strategist better known to his legions of devoted Twitter followers and YouTube subscribers as Gary Vee, gathered some friends for a pregame huddle. Or maybe it was a prayer circle. “O.K., bring it in,” he said in a hushed voice. The 12 men wrapped arms and locked eyes. One by one, they predicted the final score and a key play of the game. And because they were all Jets fans, the overwhelming expectation on this damp December afternoon was that the Jets would lose. In fact, Vaynerchuk was hoping for it. “I want them to get a high draft pick,” he said. “Any real fan should want the same thing.” Know this: Vaynerchuk, 43, is a real fan, and he has been since the New York Sack Exchange team in 1982. He might prove this by casually referencing the former wide receiver Wallace Wright (career receptions: eight). He also owns a Thomas Hennessy jersey. That’s the current team’s long snapper. So when he one day owns the Jets, Vaynerchuk said, he will still be rooting for high draft picks and tailgating in the parking lot and tweeting furiously about his team’s preseason games, because that’s what Vaynerchuk does. Fulfilling a lifelong dream to buy this particularly unfortunate and derisible N.F.L. franchise wouldn’t change that. Many die-hard N.F.L. fans might dream of owning their favorite team. Vaynerchuk, though, is the rare fan with an outside chance of one day making that dream a reality. Here’s the plan: Over the next 25 years, if his $150 million communications holdings company, VaynerX, sees the growth he expects, and the team’s current owner, Woody Johnson, or his family, or whoever is the principal owner at that point, is ready to sell, then the Jets will become Vaynerchuk’s. Scratch that. When these things happen, not if. Because no one is willing to bet bigger on himself than Gary Vee. On a recent afternoon in his office on Manhattan’s West Side, in front of a window gazing across the belly of the city, Vaynerchuk took stock of the bustling digital media empire he built, in part, on his ability to scout the future. “All of this is to buy the New York Jets,” he said, sweeping an arm toward the glass wall facing rows of cubicles and conference rooms. “Yes,” he continued, “that’s what I want to do with my life. I’d like to buy the Jets at 68 years old and win six Super Bowls before I die.” It is reasonable to wonder, as the Jets wrap up another losing season, why them? Why the Jets? It is a franchise that, after all, just celebrated the 50th anniversary of its last Super Bowl. A franchise most likely on the verge of making a sixth coaching change since 2000. A franchise that has again missed the playoffs, for the 22nd time in the past 30 years. According to Forbes, the Jets ($2.85 billion) are the eighth most valuable team in the N.F.L., but the fourth most valuable sports team in the New York metropolitan area, slightly ahead of the Mets ($2.1 billion). And there is no indication that Johnson, currently the United States ambassador to the United Kingdom, or his brother Christopher, the team’s chairman, is planning to sell any time soon. Still, when RSE Ventures, led by Stephen M. Ross, the majority owner of the Miami Dolphins, bought a stake in VaynerMedia in 2014, it came with a half-serious option for equity in the football team, as well. Vaynerchuk declined. “It would have been cool to walk around life as a 38-year-old and say I own the Dolphins,” he said. “But I hate the Dolphins.” Ross said: “I’d be partners with him in anything. But I knew he wasn’t going to do that.” It has been all about the J-E-T-S since Vaynerchuk, who was born in Belarus, started selling lemonade and shoveling snow for extra cash in Edison, N.J. His family moved first to Queens and then to New Jersey, where his father opened a wine store called Shoppers Discount Liquors. In 1996, working for his father, Vaynerchuk considered opening a second store. Instead, he started a website. A multimillion-dollar e-commerce wine-selling enterprise was born. Along the way, he discovered the Jets. As an immigrant bouncing to various places in his childhood, without a firm grasp of English, he found in the early 1980s that football helped him bond with children in school and connect with the community. “It represented so much,” he said. “We were starting to make it in America. That was the way I broke through. It is the American thing for me.” Though cheer-worthy seasons have been few and far between since 1982, his passion for the Jets has hardly diminished. In the Vayner offices, there are autographed helmets, framed jerseys on the walls and even a small Jets ornament hanging from a Christmas tree in the reception area. At a recent consulting workshop called the Daily Digital Deep Dive, for which a seat at the conference table costs $10,000, Vaynerchuk wore an “ugly” Jets sweater equipped with battery-powered lights. On game days, from his seats in Section 113, Row 18, Vaynerchuk has become one of the team’s most famous fans since Edwin Anzalone, better known as Fireman Ed, stopped regularly attending games in 2012. “He used to get so upset after losses,” said Phil Toronto, VaynerX’s senior vice president for special projects, investing and advising, “I used to have to cancel meetings the next day.” Vaynerchuk said he has no relationship with the Johnsons and has never engaged in any discussions about a sale. There is no discussion to be had, he said. He understands that N.F.L. teams are purchased by people with substantially more money than he has, like David A. Tepper, a hedge fund manager who paid more than $2.2 billion for the Carolina Panthers in May. So Vaynerchuk’s pledge to one day have the resources to buy the team might be partly self-motivational, a goal to chase. But that has not stopped him from candidly telling anyone who asks that he is actively laying the foundation for a future Jets takeover. “He’s speaking it into existence,” his brother and business partner, A.J., said. “Gary doesn’t have a dream to own tons of houses or a private jet,” he added. “I truly believe he’s working toward ownership of the Jets.” Being discreet was never Vaynerchuk’s style. With a podcast, newsletters, essays, books and tweets, he is widely credited with originating the full-time videographer trend by putting his life on camera, everywhere, for a series called DailyVee starting in 2015. His views on transparency and engagement naturally seem to conflict with the N.F.L., which he called “stodgy and out of touch” in its handling of a recent case of violence against a woman by Kansas City Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt. “When you’re talking about a passionate product, you can’t just put out press releases,” Vaynerchuk said. The league’s struggle to stem the exodus of fans choosing to watch games on television, rather than attend in person, is another sticking point for Vaynerchuk, who criticized the Jets and the Giants for betraying many longtime season-ticket holders with the introduction of costly personal seat licenses when the teams moved into MetLife in 2010. “He has the pulse of the people out there,” Ross said. “Sometimes you lose sight of them. How do you get to them? How do you influence them? How do you market to them?” Ross said that although Vaynerchuk might not have been interested in owning the Dolphins, he has contributed marketing ideas geared toward Dolphins fans. “Social media is the greatest marketing tool there is today,” Ross said. “And he’s like the gold standard in that.” That was evident before the Jets hosted the Houston Texans, as Vaynerchuk bounced around the small gathering in the parking lot in typically restless fashion. He exchanged text messages with a professional boxer, recorded a video for Facebook Live and checked his YouTube page, where he had just posted a seven-and-a-half-hour vlog of his recent tour of Dubai. As far as tailgates go, it was a mild one. There was one foldout chair. Somebody handed out a bag of pretzels. (Vaynerchuk, who recently started a direct-to-consumer winery called Empathy Wines, rarely drinks beer.) Around 4 p.m., Vaynerchuk, wearing a Sam Darnold jersey (the Hennessy one stayed at home this day), a knit cap and a pair of K-Swiss sneakers, began walking toward the stadium and was quickly recognized by multiple groups of fans, who approached him asking for selfies. Rolling his eyes, A.J. Vaynerchuk joked, “It’s like he’s a slot receiver.” Except that his route is aimed at the owner’s suite.",The New York Times
2018,"The Senate Passed the Criminal Justice Bill. For Jared Kushner, It’s a Personal Issue and a Rare Victory.","Updated Wednesday, Dec. 19: The Senate on Tuesday passed the criminal justice overhaul. For more coverage and analysis of the bipartisan effort, read here. WASHINGTON — The day after President Trump announced his support for a bipartisan criminal justice overhaul bill in the Roosevelt Room, Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, arrived in the Oval Office to give him a dose of political reality. He was not going to bring the bill to the Senate floor until next year, Mr. McConnell told the president. Mr. Trump called for his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the administration’s driving force behind the bill, to join the meeting and hear the news himself. As Mr. Kushner entered the Oval Office, Mr. McConnell joked that he felt like he had heard from everyone Mr. Kushner knew. “That’s not true,” Mr. Kushner replied, according to administration officials. “I have a lot more people.” And he did. Because Mr. Trump agreed that the bill had to wait, according to administration officials, Mr. Kushner enlisted Vice President Mike Pence to explain to the president that waiting until next year, when a House controlled by the Democrats would then vote on the bill, would most likely result in a version that he would not like. Mr. Kushner called Rupert Murdoch, his son Lachlan Murdoch and Hope Hicks, the former White House communications director who is now a senior executive at Fox, to release a statement backing his bill. Mr. Kushner also appeared on “Hannity” on Fox News in an effort to make clear to the president’s base and Republican senators on the fence that even Sean Hannity, the hard-right host, was supportive of it. The bill’s advocates say Mr. Kushner’s efforts were part of the reason Mr. McConnell reversed course, announcing that the Senate would vote on the bill next week. But even more important was his ability, over a course of years, to make Mr. Trump comfortable with the need for criminal justice overhaul in the first place. “The bipartisan coalition was there before Jared showed up,” said Ronald A. Klain, a former senior official in the Obama and Clinton administrations. “The Koch brothers deserve credit for that. But if Jared got the president to be for it, that is a key part of getting it done, and he does deserve credit for that.” In a statement, Mr. Kushner played down his role. “For all those who are deserving of a second chance, this legislation will make a meaningful and measurable difference in their lives,” he said. “We could not have reached this point without the leadership and vision of the president.” But for Mr. Kushner, it was a rare success after perhaps the most difficult period he has faced as a member of the Trump family and as a high-ranking official in the Trump White House. His close relationship with Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, whom he has defended even after intelligence agencies concluded that the prince ordered the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi journalist, has generated bitter criticism from even Republicans. Within the White House, where Mr. Kushner has feuded with John F. Kelly, the chief of staff and technically his superior, his attempt to replace him with Nick Ayers, an ally, backfired when Mr. Ayers would not agree to Mr. Trump’s conditions for the job. And other issues on which Mr. Kushner has focused have gotten little traction. The release of his Middle East peace plan has been delayed until next year, and some of the top people on his team tasked with innovating the government have already left the Trump administration. But criminal justice is something personal. Mr. Kushner’s father, after being sentenced in 2005, served 14 months in an Alabama federal prison for tax evasion, witness tampering and making illegal donations. “Jared is committed in a way you can only be when you’ve seen your daddy hurt,” said Van Jones, a liberal CNN host who has worked closely with Mr. Kushner on the issue. “What I’ve seen is someone who is personally driven to make a powerful change in the experience of people behind bars.” Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who had been part of the coalition that pushed a more extensive criminal justice bill during the Obama administration, first approached Mr. Kushner about the issue in the opening months of the administration last year and asked him to meet on the issue. Mr. Kushner was inclined to get involved. The bigger question was whether his tough-on-crime father-in-law would support the legislation. Realizing that Mr. Trump was unlikely to be in favor of sentencing overhauls, Mr. Kushner decided to focus on prison overhauls and leave the sentencing piece of the puzzle to Jeff Sessions, the attorney general at the time. Knowing that Mr. Trump learns by hearing from people, rather than from reading briefing books, Mr. Kushner arranged for blocks of “policy time” on his father-in-law’s schedule and flooded the zone, bringing conservative leaders and governors to explain how the mission fit in with Mr. Trump’s campaign promise of standing for the forgotten man. Meetings with Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West, organized by Mr. Kushner, also helped bring outsize attention to the issue. And above his office door in the West Wing hangs a poster from Mr. West, with the slogan, “Bringing Dignity to Forgotten America,” and signed, “To Jared from your friend Ye.” On another track, Mr. Kushner worked to win over skeptical Democrats wary of the Trump administration. When Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York refused invitations to meetings at the White House, Mr. Kushner agreed to meet him on his turf, so he dined with Mr. Jeffries and Representative Cedric L. Richmond of Louisiana in the Members Dining Hall. He kept them on board by pushing back against Mr. Sessions, who wanted to insert statutes that were deal breakers for Democrats. “There was a constant back-and-forth with Sessions, and Kushner won that battle,” Mr. Jeffries said. “It’s fair to say that if we’re able to get meaningful criminal justice reform over the finish line, it would not have occurred without substantial leadership from Jared Kushner.” Representative Josh Gottheimer, Democrat of New Jersey, recalled hearing from Mr. Kushner on the issue as early as April 2017. “Jared called and asked if he could meet with the caucus, and he and Van Jones and Grover Norquist showed up,” Mr. Gottheimer said. “It was a motley crew that came in. I spoke to him regularly over the ensuing months. He was obviously very committed.” Over Thanksgiving, Mr. Kushner realized that the message had sunk in. He was out of town when he saw that Mr. Trump — without any prodding — wrote on Twitter: “Really good Criminal Justice Reform has a true shot at major bipartisan support. @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell and @SenSchumer have a real chance to do something so badly needed in our country. Already passed, with big vote, in House. Would be a major victory for ALL!” But the bill still has its detractors. On the right, Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, continues to oppose cutting mandatory minimum sentences for serious crimes and has campaigned to defeat the bill. On the left, Roy Austin, who led the Obama administration’s efforts on criminal justice overhauls, said that passing the First Step Act, as the legislation is called, would be “a Pyrrhic victory” that would leave those now in the criminal justice system “exactly where they are: at the mercy of an administration that has no real interest in reform.” Mr. Jones said his work with the Trump administration has surprised him, but he disagreed. “This issue was marginal and only used as a weapon to say someone else is soft on crime,” Mr. Jones said. “The person who made it safe for everyone is Donald Trump, and that is an insane outcome.” Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article contained a truncated quote from Van Jones, the liberal commentator. The full quote is: “The person who made it safe for everyone is Donald Trump, and that is an insane outcome.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Sentencing of Michael Cohen,"letters One reader says he “did not deserve the leniency he got.” Another poses a question for President Trump. To the Editor: Re “Cohen Gets 3 Years in Prison for ‘Smorgasbord of Fraudulent Conduct’” (news article, Dec. 13): Michael Cohen’s 36-month prison sentence is obscene. He’s not the good guy he tried to paint himself as in court, just a family guy who went momentarily astray. Aside from the charges against him, Mr. Cohen is also the man who violently threatened a journalist during the 2016 election campaign for asking a question about Donald Trump’s first marriage. He is the man who retweeted that the journalist Megyn Kelly should be gutted after her questioning of Mr. Trump during the campaign. He is the man who helped Mr. Trump perpetuate a fraud on the American people, who lied to Congress and who later sold access to the president. Mr. Cohen’s actions have been an attack on our democracy and have harmed us all. Even in this plea agreement, Mr. Cohen has not come clean. He has refused to sign a full cooperation agreement, which means he’s not telling all he knows. For these reasons it is clear: Michael Cohen did not deserve the leniency he got; his sentence of 36 months is an affront to all Americans and our system of justice. Katharine JonesNew York To the Editor: Re “President Lays Out a Defense Against Potential Campaign-Finance Charges” (news article, Dec. 11): Here’s a question for President Trump: If, as he claims, Michael Cohen’s payoffs (at the president’s direction) to two women were perfectly legal, “a simple private transaction,” why on earth would (1) Mr. Cohen admit that they were felonies (as he has), and (2) a federal court sentence him to three years in prison for his role in them (as it just did)?

2018,"Opinion | The Sidney Awards, Part I","The best long-form essays on a brutal year. Opinion Columnist At the end of every year I give out the Sidney Awards to celebrate and recommend great examples of long-form journalism. I do it so that we can step out of the daily rush of events and read things that are broader and more reflective. This year there were a lot of great essays on the shame culture and the out-of-control viciousness of online life. There were a lot of great essays about our brutal, angry transitional historic moment. And there were a lot of great essays about tigers. Don’t ask me to explain that last one. The first of the Sidneys, named for the philosopher Sidney Hook, is Helen Andrews’s essay “Shame Storm” in First Things. It is an amazing description of online viciousness. In 2010, Andrews was on a panel about conservatism with her ex-boyfriend, Todd Seavey. Instead of talking about the subject of the panel, Seavey went on a long rant about what an allegedly cruel person Andrews was, all of it televised by C-Span2. When it was posted on YouTube, the clip got half a million hits in the first 48 hours. The wave of vitriol against Andrews built over time and got more vicious. Andrews couldn’t find a job for 18 months. She eventually escaped to Australia, but when she released a think-tank report there, she was still attacked by an Australian member of Parliament because of the clip. It never goes away. “The more online shame cycles you observe,” Andrews writes, “the more obvious the pattern becomes: Everyone comes up with a principled-sounding pretext that serves as a barrier against admitting to themselves that, in fact, all they have really done is joined a mob. Once that barrier is erected, all rules of decency go out the window.” Most of us have certain stereotypes about the European far right — that it’s just a bunch of blood-and-soil racists. But in an essay in The New York Review of Books, “Two Roads for the New French Right,” Mark Lilla shows that there’s a lot more going on. He found a group of Catholic conservative intellectuals who argue that social conservatism is the only viable alternative to neoliberal cosmopolitanism and who are all fans of Bernie Sanders. They believe that both the European superstate and global capitalism undermine the cultural-religious foundations of European civilization. They are strongly environmentalist, feel that economic growth should be subordinated to social needs, believe in strong social support for the poor and limited immigration. As Lilla notes, they have a very coherent, communitarian worldview. I found the essay uplifting because it shows that in times of political transition, ideas get shuffled and reassembled in new and impressive ways. In a post called “How This All Happened” for the Collaborative Fund blog, Morgan Housel walks us through 73 years of American economic history. He shows us how many economic phases there have been. And how each phase led to something unexpected. “If you fell asleep in 1945 and woke up in 2018 you would not recognize the world around you. The amount of growth that took place during that period is virtually unprecedented. If you learned that there have been no nuclear attacks since 1945, you’d be shocked. If you saw the level of wealth in New York and San Francisco, you’d be shocked. If you compared it to the poverty of Detroit, you’d be shocked. If you saw the price of homes, college tuition, and health care, you’d be shocked. Our politics would blow your mind. And if you tried to think of a reasonable narrative of how it all happened, my guess is you’d be totally wrong.” In “How Did Larry Nassar Deceive So Many for So Long?” in The Cut, Kerry Howley blows up the conventional telling of the American gymnastics sex abuse scandal. The story is generally told as a large group of victims finding their voice and “breaking their silence.” But Howley shows that they were telling their stories all along, to every relevant authority. It’s because the abuser, Nassar, had built up an edifice of trust that people couldn’t see the monstrosity that was taking place literally in front of their eyes. Nassar abused many of these young girls while their parents were in the room. He just told them he was doing a medical procedure he called a “sacrotuberous-ligament release.” He might still be doing it today if a police officer hadn’t discovered his hard drives, with 37,000 child porn images on them. It was the hard drives that finally persuaded the world, not the women and their repeated warnings. Andrew Sullivan has forced me to do something I really don’t want to do — award two separate Sidney awards to the same writer in the same year. But his work for New York magazine this year has really defined the era. His two masterpieces are “The Poison We Pick,” on the opioid crisis, and “America’s New Religions,” on political fundamentalism. If you want to understand America in 2018, those essays are a good place to start. Another batch of Sidney winners will land Thursday.

2018,"Opinion | The Sidney Awards, Part II","Sex, foreign intrigue, faith, the corruption of ideas, and man-eating tigers, oh my — more great reading for edification and pleasure. Opinion Columnist In her essay “Why Are Young People Having So Little Sex?” Kate Julian takes a question that seems to have a simple answer (porn) and shows that it has a complex answer. In one striking part of the essay, which appeared in The Atlantic, Julian shows that fewer young people are having the kind of relationships that lead to sex. In 1995, 74 percent of 17-year-old women had had a special romantic relationship in the preceding 18 months. By 2014, only 46 percent of 17-year-olds had ever had a romantic relationship of any kind. Having lived much of their social life online, many young people expressed concern that they hadn’t developed the skills they needed to read possible partners in live, face-to-face situations. How do you tell if someone thinks you are special or just wants to be friends? In addition, nearly a fifth of Americans aged 18 to 29 believe that a man inviting a woman out for a drink “always” or “usually” constitutes sexual harassment. The essay is part of the second batch of this year’s Sidney Awards, which I give for outstanding long-form journalism. (The first group is here.) From The New Yorker, I recommend Dexter Filkins’s “A Saudi Prince’s Quest to Remake the Middle East.” In one essay, Filkins weaves together the Middle East’s geostrategic situation, its economic situation and how each of the major players, from Jared Kushner to Iran, is grasping for something. It’s all built around a profile of Mohammed bin Salman, the young Saudi leader. Years ago, M.B.S. asked a Saudi bureaucrat to help him appropriate a property. When the official said no, he received an envelope with a single bullet inside. Last year, M.B.S. replaced Mohammed bin Nayef as crown prince. Bin Nayef had been summoned to the palace and surrounded by guards. His cellphone was taken away and he was forced to stand for hours — in excruciating pain because of an old injury. Just before dawn, bin Nayef agreed to surrender his position. In “The Constitution of Knowledge,” in National Affairs, Jonathan Rauch argues that the marketplace of ideas is like a funnel. Millions of people float millions of hypotheses every day. Society collectively tests these ideas, bats them around or ignores them, and only a tiny few make it out the narrow end of the funnel, where they are declared useful or true. But, Rauch says, the funnel is no more. Internet trolls simply overwhelm the system with swarms of falsehood. There used to be an implicit honor code — truth exists, credentials matter, what hasn’t been tested isn’t knowledge — but the honor code has been swept away. Most fringe information used to get ignored. But today, it can’t be ignored because a lot of it is spewed by the president of the United States. Rauch shows that the national conversation had an architecture, which has now been reduced to sand. It’s hard to write about what religious faith feels like. Tish Harrison Warren does it compellingly in “True Story” in The Point. As a kid she just loved going to church. Then as an adult she learned about the church’s sins — the narcissism, abuse, sexism. But she still became an Anglican priest. The nice side of church, she writes, is the day-to-day goodness, the teenage boy still sweet enough to rest his head on his mother’s shoulder during the sermon, the young man who gives an elderly friend a ride, the way the members see themselves as a community of forgiven sinners. “Each Sunday during communion, when the members of my church come to the table, I watch their faces. Many tired. Some sad. Some lit up with joy. One kid who has special needs approaches me like he’s won the lottery. His voice rises, ‘Oh boy! Oh boy!’” Chinese art prices are through the roof. In 2010, a vase with a starting price of $800,000 sold in a suburban London auction for $69.5 million. Coincidentally, Chinese art is now routinely looted from Western art museums. In “The Great Chinese Art Heist,” in GQ, Alex Palmer walks us through these “Mission Impossible”-style robberies. He also captures the nationalist fervor driving the frenzy. Most of these pieces were looted from China centuries ago by foreign soldiers. The price of each piece is determined partly by quality, but also by how closely it is associated with one of China’s most inglorious defeats. Stealing the items back is nationalist revenge. I mentioned in my last column that there were several excellent essays this year on tigers. My favorite is “Man-eaters” in The Ringer, in which Brian Phillips explains: “The arrival of a tiger, it’s true, is often preceded by moments of rising tension, because a tiger’s presence changes the jungle around it, and those changes are easier to detect. Birdcalls darken. Small deer call softly to each other. Herds do not run but drift into shapes that suggest some emerging group consciousness of an escape route.” Sidney nominees are gathered by a completely haphazard, random process. But I couldn’t do it at all without the annual help of Robert Cottrell of The Browser; Robert Atwan, who directs the Best American Essays series; and Conor Friedersdorf, who produces a Best of Journalism newsletter each week.

2018,The Simplest Annuity Explainer We Could Write,"Your Money We define immediate annuities, fixed annuities, variable annuities and index annuities, plus give you questions to ask salespeople. Annuities can be complicated. This column will not be. After I wrote two weeks ago about getting tossed out of the office of an annuity salesman, there was a surprising clamor for more information about this room-clearing topic. One group of readers just wanted a basic explainer on how annuities work. For that, read on. Another group of readers worried that those hearing of my experience might assume that all annuities are bad, and that all people who sell them use subterfuge to do so. Neither of those is true: Next week, I’ll introduce you to some reasonable people who are trying to use certain annuities in new and improved ways. The insurance companies that create annuities often make them seem like investments. But really they’re more like insurance. At their simplest, annuities offer a guarantee. If you turn over some money, you’ll be guaranteed to get all that money back — plus usually a certain amount more. Or you turn over some money and you’ll be guaranteed a regular check for a certain period. Like insurance to stave off financial disaster, an annuity is something you purchase to guarantee that you won’t run out of money if you live a long time. Such financial guarantees are attractive. After all, we don’t know how our investments will perform: This year may be the first in a while that your stock and bond index funds both lose money. Still, annuities are not a mainstream product. This is partly the fault of the annuity companies, since they have long outsourced the sales process to people who do not always have customers’ best interests at heart. Word is out about how annuities are sometimes sold, and it’s not good. Another problem: The annuity product lineup has become so filled with complex offerings trying to solve every problem and answer any objection that the word “annuity” itself can mean lots of different things. I’ll divide them into four categories. Paycheck annuities are the simplest annuities, and they are kind of like a pension. You hand over a pile of money, and in exchange you can receive a regular check for life. An immediate income annuity generally starts sending checks very soon, and they keep coming until you die. What you get each month will depend in large part on how much money you hand over, your age, your sex, whether you’re including a spouse in the package (so the checks keep coming until the second person dies) and the prevailing interest rates at the time you buy the annuity. Deferred income annuities, also known as longevity insurance, work similarly, but the checks don’t start coming right away. The longer you wait to receive payments — you buy at 65 but don’t start collecting checks until 85, for example — the bigger the checks will be. There is risk involved with a deferred income annuity. Each year that you wait in between the purchase and the first check brings you closer to death, and the annuity company is betting on your eventual demise. The fun — broadly speaking — in annuities is beating the odds and collecting checks until you’re 105. Fixed annuities start the same way: You hand over some money. That money grows for a predetermined period at a rate that is relatively easy to explain and understand (that’s the “fixed” part); then you can turn it into a regular check for life if you’d like. Sometimes, the amount that the annuity company credits to your account will change once per year based on prevailing interest rates. Other times, in the case of multiyear guaranteed annuities, it works more like a certificate of deposit — you will know exactly how much money you’ll accumulate over time. These annuities tend to run longer than standard certificates of deposit. Variable annuities exist for people who want to have their cake and eat it, too. They can offer a guaranteed check for life with a promise that they won’t lose money. But variable annuity buyers can get more money than the baseline minimum, depending on how certain mutual funds that they select perform. The annuities I described above don’t give their owners access to the stock market. But variable annuities come with what are known as sub-accounts that can. That access comes at a price, though. The fees here also tend to be so high that they have been the subject of many investor alerts from regulators over the years. My colleague Tara Siegel Bernard explained variable annuities in more detail in 2015. The last type of annuity is the equity indexed annuity, which is the type that the salesman I met a few weeks ago was selling at a steak dinner he held for people contemplating retirement strategies. With an equity index annuity, you still receive a guarantee that you’ll get your money back. And if the equity index — say, the S&P 500 — goes up, the annuity company will credit a portion of that to your account. Not only is your gain usually just a percentage of the actual gain, the overall amount you get in any year might be subject to a cap and additional costs. Any decision you make about an annuity is bound to be important, given how much money the person selling it will most likely ask you for. But much of the background reading on the topic is dull and confusing. So here are three things that I actually enjoyed reading and made me think harder. One of them, “Annuity Insights,” comes from Fisher Investments. They don’t like annuities very much over there, and make money managing other kinds of investments. The other two come from academics I’ve spoken to who do think certain annuities are worth considering, and both have other jobs that could earn them more money if more people buy annuities. The first, “Fixed Index Annuities: Consider the Alternative,” by a Yale professor, Roger G. Ibbotson, explains how some index annuities could help people in a rising interest rate environment. He is chairman of an investment firm that could receive compensation for licensing rights to indexes that annuity firms might use. The second, “Annuity Fables: Some Observations From an Ivory Tower,” appeared in the Journal of Financial Planning and was written by Moshe A. Milevsky of York University in Toronto. It is more of an omnibus piece about the mean things people often say about annuities and whether they are true. Professor Milevsky has a variety of consulting engagements related to the products. Even within the above categories, annuities can vary radically. There is almost no end to the bells and whistles and levers and switches. So I wouldn’t buy even the simplest one without reading the contract three times and hiring someone for a second opinion about whether an annuity really fits my overall financial strategy. Then come questions, lots of them, for which you should demand answers in writing: What happens if I suddenly need some or all of my money back? What happens with the annuity if I die? What taxes will I pay? Aren’t you going to spend hours asking me about my assets, goals, dreams and fears before you sell me something this important? And will you agree to act in my best interest — as a so-called fiduciary — and sign a pledge saying so? If not, why not? The questions don’t end there. What are all the circumstances under which I might not get back the money I am handing over? What part of the contract might limit or change how much money I eventually receive? What can change during the term of the contract? Is there any possibility that payments could increase with inflation? Must I take a monthly or other regular payment at any point during the term of the annuity, or is it merely an option? Finally, can you please provide a list of all the fees I’m paying? And what are you earning in commission from this sale? These questions are easy enough to understand. If the replies aren’t equally simple, you should walk away. Given the stakes in any annuity sale, you should feel a strong sense of entitlement to clear, direct answers. Are you using annuities in new and improved ways?

2018,Opinion | The Solace of Birds in Winter,"Nature offers its own consolations in the darkest days of the year. Contributing Opinion Writer NASHVILLE — In the search for comfort in the face of so many 21st-century dangers — to democracy in the age of fake news, to the natural world in the age of climate change — I don’t normally think of winter as offering much in the way of consolation. Many of the most interesting creatures have gone to ground now. The cheery chipmunks are asleep in their tunnels beneath my house. The queen bumblebees have made themselves a little sleeping chamber deep in the soil of my garden. Somewhere nearby, the resident rat snake is also sleeping underground, and, at the park, the snapping turtles and bullfrogs have settled themselves into the mud at the bottom of the lake. All the loveliest insects are gone now, too. The honeybees are huddled up in their hives, vibrating their wings to keep warm and feeding on the honey they’ve stored for just this reason. The monarch butterflies have long since migrated to their Mexican wintering grounds. My flower beds are nothing but a jumble of dried stems and matted clumps, a collection of dead vegetation I’ve left undisturbed for my tiniest neighbors to shelter in. But even remembering the purpose behind this untidiness, I take no comfort from my garden anymore. I miss the singing most of all. During winter we still have songbirds in Middle Tennessee, some of them yearlong residents and some of them visitors passing time until they can return to their nesting grounds to the north. But songbirds rarely sing in winter. Yes, the fussy chickadees still call out to defend their claim on the feeders in my yard. And the Carolina wrens that nest every summer in the hanging ferns under the eaves will sometimes stand on a fence post and chirrup their own irritation into the gray sky. But it’s not the same as waking into a morning full of bird song. A walk in the woods is an exercise in near silence now, the only sounds my own lumbering footfall and the huff of my breath on an uphill path. And yet. Winter can be the best time of year for backyard bird-watching. The mockingbirds are finally interested in the suet balls they disdained all summer, and the gorgeous blue jays, their bright colors even bluer against the sepia backdrop of winter, carry away the unshelled nuts I set along the deck rail for squirrels. The tiny dark-eyed juncos that spent all summer in the Far North are back now, hopping around in the leaf litter, picking up the safflower seeds the tufted titmice push out of the feeder in their search for the sunflower seeds they prefer. Now the downy woodpeckers, with their striped wings and their tidy red caps, come and go from the peanut feeder, not nearly so cautious in my presence as in the days of summertime plenty. They swoop to their feast with the characteristic undulating flight of their kind. If I ever get around to hanging Christmas garland this year, I will try arrange it in a way that mimics the exact arc of their flight. On especially cold mornings, when bitter temperatures overnight have frozen all the puddles, every songbird in Middle Tennessee, it seems, comes to my back deck to enjoy the heated birdbath. One morning last week I looked out the window and saw six bluebirds gathered in a ring around the edge of it, dipping their beaks into the bowl over and over again while the air above the heated water puffed into fog in the cold. In winter the neighborhood hawk sits still in the bare branches of trees, a perch where she is invisible to me at any other time of year. Now I can see even the claws on her great yellow feet extending beyond the fluffed feathers she has drawn around them. The neighborhood crows know very well that she is there, and they have a few furious words for her as she waits, calmly surveying them as they swoop around her head, close but not too close. Despite their legendary intelligence, I have my issues with crows. Opportunistic omnivores, they will poach the young from songbird nests. In the spring and fall migrations, they will even devour the exhausted songbirds themselves. But in winter, the crows become my favorites again. They are perfectly designed for this season, black against a gray sky, a three-dimensional silhouette. Unlike other birds, crows continue to speak to one another throughout the coldest days. American crows remain together as a family through the seasons, with the parents and the young from several nesting years cooperating to find food and fend off predators. I stand in my yard and watch them grooming one another in the high branches: One crow will nibble at another crow’s head or neck, and the other crow will tilt its face this way and that, presenting the itchy places for attention, one by one. Sometimes they simply sit in the branches and call out, one to another, deep in conversation, a talk that continues even as they fly toward their roost in the last light of these short days. The crow’s “Caw!” is immediately recognizable to the human ear, but the birds actually have more than 20 different calls, not even counting the “subsong” sounds they make: clacking and cooing and rattling and clicking. I don’t know what the crows are saying to the other crows, but I like to listen in anyway. It’s a gift to watch them living their intricate lives so visibly now that the trees are bare again. This is their world, though it overlaps with mine, and I have no trouble understanding what they are saying to the red-tailed hawk: “Away! Go away!” It may be their message for me as well.",The New York Times
2018,The Sound of Silence,"DOMAINS How many crazy gizmos are needed to achieve your optimum sleep environment? On winter nights, the white-noise app on my phone is tuned to Air Conditioner: a raspy, metallic whir that sounds like the mechanical noise that might echo deep inside the ductwork of a huge commercial building. (Among the app’s other offerings are Dishwasher Rinsing, Crowded Room and Vacuum Cleaner.) It lulls me to sleep nonetheless, because it blankets the din in my apartment (the ragged snore of a roommate; the clanking of the steam radiator; the cat’s skidding pursuit of something only he can see). It may also soothe because it replicates an early sound environment, probably that of a Manhattan childhood, though perhaps it suggests something much, much older. Some sleep experts note that babies, their ears accustomed to the whisper of the maternal circulatory system and the slosh of the womb, sleep better accompanied by a device that mimics those familiar whooshings. My app is but one note in the mighty chorus of white-noise generators, an exploding industry of mechanical and digital devices; apps and websites, and Sonos and Spotify playlists that grows ever more refined, as if to block out the increased rate of speeding, the wrecks, on the information superhighway. Car Interior? Oil Tanker? Laundromat? These ballads are in the vast soundscape library created by Stéphane Pigeon, a Belgian electrical engineer, and ready to play on Mynoise.net, a sound generator he put online in 2013 that now has one million page views each month. It’s a nearly philanthropic enterprise, as it runs on donations. “I have enough stress,” Dr. Pigeon said. Reddit, among other message boards, offers D.I.Y. white-noise hacks for light sleepers, shift workers and tinnitus sufferers. Rough up the blades of a box fan with a box cutter, suggested Christopher Suarez, a field service technician from Riverside, Calif., whose wife is an insomniac, on one captivating thread there. The first so-called domestic white-noise machine may have been built in 1962, by a traveling salesman whose wife grew used to the air-conditioners in the motels they frequented and was unable to sleep at home. But white noise was identified by engineers as early as the 1920s, Dr. Pigeon said, and used as a test signal because, as he put it, “it’s the sum of all the audible frequencies in equal proportion in a single sound. It’s so named because of its analogy to light, which turns white when all visible frequencies are summed up into a single beam.” Back home in his garage, Jim Buckwalter, the salesman, set a turntable and a fan blade into a dog bowl insulated by some foam, and invented the Marpac Sleep-Mate, now called the Dohm ($40 on Amazon), a gizmo whose popularity grew by word of mouth and became a favorite not just of light sleepers, but also of psychotherapists, the legal and medical community, and others seeking to mask confidential conversations. (Nothing says 1980s-era Upper West Side analysis like the whispery hiss of a mushroom-shaped Dohm.) Sound purists adore it, because its mechanical whirring is closer to truly random and contains no loop, as many digital versions do. Fred Maher is a veteran music producer and drummer who works as an audio engineer and audio-quality tester. He has what are considered golden ears, meaning he is an expert listener who can spot audio errors in music, film and television content. He also suffers from tinnitus, a condition he soothed for years with machines like the Dohm. (That device is now in the bedroom of his 6-year-old daughter, Ruby.) White noise, he wrote in an email, “is one of the first things we hear from our first moment of existence, in utero (not the Nirvana album). It’s what you hear in a seashell, kind of. The seashell is a mechanical filter that focuses and amplifies ambient noise.” Sleep is inherently dangerous, said Rafael Pelayo, a clinical professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Stanford Center for Sleep Sciences and Medicine. This is why we are wired to sort sounds as we sleep, he said, to differentiate the threats, or a baby’s cry, from more benign noises. “How can a mother feed her baby if the ability to wake up is not wired into our brain?” Dr. Pelayo said. “The thalamus needs to decide if a noise is worth informing the cortex. There’s a concept in sleep called the arousal threshold — it’s the stimulus you need to go from a deep sleep to awake. It can be a loud noise, like a garbage truck, or something soft, like your partner saying, ‘Honey, I think there’s a burglar in the house.’ The idea of a noise generator is to raise the background noise so you don’t notice the sounds that aren’t worth your attention: a snoring partner or the hotel elevator.” Dr. Pelayo is on the board of Adaptive Sound Technologies, which makes Lectrofan ($50 on Amazon), a digital, but nonlooping, version of the old analog noise machines, but he stressed that Stanford does not endorse products. There is no data that suggests a white-noise machine alters the frequencies of the brain, said Param Dedhia, the director of sleep medicine at the Canyon Ranch in Tucson. “But we can show that if you make a loud sound, you can affect your response to that with a noise machine. It’s called auditory masking.” Dr. Dedhia described its effects as a sound bubble, “a force field of sound such that a noise has to be much stronger to break through.” Dr. Dedhia has deployed Marpac Dohms in the bedrooms at Canyon Ranch, and also in his home, because the pool there draws an army of bullfrogs after dark. Their nightly chorus drives him bananas. “Oh, my friend,” he said, “it sounds like someone dying. I used to get my hose and spray them off the sides of the pool, but they soon were on to me, and after a while just hopped back on. So now I have my humidifier running, and the white noise right next to the bed. It’s my sound bubble. We don’t have to have a bug or pill for every ill if we can soothe ourselves. It’s a skill, it really is. If we could all self-soothe, it would make it easier to handle other chaos.” What is noise, anyway? Dr. Dedhia likes this definition, from the authors of a sleep study: “Noise is defined as unwanted sounds that could have negative psychological and physiological effects.” Noise is terribly subjective. There are those who love the croak of a bullfrog, and are soothed by the snores of their partner because it means they are close. Dr. Pigeon allowed that snoring was particularly tough to mask, given its locality (next to your head) and unpredictability (your ears crane for the next growl or explosive sigh). “You must convince yourself the sound of snoring is beautiful,” he said. “I have some people who asked me to put snoring on the website because they are used to sleeping with a partner snoring, and when that partner is gone — traveling or divorced or dead — they miss that sound.” “I have some snoring hidden in one of the generators,” he said. “It’s called Berber Tent. It’s an attempt to take you on a nice story. You are in the desert on vacation and it has been a very warm day and you are all snoozing in the tent together while food is prepared. You can hear the breeze, and the tent flapping and the sound of a man snoring. I didn’t set out to do that, but I always am waiting for opportunities and I was on a trek and I heard it and I taped it. I think if you imagine a beautiful young Berber sleeping next to you, it will change your mind.” Worth a try. An insomniac himself, Dr. Pigeon is not soothed by his soundscapes because he knows them by heart and will fret over dissonances only he can perceive. “A particular wave on the Irish Coast that crashes too loudly, or a bird that sings in the wrong place,” he said. “I have a brain that can’t stop working,” he added sadly. “I haven’t found a way to stop its chatter.” Is the world noisier? New York City certainly is. In 2016, there were 420,000 complaints to 311, the city’s hotline for nonemergency services, more than twice as many as there were in 2011. An analysis of that noise data by The New York Times revealed that bad behavior — loud music and parties — made up the majority of the complaints, followed by banging and pounding sounds. Alan Fierstein, an acoustic consultant and noise-abatement expert who has been measuring New York City’s clamor for over four decades, said that the city is empirically noisier because there’s just more of everything. More construction, more cars, more people and, most important, more attitude. “One man’s castle is usually above another man’s castle,” Mr. Fierstein said. “You have this huge amount of real-estate appreciation, and people are paying a lot of money and as a result they feel like they can do what they want.” Many co-ops and condominiums are now requiring, he said, that an acoustical consultant like himself attest that a proposed renovation, “with its media rooms and central air-conditioning, and apartment combinations that put his fancy new kitchen over your son’s bedroom,” will not produce any undue noises. Mr. Fierstein can design noise programs that are perfectly tuned to block the pure tones, as he put it, of outside irritants, like bus noises or building mechanicals, that can be played on any speaker system. (He described a pure tone as any sound that has a specific and constant musical pitch, and then demonstrated by making a high beeping noise into the phone.) “The way to block a noise is not to be as loud or louder” than the offending sound, he said. “You also have to produce sound that’s on the same frequency. One of the things that makes noise so unreasonable is the lack of control. You can’t stand your neighbor’s loud music even if it’s your favorite artist. One benefit of masking noise is that you can call it your own.” Recently Mr. Fierstein was called in to mediate a dispute between two neighbors, one of whom was so irked by the sound of the other’s air-conditioner that he positioned eight white-noise machines throughout his studio apartment, the noise of which then annoyed the air-conditioner man. It was the noise-machine man who sent for Mr. Fierstein. His report noted that the air-conditioner, a window unit, was emitting “audible pure tones,” he said, and may have been improperly mounted, shaking the framing of the building. That would be a win for noise-machine man, though the building’s management has yet to weigh in. Mr. Suarez, the technician whose recipe for a roughed-up box fan appeared on Reddit, suggested that the increased racket we hear is more often living in our heads. The noises we use to “quiet” them are a kind of placebo, he said. Mr. Suarez noted the constant commotions of the news cycle and social media, and made the point that we don’t do enough physical activities during the day to dissipate our energies. “Even if you turn off the pings on your phone and turn away from your devices,” he said, speaking from his van as he drove to a job, “you’re still thinking, ‘What’s happening with Facebook? With Congress?’ There is so much going on, and so little resolution. When was the last time you heard the end of a story?”",The New York Times
2018,The South Asian Artists Making Their Mark on the Western Scene,"Women from India, Pakistan and beyond are finally gaining recognition thanks to a spate of recent and coming museum shows. In Ranjani Shettar’s installation “Seven Ponds and a Few Raindrops,” looping, delicate steel forms covered in tamarind-stained muslin sway ominously in midair, evocative of parched flora or exoskeletons. Reimagining local craft traditions to create abstract sculptures, the Indian artist’s work, which was on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art this summer, speaks elegiacally to environmental loss, to historic relationships with the earth and to future uncertainties. While visually distinct, the installation at the Met couldn’t help but be in conversation with another: “We Come in Peace,” Huma Bhabha’s much-photographed two-part sculpture of a figure shrouded in a black garbage bag prostrating before a godlike giant, which conjures a haunting narrative of war and brutality, and of our ongoing grappling with the other. Shettar and Bhabha share a commitment to materiality, to sculptural innovation and to work that responds to the precariousness of our current day. They are also among a select group of women who are forging new narratives about contemporary South Asian art — and receiving unprecedented attention from major institutions in the United States. “Ten years ago, museums were not looking at us at all,” says Aparajita Jain, who directs Delhi’s renowned Nature Morte gallery and works with many increasingly prominent South Asian artists, including Benitha Perciyal, Reena Saini Kallat and Gauri Gill, whose dreamlike photographs exploring indigenous communities and social class were on display at MoMA PS1 this summer. “They’ve suddenly said, ‘Oh wow, there is a lot going on here.’” Before 2013, neither the Met, the Museum of Modern Art, nor the Guggenheim had featured a solo exhibition of a South Asian woman. While some have been present in occasional regional surveys — primarily at institutions like the Asia Society and the Queens Museum (where the influential 1997 exhibition “Out of India” helped introduce contemporary art from the subcontinent to U.S. audiences) — Jain believes those group shows were often reductive. “It was a basic overview, a 30,000-foot view,” she says. “Now, there’s a much deeper conversation going on.” That’s evident in a cluster of solo shows in New York and beyond. This year, Bharti Kher’s tender sketchbooks on gender, motherhood and the body were up at Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, where a large survey of Huma Bhabha’s work will open at the Institute of Contemporary Art in March. Next summer, the Met Breuer, which opened in 2016 with a retrospective of the work of the radical Indian minimalist Nasreen Mohamedi, will pay tribute to the work of another groundbreaking South Asian woman — Mrinalini Mukherjee. Additionally, MoMA recently acquired a monumental photographic installation by Dayanita Singh, a selection of empathetic and wry photographs by Ketaki Sheth and a major work by Sheela Gowda, who transforms found local materials into stirring meditations on labor and marginality. According to Shanay Jhaveri, the Met curator behind the Shettar and Bhabha installations, a heightened focus on South Asian women flows from American museums actively thinking more globally and beginning to reckon with long-held blind spots. Indeed, Jhaveri’s mere presence is evidence of what he calls a “concerted effort” on the Met’s part: Brought on in 2016, he’s the museum’s first curator of South Asian modern and contemporary art, one of a number of newly created positions focusing on the non-Western world. “What’s happening is a reconsideration of our received art histories,” Jhaveri says. “Part of that is an acknowledgment that there are a number of female artistic practices that have been overlooked, marginalized or forgotten.” Another explanation may lie in the vicissitudes of the art market. In the mid-2000s, amid an accelerating economy and eagerness about emerging markets, Indian contemporary art was deemed a booming industry. Dominating the scene were a handful of artists — mostly men — who projected characteristics of South Asia in art-fair friendly ways: enormous installations comprising Indian cooking vessels, large-scale pop renderings of deities; a rickshaw made of bones. (As the New York Times art critic Roberta Smith wrote, this was work that looked “just the way successful global art is supposed to: sleek, smart and familiar yet exotic.”) Speculators drove up prices until works regularly sold for millions. In 2008, though, the financial crisis hit and the bubble burst. Values plummeted, investors fled and collectors backed away. In the decade since, the market has remained cautious. But diminishing commercial pressures seem to have created room for complexity and nuance — for women, for artists who truly expand conceptions of what South Asian art can be. “Before 2008, it was like, ‘The next hot spot is India and we must figure it out,’” says Jain. “Now, institutions are finally recognizing these people as artists and not only as the next wave.” The shift is also apparent in South Asia itself. The last decade has seen the emergence of the Kochi-Muziris Biennale, the Dhaka Art Summit and the Lahore Biennale; private contemporary art institutions like the Kiran Nadar Museum; galleries and arts spaces (many run by women); and a new generation of scholars and critics. This increasingly vibrant regional activity facilitates access and depth of understanding for those abroad. In addition to directing Nature Morte gallery, Jain runs Saat Saath Arts, a foundation devoted to bringing international curators to India. “To understand an Indian artist, you have to land in a place like Delhi or Mumbai, navigate the streets to some nondescript little cubbyhole of a studio where the artist is working,” she says. “We want to make it easy for them.” If the spate of American exhibitions in the United States by South Asian women is any indication, these parallel energies — deeper interest from American museums, a canny push from South Asian practitioners — are having a real effect. But of course, the latest iteration of the trend still comes with pitfalls, as grouping a diverse array of South Asian women artists into a single story of progress risks othering them further, as well as flattening their work in precisely the ways they reject. And yet, the combination of institution-level shifts in the United States, a robust women-led contemporary arts infrastructure in South Asia and ongoing cultural conversations about meaningful inclusion and representation, do seem to be creating the conditions for more sustained engagement. “I’m so wary when people talk about moments in art,” says Sarah Burney, an independent curator in New York and former board member of the South Asian Women’s Creative Collective. “It really reduces it to this one thing that’s happening now. What happened in 2008, that felt like a moment. This does not feel like a moment.” Perhaps because moments have to come to an end. This doesn’t.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Special Misogyny Reserved for Mothers,"Motherhood is the most complex topic I have ever reported on. And yet it has been treated as niche and unimportant. Ms. Frank created the podcast “The Longest Shortest Time.” I’m one of the lucky ones in radio. Nobody called my voice whiny (at least not that I heard). Nobody accused me of uptalk or vocal fry — all the insults people tend to hurl at women in broadcasting. No editor told me my ideas were unrelatable. Sure, I had pieces killed, but my editors always explained the reason, and the reason made sense to me. If you’d asked me back then if I was a feminist, I might’ve shrugged and said, “I don’t know.” To be honest, I thought the word was a bit of an insult. In 2010, my luck changed. That’s the year I became a mother. My daughter arrived healthy, but I was injured so severely that I was unable to walk for two months. I spent eight solid weeks on an air mattress because I couldn’t handle the stairs to the bedroom. Here I was with a baby — one I’d wanted very much — but I felt completely unable to care for her. The worst part was, I barely had anybody to talk to about it. Most of my friends hadn’t had babies yet and I didn’t want to scare them. This is, in part, what led me to start working on a podcast about parenting called “The Longest Shortest Time.” I’ve been making it for eight years now. I have learned a lot. That parents can be civil with one another on the internet. That naming an episode “Boobs” will make it your most popular one ever. And that there is a special kind of misogyny reserved for mothers. When I started the show, you couldn’t make a living making a podcast, so I needed to get some episodes on the radio. I sent a sampling to my longtime editor at a big public radio station. He said he was into it but couldn’t get the higher-ups to bite. “It’s weird,” he said sheepishly. “One of them said you sound like a little girl.” Even when I was a little girl, I didn’t sound like a little girl. I listened to the clips again, trying to figure out what seemed little-girlish. The only answer I could come up with, the thing that set this work apart from my previous work, is that I — and the other women I was interviewing — sounded a little emotional. A little angry. A little raw. These are the qualities that supposedly make radio powerful. Was it being mothers that made us sound weak? I met rejection after rejection. “We’re just not sure there’s enough of an audience for this kind of thing,” an editor said. “This is just too … small,” another said. One guy put it more bluntly: “Who would want to listen to this except for moms?” So this bias was definitely about moms. But it’s a really ignorant bias to have. Let’s just imagine it’s true that only moms would ever want to listen to stories about moms. Hooray, you’re in business. Moms are one of the most coveted demographics for advertisers. But it’s also nonsense to say that stories about moms are not relatable. I don’t hear anyone fretting over whether “99 Percent Invisible” listeners are all architects or “Radiolab” listeners are all scientists. In story-based reporting, this is what we do: We take the specific and we present it in a compelling way, to make other humans connect with it. I made the show for three years — and raised tens of thousands of dollars on Kickstarter — before big shops got interested. Eventually I was picked up by WNYC and then Stitcher. In the past few years, motherhood has become a boom market, with publishers churning out books on the complicated realities of pregnancy, life with kids, or choosing not to have them at all. But back then, many of the concerns of motherhood still seemed unpopular, if not downright taboo. In 2015, I wanted to do an episode about childbirth injuries that I could also pitch to a network radio show. Most of these injuries can be remedied by pelvic floor physical therapy, but doctors rarely recommend it, or even know about it. I wanted to investigate why so many moms were living with pelvic pain for months — years, even — after giving birth, resigned to painful sex or no sex at all. When I pitched a public radio editor, she told me it was an interesting topic but that you just can’t talk about something that sexually explicit on the air. I brought the story to another radio editor, this time with an economic peg. I told him the question I wanted to ask was: What is the cost of saving a mom’s sex life? He told me he wouldn’t commission the story because the answer to why we don’t prioritize pain-free sex is that sex is extra. It’s not essential. And yet, if you type “erectile” into the search bar on NPR’s website, you get a plethora of results. In 1998, we learned about the new popularity of Viagra, the “magic pill for impotence.” In 2008, NPR assessed a decade of Viagra. And in 2014, we got “Love and Sex in the Time of Viagra — 16 Years On.” In between, dozens of pieces mention erectile dysfunction. When you talk about male sexual dysfunction, you’re talking about problems with arousal. When you talk about childbirth injuries, you’re talking about problems with chronic pain. From a health perspective, one talk seems much more essential than the other. And it doesn’t involve discussing boners. NPR. It has driven me to feminism. Motherhood is the biggest, most complex topic I have ever reported on. I’ve had the honor of interviewing a pregnant transgender man, a mixed-race kid who schools her white mom on what it means to be black via freestyle rap, and Terry Gross of “Fresh Air” on why she chose not to have children. And yet it has been treated as small, niche and unimportant, and covering it has changed how I am treated by my colleagues. The only time I’ve been sexually harassed at work happened a few years ago, when an award-winning producer I had never met drunkenly approached me at a hotel bar during a conference. “I know you,” he said. “You’re the baby lady.” “I guess,” I said. He shouted gleefully, “I’m going to give you a baby!” “I already have one of those,” I said, backing away. “No,” he yelled in my face, “I’m going to give you a baby tonight! I’m going to take you upstairs and give you a baby tonight!” Fortunately, a few of his co-workers pulled him off me and I ran away. In this guy’s eyes, I wasn’t a radio maker; I was a baby maker. A while back, I was interviewed for another podcast. When I declined to answer some personal questions about my parenting life, the host challenged me. He suggested that people might expect to hear from me about why I had only one child, for example, because I was one of the most prominent moms out there. What I wish I’d said back is, “No, I’m one of the most prominent podcasters.” Hillary Frank is the creator of the podcast “The Longest Shortest Time” and the author, most recently of “Weird Parenting Wins: Bathtub Dining, Family Screams, and Other Hacks From the Parenting Trenches.” Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.",The New York Times
2018,The Spiritual Life of Arthur Conan Doyle,"The Literati As a young doctor living in England in the 1880s, Arthur Conan Doyle began attending séances where mediums offered contact with the dead. He also observed displays of psychic telepathy, automatic writing and table tipping, and became convinced that there was an unseen world out there. A lapsed Catholic, he now announced himself a Spiritualist, but did not begin proselytizing for his new creed until World War I. The deaths of his oldest son, Kingsley (in 1918), his brother (the following year) and two nephews (shortly after the war) led him to embrace Spiritualism with all his heart, convinced it was a “New Revelation” delivered by God to console the bereaved. In 1920, Conan Doyle, now long famous as the creator of Sherlock Holmes, received a letter from an excited friend who was in possession of a photograph in which tiny females with diaphanous wings are cavorting in front of an entranced adolescent girl. The girl was 16-year-old Elsie Wright, who lived near the village of Cottingley in Yorkshire, and the photo had been taken by her 10-year-old cousin, Frances. The girls reported having previously seen the fairies by a stream and then gone back with a camera borrowed from Elsie’s father so Frances could take a picture of her with the mystical creatures. Had Sherlock Holmes seen that initial image, he would no doubt have noticed that although a breeze had caused the leaves on the trees to blur, the wings of the flying fairies showed no movement. Conan Doyle, however, regarded the photograph as genuine. When more photographs of fairies showed up the same year, he wrote two articles and a nonfiction book, “The Coming of the Fairies,” in which he insisted that the figures depicted were actual fairies. His belief earned him condemnation from the press, the public and, ironically, Christian churches, whose own belief system encompassed winged angels and devils. The writer remained convinced of the existence of fairies until his death in 1930. Both his family and Spiritualist friends refused to wear mourning clothes to the funeral as a way of expressing their conviction that the author had simply moved on to exist in another dimension. Six thousand people crowded into Albert Hall that day, many hoping that their departed mentor would make contact. His widow was not alone in swearing he did. In 1983, a much older Elsie Wright finally owned up to the hoax: She had cut the fairies out of an illustrated children’s book and then held them up with invisible threads so Frances could photograph her smiling at the cutout. Regrettably Elsie did not live long enough for the world to witness what she could have done with Photoshop.",The New York Times
2018,"The Squishiest, Sweetest Sleep","domains The inventor of the water bed is reprising and updating it for a Casper world. The original design for the water bed by Charles Hall.CreditCreditvia Charles Hall He used Jell-O and cornstarch at first, but the squashy gunk, poured into a vinyl bladder, was too heavy to move. And it began to stink after a few days. Then he tried water. “Rancid Jell-O Led to First Water Bed,” a newspaper headline proclaimed at the time. It was 1967, the Summer of Love, and Charles Hall, a student at San Francisco State University, was experimenting with flotation furniture, as he called it then, for an engineering class. (He got an “A.”) The following year, after some tweaks, his eight-foot-square heated “Pleasure Pit” debuted at a gallery on Leavenworth Street, as part of a show called “The Happy Happening.” Mr. Hall was living in Haight-Ashbury, in an apartment in a listing Victorian that rented for $67. It was August, a slow news cycle, Mr. Hall recalled, and the Pleasure Pit made news around the country. It was Mr. Hall’s idea that the contraption was both bed and chair, the only piece of furniture you’d ever need. Mattress companies rebuffed him in those early days, as did department stores, so he sold it himself, using his Rambler station wagon to deliver beds to local head shops, a member of Jefferson Airplane, a Smothers brother (he can’t remember which), a nudist colony (which bought two) and, inevitably, Hugh Hefner, who ordered one for the Playboy Mansion, upholstered in green velvet. “I think it got a lot of use there,” Mr. Hall said. But he himself was no sybarite; he was earnest about his invention’s benefits: how weightlessness contributed to health and well-being. “I was trying to make a better sleep experience,” he said. Eventually Mr. Hall and a partner found investors, and their company, Innerspace Environments, opened more than 30 stores throughout California. Though Mr. Hall patented his heated, lined version, which he sold on a sturdy redwood frame, there were many, many imitators, offering cheaply made, leak-prone knockoffs for a fraction of the cost. The first “Pleasure Bed,” as Mr. Hall called his model, went for $350. Mr. Hall remembered one shady seller whose product line also included “orgy butter” and fake theological doctoral degrees. There were rumors of electrocutions, and floors collapsing from the weight of all that water pouring out of defective mattresses (a king-size bed might weigh as much as 2,300 pounds, some newspapers reported); landlords got the jimjams. (In New York City, they remain leery: Most standard leases still contain a “no-water-bed rider,” said Zach Gutierrez, a consultant at Cityrealty.com, which collects real estate data.) By 1975, Mr. Hall’s company was in bankruptcy, not because of the competition, he said, but rather mismanagement by his investors, and he had moved on to other ventures like solar showers, inflatable kayaks and camping mattresses. The water bed evolved nonetheless, shaking off its sleazy associations as a lame sexual prop and sight gag. By 1984, Waterbed Magazine fretted that its customers were aging, “edging toward the 40-year old category.” In 1986, according to the Waterbed Manufacturers Association, water bed sales reached nearly $2 billion — between 12 and 15 percent of the American mattress market — and retailers like Waterbed City, based in South Florida, were making millions of dollars. While Mr. Hall was always touted as the father of the industry, he did not share in those riches, though he continued to advise a number of companies, and to design improvements to the original product, as did others. Gone were the shin-nicking wooden frames, and the early sloshings, as water beds went waveless and mainstream, encased in soft-edged mattress forms that looked just like their coil-filled cousins. You could buy baby water beds, and suites of water bed furniture, including one wince-making number in dark wood paneling, the “Captain Pedestal,” that looked like a high boy married to a schooner. By 1991, one of every five mattresses sold was a water bed. That same year, Mr. Hall won a lawsuit against a Taiwanese manufacturer for patent infringement. A jury awarded him $4.8 million, plus interest, which he shared with investors who had chipped in for his legal fees. “It was about the principle of the thing more than anything else,” he said. Yet only a few years later, water beds had lost their luster. Traditional mattress companies figured out how to approximate the comforts of a water bed with pillow tops and foam, and most people turned away, though there were stalwarts who clung to their vinyl oddities like gear heads with an eight-track. Water-bed manufacturers found other markets, like dairy-cow farmers, who had discovered that the soft structures protect their generally prone animals’ joints (dairy cows do their best work lying down). Wistful articles began to appear about the dwindling number of water-bed salesmen, and their loyal, aging customers. Last year, someone started a GoFundMe campaign to buy a bed from a dealer in Tampa, Fla., who was planning to shutter his 46-year-old business, raising $167. One staunch holdout is Roland Formica, who opened his water-bed business, Odds-N-Ends, just north of Berkeley, Calif., in 1969 (he also sold antiques, leather goods and head shop accouterments). Though he closed his physical storefront in 2016, he continues to sell water beds online, nearly 50 this year, along with parts. “A lonely soldier,” is how Allen Salkin, a New York Times reporter who had grown up on a water bed (a bar mitzvah present, and it vibrated), described Mr. Formica in a 2003 profile. (Six years ago, Mr. Salkin broke down and bought a water bed from Mr. Formica for his Lower East Side apartment; it is currently for sale, however, since his girlfriend has vetoed its move to their new home in California.) “If I sell you a bed,” Mr. Formica said the other day, “you’re not going to need another for 10 or 15 years. They last forever. Who the hell would go into a business like that? It’s a predicament.” On a recent stormy afternoon, Mr. Hall, now 75, sat in the glassy living room of his pristine bungalow on Bainbridge Island, Wash., overlooking Puget Sound and showed off his water-bed scrapbook, a kitschy trove of vintage print media. There were brochures for Innerspace Environments that promised in purple prose that the water bed, its photo accessorized with the requisite female nude, was “a friend in love with you, beckoning you to grovel in rapturous sensual splendor.” There was a copy of Maxim magazine’s history of sex — “four billion years of quality nookie” — which noted Mr. Hall’s patent application. Playboy’s May 1971 issue showcased his velvet upholstered number, along with a glowing Lucite version made by Bloomingdale’s. It was the 50th anniversary, more or less, of the water bed’s beginnings, and Mr. Hall, a soft-spoken man in a gray fleece and bluejeans, was newly bullish on his invention, which he has reprised and updated for a Casper world. Three years ago, two of Mr. Hall’s long-ago colleagues, Keith Koenig of City Furniture (né Waterbed City) and Michael Geraghty, a former water-bed manufacturer whose company was bought by Sealy and who has sent water beds to burn victims in Russia, decided, as Mr. Koenig said, “that it was time. I said to Michael, ‘Get Charlie!’” Mr. Hall’s next-gen water bed is called Afloat. A queen-size bed costs $1,995 to $2,395, which includes a heater, a kit to fill it up and drain it (a 25-foot hose is included) and a metal frame. A canvas sling helps to heft the deflated mattress around. (An unfilled queen weighs about 40 pounds; with water, it’s about 1,200 pounds. All Afloat beds fall within building-code floor-loading requirements, Mr. Geraghty said, adding that 1,200 pounds is roughly equivalent to six or seven people sitting around your dining room table.) Since July, Mr. Koenig has been selling Afloats out of three of his South Florida stores to test the market. “The first order was maybe 100,” he said, “and they sold out pretty quickly.” Next month, Mr. Hall and his colleagues said, you’ll be able to buy Afloat online. They promise a 100-night guarantee with a full refund, as Casper does, and free shipping. Mr. Hall said that he hopes Afloat’s market will be not just aging, achy boomers, but Gen Xers and millennials. “It’s like salmon,” he said. “They’ll return to the place where they were spawned.” And so, to bed. Mr. Hall, who has spent most of his adult life sleeping on a water bed, lives alone with two Afloats: a dual mattress in his guest room, with side-by-side bladders you can heat or cool to your taste, and a king-size, single-bladder bed in his own room, a lofty extension he built a few years ago. With 40 patents to his name, Mr. Hall also has houses in California (Sonoma and Santa Barbara) and nine sports cars, including a 1966 E-Type Jaguar Roadster, an Aston Martin, a Ferrari and a silver Mercedes coupe. He has two grown daughters; their mother, Suzanne, died 25 years ago of ovarian cancer. “She was my soul-mate,” he said. Both Afloats looked perfectly normal, set upon low-slung platform beds. Mr. Hall, a collector of post-Mao Chinese art, whose taste runs to West Coast minimalism, had dressed them nicely. I took my shoes off and lay down, as Mr. Hall extolled a water-bed benefit I’d never considered: no critters. “If you weigh a regular mattress after it’s been used for a few years, it will be heavier than when you bought it,” he said. “That’s because it will be filled with your sweat and skin cells, and the dust mites and bedbugs that feed on them.” Moving right along, the bed felt great: There was a bit of motion, a kind of floaty up-and-down sensation. “It’s got full cradling,” Mr. Hall said with pride. “Two things are better on a water bed,” an early ad once announced. “One of them is sleeping.” But wasn’t water-bed sex rather a challenge, I wondered, given the instability of the surface? Mr. Hall blushed. “Because this water bed fills in any open spots, the motion is suppressed substantially,” he said. “The cuddling and position aspects are far better than anything you could imagine.” I asked about his marketing plan: sex or comfort? “I think for our generation, it’s comfort,” he said. “Maybe sex for the millennials.” In the mid-’70s, David Rockwell, the designer of hotels, hospitals and playgrounds, Broadway shows and a couple of Oscar ceremonies, slept on a water bed in his attic dorm room. He was in architecture school at Syracuse University then, and he chose the bed mostly because it was low and fit the look he was after: He had wrapped his room in red burlap, and the décor included a fish tank, a butterfly chair and a pair of Mexican huaraches. “A bed that comes with its own climate is interesting,” Mr. Rockwell said in a phone interview, noting Afloat’s temperature control. “A microclimate! When it’s hot, you want an ice-cold drink. There is something kind of fabulous about being able to cool or heat the mattress. In a hotel context, I don’t know if it checks the box of dependable and affordable. It certainly checks the box of being different and quirky.” There are still fortunes to be made in the bedroom. Mattresses are a $15 billion industry, according to Furniture Today, a trade publication. Last week, as it happened, David Perry, Furniture Today’s mattress editor, was in Orlando, Fla., for a conference, and he and his colleagues spent an afternoon at a City Furniture there, rolling around on the new water beds. He took notes. “One retailer said, ‘The ’80s are calling, they want their water bed back.’” Mr. Perry told me. “Another said, ‘This is retro, and how hot is retro right now? Vinyl records are back, why not water beds?’” “Obviously I’ve laid down on maybe thousands of beds over the last 30 years,” Mr. Perry continued. “These felt great. You could feel the water. You’re literally rocking in the water. That might be a ‘love it or hate it’ feeling. They harken back to the glory days of water beds, but modern technology makes them more comfortable than the water beds of yesteryear. These are positioned as premium products, a smart move, as consumers really want better sleep, not cheaper sleep. I think the timing is fantastic. Water beds were the original disrupters. They used to call inner springs ‘dead beds.’” Warren Shoulberg, a retailing journalist and consultant to the home furnishings industry, also thinks the time is ripe for the return of this aqueous sleep aid. “This generation doesn’t have the association that water beds eventually got as a place where lonely single men slept, in hopes of luring young ladies into their homes,” Mr. Shoulberg said. “The other thing is that consumers have no idea what’s inside most mattresses. It’s all gobbledygook. It’s this great mystery, and the industry loves it that way. It thrives on that confusion. The water bed is simple. It’s a big bag that holds water.”",The New York Times

2018,Opinion | The Steady Bedlam of the Trump White House,"Making sense of the never-ending turnover in the administration. Contributing Opinion Writer What are we to make of all this turnover in the Trump White House? Clearly, James Mattis’ departure is gravely concerning — he was the last grown-up, and while not much is known about acting secretary designee Patrick Shanahan, his experience in military technology isn’t likely to calm jitters in world capitals about whether Mr. Mattis’ successor can check the president’s impetuous behavior. Other departures are less obviously chilling. In a normal administration, a president hiring his third chief of staff in under two years would launch a flotilla of news stories speculating about that president’s stability and willingness to submit to a certain degree of order. But we have a president who gleefully flaunts his instability and thirst for disorder every day, so these stories are very old news. Before we start drawing conclusions, let’s first survey the facts. It is indeed the case that turnover in Donald Trump’s administration is greater than in recent past ones — in some cases, far greater. On Dec. 17, Brookings Institution scholars Elaine Kamarck, Kathryn Dunn Tenpas and Nicholas W. Zeppos released a report called “Tracking Turnover in the Trump Administration.” The study analyzes turnover among what the authors call the president’s “A Team” — the few dozen most influential positions within the executive office of the president — and among Cabinet members. Among the 65 Trump A Team members, they find, 42 positions have turned over, for a rate of 65 percent. Seventeen of these vacancies occurred because the person was promoted, 14 because the person “resigned under pressure” and 11 because the person simply resigned. The 14 are, of course, the most interesting for our purposes, with their departures labeled in the report by the slightly ominous acronym “RUP.” Some of the better-known ones: Sean Spicer, the little-mourned (except by reporters who now have to deal with Sarah Huckabee Sanders) first press secretary; Reince Priebus, the first chief of staff; the alt-rightist Steve Bannon; and the tell-all memoirist Omarosa Manigault. The 65 percent turnover rate for the first two years is considerably higher overall than that of Mr. Trump’s five immediate predecessors. In Barack Obama’s first two years, his A Team turnover rate was 24 percent (Mr. No Drama!). George W. Bush’s rate was 33 percent. Bill Clinton’s was 38 percent. George H.W. Bush’s was 25 percent. And Ronald Reagan’s was 57 percent, his year-two turnover rate being actually just a bit higher than Mr. Trump’s. With respect to the second category of appointees tracked in the Brookings study, Cabinet officials, here again Mr. Trump had the most departures. He lost 12 Cabinet secretaries in his first two years, according to the study (released before Mr. Mattis made 13). Mr. Obama lost four, Mr. Clinton six, and Mr. Bush the younger just one. Of the 12, eight were RUPs, and many of them left in quite dramatic fashion: Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who leased a townhouse from a lobbyist for around one-third the going market rate, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was on the receiving end of torrents of presidential Twitter abuse until he finally said “enough.” These numbers, while interesting, are not especially surprising to anyone who follows the news. The Trump administration is, to employ a seasonal metaphor, an island of misfit toys. And it’s presided over by a mercurial and minatory chief executive who can’t be easy to work for on a number of levels. (He doesn’t listen to people, he might turn on you in a flash, etc.) Add to all that the fact of the Robert Mueller investigation, which veritably ensures that anyone who accepts a White House position today will spend years paying for the pleasure. First, literally, as any Trump White House aide is bound to need to lawyer up and eventually pay tens of thousands of dollars in legal bills. And second, reputationally; that parachute on which officials of administrations from both parties typically float off to lush corporate sinecures is, in this administration, made not of gold but of lead. But there’s an even more sobering angle to the Mueller part of this story, for the potential Trump staffer who can think ahead. Anyone who goes to work in that White House should assume that he or she will witness acts that are, shall we say, irregular at best. If it were me, I’d assume that fate would one day place me in the position of either having to tell prosecutors some very gruesome truths about what I saw or not telling them and risking jail time. Who wants that? In any event, there seems almost no chance that this administration will stabilize. If we extrapolate the Brookings numbers out, Mr. Trump is on track to have a four-year turnover rate of greater than 100 percent — that is, to have all 65 A Team positions change hands at least once. Yes, that’s troubling, certainly in the case of Secretary Mattis. In other instances, though, let’s face it — the staff hardly matters. Mr. Trump is more influenced by whoever is on “Fox & Friends” on any given morning than who’s in the office down the hall. That’s a kind of steadiness, I suppose. But it’s steady bedlam, and it’s just getting worse. Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.",The New York Times
2018,The Stories Behind the Supreme Court’s Class Photos,"For 150 years, the justices have sat, not always happily, for an extraordinary series of group portraits. Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh stood in the back row, on the far right, beaming. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, recovering from a fall, sat in front of him, grimacing. Off to her right, Justice Stephen G. Breyer appeared to chuckle at a joke he had just recalled. It was the latest installment of an awkward and illuminating tradition at the Supreme Court: the group photographs prepared when a new justice joins the court. Last month, the justices took their places, in strict order of seniority, and tried to smile for the cameras. About a dozen news photographers were there to document the occasion, supervised by a court official with a stopwatch. “It’s a tradition that all the photographers in town look forward to getting a crack at,” said Doug Mills, a photographer for The New York Times, “because it’s a historical picture no matter what.” A Supreme Court photographer also takes pictures. Until recently, the justices voted on which of those would be the official photograph. “It is not clear when the justices began voting for their preferred pose, but the process goes at least as far back as the Taft court” in the 1920s, Franz Jantzen, one of the court’s photographers, wrote in 2015 in The Journal of Supreme Court History. If there were 5-to-4 splits, they have not been reported. The 2017 official photograph, according to notes to an exhibit at the court, included an innovation. It looks like a class photo, but it is a composite. “This is the first official color group photograph for which color film was not used,” the notes said, “and the result is the first to combine each of the justices’ individual choices, from several poses, into a single image.” The photo appeared on the court’s website without acknowledgment that it was a composite. The Supreme Court is resistant to change. For the past 50 years, the elements of the group photographs have been identical. They are taken in the court’s east conference room, in front of red velvet drapes. Some traditions are older. Since 1899, the justices have arranged themselves in order of seniority. These days, that means the chief justice is seated in the middle, with his four longest-serving colleagues seated at his sides. The four more junior justices stand, with the newest on the far right. The first group photograph of the justices in their robes was taken in 1867, by Alexander Gardner. The justices have assembled 52 more times since then, generally whenever a new member joined. In 2003, after the justices had been together for nine years without a change in personnel, they added a bonus sitting. The news photographers have to work fast. Decades ago, they were allowed three minutes, but Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who was not known for his patience, thought that too generous. He gave the photographers two minutes. Last month, Kathleen Arberg, the court’s public information officer, used a stopwatch to count down the allotted 120 seconds. The main thing photographers want in those two minutes is a formal group portrait in which the justices look at the camera. “The tough part is that most of the time their heads are turned and they’re talking to each other,” said Bob Daugherty, a retired Associated Press photographer. “You like the animated stuff, but you do want something where the faces are identifiable in a group shot.” That can be hard to achieve, particularly if Justice Clarence Thomas is in characteristically gregarious form. “Our nemesis is Thomas, because he’ll start laughing and joking with whoever is next to him,” said Dennis Brack, who photographed the justices for many years for Black Star Publishing Company. “If you’re doing a group picture, you want everyone looking at you and looking serious.” There were other challenges, Mr. Brack said. “Our biggest non-fan was Thurgood Marshall,” he said. “His solution was to go to sleep.” It has long been said, including by me, that the court did not sit for a 1924 group photograph for an ugly reason. “The court had to cancel its portrait that year,” I wrote in a 2010 column, “because Justice James C. McReynolds, an anti-Semite and a racist, refused to sit next to Justice Louis D. Brandeis, the first Jewish justice.” Justice McReynolds was indeed an anti-Semite and racist, but that particular story was false, as Mr. Jantzen documented in his 2015 essay. The misunderstanding arose from a 1924 letter from Justice McReynolds, who told Chief Justice William Howard Taft that “I absolutely refuse to go through the bore of picture taking until there is a change in the court” — meaning the arrival of a new justice. The justices had sat for a portrait in 1923, and no new justice had been appointed since then. In his letter, Justice McReynolds said nothing about Justice Brandeis. A Taft biographer, Alpheus T. Mason, misinterpreted the letter. A review of his biography in 1965 in The Times Book Review repeated the error, giving it “a crucial nudge toward its current popularity,” Mr. Jantzen wrote. In fact, Justice McReynolds “showed up for all 10 sittings during his tenure when the new group photograph was to be taken,” Mr. Jantzen wrote. “At nine of these 10 sittings there was at least one Jewish justice on the court — first Brandeis, then Benjamin Cardozo and Felix Frankfurter — and although the seating arrangement never called for him to sit beside a Jewish justice, at three of these sessions either Cardozo or Frankfurter stood directly behind him.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Story of 2018 Was Climate Change,"Future generations may ask why we were distracted by lesser matters. Opinion Columnist Our best hope may be the weather. For a long time, many people thought that it was a mistake to use the weather as evidence of climate change. Weather patterns contain a lot of randomness. Even as the earth warms and extreme weather becomes more common, some years are colder and calmer than others. If you argue that climate change is causing some weather trend, a climate denier may respond by making grand claims about a recent snowfall. And yet the weather still has one big advantage over every other argument about the urgency of climate change: We experience the weather. We see it and feel it. It is not a complex data series in an academic study or government report. It’s not a measurement of sea level or ice depth in a place you’ve never been. It’s right in front of you. And although weather patterns do have a lot of randomness, they are indeed changing. That’s the thing about climate change: It changes the climate. I wanted to write my last column of 2018 about the climate as a kind of plea: Amid everything else going on, don’t lose sight of the most important story of the year. I know there was a lot of competition for that title, including some more obvious contenders, like President Trump and Robert Mueller. But nothing else measures up to the rising toll and enormous dangers of climate change. I worry that our children and grandchildren will one day ask us, bitterly, why we spent so much time distracted by lesser matters. The story of climate change in 2018 was complicated — overwhelmingly bad, yet with two reasons for hope. The bad and the good were connected, too: Thanks to the changing weather, more Americans seem to be waking up to the problem. I’ll start with the alarming parts of the story. The past year is on pace to be the earth’s fourth warmest on record, and the five warmest years have all occurred since 2010. This warming is now starting to cause a lot of damage. In 2018, heat waves killed people in Montreal, Karachi, Tokyo and elsewhere. Extreme rain battered North Carolina and the Indian state of Kerala. The Horn of Africa suffered from drought. Large swaths of the American West burned. When I was in Portland, Ore., this summer, the air quality — from nearby wildfires — was among the worst in the world. It would have been healthier to be breathing outdoors in Beijing or Mumbai. From year to year, the number of serious hurricanes fluctuates. But the last few decades show a clear and disturbing trend. 5 Annual Category 4 and Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes 4 Number each year 3 20-year moving average 2 1 0 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 5 Annual Category 4 and Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes 4 Number each year 20-year moving average 3 2 1 0 ’50 ’60 ’70 ’80 ’90 ’00 ’10 By The New York Times | Source: National Hurricane Center; data on hurricanes is considered most reliable since geostationary satellites began tracking them in the 1970s. Amid all of this destruction, Trump’s climate agenda consists of making the problem worse. His administration is filled with former corporate lobbyists, and they have been changing federal policy to make it easier for companies to pollute. These officials like to talk about free enterprise and scientific uncertainty, but their real motive is usually money. Sometimes, they don’t even wait to return to industry jobs. Both Scott Pruitt and Ryan Zinke, two now-departed pro-pollution cabinet secretaries, engaged in on-the-job corruption. I often want to ask these officials: Deep down, do you really believe that future generations of your own family will be immune from climate change’s damage? Or have you chosen not to think very much about them? As for the two main reasons for hope: The first is that the Trump administration is an outlier. Most major governments are trying to slow climate change. So are many states in this country, as well as some big companies and nonprofit groups. This global coalition is the reason that the recent climate summit in Poland “yielded much more,” as Nat Keohane of the Environmental Defense Fund said, “than many of us had thought might be possible.” The second reason for hope is public opinion. No, it isn’t changing nearly as rapidly as I wish. Yet it is changing, and the weather seems to be a factor. The growing number of extreme events — wildfires, storms, floods and so on — are hard to ignore. Only 40 percent of Americans called the quality of environment “good” or “excellent” in a Gallup Poll this year, the lowest level in almost a decade. And 61 percent said the environment was getting worse. In an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 66 percent of Americans said they wanted to see action to combat climate change. Some polls even suggest that Republican voters are becoming anxious about the situation. The politics of climate change remains devilishly hard, especially because so many people around the world feel frustrated about their living standards. France’s “gilet jaune” protests, after all, were sparked by a proposed energy tax. Compared with day-to-day life, the effects of climate change have long felt distant, almost theoretical. But now those effects are becoming real, and they are terrifying. To anyone who worries about making a case for climate action based on the weather, I would simply ask: Do you have a better idea?

2018,Opinion | The Surprisingly Normal Reason Trump Wants a New Chief of Staff,"It probably has nothing to do with John Kelly’s personality. More likely, the White House wants someone who’s got political skills for the 2020 campaign. Mr. Dickinson is a professor of political science at Middlebury. True or not, everything under President Trump feels like it has been more bumpy than for any of his predecessors in the modern era. His governing approach combines an unusual faith in his own intuition, a relative lack of interest in policy details and a penchant for demonizing his opponents, real and imagined. The president appears to judge his White House aides less on their governing expertise than on their compatibility with and loyalty to his deeply personal approach to the presidency. So with the announcement that President Trump’s chief of staff, John Kelly, will step down at the end of the year, we all took it as just the latest round of White House chaos. But actually, the modern presidency moves to recognizable rhythms. And this one, in some ways, has been no different. There is a season to govern, and one to campaign. The announcement about Mr. Kelly is the clearest sign yet that for Mr. Trump and his White House staff, the time to govern is winding down, and the presidential campaign is about to begin. Governing and campaigning in the recent administrations are relatively distinct processes. The expertise a president requires from his staff to govern is not always the same skill set he needs for campaigning. The most effective campaign aides are adept at distilling complex issues into campaign slogans suitable for sound bites and bumper stickers, and at demonizing the opposition. Skills suitable for sound bites, digital ads and bumper stickers are assumed to be less useful in the White House, where policy expertise, patience and a willingness to work across the aisle are normally prerequisites for getting things done. It is one thing to promise to Make America Great Again. It is another to recognize how to do so. To date, Mr. Trump appears less inclined than his predecessors to recognize the significance of that distinction; he governs as he campaigned. Mr. Kelly’s rocky White House tenure as chief of staff illustrates this dynamic. President Trump hired him in July 2017 to bring order to a White House staff divided by factions. Reports detailed clashes among Mr. Trump’s campaign aides, led by the former Breitbart executive Steve Bannon, Stephen Miller and Mr. Trump’s daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka and Jared Kushner. Reince Priebus, the president’s first chief of staff, seemed unable to mediate these disputes, prompting the decision to replace him with Mr. Kelly. Soon after, Mr. Bannon left the White House, and over the course of the next several months Mr. Kelly eased additional campaign aides out — including the former “Celebrity Apprentice” star Omarosa Manigault Newman — while bringing some semblance of coherence to White House operations. But the president never seemed fully comfortable with Mr. Kelly’s effort to take charge of the White House staff. Mr. Trump reportedly bristled at the perception that Mr. Kelly was too willing to take credit for the administration’s successes while criticizing Mr. Trump’s failings, as when the chief of staff indicated the president’s campaign statements on immigration and building a border wall were “uninformed.” For his part, Mr. Kelly’s often-intemperate remarks, as when he suggested that the Civil War occurred because of a failure to compromise, revealed a lack of political acumen. As the former Clinton White House chief of staff Leon Panetta acknowledged, “John is a great Marine … but he is not a politician, and one thing he lacks is the ability to look at the big political picture and understand what you should and shouldn’t say as chief of staff.” Although Mr. Trump grudgingly tolerated Mr. Kelly’s political tone deafness and thinly veiled insubordination in return for bringing a semblance of discipline to White House operations, the shift in focus from governing to campaigning evidently has changed Mr. Trump’s calculation. If this explains Mr. Kelly’s departure, it is consistent with the research I have conducted with the Brookings Institution scholar Kathryn Dunn Tenpas. We show that most modern White House staffs undergo a significant overhaul in the president’s third and fourth years in office in preparation for the re-election campaign. Although Mr. Kelly’s replacement has not been named, it is likely to be someone with the skills to run a White House in full campaign mode. Given those demands, it was not surprising that one rumored replacement, Vice President’s Mike Pence’s chief of staff, Nick Ayers, was the focus of the president’s search to replace Mr. Kelly. Mr. Ayers has experience in political consulting and is considered a potential candidate for office himself in Georgia. But given the enormity of the tasks in the Trump White House, he has already reportedly turned down the job. Whoever it is, the new chief of staff will be dealing with a Democratically controlled House intent on using its oversight capability and the findings from the Mueller investigation as a possible basis for impeaching the president. The new official, in any case, will be charged with two fundamental tasks shared by all chiefs of staff, regardless of season. That person must protect the president’s most precious asset — his time — while ensuring that he is not isolated from the advisers whose expertise he relies on. Under Mr. Trump, however, a president who brags about making “gut” decisions and who resists any attempt at management, the chief of staff’s task takes on greater urgency. How well the new chief performs may well determine the future of Mr. Trump’s presidency, his potential re-election and the nation he leads. Matthew J.

2018,Opinion | The Tao of Gravity ,"Sporting All martial arts are a quest for beauty and transcendence. I found those not in doing karate but rather having karate done to me. Mr. Joyce is a features editor for Sportsnet. Two hundred men and women knelt in rapt and reverential silence. All of them wore crisp, white karate outfits, or gis, cinched with black belts. Hardened karate-ka who had trained two decades and earned third- and fourth-dan black belts took honored places in the front row. I was in the back by the fire exit. We were gathered in a university gym in Toronto for an international tournament. I was in my late 30s at the time. With my still new first dan, I felt like a humble 10-handicapper in the company of Tiger Woods. At the front of the hall stood the shihan, a master instructor with a seventh dan. He was demonstrating leg sweeps, techniques associated with judo more than karate. In Japan, he had been a university judo champion. At this point, the shihan passed over the champions up front and summoned me from the ranks. Karate etiquette demands stoicism, but the skepticism in the ranks was not entirely disguised. “Kame,” he said. Kame was my far-from-fearsome handle in the dojo. English translation: Turtle. This wasn’t intended to evoke Gamera, the monster turtle who fought Godzilla in Japanese horror films. And all of this predated the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. No, Turtle had been my boyhood nickname because I had a pet tortoise. The tag proved apropos for an entirely different reason, a gift that revealed itself in the dojo: I could fall. Yes, my best asset was a durable back. I know what you’re thinking: Anyone can fall, it’s just gravity. But you’re wrong. Breaking a fall is as complex as any offensive technique. You’re utterly exposed and in immediate danger of real physical harm. Your opponent has weaponized the ultimate blunt force object: the floor. In this instance with the shihan, a hardwood floor. I spent many hours practicing break-falls, some from great heights. I did judo in grade school. In prep school, I routinely recreated Dick Van Dyke’s tumble over the footstool in the intro to his old TV show, a letter-perfect judo break-fall. I could have paid my way through school working as an adolescent stuntman. I was 200 pounds back then and my break-falls produced thunderclaps, like sound effects laid over fight scenes in “Enter the Dragon.” In hockey circles, they’ll say that a guy on the wrong end of a one-sided fight has been “rag-dolled.” In karate circles, they say nothing. Instead, they kneel and study the physics of bodies in motion. All martial arts are a quest for beauty and transcendence. I found those not in doing karate but rather having karate done to me. I was honored to be tossed like a bag of wet cement by the shihan. There was no looking down for a soft spot to fall, nor for the leg that would undercut my own. I had to properly simulate the fighting condition, willing myself unaware of my fate so that I didn’t reflexively start falling until I was actually being felled. On my descent, I locked eyes with the shihan and grabbed a fistful of the sleeve of his gi. I had let him and gravity do their business and landed in position to counter. He might have been the only one in the room who recognized this, but no matter — it wasn’t about me, and I wasn’t brought up to compete. The shihan let go of me. I sprang to my feet and assumed a fighting position. Once again I was thrown to the floor. And again. And 20 times more. Each time I broke my fall as if out of an ancient textbook, none the worse for wear. In the material world the martial arts are often described and even advertised as a means of self-defense. You sincerely hope you never have to use your martial art outside a dojo. And you definitely hope that you never have to perform a break-fall in any situation. That said, my ability to fall spared me injury and possibly saved my life in the workplace. My job as a sportswriter has often landed me in strange circumstances, but none stranger than my trip in 1991 to Calgary, Alberta, to write about Bret Hart, a big dog in the World Wrestling Federation. This led to a fateful encounter with Bret’s father, Stu, who had retired as the proprietor of Stampede Wrestling, leaders in the mayhem industry in Western Canada. Stu Hart began his ring career in the 1940s and threw one of his last elbow smashes in apparent anger on an early-1990s pay-per-view show, knocking out Bret’s rival Shawn Michaels. Some doubted the authenticity of that blow: Could a septuagenarian really ice a 240-pound champion in his prime? I, too, considered it far-fetched, but only until I wound up in the same position with Hart as I had with the shihan. That position, as ever, was supine. I was interviewing Hart and minding my manners when he asked me about a splint on the middle finger of my left hand. To my instant regret I told him my finger had been dislocated blocking a roundhouse kick in the dojo. This prompted what old-school wrestlers called a “snatching,” an act of bodily appropriation that I was powerless to fend off while trying to take notes. “I could shoot an angle,” he said. “You’d be the wrestling reporter.” Before I could beg off this narrative, I was in fact a wrestling reporter, or at least a reporter being wrestled. Hart lifted me to shoulder height and body-slammed me onto his dining-room floor. Chin in, arms extended, hitting the floor with open hands: check, check and check. I took inventory: I was in one piece and breathing, but the latter seemed only temporary as 270 pounds of wrestling history landed on me. Reverting to his days in the ring, Hart started to choke me out. Thankfully his wife, Helen, happened on the scene. Rather than counting me out, she offered profuse apologies and upbraided her husband for snatching yet another guest. I thanked her for the well-timed intervention but told her no apology was necessary. If you want to start to understand a fighting art, you have to be willing to go to the mat. The warrior might be as sacred as Shihan or as slapstick as Stu, but regardless best viewed from the ground up.

2018,The Tech That Was Fixed in 2018 and the Tech That Still Needs Fixing,"Tech fix From Facebook to creepy online ads, the worst tech of the year made the internet feel like an unsafe place to hang out. Yet there were some products that were fixed, our personal tech critic writes. Personal technology was so awful this year that nobody would think you were paranoid if you dug a hole and buried your computer, phone and smart speaker under six feet of earth. Facebook made headlines week after week for failing to protect our privacy and for spreading misinformation. Juul, the e-cigarette company under investigation for marketing products to teenagers, emerged as the Joe Camel of the digital era. And don’t get me started on just how intrusive online advertising has become. On the other hand, there was good technology this year that improved how we live, like parental controls to curb smartphone addiction and a web browser with built-in privacy protections. For the last two years, I’ve reviewed the tech that needed the most fixing and the tech that was fixed for the first time. This year, I’m repeating the tradition in hopes that the list of lows gets shorter and the list of highs gets longer over time. Facebook this year was analogous to a cheating romantic partner who was caught betraying us and apologized — only to be caught again weeks later. The social network admitted that Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm, had improperly gained access to the data of millions. Later, the company confessed that a security breach had exposed the data of 30 million accounts. This month, a New York Times investigation revealed that Facebook gave tech giants like Netflix and Spotify special access to user data, including private messages. Other social media companies also stumbled. Twitter came under fire for being slow to react to Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist who regularly spread misinformation, including that the Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax. Even after Facebook, Apple, YouTube and others took down Mr. Jones’s content in early August, Twitter said his posts had not violated the company’s policies. After several more weeks, Twitter barred Mr. Jones in response to reports of abusive behavior. Google’s YouTube, long adored as a venue for people to share music videos, food recipes and D.I.Y. home improvement projects, also had a tough year. The video-sharing site said it had removed 39 channels that were linked to an Iranian disinformation campaign. The bottom line: Social media companies demonstrated they could barely be trusted with our data and were still trying to get a handle on all of their issues. Unfortunately, there is no simple solution for problems like hate speech and misinformation. And keeping our information private is not really in the interest of many of these companies, which use our data to target us with digital advertising. Speaking of which: Online ads became so intrusive in 2018 that they increasingly ruined people’s web-browsing experiences and raised more hackles about privacy. The online ads industry became so good at tracking our web browsing activities that it increasingly knew precisely what we were thinking about buying. If you did a web search for a blender, for example, you could be certain that a digital ad for that blender would follow you around. In addition, the autoplay videos embedded on many news sites were ruthless about shouting for our attention while draining our batteries and burning through data plans. Fortunately, there are solutions for this, which I outlined in several articles this year about how the web is breaking. They included installing ad and tracker blockers, downloading add-ons that stop auto-play videos from loading and changing some browser settings. These fixes are not ideal because they take a long time to put in place, and blocking ads hurts media businesses. That means there’s work to do on this yet. E-cigarettes, or vape devices like Juul, have been a useful aid for adult smokers to give up cigarettes. But for teenagers, vapes have replaced cigarettes as a gateway to addictive substances. According to the 2018 National Youth Tobacco Survey, about 3.6 million middle and high school students currently vape, up from 280,000 in 2011. The Food and Drug Administration this year announced restrictions that allowed stores to sell most flavored e-cigarettes only in areas where minors were not permitted. The agency also said it was investigating whether Juul, which accounts for more than 70 percent of e-cigarette sales, intentionally marketed its products to youths. Juul has since suspended its social media promotions. But the damage has been done. While e-cigarettes don’t produce the carcinogenic smoke that cigarettes do, they deliver lots of nicotine and harmful chemicals. Parents are reeling over the effect on teenage brains. E-cigarettes notwithstanding, at least parents can worry less about their children’s addiction to smartphones. This year, Apple released Screen Time, a feature for people to set restrictions on the amount of time they spend on their iPhones. The software includes the ability for parents to remotely monitor and limit their children’s iPhone use. I tested Screen Time for three weeks with a colleague’s daughter and was thrilled to see that the curbs helped the screenager cut iPhone use down to about three hours a day from roughly six hours. (The constraints I set on myself were not as effective because I could easily override them as a parent.) There’s still room for smartphone parental controls to improve. Google offers Family Link, a comprehensive parental controls tool for Android phones. Yet the software has major limitations, as children can turn off the features once they turn 13 — which seems like precisely the time when you would want to be monitoring your child’s phone. Remember Firefox? Over the last decade, the once prominent web browser became irrelevant after Google released Chrome, a speedier and more secure web browser. Then late last year, Mozilla released a redesign of Firefox with thoughtful privacy features and much faster browsing speeds. This year, Mozilla kept polishing and expanding on Firefox’s capabilities. It released a “container” that can be installed to prevent Facebook from tracking your activities across the web. In August, Mozilla also said that it would, by default, turn on anti-tracking features to prevent third parties, including advertisers, from snooping. Firefox could still be better. Chrome, for instance, is still faster at loading some web pages. But after a harsh year when consumers lost faith in how companies like Facebook managed their data, it feels heartening to know that someone in the tech industry is making a browser for the people. So did we get to a shorter list of personal tech lows and a longer list of highs? Not quite. I guess there’s always next year.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Threat in the White House,"With the impetuous decisions that drove Jim Mattis into retirement, President Trump does more to undermine American national security than any foreign adversary. Ms. Rice is a former national security adviser and a contributing opinion writer. This country’s national security decision-making process is more broken than at any time since the National Security Act became law in 1947. Nothing illustrates this dangerous dysfunction more starkly than President Trump’s reckless, unilateral decisions to announce the sudden withdrawal of all 2,000 United States troops from Syria and to remove 7,000 from Afghanistan. These decisions went against the advice of the president’s top advisers, blindsided our allies and Congress, and delivered early Christmas presents to our adversaries from Russia and Iran to Hezbollah and the Taliban. The costs of this chaos are enormous, starting with the blunt, unnerving resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, one of the last senior administration officials committed to preserving American global leadership and alliances. In a stunning tweet Wednesday, Mr. Trump declared the Islamic State defeated and promised the rapid return of all United States forces from Syria. In fact, the Islamic State is not defeated, though it is greatly weakened. The Pentagon estimates that 2,000 to 2,500 fighters continue to control territory in southeastern Syria, while tens of thousands more remain throughout Syria and Iraq. Although many militants have melted back into the population, they can re-emerge, as we saw after the American withdrawal from Iraq in 2011. Stabilizing the areas liberated from the Islamic State to prevent its revival remains as important as ever. Cutting and running from Syria benefits only militants, Turkey, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, Russia and Iran. We are abandoning our Kurdish partners, leaving them vulnerable to Turkey’s offensive, after they did the hard work of undermining the Islamic State. We are walking away from our British and French allies that deployed forces on the battlefield, and from the coalition of over 70 countries we painstakingly built to counter the Islamic State — without even the courtesy of consultation. We are leaving Israel alone to confront Iran and Hezbollah’s hostility, while relinquishing our remaining influence over the future of a fractured Syria. The near simultaneous order to withdraw half of the American troops in Afghanistan shocked our NATO allies, who have served alongside United States forces since Sept. 11, and shook the Afghan government in advance of precarious presidential elections next year. This arbitrary and precipitous withdrawal will strengthen the Taliban and undermine diplomatic efforts to jump-start reconciliation talks, while opening the field to greater Russian and Chinese influence. If our national security decision-making process were even minimally functional, there would have been a carefully devised plan to execute moves, including wrongheaded ones. The plan would have included strategies for mitigating risks to our partners on the battlefield and to friendly governments; advance consultations with allies; briefings of Congress; and a press strategy. Instead, two factors combined to ensure the collapse of the decision-making apparatus. First, it appears that the national security adviser, John Bolton, rarely convenes his cabinet colleagues, known as the principals committee, to review the toughest issues. Instead, key players are cut out, as reportedly the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was from the final, fateful meeting on Syria. Mr. Bolton has not named a replacement deputy national security adviser, leaving vacant a crucial position whose holder typically coordinates the national security agencies in drafting and carrying out policy. Mr. Bolton has also taken over direct responsibility for managing everything from cyber and terrorist attacks to hurricanes and pandemics — tasks previously assigned to another top-level White House official. Mr. Bolton is also traveling abroad more than most of his predecessors, even as he is playing multiple all-consuming roles. These ill-advised choices alone would cripple national security decision-making. But a second factor — Mr. Trump himself — has dealt the death blow to effective policymaking. The president couldn’t care less about facts, intelligence, military analysis or the national interest. He refuses to take seriously the views of his advisers, announces decisions on impulse and disregards the consequences of his actions. In abandoning the role of a responsible commander in chief, Mr. Trump today does more to undermine American national security than any foreign adversary. Yet no Republican in Congress is willing to do more than bleat or tweet concerns. Against this backdrop, Mr. Mattis’s resignation is even more worrisome. Even though his record was mixed, he provided desperately needed reassurance to our allies, an unabashed if private counterweight to the president’s worse instincts, and experience and stature too great for Mr. Bolton to ignore. His departure will leave the administration all but devoid of wise, principled leadership and the guts to check a president who consistently places politics and self-interest above national security. No one relishes keeping American service members in harm’s way. American troops should not remain indefinitely in Syria or Afghanistan. Our deployment of forces, strategy and objectives should be continuously evaluated, and decisions based on conditions on the ground and our broader interests. That is what the National Security Council decision-making process is supposed to do. When it is discarded, the security of the nation and our allies is the first to suffer.

2018,Opinion | The Ticking Time Bomb Under Obamacare ,"The threat from President Trump and Republicans to take health care away — including a pending case that would strike down a large part of the law — has hit alarming levels. Professor Gluck specializes in health policy at Yale Law School, where Ms. Turret is a student. Yes, the Democrats reclaimed the House. But you should not assume that your health care coverage is now safe. The biggest threat is President Trump himself: His administration has been relentlessly assaulting the Affordable Care Act for two years, and that threat has not abated. Democrats may have made significant electoral gains by running on the protection of the pre-existing-conditions guarantee to insurance, but Republicans apparently aren’t listening. The president and his party remain focused on taking health care away. The administration has instituted administrative rules and guidance letters intended to undermine the insurance markets, trick the healthy into buying junk plans, and leave the less healthy with unaffordable premiums. It has also succeeded in reducing enrollment, making access to health care harder for the poor and immigrant populations and, for the first time in a decade, raising the number of uninsured children. To add insult to injury, it refuses to defend the A.C.A. in a ludicrous lawsuit in Texas — in which it now appears the judge may very well strike down a large part of the law, including the ban on pre-existing conditions. The entire A.C.A. is at stake. Don’t be fooled by the president’s claims that these problems are inherent in Obamacare. Let’s start with the insurance markets. Combining healthy and sick people into a single insurance pool as the A.C.A. requires drives down the cost of insurance. The administration is destroying this pool to isolate less healthy people in their own market with skyrocketing premiums so the public and the insurance industry will turn against the law. First, it promulgated a rule that expands A.C.A.-exempt “short term” plans — previously just band-aid plans for a three-month period between jobs — to yearlong exceptions that can be renewed for up to three years. It passed another rule allowing expansion of so-called association health plans, once a limited exemption from some A.C.A. requirements for some small businesses but now open to virtually anyone. Many of these plans are so bare-bones that they do not cover even prescription drugs or maternity care. Short-term plans can exclude people based on pre-existing conditions, and exclude full categories of benefits including substance abuse — even though the president claims to care about solving our national opioid crisis. To make matters worse, just last week, the administration relaxed the requirements for states to get waivers from A.C.A. provisions, making it easier for states to make excuses for not covering their citizens. It is another potential avenue for keeping young, healthy people out of the insurance pools and driving up premiums for the Americans who remain. In addition, the administration cut the period for open enrollment in half. It also significantly reduced funding for “navigators,” given the task by the A.C.A. of linking individuals to insurance. It seems these efforts to discourage enrollment are working: The enrollment period ends next week, and so far, sign-ups are down about 10 percent compared with last year. Add all this up, and premiums for baseline A.C.A. plans in 2019, so-called silver plans, are 16 percent higher than they would have been absent the Trump administration’s acts of sabotage. This is on top of the obstacles the administration has erected against needy populations. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services now allows states to require Medicaid recipients to work. In Arkansas, for example, more than 12,000 people have been pushed off the Medicaid rolls since September, when the requirements went into effect. It should be noted that most of these people have jobs; it’s the onerous reporting procedures that are having their intended effect. What’s worse, failure to comply carries with it a prohibition against reapplying for insurance for up to six months. Yes, no access to health care for six months. Immigrants are also in the administration’s sights. A new rule would make getting certain federal benefits, including health coverage, grounds for classification as a “public charge” under the immigration laws; such a classification can prevent immigrants from obtaining permanent residency. The proposed rule will encourage immigrants to forgo coverage for which they and their children are eligible. And then there is the meritless lawsuit in Texas. Mr. Trump’s Justice Department has chosen not to defend the suit and to let the A.C.A. benefits die, including the guarantee of insurance even if you have a pre-existing condition — despite President Trump and Republican candidates across the country swearing to defend them only weeks ago. The case involves the A.C.A.’s requirement that we all get insured or pay a tax — the so-called individual mandate. In 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the mandate as constitutional under Congress’s taxing power. Texas and more than a dozen other states are now arguing not only that the mandate is unconstitutional given that there is now a penalty of zero dollars but also — and here is the kicker — that the entire 2,000-page law should be overturned if the mandate must be excised. The suit is a such a perversion of settled legal doctrine that scholars who on were opposite sides of the last two A.C.A. Supreme Court challenges have argued against it. The settled law is that when a court excises one part of a statute as unconstitutional, it aims to preserve the rest and defers to Congress’s judgment. Here, there is no question about what Congress intended. It was the 2017 Congress that eliminated the mandate penalty and the same 2017 Congress that left the rest of the A.C.A. standing. The judge overseeing the case was handpicked by Texas for his unfavorable view of the A.C.A. and has delayed until after the election what would be a disastrous decision with consequences for millions of Americans. Recent estimates say as many as 17 million could lose their health care in the first year alone. The A.C.A. has been the most resilient statute in modern American history. It has survived two major Supreme Court challenges, more than 50 attempts to repeal it, state reluctance to obey it, and relentless administrative sabotage. But every day the assault continues, real people are hurt and our health care system is put in jeopardy. When the Democrats take back the House in January, we can expect them to step in and defend the A.C.A. in court; hold hearings to investigate the consequences of the administration’s illegal rules; and use their oversight authority to make the Department of Health and Human Services account for its decisions. The House may well pass other bills to strengthen the A.C.A.’s protections. But with just one chamber, there is only so much it can do. Just because the election is over, we should not let Mr. Trump and his party escape accountability. Abbe R. Gluck is professor of law and faculty director of the Solomon Center for Health Law and Policy at Yale Law School, where Erica Turret is a student and a fellow at the Solomon Center.

2018,"The Tiny Club, the Giant Stadium and the Deal Driving Them Apart","Queen’s Park is Scotland’s oldest soccer team and shaped how the sport is played. It has called the national stadium, Hampden Park, its home. But that is about to end. GLASGOW — As a lifelong fan, a historian, and a former president of Queen’s Park F.C., Jim Hastie has been to enough home games to notice the pattern. The same thing, he says, happens every time: Long before kickoff, long before the Queen’s Park players have left their dressing room, long before it is necessary, the visiting team will emerge, ready to go through its warm-up routine. For most players and for most games, the warm-up is a chore to be completed, a box to tick before the real business of the game starts. When a team travels to Queen’s Park, though, it is different. Here, the visitors dawdle a little over their stretches, passing exercises and sprinting drills. When they are summoned back inside, they stroll, rather than jog. They find myriad ways to spend as much time as possible on the field, savoring their surroundings, the moment. It does not matter that the stadium, designed to hold 52,000 fans, will attract only a few hundred for today’s game against Annan Athletic, or that there may well be more people in the wedding fair being held in one of the executive suites than there are watching the game. This is still a day Annan’s players will remember: the time they played at Hampden Park. Hampden has always led a dual life. As the home of the Scottish national team, stage for the country’s cup finals and one of Europe’s elite stadiums, it has long been regarded as one of the game’s great stages. It was here that 150,000 people watched Scotland play England in 1937; it was here that Zinedine Zidane scored perhaps the finest goal in Champions League history in 2002. It has also, though, long been a regular stop for the teams in Scotland’s lower leagues who come to face Queen’s Park, in matches when its stands are all but empty, its famous roar no more than a whisper. Queen’s Park is Scotland’s oldest club, and historically perhaps its most significant. Uniquely in the Scottish leagues, it remains resolutely amateur, run by a few hundred members, staffed largely by a few dozen volunteers — like Hastie — and represented on the field by a team paid only its expenses. It has spent much of its recent past bouncing around the lower reaches of Scotland’s four divisions. It also calls Hampden Park home — for now, at least: In 2020, Queen’s Park, the club that owns this place, the club that built it more than a century ago, is being forced out. Last year, the Scottish Football Association announced that it was reviewing its relationship with Hampden. For more than a century, Scotland has played here, essentially as a tenant of Queen’s Park: initially on short-term staging agreements and then, more recently, under long-term leases, usually agreed to depending on certain improvements to the stadium. The current lease is set to expire in 2020 — after that year’s European Championship, for which Hampden will be one of a dozen host sites — and the S.F.A. let it be known that it was keen to explore its options. It was offered the chance to move games to Murrayfield, in Edinburgh, the home of the Scottish rugby team. Celtic and Rangers, Glasgow’s twin giants, proposed alternating games between their stadiums, Celtic Park and Ibrox. Some wanted the national team to play across Scotland. Eventually, the S.F.A. determined that the best option was to buy Hampden from Queen’s Park. A deal — a £5 million cash payment (about $6.3 million), and the assumption of around £19 million in liabilities — was agreed upon, though the S.F.A. had to rely on £1 million donations from two of the country’s richest men to conjure the funds. It seemed a surprisingly low price for a 33-acre plot of prime real estate in Glasgow’s South Side, a 10-minute drive from the city center. A survey commissioned by Queen’s Park during the talks estimated the land alone was worth around £28 million, even without the stadium. But Queen’s Park did not have much of a choice. Its rental income from the S.F.A. accounts for £300,000 of its £750,000 revenue each season. “It doesn’t take a genius” to see that Scotland’s leaving would have had dire consequences for the club, Hastie said. The deal was done. Starting in 2020, Queen’s Park will no longer play at Hampden Park, bringing to an end some 150 years of history. Instead, it will use the £5 million payment to refurbish Lesser Hampden — its community and administrative facility in the shadow of the main stadium — as its new home. Outside Queen’s Park, few doubted that the right decision had been reached. Hampden is Scotland’s “spiritual home,” as the former national manager Craig Brown and Kenny Dalglish, perhaps its finest player, said. And though the thought of the team’s leaving was, to many, anathema, the fate of a minor fourth-division team was, at best, a secondary consideration. That is not quite how they see it at Queen’s Park. Gerry Crawley, the club president, acknowledged that leaving for Lesser Hampden was “not a situation we sought,” though he said he was confident the £5 million would be enough to create a new home on the existing training complex there and allow the team to “operate in a similar manner.” Others are more fearful. Keith McAllister, 61, has been attending Queen’s Park games for almost three decades. He grew up a few streets away. He estimates that he has missed only three away matches since 1979. He has, he said, warned his daughter that if she marries during the season, it will have to be on a Friday. For home games, he runs a souvenir stall in Hampden Park. Most weeks, he said, he will have a handful of foreign visitors paying homage to Queen’s Park. “There are a lot who come up from England, but I’ve had people from Spain and Germany, too,” he said. They come not just because of the litany of famous players this club has produced — like Alex Ferguson, now a life member, and Andy Robertson, Liverpool defender and current Scotland captain — but because of its contribution to the game as a whole. Indeed, perhaps more than any other club, Queen’s Park helped to craft soccer as it is played today. Though the game was first codified in England, for much of the 19th century it remained at heart a “hacking and dribbling” game: Players would run with the ball until they were brought down, by fair means or foul. Queen’s Park is credited with the creation of what it called the “combination” game and what became known, south of the border, as the “Scottish style.” This is the club that invented passing. “There is a degree of truth in that,” Hastie said. “Queen’s Park introduced that method of play, and they changed the system to go along with it. In terms of style, Queen’s — and Scotland — were ahead. England was behind the times.” Twice, in the 1880s, Queen’s Park reached the English F.A. Cup final, the only Scottish club ever to do so. In several of the very earliest international matches, Queen’s stood in for Scotland. “That’s why the great English teams of the 1880s and 1890s all signed Scottish players,” Hastie said. That group of expatriates, drawn south by Preston, Sunderland and Liverpool, among others, became known as the Scots Professors. Many in Glasgow, then, think this is a club that should be cherished by Scotland, seen as a source of pride. Instead, as it faces ejection from its home, they believe there is a risk it may fall into decay, or even cease to exist. “What other country would do this, with a team that has done more than any other for the game’s history?” McAllister said. “At one point, this was the best football team in the world. It is a sad thing for football, and this is a football-mad city, but the attitude is that it’s only Queen’s Park. The club will survive, but it will not be what it was.” Hastie shares that concern. These days, he said, Queen’s Park’s selling point is as a hub for youth development: It attracts players not by offering to pay them, but by providing the “best facilities, the best coaching” outside Celtic and Rangers. The path laid down by Liverpool’s Robertson is a part of that lure — “everyone here wants to wear the No. 3 shirt” in his honor, Hastie said — but so, too, is the opportunity to call Hampden home. Leaving, then, delivers a double blow: Queen’s Park’s eight youth teams are based at Lesser Hampden, and it is not entirely clear when or where they will play if that facility is remade to house the first team. That — together with the loss of the unique chance to play every other week at the national stadium — could undo much of Queen’s Park’s good work. What worries them most, though, is something less tangible. To those who have spent their lives following Queen’s Park, or working for Queen’s Park, Hampden is a central part of the club’s identity. This spot has been its home for 115 years. It has been its owner, its developer, its protector. At times, as Hastie said, it has felt like an “unfortunate custodian.” They know that the time has come to sell, to downsize. But some of the club’s members hoped, perhaps, to be allowed to remain as tenants, as guests of the S.F.A. They fear that by moving on completely, Queen’s Park is leaving behind a little of its soul, a little of itself, in the bricks and mortar and empty seats of Hampden Park. “Queen’s and Hampden are intrinsically linked,” Hastie said. “It is our whole history, our reason for being. If we lose Hampden, we lose our status as a national institution. We lose everything.”",The New York Times
2018,The Top 18 Media Grinches of 2018,"Mediator It’s time for the Grinchy Awards, given to the year’s worst actors in the news media and anyone else who interfered with a free press. CreditCreditTom Grillo I’m usually cheerful during the holiday season. This year? Not so much. My bad list has grown too long, my patience way too short. So with that, allow me to present what I hope will not have to be an annual Mediator tradition — the Grinchies. It’s an award that doubles as a ranking of the people and institutions who undermined this already troubled industry or actively worked against a free press, and it was devised with high hopes for a better 2019. Recipients of the Grinchies are ranked on a scale of one to five Grinches. One Grinch denotes an annoyance, and five Grinches go to those who have undermined the news media or the general discourse. As if the New York City mayor’s refusal to take reporters’ questions at public events wasn’t bad enough, emails released this year showed him cheering looming staff cuts at The Daily News. “Good for us, right?” Mayor Bill de Blasio wrote. He also rooted for the demise of The New York Post and suggested that his staff “starve” The New York Times. And I thought Rudy Giuliani hated the press when he lived in Gracie Mansion. Hizzoner needs to get a grip. You had one job. It was not a very hard job. Find a funny host and put on a show promoting the movie business. But then you hired Kevin Hart without checking his social media feeds or otherwise inquiring about his views. And now nobody wants the job. At this point, hire the Unknown Comic for 2019 and cancel 2020. The Philadelphia Flyers this year introduced a mascot named Gritty. Like the city’s less-than-civilized sports fans, this fun-loving orange monstrosity was rude and crude and a little out of control — and the internet couldn’t get enough. Then the anti-Trump resistance claimed him as one of its own. Does everything have to be political these days? (Full disclosure: My late father worked for the team when it was known as the Broad Street Bullies.) Benjamin Brafman, a criminal lawyer, said last month that Harvey Weinstein had been “vilified by a vicious media assault.” Oh, the press was vicious to Mr. Weinstein? Is Mr. Brafman aware of how his client sought to undermine reporters looking into the numerous sexual harassment and assault accusations made against him? Does he remember how Mr. Weinstein hired secret agents from Black Cube to sidle up to reporters, gain their confidence and report back to Mr. Weinstein? My queue is full. Enough already. Enough shows. Enough with the algorithm (do I look like I’m in a “Love, Actually” mood?). I’m saying this for your own good: Your content gluttony is becoming a problem. Just because you can swallow an entire industry doesn’t mean you should. And when you run movie theaters out of business, Mediator is going to be very upset. Who is James Katz? He’s the New York City development official who signed off on a stipulation in the city’s agreement with Amazon that will give the company immediate warning whenever anyone makes a public records request about its arrangement with the de Blasio administration. That proviso was one of many inducements that gave the online giant a swath of Queens. As Politico put it, the city promised to give Amazon “notice sufficient to allow Amazon to seek a protective order” and block any such requests. Ever heard of the public’s right to know? It’s part of this thing we call democracy. Give it a whirl. Why would Amazon even want a heads-up from citizens seeking answers? The company’s founder and chief is Jeff Bezos. Mr. Bezos owns The Washington Post. You know, the newspaper with the motto “Democracy Dies in Darkness.” Demanding notice of public information requests so that you can stifle them is pro-darkness. Pete Hegseth, a “Fox & Friends” weekend co-host, said that the slow-moving “caravan” of migrants making their way toward the United States “looks more like an invasion than anything else.” A frequent Fox guest, Sidney Powell, accused the migrants of bringing diseases with them, and another Fox News guest, David Ward, got more specific, claiming that they would bring to the United States “smallpox and leprosy and TB.” (Smallpox was eradicated as of 1980!) Chris Farrell, a guest on Lou Dobbs’s Fox Business Network show, said that the groups supporting the migration were propped up by the “Soros-financed State Department,” a callback to anti-Semitic tropes about the Hungarian-born liberal financier George Soros, who is Jewish. Fox later condemned the comments and banned the guest from future appearances. But it all played to President Trump’s xenophobic message at the close of the midterm campaign. And more recently, Tucker Carlson, a Fox News prime-time host, said immigration made the United States “poor and dirtier and more divided.” In a less heated political environment, the story of a star journalist who was found to have passed off fiction as fact would be worth little more than a chuckle from general readers and a scolding from media critics. But now that people from both ends of the political spectrum routinely accuse reporters of creating “fake news,” this kind of thing hurts journalists everywhere. Claas Relotius, a writer for Der Spiegel, a German magazine known for its fact-checking department, is the latest in a line of fabulists (Janet Cooke, Stephen Glass, Jayson Blair, among others) to have made a name for himself by hoodwinking editors and readers with stories that really were too good to be true. Pick a new field, Herr Relotius. We hear Hollywood’s hiring. It wasn’t me, Charter Spectrum — it was you! How many commercials did you run promising higher internet speeds? A million? Well, last week came the news that you have agreed with the New York attorney general that Charter Spectrum did not deliver the speeds it had advertised. Sure, Time Warner, which was previously running the service, started the pattern of bad-faith promises. And the company will try to make good by offering its customers payments of either $75 or $150. But that’s not going to get back the eBay bid that the cursed spinning pinwheel caused me to lose. The 2020 race has yet to start in earnest, but in the days before the midterm elections, the Donald J. Trump for President organization managed to do something I’ve never seen any other presidential political team come close to pulling off: It produced a commercial so racist and xenophobic that all the major networks rejected it, after it had aired on NBC’s “Sunday Night Football.” This piece of propaganda featured footage set to ominous music of an undocumented immigrant bragging in court about his murder of two police officers, followed by images of the caravan that originated in Central America. What other exciting firsts are in store for us in the next 22 months, Trump ad team? When reports that she had made homophobic remarks on her old blog surfaced toward the end of 2017, the MSNBC host Joy Reid apologized for her “choice of words and tone.” Fine. But when Mediaite reported on more posts of a similar vein, she claimed they were planted by hackers. When that defense fell apart, she apologized again, saying she still didn’t “believe” she wrote them but her views had changed, anyway. And that was that — no investigation by NBC News, which oversees MSNBC, no further comment from Ms. Reid. Either the blog was hacked or she invented a cover story. MSNBC and Ms. Reid still owe viewers a full explanation. Long before Twitter and Facebook, the magazine racks in supermarket checkout aisle were the original platforms. In 2016, those racks featured covers of The National Enquirer as it pilloried Hillary Clinton with false allegations that she had covered up a “child sex scandal,” committed treason and was hiding a deadly illness (from which she seems to have miraculously recovered). The supermarkets arguably played as much of a role in spreading politically motivated misinformation as any online entity swarmed by Russian bots. The fish rots from the head. And as a number of articles published over the last year have shown, a culture of sexual harassment pervaded every part of CBS. Its morning show had as a co-anchor Charlie Rose, who was fired after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment. Among the network’s prime-time hits was “Bull,” whose star, Michael Weatherly, was accused of sexual harassment by the actress Eliza Dushku, whom the company paid $9.5 million in a confidential settlement. The news division’s standout program, “60 Minutes,” was run by Jeff Fager, who was fired after sending a threatening text message to a CBS reporter looking into allegations of inappropriate workplace behavior against him. The executive suite was the domain of Leslie Moonves, the recently fired company head, who was accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women. And the CBS corporate boardroom had a place for Arnold Kopelson, who died in October after dismissing the accusations against Mr. Moonves by saying, “I don’t care if 30 more women come forward and allege this kind of stuff. Les is our leader and it wouldn’t change my opinion of him.” You know what you did. And didn’t do. And continue to do. And not do. The Russians are still using your platforms. I’m talking to you, Jack Dorsey, Larry Page, Sheryl Sandberg and Mark Zuckerberg. Guy Gilmore is an executive at a subsidiary of the New York hedge fund Alden Global Capital, which owns a number of newspapers nationwide. In April, Mr. Gilmore spiked an editorial at an Alden-owned publication — The Denver Post — that criticized the company for the steep cost reductions it had imposed on the paper and the further cuts it had planned. Alden was already peeved with The Post’s now-former editorial page editor, Chuck Plunkett, for sneaking through an editorial calling company executives “vulture capitalists.” That editorial noted that the paper was profitable and argued that the cuts were part of a scheme to trade quality journalism for bigger earnings. Helpful hint: If you don’t want to be called a vulture capitalist, don’t act like one. Repressive regimes made 2018 a near-record year for the jailing of reporters, and they helped create a climate for an increase in the number of reporters who were murdered, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. In the name of the dissident writer — and contributing Washington Post columnist — Jamal Khashoggi, the truth will out, always, eventually. And to think: Those regimes see an enabler in the president of the United States. As the Philippine journalist Maria Ressa put it at a recent awards ceremony hosted by the Committee to Protect Journalists, Mr. Trump has given “permission to autocrats like ours to unleash the dark side of humanity and extend their already vast powers with impunity.” Ms. Ressa should know. She faces prison time in the Philippines on dummy charges. Mr. Trump’s “enemy of the people” language has reverberated around the world. And he once again undermined press freedom when he ignored his own intelligence community’s assessment of the role played by the Saudi Arabia crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Torture of Dressing for Your Office Holiday Party,"What does “festive dressy” even mean? Contributing Opinion Writer It’s the least wonderful time of the year. Maybe your office holds a holiday party every December, and you’ve got to move your awkward small talk from the break room to the local bar/restaurant/rented party space. Maybe you’re going straight from work to the school play or holiday concert, or you’re having cocktails with your significant other and his boss. Whatever the reason, you have to navigate the journey from professional to party, choosing clothes that signal that you are polished without being boring, attractive without being provocative, and that you’re looking to be promoted, not propositioned. For women, it’s never easy. Men, in general, have it all figured out: a suit and a tie, and they’re ready for anything from a wedding to a funeral to an office holiday party where the dress code is “smart casual” or “festive dressy” — even if the suit is boxy or baggy, even if the tie’s held together with Scotch tape. Boom. Done. My husband will spend all of five minutes getting ready. (“And if I’m overdressed,” he told me, in the tones of one imparting ancient and valuable wisdom, “I just take the tie off!”). I, on the other hand, will consider all of my dresses and jumpsuits, maxis and midis and minis, capri pants, palazzo pants, pantsuits, tunics that make me look like Bea Arthur, high heels that make me feel like I’m walking on knives, body-con dresses that work only with three layers of undergarments worn in the precisely correct order, and the pair of hand-tooled red leather cowgirl boots that looked so pretty in the catalog but made me feel as if I were dressed up as the Lone Ranger the one time I wore them outside. Here is the dark-purple dress that I adored until my daughter said it made me look like Grimace, and I can never un-hear those words. And over there is my absolute favorite stretchy, comfy black dress that fits beautifully and feels great, so much so that I wore it the last three times I had to go somewhere that wasn’t swim practice drop-off or Hebrew school pickup. Clothes might make the man, but they typically have so little to say about him that when Richard Nixon was trying to show the nation his honesty by way of his modest lifestyle, he had to figuratively reach into his wife’s closet and reference the “respectable Republican cloth coat” that Pat wore, instead of a mink. The bar for presentable is lower than the soles on a pair of FitFlop flats: Think Ed Sheeran in jeans and layered T-shirts. Think Bradley Cooper in “A Star Is Born.” Women’s outfits, on the other hand, do not just make a statement. They tell a story, and that story is long and involved and complicated, touching on age and class and race and sexuality. Think Beyoncé, next to Ed Sheeran, in a sculptural, ruffled, pleated, fuchsia couture gown. Think Lady Gaga, once she’s been swallowed by the fame machine, in “A Star Is Born.” There’s a reason “What was she wearing?” is still asked of victims of sexual assault, though we know (and a museum exhibition at the University of Kansas vividly demonstrated) that the answer can be anything from a prom gown to a military uniform to cargo pants to a child-size sundress. There’s also a reason that President Barack Obama could be briefed on an event, put on a suit, and go to it, while Michelle Obama had to attend the briefing but also the unofficial briefing after the briefing about clothes: Would it be raining? Would there be grass or cobblestones? Was it windy? (Pencil skirts can’t be displaced by gusts.) Would she be hugging, dancing or doing push-ups? “Dress shabbily and they remember the dress; dress impeccably and they notice the woman,” Coco Chanel once said. But what, exactly, constitutes impeccable? How are you supposed to achieve it if only a handful of designers deign to make clothes in your size? Where are the clothes that acknowledge the formality and importance of an event and also allow you to do stuff? For most of my time, these questions are theoretical. As a novelist, I spend my days in clothes that no one but my husband, my kids and my dog ever see. But this spring, I’ll be on book tour: a dozen events in 10 cities in two weeks. For years, that has meant trying to come up with 14 outfits. If I wore my favorite black dress on Tuesday in Cincinnati, I’d see pictures on social media on Wednesday, and I couldn’t repeat the look in San Diego on Thursday — or else, I reasoned, people would think I had only one dress. I have honed all kinds of systems over the years, from shipping dirty laundry home to traveling with ridiculous amounts of luggage to spending a rare afternoon off rushing to the nearest Nordstrom, all while watching male authors throw on a button-down and call it a day. What would happen if I treated my dresses the way a man on tour might treat his suits? Could I just pack four outfits and rotate them? Could I find my own uniform? That’s one way to go. The other is the path paved by Stacey Abrams when she ran for governor of Georgia this year. She did it in jewel tones, in statement necklaces and interesting necklines. She seemed, from where I was following along, to enjoy her clothes, her dresses and her necklaces and her earrings, how she felt and how she moved, and what those looks told the world about her. “From the moment I enter a room, I am clear about how I intend to be treated and how I intend to engage,” Ms. Abrams wrote in her book “Minority Leader.” “For example, my attire, my hairstyle, even my presentation style, reflect me rather than aping the behavior of others.” And so, as we’re all girding our loins for this year’s office party, Christmas-cookie exchange, carol sing or latke fry, wriggling into our Spanx, and asking ourselves, If I put on a different necklace, does it still look like the same black dress? a few questions to consider: If men can wear the same thing over and over, why can’t we? If men have clothes that look good and let them kick a soccer ball, hold a baby or walk on cobblestones in the rain, where are ours? And finally, how would it feel if the only person’s approval you sought when you looked in the mirror was your own?

2018,"The Town Where the Shots Go Up, and the Records Fall","Joe Girard III is smashing scoring records at Glens Falls High School, recalling another favorite son of upstate New York who preceded him there. GLENS FALLS, N.Y. — Joe Girard III, an 18-year-old senior at Glens Falls High School and a pitiless scoring machine, hurried across the school’s hardwood court, placed his inhaler on a table and started his basketball season with a passing drill. It was a recent afternoon. He looked worn. Two days earlier, he had led his school’s football team to a state title as a quarterback. He threw two touchdown passes, ran for another two scores and earned most valuable player honors. Now, at basketball practice, red dots marked where a football opponent had stepped on his left hand with his cleats. His right hand was swollen from being sandwiched between the helmets of two players. And yet today he and his teammates threw a 41-ounce basketball — almost twice as heavy as a game ball — to one another. He caught the heavy ball last. He squared up on the left wing — just inside the 3-point arc — and shot it. It went in. With that shot, Joe Girard III’s pivot to basketball was complete. “Those used to be air balls,” said Rob Girard, the team’s head coach and a cousin of the marksman. “He’s getting stronger.” Girard, who is 6-foot-1 and 185 pounds, and goes by JG3, averaged 50 points a game and set the state’s career scoring mark last winter with 3,306 points. Perched atop the scoring annals, he has an enviable challenge ahead on his home court in the Adirondack foothills — the same court on which another productive scorer, Jimmer Fredette, elicited oohs and aahs not too long ago. “The question now is: What do you do after averaging 50?” his father, Joe Girard Jr., said. “He has a year to go, which is scary.” It all started at the free-throw line. As a fifth grader, Girard won a national contest by making 25 of 25 free throws. As a seventh grader, he played on the high school’s freshman team. As an eighth grader, he scored the opening basket of his first varsity game and finished with 31 points, including a pull-up 3-pointer at the buzzer to win the game. As a ninth grader, he scored 52 points in one game. As a 10th grader, he once scored 41 points, grabbed 19 rebounds and fell one assist short of a triple double. Those are absurd numbers for almost any player, much less one in high school, where games last only 32 minutes, compared with 40 in college and 48 in the N.B.A. As a junior, he recorded his first dunk in a game. His cousin Trent, who is 5-foot-5, threw the ball off the backboard to Girard to earn the assist. “There are times when you say, ‘Jesus, that’s not a good shot,’ ” Rob Girard, the coach, said. “But when he hits four out of six of them, what can you say? You go with it.” Girard fired from all over last season. He scored 60 points in a game twice and never scored fewer than 41 points as his team went 20-3. He broke his own team record when he made 12 3-pointers in a game, and he stitched together four consecutive games with 50 points or more. When defenders locked arms while trapping him after he crossed the half-court line, the coach told his star to attack the linked limbs to force referees to call a foul. With seven games left in his junior season, he surpassed Los Angeles Lakers guard Lance Stephenson’s state-record 2,946 career points. In his final game as a junior, a sectional semifinal, Girard scored 56 points. “I saw those numbers, and I couldn’t believe it,” said the retired N.B.A. player Kenny Anderson, who scored 2,621 points at Archbishop Molloy High School in Queens and held the state record for 15 seasons. “In 32 minutes. Amazing. Crazy. Wild. Regardless of who he is playing, with those numbers, I was like, wow, that kid is balling.” Girard was raised by a gunner. His father scored 2,179 points at St. Mary’s in Glens Falls and Shenendehowa High School in Clifton Park, N.Y., and is 44th on the state’s career scoring list. He later played for John Beilein at Le Moyne College in Syracuse. The Girard name is known all over Glens Falls. The boys and the girls basketball teams are each coached by a Girard. “For good and bad, Glens Falls is known as the Girard Town,” said Joe Girard III, who has two cousins as basketball teammates. “We’re all over the place.” Another family in town scored some points, too. When he was younger, Joe Girard III rode his bike to Sanford Street Elementary School and pedaled past Ogden Street, where he could see a growing collection of trophies in the Fredette family’s window. That a single city could produce these basketball look-alikes could just be coincidence, but while Jimmer Fredette was scoring 2,404 points at Glens Falls from 2003 to 2007, he also was working as a counselor at a basketball camp in town that had been held on fall Saturdays for decades. Girard was a camper there, just as Fredette had been. Fredette’s brother, T.J., remembered Girard being called upon at a basketball clinic to demonstrate a ball-handling drill. “He zipped right through it, spider dribble and all,” he said. By the time Jimmer Fredette earned national player of the year honors at Brigham Young, in 2011, Girard, 11 years younger, was being called the next Jimmer. Girard played one season for Tony Hammel, who had coached Fredette at Glens Falls, before Girard’s uncle took over the program. Girard walks by Fredette’s framed jersey outside the gym nearly every day. “There was always something just different about Joe,” Jimmer Fredette said in a phone interview from China, where he plays for the Shanghai Sharks and in November scored 75 points in a Chinese Basketball Association game. “He’s just broken every milestone by a long shot. He is a deadeye shooter, but I work with him on his middle game: floaters, runners, shots he can be creative with in college and beyond.” Girard used to hear chants — “Jimmer’s better!” — when he missed shots, but those faded in recent seasons. Still, as they did with Fredette, college coaches are figuring out where Girard fits moving forward. One of 32 players invited to try out for the United States’ under-18 team in Colorado in June, he did not make the final cut. Playing at Peach Jam, the main event of Nike’s Elite Youth Basketball League, in July, he was less of a scorer alongside center Isaiah Stewart, one of the nation’s top-rated recruits. Twice, Girard went scoreless against better competition. “He’s got to become a little more efficient in being able to maneuver his way into shots,” said Tom Konchalski, a talent evaluator and publisher of High School Basketball Illustrated, a scouting newsletter for coaches. “He’s not a point guard, but he has intergalactic range. If he’s patient, he can have a good career.” College coaches came to town to pitch their programs in the fall. Girard’s mother, Arleen, ordered from Panera Bread for most, but she made chicken parmigiana for Mike Krzyzewski of Duke. Phil Martelli, from St. Joseph’s, told Girard he should wear Bubble Wrap, but Girard absorbed his share of blows in football as a quarterback and defensive back. “I had a shoulder problem, so I used every other part of my body to tackle a guy; got a knee to the rib,” he said, recalling a hit that took his breath away. “Felt like I was going to puke blood, but my ribs were still there, so I played on. It’s senior year. I want to help these guys out.” Syracuse basketball fans made their pitch, as well. One night after coming home from a football game on the road, his mother noticed a round orange object glowing by their house. It was just before Halloween, but it didn’t seem right. “I thought our neighbor put an inflatable pumpkin on the front yard,” she said. “As I got closer, I saw the thing with a spotlight on the front and realized it was an inflatable Syracuse mascot. I panicked, got out, and tried to unplug it. I was thinking, What if other coaches saw photos? He hadn’t committed yet!” Girard later announced, in a ballroom at the Queensbury Hotel, that he would attend Syracuse. After a news conference, he called Gerry McNamara, the assistant coach who had recruited him. He treated the offer like a marriage proposal. “I do,” Girard said. The bromance moved to the back burner as Girard started his senior season. In the opener, he struggled to find his stroke. He missed his first free throw, but made his second. He then missed his first 11 tries from beyond the 3-point line before making one with 30 seconds left in the third quarter. He finished with 34 points in a 92-57 win. “Still getting my legs,” he said. He found them soon after. In his next game, he scored 41 points. In his third, 53. In his fourth, he missed his first six 3-point attempts and shot an air ball. Opposing fans chanted, “Overrated!” He motioned for them to raise the volume. Before sitting out for the last three minutes of a 96-65 victory, he had scored 57 points. “You lit it up,” his father, who tallies each point in his head and checks the score book after each game, told him. “Beyond lit up!” On a recent morning, Girard pulled up a chair at Poopie Di Manno’s Lunch, a greasy spoon with a salty owner. He ordered chocolate milk and a breakfast sandwich. As the waitress retreated to the kitchen, Marcia Winslow approached him. “I don’t want to interrupt you,” Winslow said. “But before you get superfamous, can you just give me a signature? You’re totally awesome.” “Thank you,” he said as he signed her menu. Winslow explained that she had a shrine to Jimmer Fredette in her house, a wall of things he had signed, including pictures. “Maybe you’re going to replace him,” she said. “I hope so,” he said. “We’ll see.”",The New York Times
2018,"The Travels of Tony Shalhoub, From Paris to Austin ","Q & A The “Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” actor never tires of the City of Light, was fascinated by the Roman ruins in Lebanon and would happily spend the rest of his days in a certain Texas college town. It was a trip gone awry that brought Tony Shalhoub his first Tony Award last season, for best performance by a leading actor in a musical. In “The Band’s Visit,” Mr. Shalhoub played the leader of an Arab military band that inadvertently ends up stranded in a small, isolated Israeli town and not the more cultured city it was supposed to travel to for a concert performance. (The fact that one was named Petah Tikva and the other Bet Hatikva — “with a B"" — might explain the confusion.) More recently, Mr. Shalhoub, a three-time Emmy winner for USA Network’s detective procedural series “Monk” (2002-2009), and a nominee this year for his work on “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” was in Paris, where some of the scenes for Season 2 of that Amazon series were filmed. (That second season just began streaming.) When he travels — whether for work or on vacation with his wife, the actress Brooke Adams, — Mr. Shalhoub say he wants to immerse himself in the experience, whether it is exploring art in Venice, ruins in Lebanon or glaciers in Iceland. Which isn’t to say that he isn’t content to just unwind. “I’m always happy if there’s a gorgeous beach involved,” he says. “ I have to say, the most extraordinary ones were in Tahiti. The color of the water, the feel of the water, the temperature of the water — it was so unlike anything I’ve ever experienced.” In a recent email exchange and a follow-up conversation, Mr. Shalhoub revealed some of his most memorable trips, his soft spot for Texas-style ribs, and why he’s over hotels. When you travel, are you looking for adventure, relaxation, culture — all three? When I take a break I’m looking for a little bit of everything. Everything except crowds. And great food! Oh, and museums reflecting the local culture. Recently, when we were in Lebanon we went to Baalbek, where there are Roman ruins. A guide told us that a Roman temple was built on top of a Greek temple — the Greeks had been there before the Romans — and before that the Greeks built on top of a Phoenician temple. This notion of all of this labor and all of this time and all of this artistry crammed into one place, it was extraordinary. Do you sleep on the plane? Read? Watch movies? Typically, I sleep on short flights. Often I’m “out” before takeoff. On longer flights I like to read a lot, do the crossword, watch films, play video poker or backgammon. And sleep (but only before takeoff). Are there certain things you always take with you? I always wear slip-ons. Uggs. Never shoes with laces! And I try to remember to bring along some Airborne or Emergen-C. And toothpicks. And earplugs. And a sleep mask. And a book or script. And good headphones. And a pen for crossword puzzles. Oh, and my wife. Checked luggage or carry on? Carry-on. But only if it’s a direct flight. What have been your favorite trips? Well, Scotland is remarkable. Edinburgh, the Highlands, the Isle of Skye. Breathtaking. And, of course, hearing that fabulous Scottish brogue everywhere: lovely! Most recently we visited Lebanon — where my father was from — and it was unlike anything I’ve ever seen. (I want to go back for a much longer stay.) Just before that I was filming in Paris, to me the greatest city on earth. Nothing that’s been said or written or painted or documented or sung about Paris can ever truly do it justice. When I’m there I feel like I’m walking around inside a beautiful painting. Favorite hotel? Lately, we opt for Airbnb-style apartments, rather than hotels, whenever possible. We were in Venice five years ago, during the Biennale, and the available hotels weren’t what we were looking for. And so we found a site, Views on Venice; they had extraordinary apartments right in the area we wanted to be. We found we had extra room, we had a kitchen, we had privacy. When we were shooting in Paris for “Maisel,” we were offered a hotel but we found an apartment in the Marais district. And it was just heavenly. Guests came from the States and stayed with us; we had three bedrooms. Way more space and convenience than we could get in a hotel. When you were shooting “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” in Paris, did you have a favorite local restaurant? We went to a place not far from where we were staying called the St. Regis Cafe, a breakfast and lunch place: perfection. Where do you want to go that you haven’t gone yet? Cuba. I’ve always been curious about it. And I love the idea that it might just be a bit like traveling back in time. Have any places really surprised you? As a family, we found Iceland totally surprising. The scenery and topography changes radically every time you turn a corner. We did a five-day trek on horseback. Is there somewhere you went, for work, that you found unexpectedly interesting? A number of years ago I had the chance to film in Austin, Tex. And I discovered that it’s definitely a place I could happily spend the rest of my life. The music! The young people! The ribs! There’s a lot to love.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Trump ‘Charity’,"letter A reader ponders a Trump-related legal puzzle. To the Editor: Re “Trump Charity Agrees to End Amid Lawsuit” (front page, Dec. 19): Once again a Trump entity has been accused of acting illegally and has been forced to shut down. This time, at least several hundred thousand dollars from the Trump Foundation, a “charity,” was reportedly diverted to private uses such as paying for a portrait of the president, political activities and the renovation of a fountain outside a Trump hotel. Previously, President Trump was forced to return $25 million to students of his shuttered Trump University, a portion of what they say they were defrauded of. When people can go to jail for stealing a pack of gum, why are there these settlements without incarceration for crimes that are substantially more serious?

2018,Opinion | The Uncommon Power of Grace,"A revolutionary idea lies at its core: radical equality. Contributing Opinion Writer In his book “What’s So Amazing About Grace?” Philip Yancey describes a conference on comparative religions where experts from around the world debated which belief, if any, was unique to the Christian faith. C.S. Lewis happened to enter the room during the discussion. When he was told the topic was Christianity’s unique contribution among world religions, Lewis responded: “Oh, that’s easy. It’s grace.” Lewis was right. No other religion places grace at its theological center. It was a revolutionary idea; as Mr. Yancey puts it, grace “seems to go against every instinct of humanity.” We are naturally drawn to covenants and karma, to cause and effect, to earning what we receive. Grace is different. It is the unmerited favor of God, unconditional love given to the undeserving. It’s a difficult concept to understand because it isn’t entirely rational. “Grace defies reason and logic,” as Bono, the lead singer of U2, put it. “Love interrupts, if you like, the consequences of your actions.” There’s a radical equality at the core of grace. None of us are deserving of God’s grace, so it’s not dependent on social status, wealth or intelligence. There is equality between kings and peasants, the prominent and the unheralded, rule followers and rule breakers. If you find yourself in the company of people whose hearts have been captured by grace, count yourself lucky. They love us despite our messy lives, stay connected to us through our struggles, always holding out the hope of redemption. When relationships are broken, my wife Cindy told me, it’s grace that causes people not to give up, to extend the invitation to reconnect, to work through misunderstandings with sensitivity and transparency. You don’t sense hard edges, dogmatism or self-righteous judgment from gracious people. There’s a tenderness about them that opens doors that had previously been bolted shut. People who have been transformed by grace have a special place in their hearts for those living in the shadows of society. They’re easily moved by stories of suffering and step into the breach to heal. And grace properly understood always produces gratitude. Of course, grace can easily be exploited by people who don’t want to be held accountable for their misdeeds; the theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer referred to this as “cheap grace.” Nor is it easy to balance grace with the requirements of justice. We obviously can’t organize society entirely around the concept of grace. Yet the problem today is more the absence of grace than its presence. It’s easy to understand why. Living a grace-filled life is hard. Most of us, when we feel wronged, want payback. Our first impulse, when hurt or offended, is to strike out, justifying our anger in the name of fairness. We forget the words of Edward Herbert (the poet George’s brother), “He that cannot forgive others breaks the bridge over which he must pass himself,” and we forget that only grace can break the cycle of ancient hatreds among peoples. (It is notable that while I have regretted not granting grace to others, I’ve never once regretted extending it.) When Mr. Yancey was young, he rejected the church for a time because he found so little grace there. There is a tendency among many people of faith to come across as holier than thou, more eager to judge than to forgive. Jesus encountered this throughout his ministry, which helps explain why he was more comfortable in the company of the unclean and reviled, the lowly and the outcast, than religious authorities. The odds are that you know people who have had scars of ungrace inflicted upon them by the Christian church. Yet when we see grace in action — whether in acts of extravagant, indiscriminate love, in radical self-giving, or in showing equanimity in the face of death — it can move us unlike anything else. In 2014, Steve Hayner, my spiritual confidant, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Upon learning it had spread, Steve wrote, “In all probability, the remainder of my life on this earth is now to be counted in weeks and months.” (He died in January 2015.) Steve acknowledged that pain and death are reminders of the nature of our broken world. Yet he went on to say: “There is a much bigger story of which this is only a tiny part. And it is God’s story of love, hope, forgiveness, reconciliation, and joy. We went into this journey choosing to trust God and to offer our fears to God. We’ve been so grateful for the freedom from fear and the abundance of peace that we have experienced.” He added, “There are, of course, times of discouragement, grief, pain, and wonder. After all, there are a lot of unknowns ahead of us.” I sent Steve’s reflections to my friend Jonathan Rauch, who responded, “It’s letters like this — the wisdom, the grace — that make me wish I weren’t an atheist.” When I recently asked Jonathan how, as a nonbeliever, he understood grace and why it inspires us when we see it in others, he told me that grace is “some combination of generosity and magnanimity, kindness and forgiveness, and empathy — all above the ordinary call of duty, and bestowed even (or especially?) when not particularly earned.” We see it demonstrated in heroic ways and in small, everyday contexts, he said. “But I guess, regardless of the context, it’s always at least a little unexpected and out of the ordinary.” A lot like if the incarnate deity, veiled in flesh, were born in a manger in Bethlehem.

2018,The Unforgettable Theater Moments of 2018,"We escaped to Margaritaville and made way for Glenda Jackson, got mad as hell all over again and learned to love a Malfoy. The year in theater had many riches and no shortage of surprise. Now that our chief critics have weighed in, it’s time for other New York Times writers and editors who spend lots of time in the dark to illuminate the moments that brought us joy and laughter, shock and awe. And the beat. Any star gets entrance applause these days. Entrance yowls of terror? That’s trickier. But when the titular two-ton ape of “King Kong” — a marvel of puppetry, animatronics and some not exactly subtle sound, projection and lighting — blasted onto the Broadway stage, looking like he meant to eat the front mezzanine, it was a first impression for the ages. ALEXIS SOLOSKI Rarely has a strut so completely embodied a character as Taylor Louderman’s in “Mean Girls.” Playing queen bee Regina George, Ms. Louderman swings her hips with bold confidence and aligns each foot exactly ahead of the other, as if she were walking on a tightrope. It’s like watching the second coming of Ann-Margret, and it’s exhilarating. ELISABETH VINCENTELLI An “Oklahoma!” with same-sex lovers might seem to have “gimmick” written all over it. But in Bill Rauch’s transformative and important production at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, any such worries melted away the instant that Curly (Tatiana Wechsler) made her exuberant entrance, as much fun to root for in romance as Ado Andy (Jonathan Luke Stevens) would turn out to be. LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES Ewww! That’s the word Idina Menzel, making her first appearance in a straight play in years, might have uttered if she actually needed words to express her inner thoughts in Joshua Harmon’s comedy “Skintight.” After all, she was sitting down on the couch where her 70-year-old father’s 20-year-old boyfriend, clad only in a jockstrap, had just been perched. Remembering the sight of his bare butt, she blanched and leapt back up. It turns out there’s more than one way to hit those high notes. MICHAEL PAULSON A devil with an angel’s face, the British actor and musician Johnny Flynn brought his floppy hair and pouty lips to Martin McDonagh’s midnight-black comedy “Hangmen.” A creature of fast talk and loose walk, his Peter Mooney was a menace, a creep and a maelstrom of pure charisma. A.S. “We Got the Beat” opened the show with the requisite bang, and “Vacation” had its spot, too, but the real surprise in the underrated Go-Go’s jukebox musical “Head Over Heels” were two deep cuts: “Vision of Nowness” and, especially, “Automatic Rainy Day” — the latter powerbombed into my cranium in a duet by Bonnie Milligan and Taylor Iman Jones. SCOTT HELLER In “Pass Over,” Antoinette Nwandu’s powerful contemporary reimagining of “Waiting for Godot,” a picnic basket contains a bottomless (and ridiculous) array of delicacies, from string beans to apple pie, goji berries to turkey legs, collard greens to dim sum. There is meaning, here, about the haves and have-nots, but there is also spectacle — watching a menacingly mild Gabriel Ebert extract the impossible bounty from a dainty basket was unexpected stagecraft that had to be seen to be believed. M.P. The stage area in “Yerma” was encased in a glass box with no visible door or hinges. Even with the audience on two sides, it was impossible to tell how the set changes — which took place during brief blackouts — happened. Spoiler alert: The director Simon Stone gave away the trick to design magazine “Surface.” E.V. “The Ferryman” pulls many rabbits out of its sleeve, including literally. But the most magical moment might be when Aunt Maggie Far Away wakes from a near-vegetative state and holds the four young Carney daughters rapt with tales of lost love and predictions of their own futures. It’s a sweetly mystical glance both forwards and backward, whose dark oracular power only becomes clear in the play’s final seconds. JENNIFER SCHUESSLER The talk-dirty-to-me monologue in Kate Tarker’s bizarro comedy “Thunderbodies,” at Soho Rep, was flamboyantly gross-out filthy, and the great Deirdre O’Connell wallowed magnificently in it, delivering a screamingly funny, revoltingly blue aria to a lover’s prowess with his nose. L.C.H. Maybe I’m too open to suggestion. But I would swear that the Lyric Theater actually got cooler when the dementors — cloaked creatures that feed on human happiness — arrived in “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.” Is the production actually lowering the temperature in the auditorium, or am I just feeling chills because I know dementors exude cold? I’ve never asked the question, because, to be honest, I’d rather treasure the thrill. M.P. They are sisters who survived a fire set by their father, and hellbent on revenge. How to depict the brutally scarred Racine and Anaia in Aleshea Harris’s phantasmagorical “Is God Is.” Netting punctured and torn to make masks for the faces of the actresses Alfie Fuller and Dame-Jasmine Hughes — a simple, effective and enormously disturbing choice courtesy of the costume and makeup designers Montana Levi Blanco and Cookie Jordan. S.H. “The King and I: From the London Palladium” captured, for the big screen, Bartlett Sher’s lushly gorgeous production. It also committed to film a wrenching moment in an actor’s life: Ruthie Ann Miles, re-creating her Tony Award-winning performance as Lady Thiang with ferocious command and, as she healed from a devastating accident early this year, the help of a cane. L.C.H. What can’t Katrina Lenk do? At MCC Theater’s annual Miscast gala, which features gender-swapped performances, the sultry star of “The Band’s Visit” found a way to own “If I Were a Rich Man,” accompanying herself on the fiddle, slyly giving the lyrics a feminist spin, and delivering a deadpan eye roll that signaled some 2018 skepticism about the wisdom of the wealthy. M.P. Two young Afghan refugees crossed Europe in search of safety in the Scottish company Vox Motus’s “Flight,” an affecting show that, sans live actors, was a triumph of visual and aural design — the story of the journey told through a series of exquisitely detailed miniature dioramas that gave spectators the heart-racing sensation of being immersed in the boys’ peril. L.C.H. For years I’ve read theater fans wondering out loud why “Mack and Mabel,” Jerry Herman’s silent-movie-era musical from 1974, has never been revived on Broadway. Great score, bad book; that seems to be the story. But watching Alexandra Socha effervesce her way through the madcap “Look What Happened to Mabel” number in the Encores! revue “Hey, Look Me Over!” put me firmly in the when’s-it-gonna-happen camp. And why not pair her once again with Douglas Sills? S.H. When Rosanne Cash and John Leventhal premiered songs from their upcoming musical based on “Norma Rae” in the American Songbook series, the excitement was palpable: Finally, a film-inspired show that targets adults, and with a pro-union message to boot. Let’s hope the pair’s efforts find a theatrical stage soon. E.V. During the Tony Awards, the members of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas drama club, survivors of a mass shooting, made a surprise appearance, belting — beautifully — “Seasons of Love” from “Rent.” It was a poignant reminder of art’s ability to elucidate and console, a bittersweet way to measure a year. A.S. Playing a boarding-school dean in Joshua Harmon’s “Admissions,” Jessica Hecht at one point spells out an Indian student’s name to a colleague. On paper the exchange is innocuous but in a few seconds Ms. Hecht gave a master class in comedic timing, her character remaining unfailingly calm and polite as she enunciated for the benefit of someone she clearly thought to be an idiot. E.V. My Saturday matinee of “Carousel” was interrupted by two medical emergencies. In the second, Jessie Mueller’s Julie Jordan — weeping over the lifeless body of Joshua Henry’s Billy Bigelow — had to stop at full emotional peak when someone started choking in a back row. Several chaotic minutes later, she picked up exactly where she’d left off, as if nothing had happened. E.V. Gracie Gardner’s “Athena,” a deceptively simple portrait of adolescent friendship and the ways that girls temper and blunt their own ambition, concludes in a closely fought fencing match. As directed by Emma Miller and performed by Julia Greer and Abby Awe, it was all clanging épées and panting breath, brutal and overlong. No one wanted it to end. A.S.",The New York Times
2018,The Versace Safety-Pin Dress Is Back,"And other trips down memory lane at Donatella Versace’s pre-fall collection extravaganza in New York. What is it with designers bringing back their greatest hits? First, Donatella Versace offered an ode to her brother Gianni’s archives, as well as to his most celebrated supermodel moment, in 2017, on the 20th anniversary of his murder; then Fendi brought back the baguette bag; then Marc Jacobs announced his “grunge redux” collection, which officially goes on sale this week. And on Sunday night in New York, Ms. Versace was at it again, reincarnating the notorious safety-pin gown of 1994. You know: the one worn by the then fairly unknown starlet Elizabeth Hurley, who was accompanying her boyfriend, Hugh Grant, to the premiere of “Four Weddings and a Funeral,” catapulting her to paparazzi stardom overnight. Also, the palm-tree-print chiffon number that Jennifer Lopez wore to the Grammy’s in 2000, which won the public’s eye that night. Well, musicians do it, not to mention Hollywood (“Mary Poppins Returns,” anyone?), so why not fashion? There’s always been a lot of mutual admiration and back-scratching between the two industries, after all. And you can understand the thinking, in the current uncertain climate. It worked very well once, why shouldn’t it work again? Plus, on the constantly churning fashion hamster wheel, it takes a little creative pressure off designers to constantly make something new and fabulous. Instead, they can give you the familiar and fabulous! So Donatella did. The occasion for the Versace trip down memory lane was the brand’s first pre-fall collection show, its first show in New York and its first show as a member of the Michael Kors family — sorry, the Capri Holdings family (remember, the holding company has been renamed, now that it’s a group). As a way of announcing Versace’s new status and suggesting that, contrary to some fears, being owned by an American company would not make the brand forget its roots, the show was a pretty high-profile statement. “Donatella came to me and said she wanted to do something big, and I was all for it!” said John D. Idol, chief executive of Capri, before the show. It was the first Versace show he attended, and he was wearing his first Versace suit (black, slim-cut), as well as a pair of Versace Chain Reaction sneakers (also black, with white soles). He was very excited. He was standing on the edge of the cavernous former trading floor of the old American Stock Exchange, where the show was held. In the center of the room was another recreation: the hand holding the torch from the Statue of Liberty — but this being Versace, it was gilded. Which was part of a whole ode-to-New-York thing that Ms. Versace saw as important to the collection, as well as being part of an ode-to-female-freedom thing (ditto). The overarching theme, though, was again an ode to her brother, down to the fact the show was held on his birthday, Dec. 2 (he would have been 72). And that one of the prints — a multicolored heart number that replaced the palm trees that had been on ye olde J. Lo dress (worn in Sunday’s show by Amber Valletta, who also wore the original palm-tree dress on the Versace runway) — came from the artist Jim Dine’s work for Gianni’s New York townhouse, which the designer had also used in a collection in 1997. Because you can bring back the past, but you have to update it a little. Otherwise it just looks like a lack of imagination. So the oversize gold safety pins of fashion legend came not just on a slinky black gown slit up to here and sliced down to there, more asymmetric and twisty than the original, but also on nipped-in black jackets, holding together seams on the back and shoulders and paired with cropped mohair sweaters (stomachs were a prime erogenous zone) and black miniskirts. They also, not coincidentally, showed up half a world away on a bright yellow custom-made Versace jumpsuit Beyoncé wore over the weekend at the Global Citizen concert in South Africa. It, too, was inspired by the pre-fall line (see! synergy!), highlighter shades being another part of the collection, though back on the New York runway they came in the form of vinyl minidresses. Which were in turn mixed in with a whole wild kingdom of not-in-nature animal prints themselves (and fur, though the fake kind), which were mixed in with the brand’s signature Barocco swirls of gold, black and white, and more hearts, for men and women no matter. Oh, and there were sneakers. Cat’s eye bejeweled sunglasses and crazy 1960s bouffants. One “I Love New York” Medusa-head T-shirt. Also lots of gold buttons, and even more celebrities, including Kim and Kanye, Bradley Cooper, Lupita Nyong’o, 2 Chainz, Paris Jackson and Blake Lively. Even the models stayed on the runway to sip Champagne and dance around in their new-vintage finery after the show was all over. It was all a little head-spinning, in a “Dr. Who” kind of time-traveling way. What decade were we in? Does it matter? For anyone who’s not just playing dress-up, it should. Before the show, Donatella tried to sum up the difference between then and now in her own way: Today “you can wear a short dress and a pair of sneakers and that’s not sexy any more, it’s cool,” she said. It was a good try, and pretty fun to watch, but all this back-to-the-future-ness is starting to seem less and less convincing.",The New York Times
2018,The Vienna Philharmonic Looks to a New Generation,"VIENNA — There was no mistaking the Vienna Philharmonic’s plush sound in November at the Musikverein here, as Franz Welser-Möst conducted excerpts from Wagner’s “Götterdämmerung.” Gentle strings, glowing brass and a blend across all instrumental sections spoke to a culture of playing that has been cultivated since the 19th century. But even for an orchestra that lives and breathes tradition, recruiting the next generation of talent is no longer self-evident. That is why, for the first time in its history, the Philharmonic is opening an academy to train musicians hands-on. Auditions begin early next year amid a busy schedule that includes touring to Lugano, Switzerland; Salzburg, Austria; Frankfurt; Budapest; and, in early March, New York. Orchestra academies offer young players a transition from conservatory to professional life but also allow institutions to pass on their specific culture of playing. The Berlin Philharmonic has maintained its own academy since 1972, at the initiative of Herbert von Karajan, and graduates currently occupy about 30 percent of the orchestra’s seats. More recently, in 2014, the Shanghai Symphony began partnering with the New York Philharmonic to prepare instrumentalists in China for the demands of orchestral life. The Vienna Philharmonic’s academy will be comparatively small and exclusive. Only 12 players, ages up to 26, will gain admission to a fully subsidized two-year program not only immersing them in the traditional curriculum of chamber music, private lessons and performances with full orchestra, but also exposing them to Austrian culture and history. At least one instrumentalist will be from the United States, thanks to support from the Vienna Philharmonic Society, and talks are underway with leading East Coast conservatories. The double-bassist Michael Bladerer, who also serves as managing director of the self-governed orchestra, admitted that the Philharmonic had been disappointed in recent years with the quality of auditions for new players. He hopes that the academy will raise standards. “Very often people are good technically, but we don’t always find what we are looking for,” he said. There is a desire, he said, to hear what he called “character,” adding, “In opera, it is about life and death.” The Philharmonic divides its time between the pit of the Vienna State Opera and a schedule of up to 130 concerts annually. Players must rapidly learn new repertoire and, in the absence of a general music director, adapt to the style of different conductors. Even in pure orchestral music, the Philharmonic — and in particular the string section — is known for its singing quality. Mr. Welser-Möst likened the orchestra’s musical language to a dialect that must be preserved in an age of internationalization. He called the academy an important initiative for ensuring that the Vienna Philharmonic would not become interchangeable with other orchestras, citing as examples the Berlin Philharmonic, Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra and the Philadelphia Orchestra, which are also famous for their rich strings. “It is about having everyone speak the same language,” he said. Seasoned conductors such as Mr. Welser-Möst, Riccardo Muti, Zubin Mehta and Herbert Blomstedt are already lined up to coach and lecture academy members when they are conducting the Philharmonic in Vienna. Plans are also underway for the academy to perform its own chamber series at the Musikverein and at the Stift Melk, an opulent baroque abbey in Lower Austria where players will enjoy a tour of the monastery library, crypt and more. “One has to have seen, felt and smelled it to understand how old this culture is,” Mr. Bladerer said. “You can’t just read about it or look at a picture.” Academy members will also be encouraged to study scores and letters in the archives of the Philharmonic and the Musikverein in connection with a given piece of music. The Philharmonic’s chairman and first violinist, Daniel Froschauer, recalled the impression of studying the original score of Schubert’s Fourth Symphony during rehearsals. “One never forgets it again,” he said. “Now that I’ve seen how the crescendi look, I play it differently.” The Philharmonic has distinguished itself over the centuries for its specifically Viennese, as opposed to German, sound culture. While it is possible to isolate certain features such as judicious use of vibrato or the sonority of native instruments such as Vienna horn or Vienna oboe, critics often resort to metaphors. Eduard Hanslick wrote of the “feminine” as opposed to “masculine” approach, the sensual rather than the rigorous, in 1860. As Christian Merlin explains in his recent book “Le Philharmonique de Vienne. Biographie d’un Orchestre” (The Vienna Philharmonic. Biography of an Orchestra), the Viennese style results from the fusion of “Jewish, German, Czech, Hungarian, Slavic, Balkan components, forming a truly multinational melting pot.” Until the 1970s, the sound culture was easily transmitted as most members studied with a Philharmonic player at the University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna before joining the orchestra. But in recent years, recruitment has become less and less local. The presence of family dynasties has also waned, with percussionists Benjamin Schmidinger, the solo clarinetist Daniel Ottensamer and a handful of other players serving as exceptions. The orchestra also experienced a large turnover in age and nationality over the past two decades. More than 50 of the orchestra’s 148 players retired from 2000 to 2012, and the Philharmonic’s average age is currently 40. About 30 percent of players are foreign-born, as opposed to 18 percent in 1974. The majority of foreign players come from Central and Eastern Europe, reaching back to the Philharmonic’s roots in the fabric of the Austro-Hungarian empire, but also extending to Russia (the violinist Ekaterina Frolova is one of 16 women). As Mr. Merlin notes, the engagement of overseas players has been “more episodic.” At present, only Australia and New Zealand are represented, through three players. The academy will be an opportunity to widen networks for recruiting and to embed young players in the Philharmonic’s working conditions. Accompanying duties at the State Opera will be limited, however, to ensure students have enough time to practice and win an audition either into the Philharmonic (a process that requires playing in the opera pit for three years before becoming an official member) or another great orchestra. Mr. Welser-Möst spoke of the need “to infect these young people with the virus”: “It is a calling for most people to be a part of the Philharmonic,” he said, noting the personal dedication with which Mr. Bladerer and Mr. Froschauer are opening the academy. “The way we play must be experienced,” Mr. Froschauer said. “There is a collective memory that we pass on without knowing it. This is an opportunity for young people from around the world to come and take part.”",The New York Times
2018,"The Wall and the Shutdown, Explained","WASHINGTON — Standing in the way of a resolution to the government shutdown is a wall. A still mostly hypothetical wall along large sections of the southern border intended to keep immigrants from entering the United States illegally. A wall that President Trump promised his supporters he would deliver once he was in the Oval Office. A wall that if not built, some conservatives say, could cost Mr. Trump his presidency. It is a big wall. Here’s what you need to know about it. As he described it during the campaign, the wall would not be one continuous barrier along the entire stretch of more than 1,900 miles of land between the United States and Mexico, but rather sections of a wall. Natural barriers and “Border Patrol people” stationed in certain parts of the Southwest would provide security in between. And building the wall would be easy. “I’m a builder,” Mr. Trump said. The construction would not be as complicated as building a 95-story high-rise. “And I would have Mexico pay for it,” he said. “Believe me.” The estimated cost of the wall would be $4 billion to $8 billion. It would be 35 feet to 45 feet high, with a “big, fat beautiful door right in the middle,” he said, which would be for people to enter the country legally. Mexico has refused to pay for it, and Mr. Trump’s supporters still want it. “Build a wall. Build a wall. Build a wall,” supporters chanted when Mr. Trump spoke at rallies around the country in the lead-up to the midterm elections. In October 2017, prototypes for Mr. Trump’s wall were unveiled, and the administration has issued two contracts to begin construction on parts of a wall in Texas. But construction on new portions of the wall has not yet begun. When the Senate passed a government funding proposal this past week that did not include money to build the wall, conservative commentators and members of the House Freedom Caucus warned Mr. Trump that if he did not veto it and fight for the funding, he would lose his base, and with that, any chance of re-election in 2020. “One way or the other,” Mr. Trump said on Friday, “we are going to get a wall, we’re going to get a barrier.” Division over a border wall and the potentially dire political consequences are not a predicament unique to the Trump administration. In 2006, Congress funded the construction of 700 miles of a border wall and fencing, despite the reluctance of the George W. Bush White House and Senate Republicans, who had hoped for a more comprehensive overhaul of immigration laws. At the time, House Republicans insisted on funding a wall because they said it was what their voters wanted in order to stem illegal immigration. Since 2006, the United States government has installed barriers — some meant to stop vehicles, some to stop pedestrians — and a “virtual” fence that turned out to be harder to build than what officials had thought. The virtual portion of the border wall was canceled in 2011, during the Obama administration. Scenes along both sides of the border, as President Trump prepares to build a wall between them. Today, the nearly 700 miles of border wall made out of materials such as wire-mesh and chain-link fences, is still in place and in different states of disrepair. Funding has been made available to fix portions of the wall, and the Trump administration has been moving forward with replacing some of the old barriers with new ones. The current wall snakes through private property and has created barriers that have been detrimental to wildlife. Photojournalists from The New York Times visited sections of the border wall in four states this year and described what they saw. [Read their descriptions here.] In the Rio Grande Valley, there was a towering structure made of steel or concrete. Along one stretch, there was thornbush that appeared impenetrable. In other areas, there are Border Patrol agents driving A.T.V.s and riding horses that were following migrant-sniffing dogs. In El Paso, a tall, steel barrier of fence panels topped with a solid steel sheet divided the desert. Democrats have long been opposed to this, leaving Senate Republicans without enough votes to get the spending legislation passed. Democrats say a border wall is ineffective, in part because it constantly needs to be repaired. And building the wall is expensive: An official price tag has yet to be determined, but estimates range from $25 billion over the next 10 years to $70 billion. The Trump administration says there is a “crisis at the border,” despite government data that shows illegal border crossings into the United States from Mexico are declining. In 2000, federal agents apprehended 71,000 to 220,000 people trying to illegally enter the United States each month.

2018,Opinion | The War on Truth Spreads,"Democratically elected leaders borrow from the anti-press playbook of dictators and tyrants. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. A free and unfettered news media has long been anathema to authoritarian rulers, but even George Orwell might not have anticipated that some of the most unscrupulous assaults on press freedoms would one day be perpetrated by democratically elected governments. Witness these recent events: Earlier this week Maria Ressa, founder of an online news site critical of the Philippine government of President Rodrigo Duterte, turned herself in to face charges of tax evasion on her return from receiving an International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists. Mr. Duterte has long harassed Ms. Ressa and her start-up, Rappler, and other independent media critical of his murderous campaign against drug dealers and drug users. At one news conference, Mr. Duterte warned a Rappler reporter not to come to his hometown, Davao City, because “something bad will happen to you.” Davao is thought to be home to the most vicious of Philippine vigilante bands, the Davao Death Squad. The week before, more than 400 news outlets in Hungary, including the leading online newspaper and all remaining regional newspapers, were “donated” by their owners — many of them oligarchs loyal to Prime Minister Viktor Orban who had been systematically buying up outlets — to a foundation run by Mr. Orban’s cronies. Poland under the nationalist Law and Justice Party has been stymied by civil society in its more brazen attempts to emulate Hungary, but the public broadcaster has become something of an ideological mouthpiece. The infamous state-ordered murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and critic of the Saudi crown prince, is in a class of its own, and Saudi Arabia is emphatically not a democracy, illiberal or otherwise. But President Trump, the leader of the world’s premier democracy, has added to his other trespasses against the press by refusing to criticize the kingdom and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, despite evidence that the powerful heir must have been behind the grisly execution. President Trump’s own assault on the press includes his trademark dismissal of any reporting that riles him as “fake news” and his inflammatory depiction of the news media as the “enemy of the people.” His attempt to strip White House press credentials from CNN’s Jim Acosta on the phony pretext that he had “laid hands” on a White House intern may not be in the same league as the exploits of other autocratic press bashers — the credentials were restored by a judge in a heartening affirmation of America’s legal institutions and the First Amendment — but the president’s disdain for fact, immunity to shame and inability to stomach criticism have offered solace to illiberal comrades. Some of the most ardent hand-wringing over Mr. Khashoggi’s murder was in Turkey, where he was killed. “The fate of Khashoggi is a test for the whole world with respect to freedom of expression,” tweeted former Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu. Yet Turkey, under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, holds the world record for throwing journalists in prison. The rise of democratically elected leaders who seek to subjugate the media to their emergent cults of personality, combined with veteran masters of repression like China or Russia, has made life far more difficult for honest journalists and news outlets. But even for the old pros, times have changed. Back in the days when news was printed on paper or broadcast over radio and television, authoritarian powers like the Soviet Union and its ideological replicants simply seized control of the outlets, censored what came in from outside and repressed anyone who spoke out. The methods were crudely effective, but they also endowed smuggled-in news with the credibility of the forbidden. New information technologies — the internet, social media, smartphone cameras — were supposed to overcome censorship. They did, but they also armed autocrats with new ways to undermine the credibility of honest news. Fake news — the really fake kind — has proliferated, along with notions such as “alternative facts.” When they founded Rappler in 2012, Ms. Ressa and her colleagues thought they would use the internet to give the powerless a voice. Instead, the internet in the Philippines of Mr. Duterte has become an outlet for threats and deceit, and much of Rappler’s efforts have been dedicated to uncovering the lies planted on the web by the president’s allies and pointing them out to Facebook, the source of almost all internet news in the Philippines. It’s a losing battle — false news is so rooted in the Philippines that one Facebook executive has called it “patient zero” in the global misinformation epidemic. And yet Ms. Ressa fights on, as do reporters the world over, exposing abuse, lies and false reporting. That’s the good news.

2018,"The Warm-up Master of Amateur Night at the Apollo Is Retiring. Wait, He Changed His Mind.","Grace Notes “Be good or be gone” has long been the slogan of the Apollo Theater’s Amateur Night, an open-mic talent show where the audience can boo lackluster performers off the stage. Joe Gray has done the warm-ups for the past 30 years, getting the crowd fired up before the first contestant goes on. After he turned 69 in June, he decided it was time for him to be gone: It was time to retire. The search for a replacement began. In September, a casting agency held auditions. Then Mr. Gray changed his mind. He decided that not working — not bantering with the audience, and not hanging out with performers and stagehands behind the scenes — was not for him. He was on the way to work one day in the fall when he started thinking about his path toward retirement. “I said, ‘I still have love for this place and I am feeling good, except for my knees,” he recalled, explaining that he had surgery to fix tears in both menisci several years ago. One had popped while he was onstage. He decided to make a career U-turn. “I told them I’d like to stay on,” he said. So there will not be a changing of the guard at Amateur Night, the competition that propelled careers long before “American Idol” came along — Ella Fitzgerald, James Brown and Stevie Wonder survived Amateur Night, as did Luther Vandross, although he was booed off a couple of times before he won. Mr. Gray will continue to be the good guy of Amateur Night. He is not the bad guy. That would be left to a character known as the executioner, who kicks contestants who bomb off the stage, a role played by C.P. Lacey, himself a six-time Amateur Night winner. Mr. Gray has his own history with Amateur Night. He sang in an Amateur Night segment the first time he set foot in the Apollo, in the 1960s, after driving in from North Carolina with his mother and his girlfriend. He chose the Al Green song “Let’s Stay Together.” “I didn’t win,” he said, “but I didn’t get booed off, either.” He also met his wife, Yvonne, at an Amateur Night show. He spotted her in the front row when her niece was on the bill. After 30 years on the professional side of Amateur Night, Mr. Gray said the Amateur Night audience had changed with Harlem. When he started, he said, “There were guys, I can’t call them drug dealers, who would sit in the boxes and throw $100 bills at the kids on the stage.” Now the Apollo, which last week announced plans to expand in the redeveloped Victoria Theater nearby, says the audience is about 50 percent tourists. “You don’t see many of us in here for Amateur Night — black people,” Mr. Gray said. The Amateur Night show has changed, too. Amateur Night started in 1934 and eventually gave rise to the syndicated television program “Showtime at the Apollo,” which ran from 1987 to 2008. The pace is faster now and the show “is kind of scripted,” Mr. Gray said. But the script includes some segments in the warm-up that he started. In one, he has the audience members join hands. “Right now, there are no white people, there are no black people, there are no Chinese people,” he says. “Right now, there’s only one thing that’s happening in this place, and that’s the human race. We’re all one human race.” He also borrowed an idea from a stagehand and introduced a segment called the “Soul Train” dance line. He picks a couple of people in the audience who join him onstage for a short dance number. At least that is how the segment is supposed to go. One night, a woman jumped on his back, clamping her hands around his neck in what he remembers as a chokehold. People on the stage crew and the security detail pulled her off. Mr. Gray did not know her and said he does not know what prompted her to do it. Another unplanned moment happened because of a language breakdown. A Japanese singer was onstage, and Mr. Gray was trying to boost the energy level of the performance. “I said, ‘Move! Dance!’” he said. “She thought I said, ‘Moon!’ and turned around and mooned the audience.” Amateur Night was not his only assignment on the stage crew, and there were times when he helped stars through emergencies. One night, the singer Phyllis Hyman took her shoes off while performing. The stage had not been painted in a while, and the surface was rough. Before long, she was shrieking from a splinter in one foot. She hobbled toward Mr. Gray in the wings, put her leg in his lap and said, “Get this out.” But the Apollo was all but empty for some of his favorite performances — his own, during sound checks. That was when he got to play with James Brown’s band and with Mr. Green’s band — “I sang ‘Let’s Stay Together’ — and with Herbie Hancock, whose drummer was late. “They started playing,” Mr. Gray said. “Nobody was on the drums. I just jumped up there.” He also whistles. He was the whistler on Stephen Marley’s “Revelation Part 1: The Root of Life,” which won a Grammy Award as the best reggae album in 2011, and on a video with the Harlem Globetrotters theme song. He moved to New York when he was in his 20s, as the drummer with Cameo, an R&B funk band. A few years later, the road manager from Cameo had become the technical director at the Apollo and told Mr. Gray to stop by. “They were loading in Stevie Wonder,” he said. He learned the routine, and when a stagehand on the crew for “Showtime at the Apollo” did not report for work, he was hired. So what about those auditions for a replacement when he was planning to retire? Fatima Jones, a spokeswoman for the Apollo, said the theater had hired Greginald Spencer, who won an Amateur Night-style competition on the “Apollo Live” show on the BET network in 2013, as a standby. Which means, she said, that Mr. Gray can take the occasional night off. Which he just might. “I haven’t really missed a show in 10 years,” he said. “It’s good to have a person in place, to be ready. Back when I was thinking about retiring, I was thinking, ‘I’ve been doing it so long, do I want to do this again tonight?’ Then the curtain goes up and all those thoughts just vanish.”",The New York Times
2018,The Way We Read,"The Art of Reading Donald and Patricia Oresman’s 550-piece art collection was auctioned recently. Every piece had one thing in common: People were reading in them. Donald and Patricia Oresman’s New York City home was designed to display and store their vast art collection, along with hundreds and hundreds of books. Their art collection was unique. Each work of art depicted the quiet solitude of reading. Photos and paintings were displayed throughout their home, and hidden in drawers and nooks. Much of the Oresman’s lives were devoted to literature and art. Patricia Oresman was a social worker who studied Emily Dickinson. Donald Oresman was a lawyer and businessman who sat on the boards of the Library Company at Philadelphia, the Larchmont Library, the Morgan Library and the New Criterion. “I think there is an intensity to reading that captures artists’ imaginations because it has a very private element to it,” Mr. Oresman explained at Poets House in 2004 at an exhibition of his and his wife’s collection. Doyle auction house auctioned 550 pieces of their art collection last month. Here are some that caught our eye.",The New York Times
2018,The Way the Wind Blows,"Q&A The rotation of the Earth forces winds into clockwise and counterclockwise motions, depending on air pressure. A. Wind travels from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure. Thus, the direction of the surface wind in a high-pressure weather system is basically outward, away from the system toward lower pressure. The wind’s direction in a low-pressure system is inward. In the Northern Hemisphere, the turning of the earth on its axis results in deflection of the wind to the right. This is called the Coriolis effect, after Gustave-Gaspard Coriolis, the French scientist who first described it in 1835. If the wind is moving inward, its deflection to the right results in a counterclockwise motion. If the wind’s motion is outward, the result is a clockwise spiral. The effect is the opposite below the Equator, in the Southern Hemisphere. But meteorological authorities emphasize that this effect is only reliably seen in large-scale air masses. Small whirlwinds can spin in either direction, just as water spiraling down a drain can go in either direction, no matter which hemisphere the observer is in.

2018,The Weed Industry May Be Better Off Without the Support of Big Tobacco,"Breakingviews Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________ Big ambitions require investment, but not all infusions of capital are equal. Cronos, the Canadian pot producer, is in early talks with the tobacco giant Altria, Reuters reported on Monday. An association with a huge tobacco company isn’t exactly what this nascent industry needs. To say that Cronos has expansion plans is an understatement. It wants to grow its production of weed to more than 258,000 pounds a year — equivalent to just less than $900 million a year in revenue terms, based on its latest realized price per ounce. In the last quarter it sold just 1,133 pounds. That’s not to say that the Cronos chief executive Michael Gorenstein can’t hit that target — but anyone buying his company’s shares, or those of equally driven rivals, is effectively getting some greenhouses and nurseries, supply agreements and a lot of hope. Altria can take that risk. With a stock market capitalization of over $100 billion, it could swallow the $1.8 billion Cronos with virtually no financial impact. (Never mind that Cronos trades at more than 20 times its projected revenue for 2019, according to estimates from the data provider Refinitiv.) And for the tobacco industry, which has more enemies than friends, diversification makes sense — much like Altria’s potential investment in the vaping company Juul Labs, reported by The Wall Street Journal last week. The trouble is, cannabis isn’t quite like tobacco, nor should it want to be seen that way. Producers aspire for their product to be seen as medicinal rather than lethal, for one. In the future a lot of cannabis won’t be smoked but eaten, taken as oils or even applied as cosmetics. Moreover, pot growers would prefer not to be regulated in the same draconian way as tobacco. Canada has already imposed strict curbs on how weed companies present logos and branding. In most U.S. states where usage is legal, a more liberal approach so far prevails. In some cases, weed producers can be selective. Canopy Growth in August announced a $4 billion investment from the brewer Constellation Brands, targeting a North American infused-beverage market that analysts from Berenberg Bank think could be worth $13.2 billion. Others might turn to pharmaceuticals companies, or even personal-goods makers. Tobacco companies have cash and urgency, but their unmistakable aroma is something that Big Weed can do without.",The New York Times
2018,"The Week in Arts: Chris Thile, J.K. Simmons, Handel’s ‘Messiah’","The host of American Public Media’s “Live From Here” is broadcasting weekly from Town Hall in Manhattan. Dec. 15 and 22; ticketmaster.com. Yes, Chris Thile is based in New York City, and yes, he is the voice of the nation’s folksiest variety show. Since 2016, he’s been host of American Public Media’s “Live From Here,” a revamped version of “A Prairie Home Companion,” Garrison Keillor’s decades-long paean to storytelling and Midwestern values. But the dissonance dissolves when considering that Thile is a virtuoso mandolinist for the groups Nickel Creek and the Punch Brothers. For the month of December, Thile and his band, led by super-producer Mike Elizondo, have been broadcasting live weekly from Town Hall in Manhattan. The two remaining shows will star indie rock favorite St. Vincent and “The Late Show” bandleader Jon Batiste; and classical ensemble The Knights. There are still stories told and winkingly political sketches performed, but those musical A-listers form the show’s core. Expect all the visiting artists to step outside their musical comfort zones. NATALIE WEINER Dec. 9; starz.com. Can there ever be too much of J.K. Simmons? For fans of “Counterpart” — with the masterful character actor Simmons doing leading-man double duty — the answer is a walloping no. In its first season, “Counterpart” chased Simmons around Berlin, playing two versions of Howard Silk that are subtly, yet strikingly distinct. One is a meek office drone at an international agency called the Office of Interchange, while his badass doppelgänger operates in a secret parallel realm called the Other Side. Their mission: to swap identities and keep the gentler Howard’s comatose wife, Emily (Olivia Williams), alive. Then a terrorist attack sends the portal doors slamming shut, leaving the Howards stranded in each other’s world. Season 2 of Justin Marks’s sci-fi espionage thriller, returning to Starz on Sunday, Dec. 9, finds an awakened Emily bewildered by her faltering memory and the nagging sense that something about her husband isn’t quite right. It also sends Peter Quayle (Harry Lloyd), the Office’s deputy director of strategy, in search of evildoers within his organization — while trying to save himself from his wife, Clare (Nazanin Boniadi), now revealed to be the other, deadlier version of the woman he fell in love with. KATHRYN SHATTUCK Dec. 11-17; nyphil.org; trinitywallstreet.org. The holidays are upon us, which means that most of the world’s classical music organizations are dedicated, at some point this month, to performing Handel’s “Messiah.” Two organizations in New York this week offer noteworthy approaches. Billed, flatteringly, as the “Messiah” of all “Messiahs,” the New York Philharmonic’s run features the conductor Jonathan Cohen overseeing a strong cast that includes the countertenor Anthony Roth Costanzo, fresh off his much more outré approach to Baroque arias with the glittery “Glass Handel” project. The Trinity Wall Street church has been presenting “Messiah” since the 1770s, and its choral and orchestral forces, led by its music director Julian Wachner, should provide an invigorating and unorthodox take on the holiday staple. (The Trinity performances will also be livestreamed). WILLIAM ROBIN Through Dec. 22; perrotin.com. Through rigorous executions of distorted or surreal forms, Emily Mae Smith’s oil paintings and Genesis Belanger’s ceramics dramatize the painful contradictions of inhabiting a female body. The high point of “A Strange Relative,” their astute two-woman show at Perrotin Gallery in Manhattan, is an installation in which a sculpture and a painting, both on the subject of a woman at her dressing mirror, also mirror each other. On Belanger’s table are a loose eyeball, crushed cigarettes, a wad of gum and a tongue emerging from a lipstick tube; in Smith’s painting “Medusa Moderne,” a disconsolate broomstick with a serpentine green coiffure hunches over a lineup of similar objects. With so many layers of performance and reflection, how can you tell what’s real? WILL HEINRICH Dec. 12-15; newyorklivearts.org. In 1983, the dancers Anne Iobst and Lucy Sexton joined forces as the irreverent duo Dancenoise. Regulars on the East Village performance scene, they quickly became known for their hard-core feminism and gory, kitschy comedy. Knives and fake blood were recurring accessories, as indispensable as combat boots and lingerie. Their appearances grew more sporadic after Ms. Iobst moved to San Francisco in the late ’90s, but in recent years they have regained momentum, with a program at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 2015 and now a 35th-anniversary show at New York Live Arts in Chelsea. The Dancenoise of today dives into the vortex of our current political moment. “Lock ’em Up!,” as the Live Arts evening is titled, features the performers Tyler Ashley, Laurie Berg, Heidi Dorow, Connie Fleming, Greta Hartenstein and Madison Krekel, along with films by Charles Atlas and dramaturgy by the choreographer Sarah Michelson. SIOBHAN BURKE Dec. 12-15; bam.org. There is some chance that the young governess was overeager for the job. At 20, a parson’s daughter, she didn’t ask many questions of the disarmingly handsome Londoner who hired her to look after his young niece and nephew in the country — not even when he stipulated that her chief duty would be to leave him undisturbed. So when she starts spotting ghosts around the grand old house, in Henry James’s spine-tingling novella “The Turn of the Screw,” she doesn’t trouble her employer about it. She says not a peep, either, about her conviction that these menacing spirits are eyeing her suspiciously angelic charges. Is she imagining it? Have her sleepless nights sent her over the edge? With onstage cameras rolling, the governess (Lucia Roderique) recounts the eerie episode in “Strange Window: The Turn of the Screw,” a new multimedia adaptation by the Obie Award-winning experimental company the Builders Association. Directed by Marianne Weems, the show arrives on Wednesday, Dec. 12, at the BAM Harvey Theater as part of the Brooklyn Academy of Music’s Next Wave Festival. LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES Dec. 14. When Nadine Labaki’s “Capernaum” had its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May, it received a 15-minute standing ovation and predictions of a Palme d’Or win. (It lost out to Hirokazu Koreeda’s “Shoplifters,” but took home the Jury Prize.) Heart-rending and raw, “Capernaum” chronicles the chaotic existence of Zain (Zain Al Rafeea), an impoverished 12-year-old delivery boy full of brooding and bravura in Beirut who is desperate to save his younger sister Sahar (Haita “Cedra” Izzam) from marriage to a much older man. Fleeing his callous parents’ overcrowded home, he ends up living with Rahil (Yordanos Shiferaw), an illegal immigrant from Ethiopia, and caring for her baby. When Zain is sentenced to five years in prison for a stabbing, he sues his mother and father for, he says, “giving me life.” Labaki shot 520 hours of footage across six months as she coaxed inhabitants of the city’s slums — including Zain, a Syrian refugee now resettled with his family in Norway — into re-enacting their struggles. “Capernaum,” Lebanon’s Oscar entry for best foreign-language film, opens in New York and Los Angeles on Friday, Dec. 14, before a national rollout.

2018,"The Week in Arts: Phony Ppl, ‘Destroyer,’ a Broadway Matinee Bonanza","Dec. 28; mercuryeastpresents.com. The divides between R&B, soul, hip-hop and jazz have long been porous, and more and more contemporary artists are taking advantage of this overlap. Among those is Brooklyn quintet Phony Ppl, which is performing a one-off show at Manhattan’s Mercury Lounge after spending the fall opening for rapper Pusha T. The band members’ experimental, rough-around-the-edges approach is grounded by their instrumental prowess and smart songwriting, which gives even their most eclectic tunes the flavor of classic R&B. On the group’s most recent album, “Mozaik,” there are breezy, bossa nova-inflected grooves (“Once You Say Hello”), Soul Train-ready throwbacks (“Move Her Mind”) and upbeat raps (“Before You Get a Boyfriend”). A romantic thread ties together much of the band’s music: “Do you want to join my one man band?” sings the frontman Elbee Thrie on “One Man Band.” “All I’ve got is my heart in my hand.” NATALIE WEINER Dec. 25. Nicole Kidman is a wreck in “Destroyer”: Her body’s aching bones, her skin a sun-weathered hide, her eyes ringed in perma-red. As Erin Bell, a Los Angeles detective in free-fall since an undercover assignment went terribly wrong years earlier, she wears the stench of alcohol and despair to crime scenes. Long ago any notion of home for her teenage daughter or herself was obliterated. But when a dead body is found surrounded by ink-stained bills, Bell knows: Silas, a cultlike bank robber, is back. And she’s off on a mission to end the man who ended any shot she had at happiness. Kidman fades into Bell to the point of being nearly unrecognizable — portraying her as a fresh-faced rookie, then as gnarled terminator — and has been nominated for a Golden Globe. Karyn Kusama (“Girlfight”) directs this pulpy, savage drama with undertones of “Dirty Harry” and “Heat,” and starring Sebastian Stan, Tatiana Maslany and a kick-ass shootout. “Destroyer” opens on Christmas Day in New York and Los Angeles before rolling out nationally in January. KATHRYN SHATTUCK Dec. 24-28; broadway.org. It’s the rare last-minute gift that doubles as a way to spend time with your loved ones — without actually having to speak to them. If you’re in the market for a present along those lines, may we suggest tickets to a holiday week matinee on Broadway? For most of the year, matinee options are generally limited to Wednesdays and weekends. But with Christmas falling on a Tuesday and many shows taking that night off, they’re making it up with afternoon performances peppered throughout the rest of the week. A few (“The Waverly Gallery,” “The Lion King,” “Aladdin”) land on Christmas Eve, and loads of others, including “The Prom,” “The New One,” “The Cher Show” and “The Band’s Visit,” arrive later in the week. Playbill has a comprehensive list. Be prepared, of course, for the usual holiday throngs in Manhattan, and plan your travel accordingly. But here’s one sweet advantage to a matinee over an evening show: The timing is right for a leisurely lunch beforehand and dinner at a normal hour that night. LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES Dec. 23 and 25; metmuseum.org; earlymusicny.org. Containing hundreds of buoyant pieces, the Cancionero Musical de Palacio manuscript is one of the largest sources of music from 15th-century Spain, including polyphonic villancicos, romances and canciones. At the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Cloisters, the collection will form the basis of a Christmas-themed celebration of Renaissance Spanish music, presented by MetLiveArts and performed by the ensemble Sonnambula and the lutenist and guitarist Esteban La Rotta. At the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, other unusual historically minded holiday repertoire will resound: The intrepid group Early Music New York, led by Frederick Renz, will present music from 18th-century England and the New England colonies, including classic shape-note hymns that represent the early stirrings of American music. WILLIAM ROBIN Through March 31, 2019; sfmoma.org Vija Celmins’s stripped-down aesthetic has passed through a number of distinct phases in her long artistic career. “Vija Celmins: To Fix the Image in Memory” at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art has examples of most of them: A moody 1964 painting of a space heater glowing orange, giant pencils and erasers made of painted wood, exacting drawings of crumpled photographs of pistols or mushroom clouds. What the Latvian-born octogenarian is most famous for, though, is her graphite renderings of star-dappled skies and dark ocean waves. The technical command necessary to capture the nebulous depth and shadow of water, or the shifting scope of empty space, is impressive enough. What makes the drawings worth revisiting is that Celmins also, somehow, summons the mysterious serenity you feel watching real tides or the Milky Way. WILL HEINRICH Now streaming; walterpresents.com; amazon.com. If you’re dreaming not merely of a white Christmas but an alternate universe, check out the latest installment of “Modus” on Walter Presents. Season 1 of this Swedish thriller — starring Melinda Kinnaman as the psychological profiler Inger Johanne Vik, hunting down a possible serial killer after her autistic daughter witnesses a murder — was the streaming service’s most-watched series in 2018. Season 2 finds a very pregnant Vik living with her partner, Detective Ingvar Nyman (Henrik Norlen), when the first female American president, Helen Tyler (Kim Cattrall), arrives in Stockholm for a state visit — a none-too-subtle reminder of what might have been — and promptly vanishes. In her entourage is the F.B.I. agent Warren Schifford (Greg Wise), who was charged with raping Vik when she worked with him in the United States four years earlier. Icy and sinister with subplots involving the New York Stock Exchange and Middle Eastern campaign donors, “Modus,” a captivating, occasionally convoluted Scandi noir, can also be found on PBS Masterpiece on Amazon Prime Video. KATHRYN SHATTUCK cbc.ca; youtube.com. It’s rare to find a ballet movie or TV show that doesn’t rehash clichés and features professional dancers as lead actors. So the mockumentary “Off Kilter,” produced by CBC Arts in Canada, came as a refreshing surprise when it was released this past summer. In eight short episodes, the web series follows Milton Frank (Alejandro Álvarez Cadilla, also the show’s writer and creator), a fictional choreographer haunted by a plagiarism scandal that derailed his career in his 20s. Making his first ballet in 25 years, he is a mess, held together by his ambitious publicist and four dancers, played by members of the National Ballet of Canada and the Royal Winnipeg Ballet. With a light touch and sometimes absurdist humor, the show raises issues often absent from popular portrayals of ballet like ageism, injury and the gender pay gap. The week of Christmas, when there’s little live dance to see, is the perfect time to catch up. Viewers outside of Canada can tune in on YouTube. SIOBHAN BURKE",The New York Times
2018,"The Week in Arts: ‘Hard Nut,’ Bruce Springsteen and Decoding Arias","Mark Morris’s riotous and poignant take on ‘The Nutcracker’ returns to the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Through Dec. 23, bam.org. Dances turn into classics for a reason. And in Mark Morris’s “The Hard Nut,” returning to the Brooklyn Academy of Music, there are plenty of them, from the pop-art designs inspired by the cartoonist Charles Burns to the yule log burning on a television set during the party scene. Morris bases his version of holiday classic on E.T.A. Hoffmann’s “The Nutcracker and the Mouse King.” It’s both a riot and a poignant tale of a young girl’s awakening. For the treasured Mark Morris Dance Group, it also reunites past generations. John Heginbotham, as Mrs. Stahlbaum/Queen, and June Omura, as Fritz, reprise longtime roles, while the veteran company member Laurent Grant returns to the part of Marie. (It’s her 22nd year.)

Just hours later, on Dec. 16, Netflix will unveil “Springsteen on Broadway” for streaming to your heart’s content. Distilled from Springsteen’s 2016 memoir, “Born to Run,” the show intersperses storytelling — about his childhood in Freehold, N.J.; his search for a voice; his quest for salvation — with 15 songs, stripped down and solemnized, the better to reveal hidden truths. It’s all part of what Springsteen has deemed his magic trick: that a man like himself, unattractive in voice and appearance, should nonetheless build a rollicking five-decade career in service to a higher calling. Or what he calls his “long and noisy prayer.” KATHRYN SHATTUCK wnycstudios.org.

The musical theater star Norm Lewis began 2018 by spending a couple of months in the Broadway cast of “Once on This Island.” Now he’s wrapping the year in his usual way: with a Christmas cabaret at Feinstein’s/54 Below in Manhattan, that this time he’s calling “Nutcracker Cool.” Lewis, a Tony nominee for “The Gershwins’ Porgy and Bess,” said one morning this month that he wants his holiday show to be pure fun — a respite from the tumultuous world outside. “I’ve gotten kind of emotional about this past year in a way that you go, ‘I’ve got to turn the news off,’” he said. “So I’m hoping to give some kind of safe space, if you will, some safe haven. No matter what your political affiliation is.” The playlist will include several numbers from his new release “The Norm Lewis Christmas Album,” including “The Little Drummer Boy,” “Mary, Did You Know?” and “Home,” from “The Wiz.” Burt Bacharach’s “Be Aware” will be new this year, as will a Barbra Streisand song that’s “going to be a surprise,” Lewis said. The six-show run starts Monday, Dec. 17. LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES Through Dec. 21; pacegallery.com. It’s no surprise that Pace Gallery’s “Agnes Martin/Navajo Blankets,” where serene abstractions by the 20th-century painter alternate with chief-style textiles from the early 19th century, is the first of its kind. There’s no particular historical connection between the two bodies of work, though Martin did live for many years in New Mexico. But the pairing is inspired: The blanket’s bright colors bring out an energy that’s usually only implicit in Martin’s subdued horizontal stripes. At the same time, the clean, matte lines of her paintings visually anchor the textiles’ bold patterns, making them easier to take in and appreciate without being overwhelmed. WILL HEINRICH Dec. 21 and 22; ticketmaster.com. All it takes is one unforgettable performance — like Darlene Love’s 1963 original “Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)” — to become a fixture of holiday movies, TV and radio, where nostalgia reigns supreme. Of course, Love has contributed far more than that irresistibly over-the-top tune, recorded for the seminal compilation, “A Christmas Gift For You From Phil Spector.” Love is a member of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, recognition for her status as one of the most prolific backup singers of all time; her story was also chronicled in the Oscar-winning documentary “Twenty Feet From Stardom.” But for these two shows at Sony Hall in Manhattan, her singular Christmas songs will be the focus, so the same voice that was the soundtrack for everything from “Love Actually” to “Jingle All The Way” can be the soundtrack to your holiday, too. NATALIE WEINER Dec. 21. For nearly a decade, the Polish director Pawel Pawlikowski struggled with how to tell his parents’ love story — the 40 years they’d spent chasing each other across the Iron Curtain in what he has called “a never-ending disaster.” He finally decided to make a film that’s not actually about them. The protagonists in his latest work are named after his mother and father, Zula and Wiktor, and are given familiar temperaments, but the similarities mostly end there. In “Cold War,” Zula, an enigmatic young singer from a provincial Polish town, worms her way into auditions for a folk-arts ensemble, and soon into the fantasies of its artistic director, Wiktor. When the group visits Berlin, Wiktor persuades Zula to escape with him — thus beginning a chase across time, borders and musical genres, from Polish songs and Parisian jazz to a Hollywood-esque rock around the clock. Shot in black-and-white, with a soundtrack that aches, it’s a ravishing study in passion and tyranny. “Cold War,” Poland’s Oscar entry for best foreign-language film (Pawlikowski’s “Ida” won in 2015) opens Friday, Dec. 21, in New York and Los Angeles before a national rollout.

2018,"The Week in Business: Apple Expands in Austin, and the Fed Gears Up on Interest Rates","with interest Want this column in your inbox? Sign up here. Hi there! Here you are, rushing around with too many plans, not enough holiday shopping done and perhaps a mild headache from last night’s mulled wine. The least we can give you is a quick rundown of what’s going on in the business world. If you like what you’re reading and haven’t already subscribed, click here — and then forward to a friend if you’re feeling generous. Speaking of the holiday season, are you one of the 45.7 million Americans planning to fly in the next two weeks? If so, keep an ear out: Customs officials at Kennedy Airport have intercepted almost 200 live finches (70 last week alone) that were smuggled on flights from Guyana. Once in the United States, the birds compete in chirping competitions, and a winner can fetch up to $10,000. While we do not condone any illegal behavior, in the grand scheme of sounds to be heard on a plane, a finch sounds downright pleasant. DEC. 9-15 Want a shot at an Apple employee discount? Now may be your moment. Apple announced plans on Thursday to invest $1 billion in a slick new campus in Austin, Tex. It will eventually bring 15,000 jobs to the area, while additional offices in Seattle, San Diego and Culver City, Calif., each plan to hire more than 1,000 employees. For years, Apple has been under fire for relying heavily on China for its product manufacturing, and this announcement makes good on its recent promise to expand operations in the United States. Other tech giants like Amazon and Google have made similar moves to expand their domestic work force in the past few months. Consider popping over to England for some holiday shopping — you’ll get a good deal on your dollar, as the British pound fell last week to its lowest value in a year and half. That’s only one symptom of the instability brought on by Britain’s floundering attempts to extricate itself from the European Union. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Theresa May — whose name is almost impossible to say without the word “embattled” before it — postponed the parliamentary vote on her Brexit proposal, which was clearly headed for defeat. Now, having survived a no-confidence vote, she’s back to the drawing board with exasperated European leaders, who have expressed little to no interest in renegotiating. Trade tensions with China eased slightly as President Xi Jinping began to lift new barriers to American imports like cars and food (phew). But the dispute is far from over, and China’s economy is showing signs of stress, weakened by mounting debt and the Trump administration’s tariffs. On Friday, Chinese officials reported bleak numbers for monthly sales and industrial production, jolting markets around the globe. Auto sales have also plunged, and some factories are sending workers off for the Lunar New Year holiday two months early. DEC. 16-22 Don’t be surprised by a tremor in the markets this Wednesday — it’s just the Federal Reserve making its last interest rate decision of the year. The Fed is expected to raise benchmark rates by another quarter point, and to do so twice more in 2019. Officials hope to stem inflation and keep the economy solid as it grows over the long run, but these upticks affect home buyers and other borrowers most acutely in the short term: Higher interest rates on mortgages and other loans can add up, and quickly. President Trump has made no secret of his distaste for rate increases of any amount, and blamed this fall’s market volatility on the Fed’s choice to impose them. So much for Washington going quietly into the holiday break. Funding for parts of the federal government will expire this Friday unless Congress and Mr. Trump can agree on legislation to keep the lights on. In an awkward televised spat with the Democratic congressional leaders, Representative Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, the president said he would be “proud to shut down the government” if the funding bill did not include $5 billion for his proposed southern border wall — which he has repeatedly said that Mexico would pay for, but never mind. Democrats have agreed to dedicate funds to border security, but not enough for the wall. While Nissan’s former chairman, Carl Ghosn, sits in jail, awaiting trial on charges of financial misconduct, the future of his auto empire (the alliance of Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors) is in limbo. Nissan’s stock has dropped 9 percent in recent weeks, and its board members are meeting on Monday to attempt to appoint a new chairman. It’s unlikely that they will agree on one. They’ll also set a date for a shareholder vote to oust Mr. Ghosn from the board altogether. Rather awkwardly, Renault has stuck by Mr. Ghosn, and he remains chief executive. So much for an alliance. Federal prosecutors are examining the finances of Mr. Trump’s 2017 inauguration committee and a pro-Trump super PAC to determine whether foreigners illegally funneled money to both in hopes of buying influence over American policy. Also, the tabloid publisher American Media Inc. admitted to participating in a hush-money scheme intended to protect Mr. Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign. Speaking of settlements, CBS paid the actress Eliza Dushku $9.5 million after she spoke up about sexual harassment on the set of TV drama “Bull” and was written off the show, adding to the list of sexual misconduct issues at the network. 100 euros: An increase to the monthly minimum wage in France, as promised by President Emmanuel Macron this week, in an effort to quell the Yellow Vest protests.

2018,The Week in Business: The Emails Facebook Doesn’t Want You to See,"with interest Want this column in your inbox? Sign up here. Hi there! Charlotte Cowles here, back from my week off and ready to regale you with the top stories in business and tech. If you’re reading this for the first time, and like your news quick and painless on Sunday mornings, you can receive With Interest in your inbox by subscribing here. Your well-informed Monday self will thank you. Speaking of which, tomorrow is “Green Monday,” coined by retailers for all the cash that procrastinators (like yours truly) will spend when they realize it’s the second week of December and they haven’t bought any holiday presents yet. Another reason it pays to shop early: Some Walmart customers received an extra gift last week, when two wealthy elves — the filmmaker Tyler Perry and the billionaire philanthropist Gayle Benson — paid off outstanding layaway accounts at their local stores. Anonymous donors picked up the tabs for shoppers in Colorado and Vermont, too. Dec. 2-8 You might have noticed whiplash on Wall Street last week. Stocks rose on Monday on news of a trade cease-fire with China, then fell mightily late in the week, as investors reacted to the news that American officials orchestrated the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of the Chinese telecom giant Huawei (and the daughter of its founder). Ms. Meng’s detention in Canada, and possible extradition to New York, poses trouble for the United States’ relationship with China, which of course has been incredibly tense with the tariff battle that’s hurting the economies of both countries. Adding insult to injury, Ms. Meng was detained on the same night that “Tariff Man,” a.k.a. President Trump, dined with China’s president, Xi Jinping, in Argentina, where they agreed to the 90-day trade truce. The victim of Facebook’s latest privacy breach: itself. On Wednesday, Britain’s parliament released 250 pages of the company’s internal documents, including emails between top executives. The messages revealed ruthless efforts to extract as much data as possible from users like you and me, and obscure the fact that it was doing so. The emails also show that the company wielded data like currency, bestowing special access to it as a reward to friendly businesses like Airbnb and Netflix while cutting off rivals. Facebook says the emails don’t tell the full story. It must be painful to have private information given to others without your consent, right? The who’s who of the oil industry huddled in Vienna to decide just how expensive a trip to the gas station will be next year. On everyone’s mind was a glut of supply poised to flood markets and drive down prices even more, which would be nice for drivers’ wallets but damaging for the oil economy. As predicted, Russia and Saudi Arabia buddied up to cut production and bolster prices, defying Mr. Trump’s call for cheaper gas. (A viral video of the fratty high-five exchanged by President Vladimir Putin and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the recent gathering of the Group of 20 nations says it all.) DEC. 9-15 Will the rebellion continue? Members of France’s “Yellow Vest” movement have carried out violent anti-government rallies to protest economic inequality and high unemployment rates (currently 9.1 percent). Though President Emmanuel Macron has backed down from a proposed gas tax increase, the policy that set off the furor, streets across France remain full of demonstrators. Wearing brightly colored roadside hazard vests, they have burned cars, broken windows and confronted riot police, particularly in fancy neighborhoods in Paris. Brace your stock portfolio for the possibility of more havoc, this time from Europe, as Britain’s parliament votes on the Brexit plan this Tuesday. London traders are preparing for stressful market swings and long hours by bringing sleeping bags and even mini golf sets to the office. Given the proposal’s chaotic birth and less-than-welcome reception, its passage is iffy. European Union leaders will convene in Brussels on Wednesday to commiserate (and, I assume, gossip) about the fallout. Uber will resume tests of its self-driving cars in the coming weeks, but don’t expect an autonomous vehicle to pull up at your door anytime soon (or, for that matter, to help the company’s bottom line before it goes public). In March, Uber stopped the program after one of its driverless cars killed a pedestrian in Arizona, and the company is now proceeding more cautiously. Unlike previous trials, when 200 test cars hit the streets in multiple cities under various driving conditions, the vehicles will now be limited to a one-mile loop between two offices in Pittsburgh. The cars won’t operate at night or in wet weather, and they’ll stay under 25 miles an hour. Michael Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer-slash-fixer, will be sentenced on Wednesday for multiple offenses, including willful tax evasion and various illegal campaign contributions. And last week, the Senate approved Kathy Kraninger, President Trump’s nominee who has no experience in financial services, as the new head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo fired dozens of district managers. The dismissals were part of the bank’s ongoing efforts to show regulators (and customers) that it is serious about cleaning up its sales practices. 3.7 percent: The unemployment rate in the United States in November.

2018,"The Week in Business: ’Twas the Week After Christmas, and Markets Were Stirring","with interest Want this column in your inbox? Sign up here. The week between Christmas and New Year’s always feels longer than it is. Unless you’re the stock market, you probably haven’t moved much (in my case, gingerbread rum balls are the culprit). And even if you managed to haul yourself into the office, no one responded to your emails (sorry). If you’re feeling stir crazy, just remember: Soon it’ll be January, and you’ll look back on these slow, sugar-addled days with fondness. Get ready to hit the ground running by catching up on the top stories in business and tech, plus what’s coming up later this week. Then proceed to revel in your final hours of sloth before those resolutions officially kick in. Happy New Year, everyone. Dec. 23-29 If you didn’t pay attention to the stock market last week, your blood pressure is surely better for it — although I can’t speak for the effects of your Christmas cookie consumption. To recap: Your portfolio went for a ride when markets neared bear territory on Monday, rocketed back up on Wednesday (the S&P 500 saw its biggest one-day leap since 2009), and wobbled on Friday, closing slightly lower. Why all the theatrics? You can guess the usual suspects, including rising interest rates and the ongoing trade tensions with China, as well as the federal government shutdown — more on that in a minute. Analysts believe the volatility reflects general unease about the economy going into 2019. Brace your 401(k)’s, everybody. The government shutdown will stretch into January while President Trump remains deadlocked with Democrats in Congress over a spending bill that includes his $5 billion demand for a border wall. As a result, about 15 percent of federal employees, or 800,000 people, don’t know when they’ll see their next paycheck. Many are required to show up for work anyway, including Border Patrol officers (the irony) and Transportation Security Administration agents — so be extra polite at the airport this week, O.K.? The rest, around 380,000 people, are sitting at home without pay. The government’s Office of Personnel Management has provided form letters that furloughed workers can send to lenders if they can’t cover their bills. The crowdfunding platform Patreon is facing a backlash after it kicked off two right-wing polemicists — Carl Benjamin and Milo Yiannopoulos — for hate speech. Several other high-profile users quit the website in protest, citing concerns about censorship and political bias. Patreon makes money for content creators like Mr. Benjamin and Mr. Yiannopoulos by collecting funds from their fans, and then takes a 5 percent cut for itself — so fewer users equals less revenue. This controversy is the latest example of the struggle by tech companies like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to moderate content and enforce the line between free speech and hate speech. DEC. 30-JAN. 5 New and re-elected lawmakers in the Senate and House of Representatives will convene for a swearing-in ceremony this Thursday, their first session of 2019. At the top of the docket: Ending the shutdown so that federal employees can get back to work — and get paid. But first, the House will elect a new speaker. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader, is the likely pick, and she has already made it clear that the House’s new majority is in no mood to compromise on funding for Mr. Trump’s proposed border wall, whatever shape it takes (even “a beaded curtain”). Do your New Year’s resolutions include job hunting? Excellent news: The labor market looks strong heading into 2019. Employment data for December will be released this Friday, and analysts expect to see 180,000 new jobs. The unemployment rate is predicted to stay at 3.7 percent, a 48-year low. Wages, meanwhile, are projected to rise 3 percent, following increases of 3.1 percent for two straight months, the most since 2009. Polish up that résumé. Blame the Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, for your slimmer retirement account if you want, but he’s not going anywhere. When criticism from Mr. Trump prompted fears that Mr. Powell might lose his job (concerns that helped fuel Monday’s diving markets), officials close to the president offered reassurances that the chairman’s seat was safe. Anticipate questions about that and more when he gets grilled — er, appears on a panel — with his Fed predecessors Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke this Friday, at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association in Atlanta. Mr. Powell’s responses may set the markets aflutter — not that it isn’t flapping wildly enough already. For-profit cosmetology schools often leave graduates with loads of debt and low-paying job opportunities. Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, asked a California judge to dismiss a defamation lawsuit that stemmed from a tweet he posted in July calling a British cave diver a pedophile. Japan announced that it would resume commercial whale hunting this year, defying an international ban. And Amazon shipped a record number of items this holiday season. 78: The number of environmental rules that the Trump administration has either reversed or started the process of weakening, mostly in the name of boosting the fossil fuel industry. According to an analysis by researchers at Harvard, these rollbacks could lead to more than 80,000 extra deaths per decade and cause respiratory problems for over a million people. The poor sage grouse won’t fare too well, either.",The New York Times

Want to get The Week in Good News by email? Sign up here. Here are seven great things we wrote about this week: In the age of Google Maps, you’d think we might have discovered all the planet has to offer. You’d be wrong about that, and this cave proves it. Scientists found it in early spring in a remote area of British Columbia. It has an opening big enough to fit the Statue of Liberty, with a roaring river running through it. It’s most likely tens of thousands of years old, and is charmingly referred to as “Sarlacc’s Pit,” because of its resemblance to the deep hole that is home to a desert creature in “Star Wars: Return of the Jedi.” “It’s one of the biggest in Canada,” said John Pollack, a career caver and governor of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society, “and certainly one of the most spectacular.” Read more » Pigeon overcrowding has become a problem in Cádiz, Spain, where some are complaining that the birds are menacing tourists and leaving excrement that poses a health risk in outdoor dining and drinking areas. In some places, pigeons are culled or fed contraceptive pills that may be consumed by other species. Cádiz pigeons, however, will be captured and transported to rural eastern Spain, where they are expected to settle into a new home in a dovecote, a structure made to house pigeons. The city hopes to carry out the relocation next year. Read more » The country is small, with a population of about 560,000, but more than 180,000 workers commute across the borders from Belgium, France and Germany. Luxembourg also has the highest number of cars for its population in the European Union: 662 per 1,000 people. This can mean big traffic problems . The proposal to take some of the congestion off Luxembourg’s roads was greeted enthusiastically on social media. Helena Rivera, an architect, said on Twitter, “A day to dream about in London.” Read more » Do you have a wedding dress gathering dust in your closet? If you aren’t planning on wearing it again or reusing it in some way, why not donate it? Several nonprofits will take such donations. Some qualified charities will also take bridesmaids’ and flower girls’ dresses, and bridal accessories like veils and tiaras. Just be sure to hold onto your receipts and purchasing documentation. “Women want their dress to get a second life and they want a cause they can connect to,” said Drew Edwards, the chief executive of Brides Against Breast Cancer, which collects wedding dress donations. “They’ve spent a lot of time shopping with their mom and friends, and they want someone to get that same joy they did.” Read more » Genevieve Purinton was 18 when she became pregnant, and she was alone when she gave birth in a hospital in Gary, Ind., in 1949. She was told that her baby had died, but a doctor at the hospital had secretly arranged an adoption. The baby, Connie Moultroup, is now 69, and discovered the truth after an Ancestry.com DNA test. They met for the first time this month. As they hugged, Ms. Moultroup recalled, her mother looked at her and said, “You’re not dead.” They both cried. “It was a bawlfest,” Ms. Moultroup said. “She was so happy to meet me.” Read more » They’re the size of a briefcase or a loaf of bread, and a group of them, operated by Planet Labs, helped firefighters monitor and contain the spread of the Camp Fire in California. Small satellites are less expensive than larger ones, and more accessible to a wider group of interests. They make it possible, among other advances, to observe Earth’s environment more completely and regularly than before. Even high schools and universities are getting into the game.

Want to get The Week in Good News by email? Sign up here. Here are seven great things we wrote about this week: There was a nearly century-old ordinance against snowball throwing in Severance, Colo. Dane Best, who heard about the ban on a school trip to the Town Hall, gave a five-minute presentation to trustees that said the law was outdated. “Today, kids need reasons to play outside,” he said. “The children of Severance want the opportunity to have a snowball fight like the rest of the world.” The Town Board voted unanimously to lift whatever ban there might have been on snowballs. Dane triumphantly threw the first “legal” snowball this week. Read more » Last spring, Judith Jones and Carolyn Kenyon heard about R.I.P. Medical Debt, a nonprofit that buys past-due medical bills at a steep discount and forgives them. So the women, both of Ithaca, N.Y., started a fund-raising campaign of their own to help those in need. They raised $12,500 and sent it to the charity, which then purchased a portfolio of $1.5 million of medical debts on their behalf. Debts were forgiven for 1,284 New Yorkers. Read more » Hours after John Drennan and Daniella Anthony got engaged in New York, the ring slipped off her finger and fell down a sidewalk grate in Times Square. The couple, visiting from Britain, tried to recover it, then flagged down a police officer to report the mishap. Convinced the ring was lost forever, they walked away without leaving their names. After the ring was recovered, the police posted the news on Twitter with a request for help finding the couple. It didn’t take long for the news to spread to Britain. “We are absolutely ecstatic,” Mr. Drennan said. He added that love itself was far more valuable than a ring: “When you have something so beautiful like that, it just puts everything in perspective.” Read more » The healthy, six-pound baby girl was born in São Paulo, Brazil, to a woman who received a uterus from a 45-year-old donor. It is the first such birth to be reported. A viable procedure to transplant uteri from deceased women could drastically increase the availability of the organs. “We talk about lifesaving transplants. This is a life-giving transplant, a new category,” said Dr. Allan D. Kirk, the chief surgeon at Duke University Health System. Read more » The remains of a man who could have been a fisherman or dock worker 500 years ago were found deep in the mud of the River Thames in London. His boots were a point of interest. “We never find high boots like this — they are always shoes or ankle boots,” Beth Richardson, a specialist with MOLA Headland, which leads digs on infrastructure sites, said. “High boots are just not very common throughout medieval times.” The man and his rare boots were found on the construction site of the Thames Tideway Tunnel. Last year, the Museum of London exhibited some of the artifacts found during construction for another megaproject: Crossrail. They included a Victorian chamber pot bearing the inscription, “Oh what I see I will not tell.” Read more » Women now form an essential part of the national market for Lake Kivu fish. The fish economy, traditionally occupied by men, has created opportunities for women to form collectives and earn their own income. Bonifrida Mukabideri is a founding member of Projet Pêche, a fishing cooperative of 87 women in Kibuye, a resort town along the banks of the lake. “I am very proud to be a part of the cooperative,” she said. “Now a woman can say: ‘I can build a house by myself.

Nintendo helped popularize the retro gaming trend with the 2016 release of the NES Classic, a scaled-down version of its original console, and 30 vintage games. Some struggling brands, like Atari, are getting a boost as well. Sony introduced the PlayStation Classic this week, loaded with 20 games for $100. “It’s kind of like watching a classic movie versus a remake or a colorized version,” Eric Lempel, the senior vice president of global marketing at PlayStation, said. “This is the way you remember those games.” Read more » What would you like to see here?

Want to get The Week in Good News by email? Sign up here. Here are seven great things we wrote about this week: Owen Williams of southern Wales shared a story of generosity on Twitter this week. His neighbor, Ken Watson, had always doted on Mr. Williams’s 2½-year-old daughter, Cadi. Mr. Watson, who had no grandchildren of his own, died recently in his 80s, but it appears that one of his final wishes was to make sure Cadi got a present from him — for the next 14 years. “He always told us he’d live till he was 100 years old,” Mr. Williams wrote on Twitter, “so these gifts would have taken him up to our little girl’s 16th Christmas.” Mr. Williams and his wife unwrapped this year’s gift out of curiosity. Their daughter’s first present from her secret Santa will be “Christmas Eve at the Mellops’, ” a children’s book by Tomi Ungerer.

That sounds like a long way off, but its appearance is among the 10 closest approaches by a comet in 70 years, NASA said. And don’t worry if you missed it; it should be visible for a week or two. Enjoy it while it’s here, because it might not be this close again for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. Read more » Animal rescue groups have created programs for feral cats that have been spayed or neutered. Homeowners or store owners agree to provide the cats with shelter, food, water and medical care in exchange for an added line of defense against mice and other vermin. The cats aren’t pets, really. Many of them haven’t been socialized and might not like being cuddled. But once acclimated to a new environment, they will hang around and keep the mice at bay. Read more » The American Academy of Pediatrics recently issued a statement advising parents of young children to look for high-quality “traditional” toys rather than elaborate digital ones. Their reasoning: Physical toys give children scope for imagination and invention, and also encourage play that brings families together. If you’ve seen a toddler playing with pots and pans or a big cardboard box, you get the idea. Read more » A piano that once belonged to the storied American composer and songwriter Cole Porter has a plaque that says, “Some of the loveliest songs in America’s musical history were composed on this Steinway.” But it had a badly out-of-tune middle C, so off it went to “sleep-away camp for pianos”: the Steinway factory in Astoria, Queens.

2018,The Week in Tech: A Peek at the Year Ahead,"Bits Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times review the week’s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here. Hello! I’m Nellie Bowles, the Silicon Valley and tech culture reporter at The Times, now with the privilege of bringing you the last tech newsletter of 2018. Readers of this letter know all too well what happened in tech news this year. We had some good times (crypto!), but mostly the headlines from Silicon Valley were dire revelations about corporate power, violations of consumer trust and platform-led disinformation. Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, even finished the year with a product mishap: It accidentally released horizontal scrolling to horrified users, Sandra E. Garcia and Niraj Chokshi reported. I’m not going to pretend 2019 will be free of Facebook news, but a new set of stories are going hit this newsletter. The year looks as if it’s going to be a Silicon Valley I.P.O.-palooza. Uber, Airbnb, Lyft, Palantir and Pinterest are all angling to go public in 2019, despite the recent stock market swoon. Cash, locked up in stock options, is about to flood the region, and fleets of new millionaires will be roving. It’ll be a boom, except San Francisco never really had a bust. So it’ll just be more. The housing market will be strained. More. Restaurants will open. Or reopen. And the city will have another chance to funnel these gains into infrastructure. Finally, this generation of start-ups, some still losing large amounts of money, will see how they can fare under the scrutiny of public markets. Will public investors be less forgiving than the venture-investing counterparts of unprofitable companies? We’ll be there to cover all of it. Now for the week’s stories: ■ Vindu Goel told how Amazon and Walmart might find themselves under strict new Indian laws against offering discounts, exclusive products or products supplied by affiliated companies on their Indian shopping sites. ■ The Federal Trade Commission is looking into how Facebook handles personal information, my colleague Natasha Singer reported. In 2011, the commission accused the company of deceptive privacy practices. And in light of the past year’s near-constant news about Facebook’s betraying consumer privacy, it looks as if it might be back in hot water. ■ I wrote about how the online payments platform Patreon is working to enforce its rules against hate speech, causing a small revolt among its user base. And I followed up on my blockchain reporting from earlier this year with a somber foray into Crypto Winter. ■ The artificial intelligence that became better at chess than any human or computer has ever been has now been thoroughly studied. Scientists have concluded that it did indeed show an intellect humans hadn’t seen before, wrote Steven Strogatz, a mathematics professor at Cornell. And in his beautiful essay, he explored what that means. ■ Brian X. Chen managed to find two tech products that got better in 2018. Which ones? Smartphone parental controls like screen time limits and the privacy-focused browser Firefox. ■ And Daniel Victor brought us back to our brief moments of communal joy and laughter with five fun 2018 memes. Did you know Yanny vs. Laurel was this year? (I literally have gone gray since then.) ■ Finally, the investigative reporter Matt Apuzzo wrote about his personal tech use. He travels with burner laptops and for the really sensitive interviews will never type the notes digitally anywhere. He has also been off Twitter for two years, he added, leaving us with the week’s best kicker. “I’m still there as @mattapuzzo, though, because a colleague told me that if I deleted the account it would be taken over by sex bots. And nobody wants that.” See you all in 2019. May none of your accounts be overtaken by sex bots.

2018,The Week in Tech: Facebook Is in the News. Again.,"Bits Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times review the week’s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here. Greetings, friends. I’m Brian X. Chen, a tech columnist, meaning my job is to obsess over tech news so you don’t have to. So here’s the CliffsNotes version of the week in tech. I remember a time when tech companies were desperate to be in the news. Just a decade ago, making headlines usually meant a company’s gadget or software product was making a big splash and getting nice publicity. But nowadays, tech companies are more powerful than ever, and journalists are focusing on holding them accountable rather than cheerleading. So I bet Facebook wishes it could be out of the news cycle, even briefly. This week, a British parliamentary committee released confidential Facebook emails and documents as part of its investigation into online misinformation. And they did not make Mark Zuckerberg’s social networking empire look good. The documents revealed how Facebook treated user data as a bargaining chip. The social network had a “white list” agreement with companies it favored, including Airbnb, Lyft and Netflix. The arrangement involved sharing user data with those parties that other companies were restricted from obtaining. The revelations paint Facebook as if it were the head of an internet syndicate with the mission of making money and crushing competition. That’s a terrible image at a time that Facebook is trying to win back people’s trust by saying its true mission is to connect people with people. In a nondenial statement, Facebook said it never sold people’s data. None of the bad publicity is lost on Facebook employees, as it appears to be affecting morale. BuzzFeed reported that Facebook had divided into three camps: people on Team Zuckerberg, people who believe the press is creating biased narratives, and a group that believes the scandals show that the company is on the brink of a meltdown. Incidentally, Glassdoor, a site where people can anonymously rank their employers, released a report this week that found Facebook was the No. 7 place to work of 2018, down from No. 1 last year. (Morale dip aside, that’s still a great overall ranking; I think people just love having Philz Coffee on campus.) ■ At least Facebook isn’t alone in hot water. Last Friday (because companies like to save their bad news for weekends) Marriott International revealed that hackers had breached its Starwood reservation system and had stolen the personal data of up to 500 million guests. The stolen data included names, addresses and encrypted credit card details of hotel customers. Hackers also stole travel histories and passport numbers of a smaller group of guests. It’s one of the bigger cybersecurity breaches in history. (Then again, the Facebook breach affecting 30 million accounts, announced last September, was nothing to sneeze at.) ■ Another company having a bad news week: Huawei. Meng Wanzhou, a top executive and daughter of the company founder, was arrested last week in Canada at the request of the United States, in a move that will certainly increase tensions between the two countries. Canada’s Justice Department said she was sought for extradition to the United States but did not give a reason. The United States government has long expressed concern about Huawei’s surveillance capabilities because of the company’s close ties to the Chinese government. • O.K., O.K., I’ll lighten things up. I wrote a column this week about how I tried to turn my food-obsessed dog, Max, into an Instagram celebrity — and failed. I tried everything: kissing up to influencers, getting professional consultations and even buying bots, but no dice. Here’s what I learned about the brutal space that is Instagram. • I love New York Times crossword puzzles, and I know many of you do, too. So it was a delight to hear from Sam Ezersky, an assistant editor of puzzles, about the tech tools uses to create the crosswords as well as how puzzle-solving has changed in the smartphone era. • This week there’s been some buzz around 5G, the fifth-generation wireless network from cellular carriers, meaning a faster cellular connection might be closer to reality. Both AT&T and Verizon Wireless announced they would support a yet-to-be-named 5G phone from Samsung next year. The 5G network will theoretically be so fast that people will be able to download movies in seconds. (I’ll believe it when I see it — I still struggle to get a good 4G LTE signal in San Francisco.)

2018,The Week in Tech: Hostages in the U.S.-China Tech Cold War,"Bits Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times review the week’s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here. Wise readers! I’m Raymond Zhong, a Times reporter in China — where, I contend, something is unfolding right now that carries higher stakes than any other tech story on the planet. I know, I’m biased. But hear me out. China detained another Canadian citizen this week, the third to have been snatched up in the country this month. Beijing denies it, but most people in China see the detentions as retaliation for Canada’s arrest of Meng Wanzhou, a top executive at the Chinese tech giant Huawei. The United States has accused Ms. Meng of fraud, and is seeking her extradition. She remains in Canada under round-the-clock surveillance. In other words, the United States and China’s contest for technological supremacy has now left four lives hanging in the balance — hostages to something much larger than themselves. To recap: Huawei is the world’s leading maker of telecom network equipment. You probably don’t ever think about this technology, but it powers our mobile age. Which is why the United States is so nervous that Huawei has become such a powerhouse supplier. Washington has warned for years, without specific evidence, that Huawei’s products can be used for spying by the Chinese government. Ms. Meng’s arrest this month was part of a yearslong effort to curb the company’s rise. It’s an unenviable position for any company to be in — not least one, like Huawei, that is privately owned and was long known for secretiveness. In an effort at openness, Huawei this week invited me and a bunch of other reporters to its campuses in southern China, where we toured some research facilities and chatted with Ken Hu, the company’s deputy chairman. Mr. Hu reiterated points that the company has made for years as it has come under scrutiny around the world. He said that Huawei had a clean record when it came to major cybersecurity incidents. He said that “ideological” or “geopolitical” fears had not cost Huawei the trust of its many customers. “Concerns about security should not be aimed without basis at any specific company,” Mr. Hu said. He issued a challenge to governments that raise concerns about Huawei’s products: “If you have evidence, then make it public.” He declined to discuss the detained Canadians or Ms. Meng’s arrest. In a way, Huawei is itself a hostage of larger conflicts. The company has built a globally respected brand. It has won customers by investing in research and development, providing attentive service — and driving its employees really, really hard. (I wrote this week about Huawei’s intense corporate culture.) Yet to the company’s fiercest critics, Huawei is tarnished simply by being Chinese, and hence within arm’s reach of a government that conducts aggressive espionage against American companies and government agencies. For some people in Washington, it hardly matters that Huawei isn’t state-owned, or that the Chinese government has never asked it to spy on its behalf. The mere possibility is enough. As part of this week’s visit to Huawei, we reporters were treated to a long presentation on the company’s processes for evaluating products for security risks. It was a barrage of details, earnestly presented, that I suspect would have zero chance of changing the mind of anyone in Washington about Huawei. Here’s what else caught my eye this week: ■ My colleagues at The Times have produced another blockbuster article full of revelations about how user data is collected and shared by giant tech companies. Here are five takeaways. ■ The Wall Street Journal took a look at Apple’s near-total failure to win over smartphone buyers in a giant, fast-growing market: India. The iPhone is clinging to market share there of around 1 percent, and the company’s revenue in India is half of what executives once hoped for, according to The Journal’s sources. The country simply doesn’t have enough people who are willing to pay Apple prices. ■ Well, it was fun while it lasted. TikTok, the quirky short video app that is now a worldwide hit, has a Nazi problem, according to Motherboard. The app’s Chinese parent company, Bytedance, is no stranger to controversies about gnarly content on its platforms. ■ Finally, I urge you to read this profile of Donald E. Knuth, the legendary computer scientist who, for the past 50 years, has been writing “The Art of Computer Programming” — a multivolume, still-unspooling bible of its field.

2018,The Week in Tech: Sundar Pichai Has a Chat With Congress,"Bits Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times review the week’s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Hello, dear readers. I’m Daisuke Wakabayashi, a reporter covering Google in our San Francisco bureau. This past week, however, I spent my time in the nation’s capital covering the congressional hearing for Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive. He faced questions about the company’s data-collection practices, about accusations of bias against conservatives in search results and about Google’s possible plans to provide a censored search engine for China. It was the first congressional hearing I had attended, and the spectacle was eye-opening. It underscored, to me, how Silicon Valley and Washington exist in their bubbles without really understanding each other. Lawmakers seemed like out-of-touch old people with little grasp of how technology works and where the real risks lie. Mr. Pichai came across as evasive and unwilling to acknowledge the legitimate concerns about Google’s business practices. At holiday parties and informal discussions in Washington, the conversation often turned to big tech and privacy. There seemed to be a growing wariness among lawmakers, regulators and aides about data collection and the unrelenting push by companies to gather more information about us. A New York Times investigation into the practices of the location-tracking industry came up repeatedly during the hearing and in conversations afterward. Even for people well versed in technology, the volume and specificity of location-data collection was shocking. While many expressed concern about the bigness of Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, there wasn’t a consensus on how to deal with them. A federal privacy law with real teeth seemed uncertain, and not many folks expected antitrust regulation even in the face of European action. All the while, tech companies continue to sell the message that they are job creators and engines of economic growth. At bus stops throughout Washington, one of the frequent revolving posters is for the “Grow With Google” campaign, a feel-good job and technology training program introduced by the company last year. It comes on the heels of Amazon’s very public beauty contest for HQ2 and, ultimately, HQ3. ■ Apple also made clear, in an announcement of plans to build a massive new office in Austin, Tex., that it, too, creates jobs outside Silicon Valley. Tech companies from the Valley have been opening big offices in other cities for decades, but they’re getting more aggressive about it as they pursue specialized engineering talent. ■ An argument often made against antitrust action is that the technology industry is dynamic, and that today’s dominant predator can become tomorrow’s prey. Nokia once dominated mobile phones but lost its standing to Samsung and Apple in the smartphone era. Similarly, Intel, once so overwhelming a force in the semiconductor industry that it was a frequent target of antitrust cases, is struggling to keep pace with a shifting industry. My colleague Cade Metz explained how Amazon is the latest tech company to start building its own chips, threatening Intel’s grip on the server chip market. ■ It’s rare for a bail hearing to make international news, but this was no ordinary arrest. Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of the tech behemoth Huawei and a daughter of the company’s founder, was arrested Dec. 1 at the airport in Vancouver, British Columbia, for extradition to the United States. The American and Canadian authorities claim Ms. Meng circumvented trade sanctions against Iran, using a Huawei subsidiary. The arrest of a prominent executive at one of China’s biggest tech companies, with close ties to the government, complicates the Trump administration’s negotiations to end a trade war with China. On Tuesday, a judge granted bail of 10 million Canadian dollars, or about $7.5 million. Ms. Meng agreed to 24-hour physical and electronic surveillance and a curfew. ■ China was at the center of another interesting tech industry news story. Qualcomm said a Chinese court had ordered Apple to stop selling older iPhones in China. The court, according to Qualcomm, said Apple had infringed on two Qualcomm patents and issued a preliminary injunction on seven older iPhone models. It’s another sign of the deteriorating relationship between the two companies. Apple sued Qualcomm last year, accusing it of monopolistic practices. Qualcomm has accused Apple of patent infringement, while carrying out a public-relations campaign against the iPhone maker.

2018,The Weekend Warriors of the Crown Province of Ostgardr (Otherwise Known as New York City),"Taking up swords, spears and battle-axes for an afternoon of killing friends. Just another gathering of a nationwide group devoted to recreating the Middle Ages. SPARTA TOWNSHIP, N.J. — The knights, squires and other armored combatants gathered near a snowy battlefield and prepared for a violent melee. “Are you ready to kill things in the snow?” yelled Queen Vienna de la Mer, who with her husband, King Wilhelm von Ostenbrücke, addressed the loyal subjects of the East Kingdom. The 170 fighters roared back, readied their armor and collected their swords, spears and battle-axes. They split into two armies for a clash that resembled a medieval battlefield in Europe, with a touch of surrealism worthy of “Game of Thrones.” In reality, it was a recent Saturday on a former Girl Scouts campground in northern New Jersey — a township called Sparta, of all places. The fighters were members of the Society for Creative Anachronism, a worldwide organization whose members share an affinity for pre-1600s life. During the week, they lead conventional modern lives — “mundane” in members’ jargon — as techies, teachers, police officers, medical professionals, lawyers and the like. But on weekends, they escape all that and come together to dress in period outfits and enjoy a recreated bygone world. Members take on a medieval name and identity as well as a position in courtly life. Along with a general love for the honor, chivalry and romance of days of old, many members develop specialties in medieval arts, cooking, culture and other disciplines. Then there are the fighters, who pursue knighthood and enjoy armored battle, such as this recent event called the 100 Minutes War, which was followed by a royal court presided over by the king and queen. King Wilhelm and Queen Vienna — a Connecticut couple whose real names are Jackie and Brian Van Ostenbridge — reign over the East Kingdom, which encompasses the Northeast and parts of Canada. It is one of the society’s 20 kingdoms in North America, each of which is subdivided into provinces, baronies and shires. There is the Crown Province of Ostgardr, which includes all five New York City boroughs and several surrounding counties, many of which also have their own medieval names. Manhattan is known as Whyt Whey, a reference to Broadway’s White Way. Brooklyn is Brokenbridge, a reference to the Brooklyn Bridge. Westchester County is known as Northpas, and Nassau County is Lions End. Southwest Connecticut is the Barony of Dragonship Haven, while the rest of the state is the Barony Beyond the Mountain. Ostgardr has about 200 members who pay annual dues and hundreds more who regularly attend events, said Piglet Evans, the province’s seneschal, or president. She makes her living as a computer programmer, but as Alienor Salton, an 11th-century Welsh woman, she helps run the Bardic Circle, a weekly singing gathering in Central Park. There is a fighting group that practices, often in full body armor, in McCarren Park in Brooklyn, led by Zorikh Lequidre, who is known as Lord Ervald the Optimistic. Practitioners of ancient archery gather on Staten Island for Sunday practices run by Gary Guarino, 45, whose persona is a 12th-century Mongolian warrior named Mungu Chinua. Eugena Pechenaya, 34, of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, said she first discovered the society 14 years ago after coming across a fighting practice in Union Square. “I found that there was a whole medieval alternative to the modern world, including the geography,” said Ms. Pechenaya, who now holds the title vicereine in Ostgardr and also attends events as a Mongolian archer named Lada Monguligin. “The mundane world falls away, and we create the Middle Ages.” The interest in medieval sword fighting is so widespread among members that “there’s a different place to practice every night in the New York area,” said Zach Karabin, 29, of Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, who works as a union glazier in Manhattan but on weekends dominates battlefields as Ozurr the Bootgiver, a fierce Viking warrior. Many fighters spend years striving to become knights through battlefield valor and acts of chivalry. Some compete to capture the crown, a position with a six-month tenure attained by winning a special armored combat tournament. While it is often a man fighting for his female “consort” to join him on the throne, women have also competed for the crown, as have same-sex couples. Mr. Karabin won a series of sword-and-shield fights recently to become the next ruler of the East Kingdom; his reign begins in April. For now, he is still the kingdom’s prince. And at the 100 Minutes War, he wore his princely crown, while the king and queen wore their gold-plated crowns, all of which are passed down within the society, which was founded by a group of history buffs and writers in Northern California in the mid-1960s. Within the group, “there’s a sense of community that is lacking in society today,” said Mr. Van Ostenbridge, who met his wife at a Twelfth Night celebration in Kingston, N.Y. Mr. Van Ostenbridge, an engineer for a technology firm and former Marine, said members shared a common background. “We were all nerds growing up,” he said. But they were also a diverse group. “We are black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Jewish, Buddhist, gay, transgender,” he said. “And we all beat the crap out of each other and then sit around the fire afterward and have a drink.” Much of the armor is realistic — traditional chain mail, leather padding and steel helmets with visors — supplemented with modern baseball and football padding, or homemade protection, concealed under medieval clothing. All the weapons are made with lightweight material and padded edges. So while the fighters laid into one another with gusto, injuries were relatively few, and “kills” were acknowledged based on the honor system between combatants. The team with the fewest deaths are the victors. “This is our modern Middle Ages,” said Hank Salvacion, 56, who was helping oversee other battle marshals inspecting weapons to make sure, for example, that the thrusting spears did not exceed nine feet in length. When he is not working as a medical assistant, Mr. Salvacion is often known as Tanaka Raiko, a 10th-century samurai with the Shire of Rusted Woodlands, a chapter of the society in northern New Jersey that was organizing the battle. The shire’s seneschal, Aaron Cohen, 39, helped coordinate event logistics even while keeping his cellphone stashed away in a period-correct leather pouch. Avoiding cellphone use, he said, helps keep the events “an escape from the everyday.” Finally, a marshal shouted, “Lay on!” and the two armies faced off at a skirmish line, where various melee units charged and retreated. “Allez!” yelled a coterie of knights visiting from the Barony of l’Ile du Dragon Dormant in Quebec. On the periphery, archers armed with crossbows shot arrows with foam tips at the enemy, and some fighters threw axes with padded blades. Numerous women fought among the men, including Andrea Glass, 29, a medieval historian known in the society as Beatrix Krieger. “I love history and I love fighting, so this is a good way to get your aggression out,” she said. “With the adrenaline of battle, every once in a while, the mundane world falls away and the veil gets thinned between the present and the past.”",The New York Times
2018,"The Weekly Standard, Pugnacious to the End, Will Cease Publication","The Weekly Standard, a primary voice of conservative Washington that found itself out of step with the Trumpward turn in the Republican Party, is ceasing publication after 23 years, its owners announced on Friday. The cause of death was financial, ideological or personal, depending on who was doing the telling. The magazine’s parent company, Clarity Media Group, cited a steep decline in subscriptions and revenues. But editorial leadership had clashed with ownership in some instances over its critical coverage of President Trump and the hard-right views of his defenders. The Standard’s editor in chief, Stephen F. Hayes, pronounced himself “profoundly disappointed” by the decision on Friday to cease publication. The editor of Commentary magazine, John Podhoretz, who was a co-founder of The Standard in 1995, described the closing as a “murder” and “an entirely hostile act” perpetrated by malevolent owners. Clarity Media, which is controlled by the billionaire conservative businessman Philip F. Anschutz, has devoted resources to The Washington Examiner, a publication that provides cozier coverage of the president. Talk of selling The Weekly Standard was floated, but the company decided against it. At an all-hands meeting on Friday, the chief executive of Clarity Media, Ryan McKibben, disputed reports that the shutdown was related to the tenor of Trump coverage, instead citing poor financial performance, according to an attendee who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share sensitive conversations. The attendee said it remained the overwhelming view of The Standard’s staff and leadership that Mr. Anschutz did not, in the end, want to own the leading Trump-skeptical publication in conservative media. The acrimonious end was perhaps in keeping with a publication that was proudly heterodox from the start, eager to buck the prevailing values of conservative dogma and forge its own provocative point of view. Started by Mr. Podhoretz and William Kristol, both scions of establishment conservative figures, The Weekly Standard offered an alternative to the National Review-led hegemony of right-wing publications. (The third founder, Fred Barnes, remains as executive editor; Rupert Murdoch initially provided financing.) It grew into the dominant organ of neoconservatism and a leading voice in favor of intervention in Iraq, helping to define politics in the George W. Bush era. Among its star alumni were Tucker Carlson, Matt Labash and David Brooks. Sold in 2009 to Mr. Anschutz, The Standard remained influential. But the Trump phenomenon posed a challenge. Originally denounced by Republican thought leaders like Mr. Kristol, who declared himself a supporter of the “Never Trump” movement, the president has since been embraced by his party — and by right-wing news outlets that are thriving with a diet of pro-Trump coverage. The Weekly Standard took a different tack. The editors supported Mr. Trump’s Supreme Court picks and tax overhaul. But the magazine’s free marketeers did not cheer trade tariffs, and its foreign interventionists lamented the president’s retreat from a central role in global leadership. Criticism of a so-called deep state, a staple of Breitbart News and Fox News commentators like Sean Hannity, did not dominate its pages. Talk of a shutdown had coursed through the magazine’s offices for days, and although a meeting with management had been scheduled for Friday, Mr. Hayes, the editor, emailed his staff beforehand to say he was still unsure of their fate. “Many media outlets have responded to the challenges of the moment by prioritizing affirmation over information, giving into the pull of polarization and the lure of clickbait,” Mr. Hayes wrote in a memo. “I’m proud that we’ve remained both conservative and independent.” Some of the magazine’s critics on Friday delighted in its demise. “TAKE THAT YOU NEVER TRUMPERS,” Chuck Woolery, the “Love Connection” host turned Trump acolyte, wrote in a Twitter post. Breitbart News knocked the magazine as “once-influential” and a “Never-Trump publication.” Clarity Media declined to comment beyond a formal written statement. “The Weekly Standard has been hampered by many of the same challenges that countless other magazines and newspapers across the country have been wrestling with,” Mr. McKibben, the chief executive, wrote in a news release. “After careful consideration of all possible options for its future, it became clear that this was the step we needed to take.” Some members of the magazine’s staff say they have heard that Mr. Kristol and Mr. Hayes are in touch with wealthy investors who could back a similar publication under a new banner. In the meantime, the final issue of The Weekly Standard is to be published on Monday. OpinionAdam Rubenstein",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The West at an Impasse,"How meritocracy and populism reinforce each other's faults. Opinion Columnist In France, where the extraordinarily unpopular Emmanuel Macron presides over a country roiled by populist protests, a leading politician of Macron’s centrist party was asked in a televised interview what policy mistakes his peers had made: “We were probably too intelligent, too subtle,” he told the interviewer, whose eyebrows danced with disbelief. Around the same time a Hungarian newspaper ran an interview with Radek Sikorski, the former foreign minister of Poland and a member of a centrist party that has been swept aside by the populists who currently rule in Warsaw. Asked to explain the chaotic European situation, he cited a recent Atlantic essay by his wife, the Washington Post columnist Anne Applebaum, which portrayed populism as, in part, a revolt by the resentfully unsuccessful against “meritocracy and competition.” The centrist alternative to populism, he suggested, was embodied by Macron, who won the French presidency on “positive ideas” rather than “what is worst in us.” “Macron’s poll numbers are breaking negative records,” the interviewer dryly noted. While I read both of these exchanges, my Kindle was open to “The Rise of the Meritocracy,” written in 1958 by the British civil servant Michael Young. The book coined the term in its title, and Young’s neologism was soon adopted as a compliment, a term of praise for a system of elite formation that relied on SAT tests and resumes and promised rule by the most intelligent rather than the well-bred. [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] But Young had something more dystopian in mind. His book, a work of fiction that purported to be a work of history and political analysis written in the middle of the 21st century, envisioned a world whose classes were increasingly segregated by talent and intelligence, in which the brainy, standardized-test-acing elite became an increasingly intolerable version of the old aristocracy, leading eventually to riots and populist revolutions in the then far-distant future of 2034. I went back to Young’s book because I’ve been writing recently (to some controversy) about the faults of our own meritocracy. What I found there was a prophecy that fit the contemporary Western political landscape remarkably well, even if the populist revolts have arrived a little early. The book’s fictional author is a pompous sociologist who believes absolutely in the meritocratic system, which has produced an elite “more brilliant” than any in the past. He also believes in its essential stability, because the nature of meritocracy itself ensures that the populists threatening revolt simply aren’t as smart or as capable as the new elite that rules them: Behind the shift and turn of current politics is the underlying fact with which I opened my essay. The last century has witnessed a far-reaching redistribution of ability between the classes in society, and the consequence is that the lower classes no longer have the power to make revolt effective. For a short moment they may prosper through an alliance with the odd and passing disillusion of a section of the upper classes. But such déclassé people can never be more than an eccentric minority — the Populists have never been more than that as a serious political force — because the élite is treated with all the wise distinction that any heart can desire. Without intelligence in their heads, the lower classes are never more menacing than a rabble, even if they are sometimes sullen, sometimes mercurial, not yet completely predictable. If the hopes of some earlier dissidents had been realized and the brilliant children from the lower classes remained there, to teach, to inspire, and to organize the masses, then I should have had a different story to tell. The few who now propose such a radical step are a hundred years too late. His point here, expressed with maximal elitism and arrogance, is that meritocracy essentially co-opts the talented people who in a different world would be leaders in their local communities, their regions, their social classes, pulling them all up into a national elite and weakening every rival power center in the process. Because Young is a satirist, this authorial pride gets its comeuppance: We learn in a postscript that the author of the book was killed in a populist riot, leaving his manuscript unfinished. But the book doesn’t tell us if the populists are able to prove its writer wrong by making their revolt “effective” — if they’re able to take power as well as instigate violence, and if they can actually govern once they’ve overthrown the pompous mandarins. The evidence of our own era suggests that they might not be so capable. It suggests, in fact, that when meritocracy loses credibility and legitimacy, the result is a political impasse. The official elite becomes too arrogant and self-deceiving and unpopular to govern effectively, but the populist alternative is much as Young’s narrator describes — disorganized, ill-led, susceptible to snake-oil salesmen and vulnerable to manipulation by factions within the upper class. In this situation, which is ours, the meritocrats have no mandate and no sense of why the public hates them — believing, with Sikorski and the Macron apparatchik, that their governance was wise and just and there’s nothing wrong with meritocracy that can’t be fixed with more of it. But the populists have no competence and no coherent program, and so all their revolt can win is stalemate. Different versions of this impasse exist in Britain, France and the United States. In the British version the forces of populism won a stunning victory in the Brexit referendum but lacked real leaders (save hacks and opportunists) and a clear plan for pushing forward (save implausible promises). The result is Theresa May’s shambolic attempt to deliver the impossible, a job she’s graced with because nobody else wants it — save Jeremy Corbyn, whose left-populism seems entirely unready for power in its own way. In France the “gilets jaunes” protests have brought populist fury from France’s peripheries into the heart of Paris and wrecked Macron’s centrist-technocratic plans. But as a political force the protest movement remains essentially inchoate, now pulled toward the far left and now toward the far right, awaiting leadership and vision. Which, judging by the equally dismal approval ratings of Macron’s rivals, is something that French politics is unlikely to supply. In the United States the populists theoretically hold the White House, under a president who promised to be a traitor to his class. Except that these promises were mostly just a con job, the Trump inner circle is a parliament of opportunists, and his administration’s policy agenda has been steered by the Republican Party’s business elite rather than by the voters who elected him. Each case is a variation on the same theme, a slightly different intimation of the meritocratic endgame that Michael Young foresaw 60 years ago. A governing class that has vaulting self-confidence and dwindling credibility, locked in stalemate with populist movements that are easily grifted upon and offer more grievances than plans. In theory the impasse can be overcome. That’s what statesmanship is for — to bridge gaps between complacent winners and angry losers, to weld populism’s motley grievances into a new agenda suited for the times, to manifest an elitism that is magnanimous instead of arrogant. But can the system we have really produce such a statesman? The next one we find will be the first.

2018,The Whalers Are Back in the N.H.L. Sort Of.,"The new owner of the Carolina Hurricanes is celebrating the franchise’s past. Hartford Whalers fans aren’t sure how to feel about that. HARTFORD — The Whalers have been gone from Connecticut’s capital city longer than they were in it, but for the first time in 21 years the team’s sweater will be worn in an N.H.L. game — when the Carolina Hurricanes host the Boston Bruins on Sunday. The Hurricanes’ new owner, Tom Dundon, has been embracing the franchise’s heritage since last January, when he purchased controlling interest from Peter Karmanos, who had moved the team to North Carolina from Hartford in 1997. Almost immediately, the Hurricanes began selling Whalers gear at PNC Arena in Raleigh. In September, Dundon announced the team would celebrate a Whalers Night, which will happen Sunday, and would also wear Hartford sweaters on March 5 in Boston, 100 miles from the team’s old home. In and around Hartford, there have been conflicted reactions to the rapprochement. Resentment lingers from the team’s move, and some people believe the new interest in the Whalers is tied to an opportunity for Carolina to sell merchandise. “The jersey belongs to Hartford and the hockey fans in Hartford,” said Joseph Bajorski, 52, a real estate broker in Berlin, Conn., and a member of the Hartford Whalers Booster Club. “That jersey is Hartford,” he added. Much of Connecticut is united by an enduring affection for the team, which won only one playoff series (1986) and one division title (1987) in its 18 seasons in Hartford. (Five years after leaving Connecticut, the franchise reached the Stanley Cup finals; in 2006, the Hurricanes won the Cup.) “Brass Bonanza,” which played after every Whalers goal, blares when the University of Connecticut men’s hockey team scores at what is now called the XL Center, where the Whalers’ 1986-87 Adams Division title banner still hangs, along with the franchise’s retired numbers. After a local radio station, WDRC-FM, was sold in 2014, the new owners rebranded it as 102.9 The Whale, adopting a whale logo and the team's blue and green colors. The Rangers’ American Hockey League affiliate in Hartford was called the Connecticut Whale for a few years this decade. The name now belongs to the National Women's Hockey League team in Stamford. The Colorado Rockies’ Class AA baseball franchise moved from New Britain, Conn., to Hartford for the 2016 season, took the name the Yard Goats and selected Whalers colors. During the last two seasons, the baseball team has held a three-day Whalers Alumni Weekend, with former players returning and the Yard Goats wearing hockey-style uniforms, featuring its mascot chomping on a hockey stick instead of on a baseball bat. “Considering how the team was ripped out of the community, it only makes sense to pay homage to them,” said Tim Restall, the Yard Goats president. In January, the state began offering commemorative Whalers license plates, with a portion of the fee going to the Connecticut Children’s Medical Center. Most recently, the new Hartford franchise of the United Soccer League announced that when it begins play in the spring, its colors will be green and blue. “That was probably the easiest decision we had,” said Bruce Mandell, the team’s chief executive. “These are really Hartford’s colors now.” Much of the Whalers’ residual good will stems from their extensive community involvement. John Forslund, who joined the franchise in 1991 as its public relations director and has been its television voice since 1995, called the Whalers “a model for the rest of the N.H.L. with the extent of their community relations. The players back then really dug into the community.” Ray Ferraro played the first six-plus years of his 18-year N.H.L. career in Hartford. “I really liked living there,” said Ferraro, now an N.H.L. analyst for Canada’s TSN. “The insurance industry was still big, downtown was vibrant, the restaurants were packed. Plus, a lot of the players were in the same stage of our lives, in our early 20s. I liked everything about Hartford.” Bob Crawford played in Hartford for only three of his seven N.H.L. seasons, beginning in 1983, but he is among a dozen or so former Whalers who still live in the area. “You could be somebody in Hartford; people knew who you were,” said Crawford, the owner of the Champions Skating Center in Cromwell and other rinks in Connecticut. “Hartford was big enough to be a world-class city but small enough so you could make a difference if you wanted to.” The Hurricanes will auction off game-worn jerseys from Sunday’s Whalers Night, and some of the proceeds will go to Crawford’s skating center. Richard Gordon, a Hartford businessman who became the controlling owner of the team in 1992 before selling it to Karmanos, remembered the civic pride the Whalers generated. “Everyone had a vested interest in the team, kind of like how people in Green Bay feel about the Packers,” Gordon said. “Sometimes you don’t realize what you have until it’s gone.” The New England Whalers began play in the World Hockey Association in 1972 and joined the N.H.L. with three other former W.H.A. teams in 1979, moving into Hartford’s 4-year-old Civic Center for Gordie Howe’s final N.H.L. season. Beginning in 1986, the team made the playoffs for seven straight years with players like Ron Francis, Kevin Dineen, Ulf Samuelsson and goalie Mike Liut. “I felt we were on the verge of something good in Hartford,” Ferraro said. But a series of bad trades beginning in 1991 stripped the team of its most popular players, including Francis. At the same time Hartford’s corporate base was contracting and interest in the UConn men’s and women’s basketball teams was rising. Soaring N.H.L. salaries exacerbated the team’s disadvantageous lease, and negotiations with the state, also in financial straits, for a new arena failed. “The writing was on the wall,” said Bajorski, who listened to the Whalers on the radio growing up and was a season-ticket holder during the team’s last years in Hartford. Karmanos announced on March 26, 1997, that he was moving the franchise at the end of its fifth straight losing season. The Whalers played their last game in Hartford 18 days later. “It was heartbreaking,” said Brad Height, 38, who grew up a Whalers fan and now manages Higganum Wine & Spirits, where a Whalers flag flies outside. “I didn’t want to believe it even after the last game. It was sort of like losing a member of the family.” On Sunday, the Whalers’ mascot, Pucky the Whale, will be at the game in Raleigh, and “Brass Bonanza” will be the Hurricanes’ goal song. Carolina will be in the vintage green uniforms the Whalers wore from 1985 to ’89 and again in the 1990-91 season. Despite tweaks to the logo over the years and the introduction of blue as the team’s primary color in 1992, the upside-down whale tail atop a “W,” with the letter “H” hiding in the negative space in between, remains beloved by many. “Outside of the Original Six, it’s the best hockey logo that’s ever been designed,” Ferraro said. Whether or not a Whalers Night becomes an annual event in Carolina, the team’s grip on its former home most likely will not fade. “When you say ‘Hartford Whalers,’ people smile,” Crawford said. “And that’s not going to change.”",The New York Times

2018,"The Wildfire May Be Over, but Those It Burned ‘Live That Nightmare Every Day’","LOS MOLINOS, Calif. — Bill Blevins had pulled himself out of homelessness and addiction with a job as an alarm systems repairman, dexterous work with tiny electrical components that he enjoyed. But last week he was forced to confront a new hurdle: His left pinkie finger was amputated. It was his third surgery since his hands were ravaged by the wildfire that devastated the town of Paradise, Calif., last month. And now he’s not sure if he will be able to work again. Those who were burned but survived are only beginning to deal with the consequences of the wildfire, which killed 85 people with 10 still unaccounted for, according to the Butte County sheriff, and consumed more than 18,000 structures. For the people burned in the Camp Fire, the battle is far from over; many are still hospitalized, facing yearslong journeys of surgeries and rehabilitation. “Long after people forget that the fire ever happened, across the U.S., there are still people here that live that nightmare every day,” said Mr. Blevins’s fiancée, Mary Sykes, as she held a cup of water to his lips as he lay inside their trailer home. “Our lives will never be the same again. Every time he looks at his hands he will be back in that fire.” The number of people burned by wildfires is not tracked, according to the American Burn Association, but hospitals in areas prone to fire are girding for future influxes of such patients as wildfires occur more frequently. “We are worried about the increase in fires that we get; it seems like they come fast and furious,” said Dr. David Greenhalgh, who leads the burn division of University of California, Davis, where the Camp Fire victims are being treated. “In terms of taking care of a massive burn, it’s not only the initial care, it’s the weeks and months of skin grafts and dealing with sepsis.” To deal with the possibility of a large increase in fire burn patients, U.C. Davis has formed a consortium with 25 hospitals across eight Western states, Dr. Greenhalgh said, with procedures in place and medevac helicopters on standby to transfer patients to those burn centers around the region. The hospital has also added another burn specialist to its team this year, for a total of five. “We are ready for that surge,” he said. On Nov. 8, Mr. Blevins was staying with a friend in Paradise when the fire started. He initially tried to flee, but turned back when his car caught on fire. They managed to survive by keeping the fire at bay with garden hoses; in the adrenaline of the firefight, Mr. Blevins did not realize he had been burned until he looked down and saw the skin “was melting off my hands,” he said. Rescuers flew him to U.C. Davis for treatment. At least 11 people were hospitalized with burns from the Camp Fire, which raged across 150,000 acres. Three are still hospitalized; two are considered to be in fair condition, and one is critical. “Our burn center team’s biggest regret is that they didn’t get the chance to treat more patients,” said Karen Finney, a spokeswoman. “The death toll is heartbreaking.” Burn care is an intricate and multistep process. Doctors must not only heal the wounds with skin grafts and surgeries, but also keep the body in balance as it recovers. From the moment burn victims arrive at the hospital, they are hooked up to intravenous fluids. That is because the immune system responds to charred skin as a foreign invader — “like it’s a splinter,” Dr. Greenhalgh said. The surge of inflammation puts the rest of the body at risk of dehydration, in a sense, from the inside out. Skin from Mr. Blevins’s hip was grafted onto his hands. For some with large burns, artificial or donor skin, which the hospital keeps frozen in a bank, must be used as a temporary patch until the body can grow enough skin of its own for the graft. Throughout recovery, patients are frequently connected to feeding tubes because their metabolism kicks into high gear: Even lying in hospital beds, patients burn calories about 1.5 times as fast, according to Dr. Greenhalgh, as the body goes into overdrive trying to repair itself. Mr. Blevins was released on Nov. 15, but returned Nov. 29 after infection set in, forcing amputation. Stroking Mr. Blevins’s hair as he lay on the bed in their home, his swaddled hands propped on pillows, Ms. Sykes described how he had saved her from a life of methamphetamine addiction, bringing her from Yakima, Wash., to California about five years ago for a cleaner life. Both are recovering addicts, replacing drugs with the joy of motorcycling side by side. Now they fear that the narcotics Mr. Blevins has been prescribed for pain could send them spiraling. “The last thing I want to do is come in as a burn patient, and leave as a heroin addict,” Mr. Blevins said. Mr. Blevins’s jobs as an alarm technician and a home health care provider took the couple from living in a car in 2014, to the little creeper-covered home they share with five cats and three dogs in Los Molinos, about 45 minutes’ drive northwest from Paradise. They now fear they will lose it. Unlike residents of the fire site, they are ineligible for much of the federal and state aid pouring into the area, because their house did not burn down. Then there are the nightmares. Days revolve around mitigating Mr. Blevins’s anxiety — a scented candle his fiancée lit set off a panic attack, he said — and his twice-daily bandage changes. It is a painstaking process that takes nearly three hours as Ms. Sykes cuts away gauze, removes dead tissue and rebandages each finger. A few days before his amputation surgery, Mr. Blevins said that in some ways, he felt blessed. News reports of his condition led to a reunion with estranged family members, he said, and his bond with Ms. Sykes has deepened. Others, he knows, have lost far more. “I pray to God that the families that have lost will heal,” Mr. Blevins said. “The same way I have got to heal physically, they have to heal emotionally.”",The New York Times
2018,The Wine Thief,"Nicolas DeMeyer was a scammer. Or a hero for the age of inequality. Or a young man haunted by the death of a dear friend. Or all of these things. Nicolas DeMeyer was a man centrally concerned with his image who always seemed to be hiding something. He had no Facebook, Instagram or Twitter account. Close friends can barely recall what he did for a living between 1999, when he graduated from Vassar College, and 2008, when he became the personal assistant to David Solomon, now the C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs. There were evasions and white lies — in college, Mr. DeMeyer said he was the son of German nobility — but for the most part, Mr. DeMeyer’s flights of fancy seemed relatively harmless. Then, in January 2018, after 14 months of traveling the world, he was arrested by federal agents at Los Angeles International Airport before he could even collect his luggage. His crime? Looting $1.2 million of wine from the cellar of Mr. Solomon’s home in East Hampton. Nine months later, Mr. DeMeyer was in New York for a scheduled court appearance, and was expected to plead guilty. Instead, he jumped to his death from the 33rd floor of the Carlyle Hotel. Had he robbed a random 0.1 percenter, it would have been easy simply to take the word of people who knew Mr. DeMeyer and described him as a modern-day Tom Ripley, just another grifter undeserving of empathy. But Goldman Sachs is a flash point in the rise of economic inequality — and Mr. DeMeyer lifted more than 500 bottles of Mr. Solomon’s wine without anyone noticing. So perhaps there was a certain inevitability to the recasting of Mr. DeMeyer as Butch Cassidy in Hermès sneakers. His long con made Mr. DeMeyer’s tale something of a parable of our age, a dark fantasy for millions of people who serve the plutocrat class and dream of getting even. “You never knew the truth of things with Nick. The appearance of things was very important to him,” said Andrew Fitzpatrick, who went to high school with Mr. DeMeyer in Findlay, Ohio (population estimate: 40,000), and for a little more than a year was his best friend. Back then, Mr. DeMeyer was Nickolas Meyer. His parents were divorced and he was mostly raised by his mother, Jane Rettig, the owner of a local self-storage business. According to friends, he got through geometry by obtaining an advance copy of the final exam from an upperclassman, and he won an award for his French mostly by charming his teacher. Mr. Fitzpatrick said that Mr. DeMeyer drove a white Mustang to school, shopped for clothes at Benetton and The Limited, and had a girlfriend named Pamela, who was “the right girl to date — trendy, popular and doing the ‘Clueless’ look before the movie came out. She had gorgeous red hair and drove a convertible. We would leave school during lunch, and drive around in her car singing Abba and talking about how we had to get out of this town.” In a rare photo from Findlay High School’s 1995 yearbook, Mr. DeMeyer looked Kennedy-esque in a dark ribbed sweater and a white button-down, a backpack hanging from a shoulder. Mr. Fitzpatrick is now known as the drag performer Mona Mour. In 1995, he was out; Mr. DeMeyer was not. After school, the boys rehearsed for class productions of “Bye Bye Birdie” and “The King and I.” On weekends, they slept over at Mr. DeMeyer’s house, sneaked out in the Mustang and picked up Pamela, bound for Bretz, a gay dance club in Toledo. Things ended poorly for the trio, Mr. Fitzpatrick said: “One day, I was in the cafeteria, and Nick walked up to me and said ‘You have to decide: Are you my friend or Pamela’s?’ I said ‘Well, Pamela never asked me anything like that, so I guess her.’ But I never understood how he could just cut me out of his life in an instant like I didn’t matter.” Vassar College, once known as the alma mater of Jacqueline Onassis and Meryl Streep, was, by the time Mr. Meyer arrived in 1995, a haven for worldly artistic kids who were too urban for Kenyon and Oberlin but didn’t have the grades or scores for Brown or Yale. What students at Vassar lacked in drive, they made up for in black eyeliner. On campus, in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., Mr. DeMeyer drove a black BMW, carried his books in a black Louis Vuitton knapsack and kept a stuffed animal in his dorm room named Aloysius, after the one in “Brideshead Revisited.” He also started dating guys. He dropped the k from Nickolas and changed his last name to Von Meyer. Eventually, he settled on DeMeyer. “I can’t say I was friends with Nick, but you couldn’t help but notice him on campus,” said Carl Cade, who graduated in 2000. “I even bought the German nobility act, despite that I looked him up in the Vassar directory and wondered how the hell a German noble was from Findlay, Ohio. It didn’t really stand out because there were so many of us who were scholarship kids pretending to be posh and there were so many of us who were rich kids pretending to be street. Vassar was a grifter’s dream. I remember he once announced that he was getting rid of a Gucci camel coat and whoever came over first would get it free.” Ray Windsor, another classmate, doesn’t buy the idea that Mr. DeMeyer was a Mr. Ripley in waiting. “He was well dressed for no other reason than that he liked being an aesthete,” he said. “He was an art history major!” But Mr. Windsor does recall that there were gaps in Mr. DeMeyer’s story. The first several years they were friends, Mr. Windsor was under the impression Mr. DeMeyer’s father worked in real estate and lived in Germany, possibly in a castle. Mr. DeMeyer’s mother ultimately told Mr. Windsor that the story was untrue. “She told me he just was a regular old dad in Ohio and asked me to please not say anything because Nicolas was going to tell me himself,” Mr. Windsor said. “And then Nicolas did, about six months later.” There was never really any question Mr. DeMeyer would come to New York after college. It was less clear what he planned to do there. Mr. Windsor recalls hearing about an internship at The New Republic, some time spent working at an art gallery. The two hung out together at gay bars like the Cock, Boiler Room and Phoenix. “I think he was always kind of supported by his family,” Mr. Windsor said. Then Mr. DeMeyer moved to Rome for a graduate degree. By the time Mr. Windsor visited him in 2005, Mr. DeMeyer was fluent in Italian. He also had a new boyfriend, Sandro Ribeiro, a handsome Brazilian. They lived in a small stylish apartment in Trastevere. The couple moved back to New York in 2007 and took an apartment in the Meurice, a prewar building on West 58th Street. There, they entertained debutantes, gay men and night life characters. Mr. DeMeyer liked that he was finally living in a building with a name. But there was no way — in a city teeming with lawyers, art dealers and bankers — for a man without a professional reputation to become a world-class saloniste. Plans to start a jewelry business and an interior design firm never fully took off. Practically the most distinguished guest Mr. DeMeyer poured drinks for was Amanda Lepore, the transgender night life diva — and she arrived with Mr. Windsor, who was then a party promoter. So in 2008, Mr. DeMeyer got with the times and pledged fealty to one of the city’s financial barons. At the time, David Solomon led Goldman Sachs’s investment banking division and he thrived in part by playing somewhat a bit against type. He wore athleisure to the pitch for the Lululemon Athletica initial public offering and D.J.ed at bottle service nightclubs. After Mr. DeMeyer went to work for Mr. Solomon and his wife as the couple’s personal assistant, he and Mr. Ribeiro often stayed at the Solomons’ Hamptons home. Mr. DeMeyer seemed to know a lot about art, furniture and movies. “He would show us trailers for obscure foreign gay films,” said Ash Blount, who became a friend around 2009. “For someone who I assumed was just another trust fund baby, he actually had a lot of depth.” But his snob side did come out. Once Mr. Blount, who lived in Brooklyn, arrived at Mr. DeMeyer’s with a shoulder bag. “He cracked this joke like, ‘That’s one of the great things about living in Manhattan. I never need to pack a bag.” Another time, Mr. Blount once arrived with a cheap bottle of wine. “He put it away, opened something better and said, ‘We just got back from Rome,’” said Mr. Blount, who now wonders whether the wine was stolen. The two fell out in 2010 or so. “I would call and say ‘I’m in your neighborhood.’ He would say ‘I’m in Rome,’” Mr. Blount said. “That’s how we lost touch.” Mr. Windsor’s relationship with Mr. DeMeyer was severed by one boozy night in 2012. “There was an incident that was half my fault and half his,” Mr. Windsor said. One constant presence in Mr. DeMeyer’s life was Ali Can Ertug, a well-dressed Turkish classmate from Vassar who went on to help both Christie’s and Sotheby’s open their Istanbul offices. Mr. Ertug, who was briefly Mr. DeMeyer’s boyfriend, also served as a mentor to him, a conduit to the good life and a representation of everything Mr. DeMeyer was hoping to become. At Sotheby’s, a number of colleagues were put off by a status anxiety they said bordered on obsession, but that also served Mr. Ertug well in his work. “Ali Can seems great,” Mr. DeMeyer wrote in an email in 2009. “As fun and silly as ever.” The next year, Mr. Ertug died by suicide, jumping from the window of his Central Park West apartment. According to people who knew him at work, before this event he’d become fixated on an oligarch who’d lost interest in him. Following Mr. Ertug’s death, Mr. DeMeyer joined Mr. Blount, Mr. Windsor and a couple other Vassar graduates in Central Park’s Sheep Meadow, where they drank wine, looked up at Mr. Ertug’s apartment and told stories about their friend. Mr. Windsor was shocked. He found it hard to reconcile the death with Mr. Ertug’s nature and with his status as the most successful member of their group, he said. But there was also, Mr. Blount thought, a manic quality that suffused Mr. Ertug’s life. When Mr. DeMeyer died in a similar fashion eight years later, the parallels were hard to ignore. Wine theft became Mr. DeMeyer’s primary source of income in January 2014, according to prosecutors’ court filings. Over the next two years, they said, he stole more than 500 bottles from Mr. Solomon without even arousing suspicion. Most bottles were sold to a wine distributor in North Carolina named Ryan Chaland, who runs the wholesaler Wine Liquidators. In October 2016, Mr. Solomon bought seven bottles of Domaine de la Romanée-Conti. Soon after, they were sold by Mr. Chaland to the Napa Valley dealer Patrick Albright. Mr. Albright was pleased to get his hands on such exceptional stock but found it strange that the bottles had wound up with a dealer like Mr. Chaland. “They really aren’t wines that would typically go to a liquidator,” he said. Worried that they might be counterfeits, Mr. Albright put out calls to colleagues, who discovered from the serial numbers that they were real but stolen. Mr. Solomon initially had no idea the wine was even missing, until he heard from his dealer asking if he knew the bottles had been sold. He did not. He also did not suspect Mr. DeMeyer, who calmly led East Hampton detectives around Mr. Solomon’s wine cellar on Nov. 7, 2016. But the next day Mr. DeMeyer was back in New York, and his demeanor changed. According to prosecutors, Mr. DeMeyer arranged to meet Mr. Solomon and his wife, Mary (they later separated), at Locanda Verde, where the Solomons were having dinner at an outdoor table on an unusually warm election night. While returns came in from Florida, showing Donald Trump was likely to win there, Mr. DeMeyer confessed to stealing the seven bottles. He promised to pay the Solomons back and made a plan to meet Mary in the morning at his bank. Then he left the restaurant, headed to Kennedy Airport, and used his American Express card to purchase a $5,300 plane ticket to Rome. A week later, prosecutors said, he called Mary and again confessed to stealing from her. He said he left for his “home in Italy” because he was scared of being arrested and couldn’t bear the idea of going to prison. A criminal investigation was already underway. The Solomons’ insurance company was involved. Mary told him the decision to press charges wasn’t up to her. Mr. DeMeyer did not have a home in Italy. He did have a pair of $17,500 checks from Wine Liquidators that he left with his mother. Over the next year, she slowly deposited money into his bank account. Mr. DeMeyer spent November and December in Rome and Capri. In January 2017 he traveled to Marrakesh for a friend’s birthday party. In February, he went to Rio and Buenos Aires, then back to Rio. The relationship between Mr. DeMeyer and his longtime partner Mr. Ribeiro busted up, and Mr. DeMeyer started seeing someone new. The new couple spent part of that summer together in Zurich. Around that time, investigators discovered $153,000 in checks and wire transfers from Wine Liquidators to Mr. Ribeiro’s J.P. Morgan account from 2014 to 2016. Hundreds of other bottles had been stolen. It wasn’t until September that Mr. DeMeyer was indicted — on one charge of interstate transportation of stolen property. Four months later, he nonchalantly returned to the United States and was arrested — likely a surprise to him, as his indictment had been sealed. According to Sabrina Shroff, the lawyer who took his case, he was in Los Angeles to meet someone about a job prospect. At his bail hearing — which took place after weeks of bouncing between jails — she pointed out that he’d traveled the world under his own name. “At any point, they could’ve put a flag on him, put up a request for a warrant, put up an Interpol warning, arrested him and brought him here. They seemed to have done no such thing, and I’m kind of confused as to why,” Ms. Shroff said. “All of his travel was transparent and open and clear.” The judge set his bail at $200,000 and took away his passport. He was given an electronic ankle bracelet and, after his mother eventually put up the bail, shipped back to Ohio while he awaited trial. He was not happy to be back in the hometown he had spent his life running away from. Conor Corcoran, a Vassar classmate, was one of many who said he was unsurprised that Mr. DeMeyer had turned to white-collar crime. “The character of a man who lifts a million dollars’ worth of hooch was on display in Poughkeepsie 20 years ago,” he said, calling Mr. DeMeyer a “socially carnivorous” “talented Mr. Ripley type” who “was always peddling a patently false image of himself.” “He was not a mean guy,” Mr. Corcoran said, “but there was a beady quality to him. Something was off.” Mr. Fitzpatrick, who Mr. DeMeyer mistreated all those years before, mostly agreed. But he also felt a hint of admiration for Mr. DeMeyer’s chutzpah. “Before he died, everyone I know was like, ‘Go girl, get the money,’” Mr. Fitzpatrick said. “There was a part of me that was cheering him on and rooting for him. This guy from Goldman Sachs was so rich, he never even noticed any of the wine was missing. Had Nick not stolen seven really rare bottles, he could still be doing this and the guy would have no idea.” On Oct. 9, Mr. DeMeyer was in New York for his hearing, staying at the Carlyle. According to The New York Post, Mr. DeMeyer had been exchanging text messages with his sister — they were worrisome enough that she called his hotel. Security guards were sent to Mr. DeMeyer’s room and reportedly saw him naked outside the window. They exchanged glances. Mr. DeMeyer smiled and jumped. Suicide is contagious, but there’s no way to know how much Mr. Ertug’s death operated as permission. Mr. DeMeyer’s death seemed senseless to his friends. “He would have done a year or two and people would have embraced him because the whole city operates on avaricious class aspirational indentured servitude,” Mr. Corcoran said. “Somebody would have taken him in.” Mr. Windsor, drawing a comparison to the jail time served by Martha Stewart, said: “It could have been not the end but the beginning of something far greater.” There was also the way Mr. DeMeyer reportedly made guards witness his death. That really bothered Mr. Corcoran, who saw it as yet another act of disassociation and self-absorption, a thing for others to “carry” with them for the rest of their lives. Back in college, Mr. DeMeyer and Mr. Windsor had read Andrew Holleran’s “Dancer From the Dance,” a novel about gay life in the 1970s that ends with the protagonist killing himself to avoid old age and icy stares. Mr. Windsor memorialized Mr. DeMeyer on Facebook last month with a quotation from the book: “Dreams are all equipped with revolving doors. Someone is always walking into the one you are leaving.” He added some words of his own: “Anyone who walked in to Nicolas’s life felt like they were in a dream. He was so exceedingly charming and elusive.” An earlier version of this article misstated the year Carl Cade graduated from Vassar. It was 2000, not 1996.",The New York Times
2018,"The Woman Who Outruns the Men, 200 Miles at a Time","CreditCredit Courtney Dauwalter specializes in extremely long races. But her success in winning them has opened a debate about how men’s innate strength advantages apply to endurance sports. HOMEWOOD, Calif. — At 1:40 in the morning, running through the woods near Lake Tahoe, Courtney Dauwalter began hallucinating. She saw live puppets playing on a swing set on the side of the trail. Trees and rocks turned into faces. She was on her second night without sleep, 165 miles into a 205-mile race through the mountains, pushing her body to levels considered physically impossible not long ago, and seeing very strange things in the night. Dauwalter had been on her feet for almost 40 hours and was leading the field of 215 runners as she set her sights on a course record for September’s Tahoe 200, one in a series of very, very long ultramarathons, the latest craze among distance running’s lunatic set. Their hero is Dauwalter, a 33-year-old with a reputation for outrunning men and shattering course records. She has won 11 ultramarathons and finished second in seven other endurance races. This weekend, she will try to break the women’s world record for the most miles run in 24 hours, at the Desert Solstice competition in Phoenix. She will have to run more than 161.55 miles to do so. She already holds the American women’s record, 159.32 miles. This fall, she ran 279.2 miles in what’s known as Big’s Backyard Ultra, a grueling race of attrition during which runners have to complete a 4.16667-mile loop each hour. If they want to put their feet up, eat, go to the bathroom or close their eyes for a few minutes, they have to earn the time by running faster. The last person standing wins. By the third night of that race, only Dauwalter and Johan Steene remained. After going mile for mile with Steene for 67 hours, Dauwalter conceded. At that point, she and Steene had run 33 miles farther in the race than anyone had before. “The race is set up perfectly to test your limits,” said Dauwalter, a former science teacher from Golden, Colo., who wants to achieve 300 miles at Big’s Backyard Ultra next year. “You just go until you reach your own finish line.” Where exactly that is is anyone’s guess. For now, elite ultrarunning is one of the few sports in which women appear able to hold their own with men. Dauwalter’s prowess has crystallized the debate about whether psychological fortitude can trump men’s innate strength advantages in endurance sports. This much is clear: As the distance lengthens, the biological advantages that men have grow smaller. In 2017, Dauwalter won the inaugural Moab 240, a 238-mile race that zigzags along the Colorado River. She completed the route in a little less than 58 hours and beat the next competitor, a man, by 10 hours, or 20 miles. She said a one-minute nap on the side of the trail the second night of the race revived her and pushed her to the finish. “We know that men are simply bigger and have more muscle mass and are more powerful and faster,” said Heather Heying, an evolutionary biologist. But, she added, “This is about stamina, and stamina is some combination of yes, strength, but also psychological will. It begs the question, is there something going on for women perhaps given our very long evolutionary history as mammals who spent a long time gestating and then giving birth, that gives us a psychological edge in extremely long-term endurance events?” To the surprise of many in the ultrarunning world, these ridiculously long races are growing in popularity. In 2014, the ultrarunner Candice Burt created the Tahoe 200, the race in which Dauwalter saw the puppets on the swing set. It was the first 200-mile-plus single-loop ultramarathon in the United States. Ninety-one people signed up. The next year, she started the Bigfoot 200, a 206-mile race that traverses the Cascade Mountains in Washington State. In 2017, she added the Moab 240, the race in which Dauwalter obliterated the competition. This year, more than 600 people ran one of the three ultraraces Burt organized. A faction of ultrarunning has argued that these events are not really a “race.” They say that the 100-plus-hour cutoffs allow less competitive runners time for sleep, and more time is spent hiking than running. Dr. Martin Hoffman, a former researcher for the Western States 100-mile race, said one reason Dauwalter was so successful was there were still so few people competing at 200 miles. According to Ultrarunning magazine, more than 100,000 people worldwide completed a race longer than a marathon (26.2 miles) in 2017. “If you have the best trained male and female ultrarunners competing against each other, the men will always win,” said Hoffman, who ran his first 100-mile race in 1984. He has spent decades researching ultrarunning, but his work does not cover anything longer than 100 miles. Heying, the evolutionary biologist, agrees that there is still not enough data to draw conclusions on 200-mile races, but she believes variables like weather, mental strength and innate tolerance for pain help level the field. Dick Dauwalter, Courtney’s father, who was part of her crew during the Tahoe 200, said she had always been a competitor. The “tiny little squirt” finished eighth in her home state, Minnesota, in cross-country when she was in seventh grade. During the winter, she would get up when it was still dark to Nordic ski before school, which helped turn her into a state champion in cross-country skiing in high school and earned her a scholarship to the University of Denver. “We did not have a lot money, and it was a lot of work getting the kids to their sports,” Dick Dauwalter said. He makes false teeth and jokes that he's not the athletic one in the family. “The deal was if Courtney or her brothers signed up for something, they had to finish the season even if they did not like the sport.” A lanky, ponytailed blonde who wears baggy shorts and shirts when she runs, Dauwalter laughs easily and has a friendly demeanor. At Mile 140 of the Tahoe 200, she stopped to give high-fives, sign autographs and talk with girls who had gathered at an aid station to cheer her on. Sometimes during races, she tells jokes to make sure her mind is still working. She believes that as her threshold for pain increases, so does her ability to run farther. “I put myself in situations where suffering is going to be involved and hope to be able to tap into the mental piece every time that physical pain becomes too much,” she said. Overwhelmed by pain, she dropped out of her first 100-mile race in 2012. She tried again the next year and finished. When Dauwalter reached the aid station at Mile 167 of the Tahoe 200, she thanked the volunteers for being up in the middle of the night in freezing temperatures to feed her. She doesn’t keep track of her time when she races, so she asked the group what time it was to figure out how long she had been on her feet. Even in the dark, fatigue showed on her sunburned face. Her blue eyes were bloodshot from sleeplessness and the dust clouds that kicked up on the trail. For most of the race, she struggled to hold down solid food and used rewetting drops to fight off swelling corneas, a condition that caused her to go blind in a previous race. The aid stations, often simple tents set up between trail heads in the woods, came roughly every 20 miles. They offered burgers, cheese quesadillas, pancakes, pickles, coffee and blankets. Dauwalter did not remove her shoes or change her clothes the entire race, but she did brush her teeth with a tiny toothbrush. She filled her water bottles, packed a half-eaten cheese quesadilla in a plastic baggie, and then headed into the night with her pace runner. Pacers and the runner’s crew play a critical role in these long races. Dauwalter had three pacers in the Tahoe 200, including her husband, Kevin Schmidt, who organizes logistics for her races and eventually ran with her the last 30 miles in Tahoe. Ultrarunners often wear heart rate monitors, stay on strict training schedules and adhere to specific diets. Dauwalter runs about 100 miles a week, but does not follow a plan or a specific training schedule. She said she let her body tell her what it needed and felt like doing each day. She eats whatever she wants. The night before the Tahoe 200, she ate candy corn and pizza. After the race, she ate nachos loaded with cheese and barbecue chicken and drank a lot of beer. At Big’s Backyard Ultra, she ate Honey Stinger Waffles, cheese quesadillas, pierogies and pancakes the first thirty hours of the race, and then opted for McDonald’s double cheeseburgers with extra pickles. In addition to dehydration, extreme fatigue and hyperthermia, Dauwalter and the other runners who take on these multiday races face encounters with bears, mountain lions, snakes and scorpions. Burt and her team mark the 200-mile courses with pink flags roughly every half-mile, but runners, including Dauwalter, have become lost. For safety, their positions are marked with a GPS spot tracking system. The coordinates also allow people to follow runners in real time. Hundreds of people followed Dauwalter’s races in Moab and in Tahoe. “I think more than anything, what we are seeing with Courtney is psychological,” said Steven Kotler, an author and director of research at the Flow Genome Project. “Every time she runs one of these long races, she believes she can do the next one faster.” She is not invincible, though. After tracking Dauwalter for two days in Tahoe, Kyle Curtin passed her at Mile 182. Forty-nine hours 54 minutes after starting the Tahoe 200, Dauwalter crossed the finish line in second, twenty-seven minutes behind Curtin. The two set a new course record by almost 10 hours. “Courtney was definitely the person to beat,” said Curtin, 32, an Army veteran. “I ran the time I did because I was trying to catch her the entire race.” The third-place runner finished 10 hours behind them. Most of the other runners finished a day or two later. Dauwalter said there was nothing she could do to ward off the puking and the fatigue and Curtin. “Hopefully now just having experienced those mental and physical components will make it so next time we are just a little bit stronger and can push through them a little bit easier,” she said. Dauwalter plans to run the Tahoe 200 again. She and Burt, the race director, believe that it’s possible to finish the race in 42 hours. “That’s two, 21 hour 100s on 20,000 feet of climbing for each hundred,” Dauwalter said. “That’s pretty stout, but it’s possible.”",The New York Times
2018,The Wooing of Jared Kushner: How the Saudis Got a Friend in the White House,"Senior American officials were worried. Since the early months of the Trump administration, Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and Middle East adviser, had been having private, informal conversations with Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the favorite son of Saudi Arabia’s king. Given Mr. Kushner’s political inexperience, the private exchanges could make him susceptible to Saudi manipulation, said three former senior American officials. In an effort to tighten practices at the White House, a new chief of staff tried to reimpose longstanding procedures stipulating that National Security Council staff members should participate in all calls with foreign leaders. But even with the restrictions in place, Mr. Kushner, 37, and Prince Mohammed, 33, kept chatting, according to three former White House officials and two others briefed by the Saudi royal court. In fact, they said, the two men were on a first-name basis, calling each other Jared and Mohammed in text messages and phone calls. The exchanges continued even after the Oct. 2 killing of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi journalist who was ambushed and dismembered by Saudi agents, according to two former senior American officials and the two people briefed by the Saudis. As the killing set off a firestorm around the world and American intelligence agencies concluded that it was ordered by Prince Mohammed, Mr. Kushner became the prince’s most important defender inside the White House, people familiar with its internal deliberations say. Mr. Kushner’s support for Prince Mohammed in the moment of crisis is a striking demonstration of a singular bond that has helped draw President Trump into an embrace of Saudi Arabia as one of his most important international allies. But the ties between Mr. Kushner and Prince Mohammed did not happen on their own. The prince and his advisers, eager to enlist American support for his hawkish policies in the region and for his own consolidation of power, cultivated the relationship with Mr. Kushner for more than two years, according to documents, emails and text messages reviewed by The New York Times. A delegation of Saudis close to the prince visited the United States as early as the month Mr. Trump was elected, the documents show, and brought back a report identifying Mr. Kushner as a crucial focal point in the courtship of the new administration. He brought to the job scant knowledge about the region, a transactional mind-set and an intense focus on reaching a deal with the Palestinians that met Israel’s demands, the delegation noted. Even then, before the inauguration, the Saudis were trying to position themselves as essential allies who could help the Trump administration fulfill its campaign pledges. In addition to offering to help resolve the dispute between Israel and the Palestinians, the Saudis offered hundreds of billions of dollars in deals to buy American weapons and invest in American infrastructure. Mr. Trump later announced versions of some of these items with great fanfare when he made his first foreign trip: to an Arab-Islamic summit in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. The Saudis had extended that invitation during the delegation’s November 2016 visit. “The inner circle is predominantly deal makers who lack familiarity with political customs and deep institutions, and they support Jared Kushner,” the Saudi delegation wrote of the incoming administration in a slide presentation obtained by the Lebanese newspaper Al Akhbar, which provided it to The Times. Several Americans who spoke with the delegation confirmed the slide presentation’s accounts of the discussions. The courtship of Mr. Kushner appears to have worked. Only a few months after Mr. Trump moved into the White House, Mr. Kushner was inquiring about the Saudi royal succession process and whether the United States could influence it, raising fears among senior officials that he sought to help Prince Mohammed, who was not yet the crown prince, vault ahead in the line for the throne, two former senior White House officials said. American diplomats and intelligence officials feared that the Trump administration might be seen as playing favorites in the delicate internal politics of the Saudi royal family, the officials said. (After publication, a senior White House official said in a statement: “Implications that Jared inquired about the possibility of influencing the Saudi royal succession process are false.”) By March, Mr. Kushner helped usher Prince Mohammed into a formal lunch with Mr. Trump in a state dining room at the White House, capitalizing on a last minute cancellation by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany because of a snowstorm. Bending protocol, Mr. Kushner arranged for Prince Mohammed, often referred to by his initials as M.B.S., to receive the kind of treatment usually reserved for heads of state, with photographs and news media coverage, according to a person involved in the arrangements. It appears to have been the first face-to-face meeting between Mr. Kushner and the prince, but Mr. Kushner raised eyebrows by telling others in the White House that he and Prince Mohammed had already spoken several times before, two people at the event recalled. In a statement, a White House spokesman said that “Jared has always meticulously followed protocols and guidelines regarding the relationship with MBS and all of the other foreign officials with whom he interacts.” White House officials declined to explain those protocols and guidelines, and declined to comment on Mr. Kushner’s one-on-one communications with Prince Mohammed since the killing of Mr. Khashoggi. Their connection, though, has been pivotal since the start of the Trump administration. “The relationship between Jared Kushner and Mohammed bin Salman constitutes the foundation of the Trump policy not just toward Saudi Arabia but toward the region,” said Martin Indyk, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former Middle East envoy. The administration’s reliance on the Saudis in the peace process, its support for the kingdom’s feud with Qatar, an American ally, and its backing of the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, he said, all grew out of “that bromance.” Before the 2016 presidential race, Mr. Kushner’s most extensive exposure to the Middle East was through Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a Kushner family friend, and the Kushners had contributed heavily to Israeli nonprofits supporting Jewish settlements in the Palestinian territories of the West Bank. But the Arab rulers of the oil-rich Persian Gulf mainly figured in Mr. Kushner’s life as investors in American real estate, the Kushner family business. So Tom Barrack, a Lebanese-American real estate investor with close ties to both Mr. Trump and the Gulf rulers, set out during the campaign to introduce Mr. Kushner to his associates as a useful ally. “You will love him and he agrees with our agenda!” Mr. Barrack wrote in May 2016 in an email to the Emirati ambassador in Washington, Youssef Otaiba. Mr. Otaiba soon positioned himself as an informal adviser on the region to Mr. Kushner. “Thanks to you, I am in constant contact with Jared and that has been extremely helpful,” Mr. Otaiba wrote to Mr. Barrack in the first months after Mr. Trump took office. The Emirati ambassador was also eagerly promoting Prince Mohammed. Since the prince’s aging father had taken the throne in 2015, the Emiratis were betting heavily on the prince as their preferred contender in the succession struggles within the Saudi royal family. “MBS is incredibly impressive,” Mr. Otaiba wrote Mr. Barrack in June 2016, as they tried to arrange meetings between the prince and the Trump campaign. The month after the American election, the de facto ruler of the United Arab Emirates — Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed of Abu Dhabi — delivered a similar message when he made an unannounced trip to New York for a meeting with Mr. Kushner and others about the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. While speaking with Mr. Kushner, the Emirati prince also recommended Prince Mohammed of Saudi Arabia as a promising young leader, according to a person familiar with their conversations. Mr. Kushner seemed impressed. The meeting had been arranged in part by Rick Gerson, a hedge fund manager who was close to Mr. Kushner and to the Emirati crown prince. After the encounter, Mr. Gerson sent a message to the Emirati crown prince about his success in winning over Mr. Kushner. “I promise you this will be the start of a special and historic relationship,” Mr. Gerson wrote, in a text message. On the eve of the inauguration, Mr. Gerson wrote to the Emirati crown prince again. “You have a true friend in the White House,” Mr. Gerson wrote, recounting a visit with Mr. Kushner before Mr. Kushner departed for Washington. The emails with Ambassador Otaiba and the text messages with Mr. Gerson were provided to The Times by people critical of Emirati foreign policies and authenticated by others with direct knowledge of their contents. Mr. Gerson declined to comment and the Emirati embassy did not respond to requests for comment. Top aides to Saudi Arabia’s Prince Mohammed also met with Mr. Kushner on a trip to New York in November 2016, after the election. The Saudi team included Musaad al-Aiban, a cabinet minister involved in economic planning and national security, and Khaled al-Falih, installed by the prince as minister of energy and chairman of the state oil company, according to executives who met with them and a person who was briefed on the meetings. Mr. Aiban did not respond to a request for comment, and Mr. Falih could not be reached for comment. The delegation made special note of what it characterized as Mr. Kushner’s ignorance of Saudi Arabia. “Kushner made clear his lack of familiarity with the history of Saudi-American relations and he asked about its support for terrorism,” the team noted in the slide presentation prepared for Riyadh. “After the discussion, he expressed his satisfaction with what was explained about the Saudi role in fighting terrorism” and what the Saudis said was their international leadership in fighting Islamist extremism. Mr. Kushner, the Saudi report said, also questioned the delegation’s motives, asking whether the group had always been interested in working with Mr. Trump. As a candidate, Mr. Trump had promised to ban Muslim immigrants from entering the United States and had singled out Saudi Arabia as a dangerous influence. “Kushner wondered about Saudi Arabia’s desire for partnership and whether it came from opportunity or worry, and he wondered as well if it was specific to this American administration or whether it was presented to Hillary Clinton (for example: women driving),” read another slide, next to a photograph of Mr. Kushner. But Mr. Kushner was clear about his own priorities, the report said. “The Israeli-Palestinian conflict was among the most important issues to draw Kushner’s attention,” the delegation reported, and therefore the best way to win him over. “The Palestinian issue first: there is still no clear plan for the American administration toward the Middle East,” the delegation wrote, “except that the central interest is finding a historic solution to support the stability of Israel and solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.” To cultivate ties with the Trump team, the Saudis had prepared a long list of initiatives that they said would help Mr. Trump deliver for his supporters. Seizing on Mr. Trump’s campaign vows for the “extreme vetting” of immigrants, the Saudi delegation proposed “establishing an intelligence and data” exchange “to help the American administration carry out its strategy of investigating those requesting residency (extreme vetting),” according to an Arabic version of a presentation for the Trump team. And the delegation pledged “high-level coordination with the new American administration” to help with “defeating extremist thought.” Several of the Saudi proposals were evidently welcomed. One was a “joint center to fight the ideology of extremism and terrorism.” President Trump helped inaugurate a Saudi version of the center on his trip to Riyadh the following May. Another Saudi proposal outlined what the Trump administration later called “an Arab NATO.” In their presentation, the Saudis described it as an Islamic military coalition of tens of thousands of troops “ready when the president-elect wishes to deploy them.” Other initiatives appeared timed to Mr. Trump’s first term in office, like proposals to spend $50 billion over four years on American defense contracts, to increase Saudi investment in the United States to $200 billion over four years, and to invest, with other Gulf states, up to $100 billion in American infrastructure. And the delegation urged Mr. Trump to come to Saudi Arabia himself to “launch the initiatives as part of a historic welcome celebration.” It is unclear how the delegation’s slide-show presentation to and about the Trump team were obtained by the Al Akhbar newspaper, which is sympathetic to the Iranian-backed Lebanese movement Hezbollah and Iran, an enemy of Saudi Arabia. Several Americans identified in the presentation acknowledged meeting with the delegation and confirmed broad outlines of the discussions. The Times provided the documents and the names of delegation members to an official of the Saudi Embassy in Washington, who declined to comment. Israel had long argued to American diplomats that Saudi Arabia’s influence in the region made it essential to any peace deal, and the Israelis were developing high hopes for Prince Mohammed because of his hawkish views toward Iran and his general iconoclasm (he would later make several statements, like affirming the Israeli “right” to land, that were notably more sympathetic to the Israeli position than those of other Saudi leaders.) Within weeks of Mr. Trump’s move into the White House, Mr. Kushner had embraced the delegation’s proposal for the president to visit Riyadh, convinced by then that the alliance with Saudi Arabia would be crucial in his plans for the region, according to a person who discussed it with Mr. Kushner and a second person familiar with his plans. The secretary of state at the time, Rex W. Tillerson, opposed the idea. It would link the administration too closely to Riyadh, these people said, giving up flexibility and leverage. Mr. Trump initially saw little benefit either, according to a person involved in his deliberations. But by the time of the inauguration Mr. Kushner was already arguing that under the influence of Prince Mohammed, Saudi Arabia could play a pivotal role in advancing a Middle East peace deal, according to three people familiar with his thinking. That would be the president’s legacy, Mr. Kushner argued, according to a person involved in the discussions. It was around the time of the White House visit in March 2017 that senior officials in the State Department and the Pentagon began to worry about the one-on-one communications between Prince Mohammed — who is known to favor the online messaging service WhatsApp — and Mr. Kushner. “There was a risk the Saudis were playing him,” one former White House official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Two later face-to-face encounters with Mr. Kushner preceded key turning points in Prince Mohammed’s consolidation of power. Shortly after Mr. Kushner visited Riyadh with the president in May 2017, Prince Mohammed orchestrated the ouster of his older cousin, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, removing him from control of the Saudi Interior Ministry and replacing him as crown prince. Prince Mohammed also announced a Saudi-led blockade of its neighbor and rival Qatar, the host of a major American air base. And days after Mr. Kushner made an unannounced visit to Riyadh in the fall of 2017, the crown prince summarily detained about 200 wealthy Saudis, including several of his royal cousins, in a Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh. After each play for power, President Trump publicly praised Prince Mohammed. One former White House official argued that Mr. Kushner’s personal ties to Prince Mohammed had sometimes been an asset. At one point, for example, the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen had blocked a critical port, cutting off humanitarian and medical supplies. The national security adviser at the time, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, suggested that Mr. Kushner call Prince Mohammed to address the issue, the official said, and General McMaster believed Mr. Kushner’s intercession had helped persuade the Saudis to loosen the restrictions. White House officials also say that Mr. Kushner has formal conversations with many other leaders in the region. And previous administrations have also had close ties to the Saudi government. Since the uproar over Mr. Khashoggi’s killing, the Trump administration has acknowledged only one conversation between Mr. Kushner and Prince Mohammed: an Oct. 10 telephone call joined by John R. Bolton, the national security adviser. The Americans “asked for more details and for the Saudi government to be transparent in the investigation process,” the White House said in a statement. But American officials and a Saudi briefed on their conversations said that Mr. Kushner and Prince Mohammed have continued to chat informally. According to the Saudi, Mr. Kushner has offered the crown prince advice about how to weather the storm, urging him to resolve his conflicts around the region and avoid further embarrassments. Few of the Saudi promises have amounted to much. The effectiveness of the counterterrorism center in Riyadh remains doubtful. After offering $50 billion in new weapons contracts, the Saudis have signed only letters of interest or intent without any firm deals. After proposing to marshal up to $100 billion in investments in American infrastructure, the Saudis have announced an investment of only $20 billion. Inside the White House, Mr. Kushner has continued to argue that the president needs to stand by Prince Mohammed because he remains essential to the administration’s broader Middle East strategy, according to people familiar with the deliberations. Whether Prince Mohammed can fulfill that role, however, remains to be seen. His initial approaches to the Palestinians were rejected by their leaders, and their resistance stiffened after the Trump administration recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital without waiting for a negotiated agreement on the city’s status. Now the prince’s father, King Salman, 82, who is still the official head of state, has appeared to resist Mr. Kushner’s Middle East peace plans as well. “The Palestinian issue will remain our primary issue,” the king declared in a speech last month, “until the Palestinian people receive all of their legal rights.” An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated when Prince Mohammed bin Salman ousted his cousin, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, as crown prince of Saudi Arabia. It was in June 2017, not April 2017.",The New York Times
2018,The World Needs a Urine Test for TB. But It’s Already Here. ,"Global health The W.H.O. has recommended such a test for H.I.V.-positive patients since 2015. But in poor countries, few qualifying patients are receiving it. For at least a decade, one of the most urgent needs in public health was a urine dipstick that could quickly diagnose tuberculosis in the most vulnerable population: those with advanced H.I.V. Now that test exists. It’s inexpensive and has been recommended by the World Health Organization since 2015. But it is hardly used in the countries that most need it. “There is a $3.50 rapid test that works on urine, for crying out loud, and the fact that it’s not being utilized is just ridiculous,” said Sharonann Lynch, a policy adviser at the medical charity Doctors Without Borders. Part of the problem, Ms. Lynch says, is that the W.H.O.’s recommendation for the test is too limited. Donor organizations such as the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known as Pepfar, tend to follow the W.H.O.’s guidance on TB. Most diagnostic tests for TB rely on detecting the bacterium or its DNA in sputum. But it can be difficult for H.I.V.-positive people to produce enough sputum. The dipstick test picks up lipoarabinomannan, a component of the TB bacterium, in urine. TB is the leading cause of death in H.I.V.-positive people, claiming 300,000 lives in 2017. The W.H.O. recommends the test only for people who are H.I.V.-positive, gravely ill and have fewer than 100 CD4 cells — a kind of immune system cell — per cubic millimeter of blood. (The typical range for CD4 cells is 500 to 1,500.) In this group, according to evidence the W.H.O. reviewed in 2015, the test correctly diagnoses TB in 56 percent of patients. “It’s a test with suboptimal accuracy,” said Christopher Gilpin, senior scientist at the WHO’s Global TB Program. “This is probably part of the limited uptake.” Another reason, he said, is that few clinics in resource-poor regions have the equipment needed to determine CD4 counts. Advocacy groups take issue with both points, saying the W.H.O. is making perfect the enemy of good. “It’s not a perfect test, but there’s literally zero harm in doing it and it has saved a lot of lives,” said Erica Lessem, deputy executive director for programs at Treatment Action Group, an organization based in New York City. According to a preliminary analysis by the Clinton Health Access Initiative, the estimated need for the test is between 2.7 and 2.9 million people with a CD4 cutoff of 100, and 5.8 million with a CD4 cutoff of 200. Abbott Laboratories, which makes the test, declined to say how many tests are sold, but one estimate pegs the figure at about 400,000 a year. The low adoption numbers run the risk of discouraging companies interested in developing TB diagnostics, said Ms. Lessem. “The W.H.O. is giving really mixed signals to countries and to suppliers and manufacturers, because they’re basically saying on the one hand we’re asking for this point-of-care test, we want to do more to stop mortality — and on the other hand, actually we think that even though we have this tool, it’s not worth rolling out,” Ms. Lessem said. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Dr. Gilpin said W.H.O.’s guidance is so cautiously worded in part because of worries that the test would be misused for people with higher CD4 levels, in whom the test is less accurate. This was a legitimate concern at one-time, Ms. Lessem said, but the pendulum has swung too far: “Now even people who need the test and would benefit from it are not getting it because the guidance is worded in such a restrictive way.” Doctors Without Borders has compiled evidence that shows the test, called TB-LAM, is more sensitive than the 2015 data suggested. The W.H.O. planned to review that data this year, but now has decided to revisit TB-LAM along with a new urine dipstick, made by the Japanese company Fujifilm, in May 2019. Pepfar released draft recommendations for TB diagnostics earlier this month — and advocacy groups are hoping the final recommendations in January include TB-LAM for anyone who is H.I.V.-positive and seriously ill. “Pepfar and its scientific advisory board have gone ahead of W.H.O. in the past, and frankly they should do so again,” Ms. Lynch said.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Writer Who Destroyed an Empire,"Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, born Dec. 11, 1918, did more than anyone else to bring the Soviet Union to its knees. Mr. Scammell is the author of “Solzhenitsyn: A Biography.” When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, pundits offered a variety of reasons for its failure: economic, political, military. Few thought to add a fourth, more elusive cause: the regime’s total loss of credibility. This hard-to-measure process had started in 1956, when Premier Nikita Khrushchev gave his so-called secret speech to party leaders, in which he denounced Josef Stalin’s purges and officially revealed the existence of the gulag prison system. Not long afterward, Boris Pasternak allowed his suppressed novel “Doctor Zhivago” to be published in the West, tearing another hole in the Iron Curtain. Then, in 1962, the literary magazine Novy Mir caused a sensation with a novella set in the gulag by an unknown author named Aleksandr Isayevich Solzhenitsyn. That novella, “A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich,” took the country, and then the world, by storm. In crisp, clear prose, it told the story of a simple man’s day in a labor camp, where he stoically endured endless injustices. It was so incendiary that, when it appeared, many Soviet readers thought that government censorship had been abolished. Solzhenitsyn was no youthful beginner. Born a hundred years ago, on Dec. 11, 1918, just 14 months after the Bolshevik Revolution, he was virtually the same age as the Soviet state and had experienced every phase of its development. As a youth and college student he had been swept up in the revolutionary euphoria of the communist experiment and fervently believed in the premises of Marxism-Leninism. In World War II he served as the commander of an artillery sound-ranging battalion and was awarded two medals for valor. But Solzhenitsyn’s promising career was brutally cut short by his arrest in February 1945 on a charge of anti-Soviet activities; he was swiftly sentenced to eight years of hard labor in the gulag. His crime? Criticizing Stalin and the Soviet Army in letters exchanged with a school friend on another front. This Dickensian reversal of fortune plunged Solzhenitsyn into despair, but it also opened his eyes to the hideous underbelly of Soviet communism and gave him glimpses of the reign of terror and lies that had kept it going for so long. He had already written poems, stories and half a novel, most of them on patriotic themes; he now resolved to dedicate the rest of his writing life to exposing the monstrous machine that had, as he later discovered, murdered or incarcerated millions like himself. After publishing two more tales focused on the plight of simple peasants, Solzhenitsyn was blacklisted by the censors, but he was able to complete the two big autobiographical novels he had been working on: “The First Circle” and “Cancer Ward.” “The First Circle” was about a group of privileged prisoners, including Solzhenitsyn, chosen to work in a secret lab run by the gulag authorities, while “Cancer Ward” described the circumstances in which Solzhenitsyn, while working as a schoolteacher in administrative exile after his release, was successfully treated for abdominal cancer in Tashkent. Both novels were notable for their ethical scrutiny of Soviet society and discussion of the government’s crimes, and both were denied publication in the Soviet Union. Like “Doctor Zhivago,"" they were quickly smuggled to the West and, like “Doctor Zhivago” and “A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich,” they became instant best sellers. For his critical approach to Soviet life, Solzhenitsyn was evicted from the state-sponsored Writers’ Union and became a virtual outlaw in his own country. But he was far from alone. Many talented and independent writers — Varlam Shalamov (a fellow chronicler of the Gulag), Andrei Sinyavsky, Yuli Daniel and Joseph Brodsky — were circumventing the Soviet censorship with a new publication format called samizdat. It consisted of self-published poems, stories, novels, human rights appeals and political manifestoes that were secretly circulated in typed and mimeographed copies; in many cases, they were also sent abroad. By the end of the 1960s, the leading writers and activists came to be known as the Dissident Movement. Their goal was to bring about freedom of expression and peaceful political change in the Soviet Union, and they garnered a global audience of readers. Besides writers, their ranks included scientists, engineers, academics, lawyers, even rebellious workers; their unofficial leader was the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Andrei Sakharov. Solzhenitsyn sympathized and cooperated with Sakharov and the other dissidents, but he didn’t always agree with them, and he continued to follow his own path. In 1973, still in the Soviet Union, he sent abroad his literary and polemical masterpiece, “The Gulag Archipelago.” The nonfiction account exposed the enormous crimes that had led to the wholesale incarceration and slaughter of millions of innocent victims, demonstrating that its dimensions were on a par with the Holocaust. Solzhenitsyn’s gesture amounted to a head-on challenge to the Soviet state, calling its very legitimacy into question and demanding revolutionary change. In response, the Soviets stripped Solzhenitsyn of his citizenship and expelled him to the West; he landed in America, and spent most of the next 19 years in Vermont. He was able to collect the Nobel Prize he had been awarded in 1970; he also wrote four more historical novels in his grand series called “The Red Wheel,” centered on the Russian Revolution and its aftermath. He continued to blast Soviet leaders for their corruption and offered reams of advice for the future, but it was not an altogether happy time for the writer. His broadsides carried less weight in the Soviet Union than when he had still lived there. Strident attacks on America and Western democracy soon alienated his liberal supporters in the West, while his fierce criticisms of former allies in his memoirs seriously damaged his reputation at home. None of this diminished Solzhenitsyn’s desire to see the Soviet system brought down, and when the government of Mikhail Gorbachev collapsed in 1991 he enjoyed both the thrill of success and the satisfaction of being proved right in his predictions of disaster. Three years later, he returned to Russia and received a hero’s welcome. But he didn’t much like what he saw there. President Boris Yeltsin’s government was chaotic, and Solzhenitsyn disapproved of what he saw as the new regime’s adulation of the West and its foolish desire to introduce a form of Western democracy. What he advocated was a strong leader, who maintained strict order in the country, encouraged more religion and state support for the Orthodox church, together with a revitalized patriotism and a return to traditional values. He seemed to get his wish in 2000, when Mr. Yeltsin handed the presidency over to a man who shared Solzhenitsyn’s nationalist views and personified his ideal of a strong leader: Vladimir Putin. The new Russian leader made a show of welcoming Solzhenitsyn to his residence and seeking his advice, and in 2007 he bestowed a state award on the author for his humanitarian activities (Solzhenitsyn had refused similar awards from Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Yeltsin). Solzhenitsyn died in 2008, before Mr. Putin showed his true colors with the coldblooded murders of opposition figures, the creation of an authoritarian state, the invasion of Ukraine and the Crimea, and the whittling down of local democracy in the provinces. (Solzhenitsyn might well have approved of the Ukrainian measures, since he was half-Ukrainian by birth, but not the others.) After his death Solzhenitsyn was given a sumptuous funeral and buried at the Donskoy Monastery in Moscow. In 2010 “The Gulag Archipelago” was made required reading in Russian high schools. Moscow’s Great Communist Street has been renamed Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn Street, his centennial is being celebrated with great pomp this week in Russia, and a statue of him in Moscow is planned for the near future. All this would give the writer great satisfaction. But though feted and exploited by questionable allies, Solzhenitsyn should be remembered for his role as a truth-teller. He risked his all to drive a stake through the heart of Soviet communism and did more than any other single human being to undermine its credibility and bring the Soviet state to its knees.

2018,Opinion | The Year Justice Caught Up With Trumpworld,"In 2018, impunity came to an end. Opinion Columnist Ever since the 2016 election, it’s been common for some people to refer to whatever year we’re in as a synonym for dystopian weirdness. (Last year, for example, CNN’s Jake Tapper tweeted “Peak 2017” about a headline saying, “US ambassador denies own comments, then denies denial.”) The world has felt continuously off-kilter, like a TV drama whose writers developed a sudden fondness for psilocybin. Last month astronomers at Harvard wrote that a strange oblong space object “may be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to Earth vicinity by an alien civilization,” and it barely made a ripple in the news. There was simply too much else going on. Amid this ceaseless barrage, things many of us have taken for granted have been called into question, including the endurance of liberal democracy, the political salience of truth and the assumption that it would be a big scandal if a president were caught directing illegal payoffs to a pornographic film actress. Often it feels like in American politics, none of the old rules still apply. But in 2018, they did. (At least some of them.) Alien probes aside, this was a year in which things started to make sense again. The Democratic landslide in the midterms proved that the laws of political gravity haven’t been suspended; Trump’s incompetence, venality and boorishness had electoral consequences. Further, it was a year of justice and accountability for at least some of those who foisted this administration on the country. An awful menagerie of lowlifes was swept into power by Trump’s victory two years ago. In 2018, at least some of them started to fall back out again. [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] At the beginning of 2018, Michael Cohen was still Trump’s loyal personal lawyer. Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman, was sleeping in his own bed at night. Rick Gates, Manafort’s deputy, had not yet made a plea deal with Robert Mueller, the special counsel. Mueller’s investigation hadn’t yet sent anyone to prison. The Dutch lawyer Alex van der Zwaan, who pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about work he’d done with Gates for the former Ukrainian president, became the first, in May. He was followed by Richard Pinedo, seller of fake IDs and fraudulent bank accounts, and former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos. When this year began, Scott Pruitt was still indulging in spectacular corruption as head of the Environmental Protection Agency. Omarosa Manigault Newman had just been fired from her senior administration job and had not yet revealed her stash of secret recordings. Rob Porter, who has been accused of abuse by two ex-wives, was still White House staff secretary. David Sorensen, accused of abuse by one ex-wife, was still a White House speechwriter. At the start of 2018, the casino mogul Steve Wynn was the Republican National Committee’s national finance chairman. He resigned after The Wall Street Journal reported that he’d been accused of committing multiple acts of sexual harassment and assault. (Wynn denied assaulting anyone.) Elliott Broidy, owner of a private security company, was an R.N.C. deputy national finance chairman. He resigned after The Journal reported that he’d paid hush money to a former Playboy model who said she’d had an abortion after he got her pregnant. (Cohen was also a deputy chairman; he resigned in June.) As this year began, Steve Bannon, Trump’s former campaign head and chief White House strategist, whose sympathy for white nationalists did so much damage in so little time, was still running Breitbart News. He’d not yet burned his bridges to Trumpworld with his comments in Michael Wolff’s book “Fire and Fury,” which was published in January. Since then, Bannon has lost considerable pull. He most recently made headlines after he was scheduled to speak at a conference on sex robots; a backlash to his invitation led to the conference being postponed. In January, McClatchy reported that the F.B.I. was investigating whether Russia funneled money through the National Rifle Association to aid the Trump campaign. Throughout the year, as evidence of sketchy connections between the N.R.A. and Russia kept emerging, many on the right poo-pooed it. (“This attempt to turn the N.R.A. into another cog in the Russian conspiracy is laughable, but the mainstream media apparently still find it deeply compelling,” wrote Breitbart editor Joel Pollak in March.) On Thursday, Maria Butina, a Russian who’d nurtured ties to N.R.A. leadership and to Trumpworld, pleaded guilty to conspiring to act as a foreign agent. The plea described how, after arranging a junket to Moscow for a “Gun Rights Organization,” she wrote a message to her handler that was translated as, “We should allow them to express their gratitude now, we will put pressure on them quietly later.” If Trump opponents had known a year ago that 2018 would bring so many revelations and comeuppances, we might have assumed that the Trump administration would be entering its terminal phase. But living under Trump has inured many of us to shock; momentous developments, like Cohen being sentenced to three years in prison, end up feeling anticlimactic, particularly with most Republicans refusing to act. Still, when you consider the events of the last 12 months together, it becomes clear how relentlessly justice has ground forward, and how much Trump and his flunkies have lost. As I was writing this, news broke that federal prosecutors have started a criminal investigation into Trump’s inaugural committee, adding to inquiries into his business, foundation, campaign and presidency. America is still in a perilous place, and even a weakened Trump can torment migrants, pack the courts, wreck the environment and suck up to tyrants. Nevertheless, this is the first year since 2015, when Trump rode down that cursed escalator to launch his bid for office, that is ending more hopefully than it began.

2018,The Year That Bill de Blasio Became Donald Trump* and 9 Other Improbable Transformations,"Big City The drama of the past year played out locally in big civic and social changes: surprise political upsets and reversals, decent reputations gone bad and bad reputations gone much worse. Here, a highly subjective (and in some cases exaggerated) list of who and what seemed to morph into someone or something else. When Bill de Blasio Became Donald Trump (*Wait, what?) Let’s just say from the outset that we are not 100 percent serious when we suggest that the liberal mayor of New York City appeared indistinguishable from the divisively nationalist, immigrant-unfriendly 45th president of the United States. But certain Trumpian characteristics in the mayor revealed themselves this year so much so that The New York Post featured a picture of him on its cover with a photoshopped head of orange hair and the line, “Don Blasio.” The catalyst for this new impression was the court-ordered release of thousands of pages of emails from his administration showing the mayor to be aggressive, insecure and deeply contemptuous of a press corps he believes has covered him unfairly. Also, he uses all caps sometimes. Also, he loves real estate developers. When an Unknown Bartender Became a Che Guevara T-shirt Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez rose from obscurity over the summer to defeat longtime incumbent Joseph Crowley in the Democratic primary to represent the city’s 14th Congressional district. But that is easily the dullest and least relevant way to describe her change of fortune. On the left she has become a symbol of working-class grievance, of an urban youth class mired in student debt and locked out of domestic comforts by a national housing crisis. On the right she has become a lightning rod for those who fear and loathe a rising progressive energy. Is she weak on policy? Does it matter? She is leading an emotionally charged movement. When Andrew Cuomo Became the Bartender Who Became the Che Guevara T-shirt More than any other year, this was the one in which the governor really wanted you to believe that he had become a firebrand left-of-center liberal. Challenged by Cynthia Nixon in the Democratic primary, he started to adopt her positions on the legalization of pot, the evil of plastic bags, the need for less punishing teacher evaluations and so on. Is he really looking like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez? Not when he is wearing a windbreaker roaming through a subway tunnel in Canarsie, but he has proposed a Green New Deal just as she has, and he is sounding like he wants to be a revolutionary. When the New York City Housing Authority Became the Ultimate Slumlord In June the federal government delivered a brutal rebuke to the nation’s biggest public housing authority, accusing it of gross mismanagement and failure to provide a safe living environment for residents, especially children who had been exposed to lead paint. The city was supposed to move quickly making repairs; it didn’t. Reports of squalid conditions continue, and in one complex, thousands of residents didn’t have heat or hot water on Thanksgiving. When Eric Schneiderman Became Ike Turner Previously regarded as a friend to feminists, the New York attorney general was accused of beating up several former girlfriends, in an article in The New Yorker and he resigned immediately after it appeared. His degradations followed the familiar narrative of domestic violence: his assaults were accompanied by his cruel assessments of the women he was dating. Initially he insisted that everything that transpired with these women was consensual. It was only after a special prosecutor determined that limitations in the law made it impossible to level criminal charges that Mr. Schneiderman accepted “full” responsibility for his conduct and committed to “making amends.” When Amazon Became Philip Morris So it turned out that Amazon was more or less just kidding when it solicited proposals from cities around the country hoping to be home to the company’s second headquarters. The company affirmed its elitist commitments when it chose to locate in New York and suburban Washington over, say, Detroit or Pittsburgh. And while that was maddening enough to plenty of urbanists, many New Yorkers have greeted the impending arrival of Amazon with a rage toward the company that was not necessarily foreseeable. Amazon’s encroachment into Queens, where the terror is that it will drive housing prices up even further and deny jobs to the people who really need them, has made the retailer the brightest new emblem of corporate malevolence. When Sheryl Sandberg Became Ayn Rand Many women in New York’s pop intellectual and publishing communities embraced Sheryl Sandberg’s book “Lean In’’ when it came out a few years ago. Its simple advice for female empowerment: Women need to just buck up and assert themselves if they wanted more from the patriarchy. For some of us — I will say smugly — that did not pass the feminism smell test. The #MeToo movement should have confirmed to any doubters that women weren’t the problem — social structures were the problem. But it wasn’t until damaging reports of Ms. Sandberg’s role in subverting democracy at Facebook and selling out its users that her dethroning was complete, and that it was clear that someone so committed to greed and corporate narcissism was not going to lead American women to a better place. On her book tour, Michelle Obama called the Lean In movement a “lie.” When Juul Became Crack As rates of drug and alcohol use have declined among adolescents for years, Juul became the beloved vice of teenagers across the city and around the country. The company, which has more than 70 percent of the e-cigarette market in the United States, was supposed to help grown-ups quit conventional cigarettes. Instead, the easily concealable and cool-looking vaping device has spurred a nicotine addiction among young people who had never smoked. All along, the company — disingenuously, it would seem — maintained that this was not its intent. And yet Juul offered its product in flavors like Crème Brûlée and something akin to Froot Loops, unlikely to appeal to anyone old enough to vote. When Rudy Giuliani Became Alex Jones If you enter “Rudy Giuliani” and “unhinged” into Google, you get a lot of entries. Had Mr. Giuliani stayed out of the Trump scrum, he would have had a decent chance at an enviable legacy in which the world would have remembered him as the strong and calming mayor presiding over New York City during 9/11. Instead he went full throttle into his role as the president’s cable-news consigliere, giving interviews so erratic and illogical that even Fox News has been confounded. When New York Became Peoria This is not a delusional post about how a slightly softened real-estate market has turned the city into a quaint center of simplicity. No; this is a post about the ways in which New Yorkers, who famously strain themselves not to look twice at celebrities and pretend to disregard their power, went bonkers over the mysterious arrival of a Mandarin duck in Central Park. Suddenly, everyone was Ron Galella, desperate for a picture and obsessed with where this gorgeous patchwork quilt of a creature would show up next.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The Year in Charts,"Economic and other indicators are making it increasingly clear that Trump’s economic dreams are unlikely to come true. Mr. Rattner was counselor to the Treasury secretary in the Obama administration. Graphics by Bill Marsh By any measure, 2018 was another Year of Trump. From his efforts to remake the American economy to his go-it-alone trade war to his curious pro-Putin foreign policy to the at least 17 investigations underway into his various activities, President Trump dominated the news as few of his predecessors have done. But by the end of his second year, the prospects that he would achieve his economic goals were in grave doubt as growth slowed and the stock market swooned. Since Inauguration Day, Mr. Trump’s approval rating, according to the monthly Gallup poll, has averaged 39 percent (a record low for a new president). Voters emphatically registered their disappointment in the midterm elections. As statistical analyses of past midterm elections have shown, the approval rating of the president is more closely correlated to midterm success than the state of the economy is. This year was no exception. In the House of Representatives, Republicans lost 40 seats (or possibly 41; one race has yet to be called). Meanwhile, Democrats picked up seven governorships. Although the Democrats had a net loss of two seats in the Senate, not one Democrat running for the upper chamber in a state carried by Hillary Clinton lost, while Democrats won in seven states carried by Mr. Trump. Happily, all of this occurred in the context of the highest turnout of eligible voters since 1914.

Bush. “I will be the greatest jobs producer that God ever created.” — Donald Trump shortly after the 2016 election Mr. Trump takes to Twitter frequently to extol the pace of job growth, which has, indeed, been solid. The problem with Mr. Trump’s victory lap is that job growth during his administration has been slightly slower than it was during the last 22 months of Mr. Obama’s tenure: 4.2 million Americans hired under Mr. Trump versus 4.8 million under Mr. Obama. More worrisome is that Mr. Trump’s policies have done little to help manufacturing workers, whose votes in key states helped elect him; their share of total employment has not improved. Monthly job growth: Obama’s last 22 months vs. Trump’s first 22 300,000 Obama average: 216,000 200,000 Trump average: 191,000 100,000 April ’15 ’16 ’17 ’18 Nov.

Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics While jobs capture the headlines, an equally important measure is wages. There, the news is not good. Real wages (after adjusting for inflation) have barely grown under Mr. Trump; President Obama fared modestly better. And the principal beneficiaries of the wage increases that have occurred have been Americans with incomes in the top 10 percent and in the bottom 10 percent. The former is not surprising; the latter has to do in large part with high demand for unskilled workers (think of the pay increases put in place by Amazon and Wal-Mart) together with increases in the minimum wage by many states. That has left the middle 80 percent of Americans with wages that continued to decline in real terms through 2017 and only inched up in 2018. This will prove yet another challenge for Mr. Trump as he tries to convince voters in 2020 that his economic program is working.

So much for the argument, presented in a letter from nine respected conservative economists to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, that the tax cut would raise the growth rate for G.D.P. to 3 percent to 4 percent. The tax cut, combined with an equally formidable new spending bill, is producing one of the biggest peacetime federal budget deficits. As low as $439 billion in 2015, the fiscal gap is now on track to exceed $1 trillion in 2020. Over the coming decade, that could mean $16 trillion more in federal debt. If all the tax law’s provisions are extended, the ratio of debt to gross domestic product for the United States will exceed 100 percent for the first time since World War II.

The stock market is on track for its worst December since 1931. What’s going on? After a burst of economic optimism, investors have turned bearish, and chatter about a coming recession is becoming more common. Since June, JPMorgan has cut its global growth forecast from 3.2 percent to 3 percent. That may not sound like much, but it’s an estimated $170 billion of lost output. China is feeling shaky and Europe — grappling with problems ranging from Brexit to weak Italian banks — is faltering. As for the United States, perhaps only Mr. Trump believes we will achieve the promised 3 percent plus growth next year; about 2.5 percent seems more realistic, and some economists expect an even greater slowdown.

Yet the stock market promptly swooned. That was because the Fed only modestly cut back on its expectations for interest rate increases in 2019, to two from the three previously forecast. But the futures markets, which have historically been better predictors than the Fed itself, foresee no rate increase next year and a cut in 2020. That’s good news for those who will be borrowing for homes or cars, but it’s a bad signal for the economy as a whole, because it suggests that economic weakness may be coming. It’s particularly bad news for Mr. Trump, who could find himself running for re-election in a slowdown or even a recession. After four years in office, it’s going to be very hard for him to pin that on Mr. Obama or the Democrats.

I’ll spare you the usual argument about the contribution that immigrants make to America, but here’s one interesting fact: The incarceration rate for illegal immigrants is only half that of people born in this country — and that includes those jailed for immigration offenses. Less noticed amid Trump news has been slipping enrollment in the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. From a peak of 12.7 million enrollees in 2016, sign-ups through the exchanges have been declining. Obamacare enrollment, in millions 12.7 12.2 11.8 11.7 11.4 8.0 2014 2017 2019 (est.)

The total for 2019 is projected to be approximately 11.4 million, according to Charles Gaba, an analyst who follows Obamacare closely. He attributes that decline, in part, to “sabotage.” The requirement that all Americans have health care has essentially been gutted. The open enrollment period was cut by half. Funding for “navigators” who help people enroll, was slashed. Advertising was reduced by 90 percent. And a federal judge in Texas recently issued a decision that could invalidate Obamacare altogether. The only good news is that after several years of hefty raises by insurance companies fearful of losing money on the new product, premium increases have slowed significantly and may fall slightly in 2019.

2018,The Year in Sound: An Audio Time Capsule of 2018,"Listen and subscribe to our podcast from your mobile device: Via Apple Podcasts | Via RadioPublic | Via Stitcher Between the government shutdowns that bookended the year, there were furious standoffs over a border wall; shootings at a high school, a bar, a grocery store, a synagogue; devastating wildfires in California. There were handshakes and promises shared with autocrats in North Korea and Russia. Powerful men were brought down by #MeToo or trying to make a comeback, and a Supreme Court nominee was accused, then elevated to the bench. There were questions about a murdered journalist, about election interference, about how much Facebook knew. The midterm elections delivered one of the most diverse — and divided — governments in American history. Here’s what 2018 sounded like. We’re taking Tuesday off for the Christmas holiday. For the rest of the week, we’ll revisit some of our favorite episodes of the year and check in on what has happened since the stories first ran. We’ll be back with a new episode on Wednesday, Jan. 2.

2018,The Year in Yesteryear: Standout Music Books and Boxed Sets,"While streaming opened doors for many of 2018’s most exciting new artists, retrospective boxed sets and photo books held the keys to gems from the past, from a revelatory 50th anniversary reissue of “The Beatles” (known best as the White Album) to “More Blood, More Tracks: The Bootleg Series Vol. 14,” an expanded version of Bob Dylan’s 1975 masterpiece, “Blood on the Tracks.” Here, the pop music critics of The New York Times choose some of the most notable collections of 2018. To capture history, you have to be present for it. “Hip Hop at the End of the World: The Photography of Ernie Paniccioli” (Rizzoli; $40) is filled with photos only Paniccioli has because, from the mid-1970s forward, only Paniccioli thought to be there — and was permitted in the room. (That’s an underappreciated photographic skill: not getting kicked out.) As a chronicler of hip-hop’s formative years, Paniccioli is essential; his voluminous archive was acquired by Cornell. His work is casual and on-the-fly. Many of the photos in the book are snapshots — literally — the sort of crammed-into-the-frame group pictures you take of friends you might not see for a while. Many of these pictures seem shot in a hurry, before the moment slipped away. Occasionally though, Paniccioli puts his subjects in dialogue with their surroundings: Fat Joe morosely standing atop a crushed car, or KRS-One posing sternly in front of the United Nations, or Nas, shot from below, arms wide open, in front of ecstatic clouds and a wide, blue, boundless sky. While Paniccioli shot for some magazines, including Word Up!, he largely predated the era in which hip-hop was considered the stuff of serious artistic photographic attention. “Contact High: A Visual History of Hip-Hop” (Clarkson Potter; $40), edited by Vikki Tobak, overlaps slightly with his era, but mostly picks up where he leaves off. This anthology shows hip-hop’s growth from the perspective of those charged with photographing it, mostly via magazine portraits and album covers. The photos are of varying intensity, by photographers with varying degrees of intimacy with their subjects. Each image is paired with a brief anecdote from the photographer — Glen E. Friedman, Jamil GS, Barron Claiborne, Danny Clinch, and many more — about the shoot. Clinch’s photos for Big L’s debut album are particularly moving, the rapper and 20 of his friends crammed onto one stoop. The images are accompanied by contact sheets, showing the just-before and the just-after, emphasizing that these are largely posed, not spontaneous, images. That’s the real value of “Contact High”: capturing hip-hop’s transition from improvisation to construction, from thrown-together fashion to stylists, from naturalism to poses. By the 1990s, when many of these photographs were taken, rap’s young stars were as meticulous about developing their visual images as much as their musical ones. (Though there is one great pseudo-candid here: XXL magazine’s 1998 A Great Day in Hip-Hop shoot in Harlem, by Gordon Parks, which gathered almost 200 of the genre’s leading lights for a giddy group shot.) “Contact High” includes some of Janette Beckman’s early hip-hop photography — she was a key portraitist in the 1980s. In her new book, “The Mash Up” (Hat & Beard; $40), many of her old shots are used as source material for graffiti artists, who draw atop them. (The book is curated by Cey Adams, responsible for developing much of hip-hop’s graphic identity in the 1980s). The most simpatico work comes from early era graffiti writers: Crash drawing on Futura, Lady Pink on Queen Latifah, Part One on Eric B. & Rakim. These pieces feel like dialogue, not tug-of-war, and radiate the sense of hip-hop as a living, breathing tradition, with innovators and inheritors, forever learning from one another. Now, more than four decades after hip-hop began, it is a minter of stars, a driver of style, a billion-dollar business. But it is also a lived culture, inhabitable not just by its celebrities, but also by those who are young, with dreams of their own. “Ferris Bueller: Catharsis” (which will be released in January via Steidl; $37.95) captures the personal collections of Rodney Bailey (known as Ferris Bueller), who parlayed a Roc-A-Fella Records internship into creative work with Kanye West, the Diplomats and others. His childhood aspirations are all here, captured in photos by Alex Bohn: worn-out cassettes, rough-at-the-edges posters, magazines, party fliers, broken old cellphones. But the most affecting photos are of sneakers. His old pairs are decayed from honest wear — in their cracks and creases you can see ambition and hustle. There is both a comfort and a wisdom in these photos, a reminder that hip-hop is something you could watch, but also own, and then build into a new life. JON CARAMANICA BOBBIE GENTRY: ‘THE GIRL FROM CHICKASAW COUNTY: THE COMPLETE CAPITOL MASTERS’ UMC; 8 CDs and hard-bound book, $109.99 Bobbie Gentry’s 1967 debut single and biggest hit, “Ode to Billie Joe,” was about a suicide; the narrator of another hit, “Fancy,” was an unrepentant hooker. Gentry’s songs brought telling unconventional detail to her Mississippi roots; she was also musically sophisticated and more ambitious than her label could quite handle. After her 1968 masterpiece (and commercial flop) “The Delta Sweete,” a borderline psych-folk concept album haunted by death and spirituality, she veered toward blander pop, but she took over songwriting and production for her last album, “Patchwork,” in 1971, a suite of elaborately orchestrated character-study songs. This completist box includes all of her albums and Capitol singles along with demos, unreleased sessions (including some convincing jazz standards) and a full disc of BBC live recordings. Gentry gave her last performance in 1981 and has been out of public view since 1982; this set offers good reason to miss her. JON PARELES ELVIS PRESLEY: ‘’68 COMEBACK SPECIAL: 50TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION’ RCA/Legacy; 5 CDs, 2 Blu-ray discs, $149.98 In 1968, after seven years of making increasingly mediocre movies, Elvis Presley needed to prove he was no has-been. He reclaimed a rock audience in the NBC television special “Elvis” — especially in a performance segment where he sat on a small stage with his 1950s bandmates, surrounded by squealing girls, clowning but then fully inhabiting his songs. He growled, he crooned, he stood up and shook his hips; the show positioned him as a rebel and, at the end, a white-clad redeemer. This set, most of it previously released, includes the original hourlong show plus extensive outtakes, including the full-length small-stage performances and audio rehearsals with the top Los Angeles musicians known as the Wrecking Crew — sometimes jokey, sometimes vociferous. PARELES THE JIMI HENDRIX EXPERIENCE: ‘ELECTRIC LADYLAND’ Experience Hendrix/Legacy, 6 LPs, hard-bound book and Blu-ray, $109.98; 3 CDs, hard-bound book and Blu-ray, $59.98 No amount of documentation or analysis can demystify the wild genius of “Electric Ladyland,” the last album Jimi Hendrix completed. It carried a deep blues spirit into new hallucinatory realms; 50 years later, it’s still overwhelming, dizzying, earthy, ecstatic. Alongside the complete album, this set probes the making of “Electric Ladyland” with an extended video documentary and a CD of Hendrix’s solo demos and early group takes. It also unveils an amateur recording of an anarchic 1968 Hollywood Bowl concert. Meanwhile, as if the copious stereo phasing and panning of the original album weren’t enough, there’s a whole new surround-sound mix. PARELES LEFTY FRIZZELL: ‘AN ARTICLE FROM LIFE: THE COMPLETE RECORDINGS’ Bear Family; 20 CDs, hard-bound book, $299.99 Lefty Frizzell (1928-1975) taught generations of country singers how to sound casual and natural through honky-tonking, hard times and especially heartache. The influence of Frizzell’s stoic drawl, liquefied syllables and tightly controlled ornaments is so pervasive that it’s often equated with classic country style. This box holds Frizzell’s entire career, from early demos to his first hit — the 1950 country standard “If You’ve Got the Money (I’ve Got the Time)” — and all of his studio recordings, along with songs recorded for radio broadcast and an eight-CD audiobook biography by Lefty’s brother David Frizzell. Lefty Frizzell was a hard drinker — another subject he sang about — but his aplomb rarely faltered; his decline becomes audible only in some 1970s songs. From the 1950s, when he wrote most of his own material, through the 1960s and 1970s, when he largely relied on other songwriters, long stretches of his catalog are anatomies of melancholy, jealous, bitterness and regret. PARELES DEBEN BHATTACHARYA: ‘PARIS TO CALCUTTA: MEN AND MUSIC ON THE DESERT ROAD’ Sublime Frequencies; 4 CDs and hard-bound book, $65.99 This is a travel diary from 1955, in prose and audio, by Deben Bhattacharya, an Indian writer-turned-ethnomusicologist who made a trip by van from the Bosporus to Bengal with a tape recorder: through Greece, Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan and India. A single LP from these recordings was released in 1956 as “Music on the Desert Road: A Sound Travelogue,” an album that left an impression on Frank Zappa, among others. Bhattacharya recorded professionals and amateurs performing classical and folk, secular and religious music, as well as Bedouin workers rhythmically grinding coffee and a ninth-century Persian epic poem intoned, with drumming, to pace an exercise routine. Bhattacharya’s journals are atmospheric period pieces, and his field recordings are mono but vivid and often raw, capturing music that was far more geographically and culturally isolated back in 1955. PARELES LINDSEY BUCKINGHAM: ‘SOLO ANTHOLOGY’ Rhino; 3 CDs, $29.99; 6 LPs, $119.99; 1 CD, $9.99 It’s still startling that Fleetwood Mac toured in 2018 without Lindsey Buckingham, the guitarist and songwriter whose complex sparkling guitar parts and melodic architecture were absolutely essential to the band’s sudden 1970s superstardom; his guitar solos were onstage climaxes. Buckingham’s solo recordings can play like research and development for his contributions to Fleetwood Mac — a virtuoso on his days off. He toys with guitar tones and production strategies; he takes more liberties with his vocals; he leaves things less glossy. And while Fleetwood Mac may have commandeered most of his poppiest hooks, he kept some for himself including “Trouble” and “Holiday Road.” The three-CD and six-LP configurations include two previously unreleased songs and more than a dozen live band performances. PARELES ‘THE ART ENSEMBLE OF CHICAGO AND ASSOCIATED ENSEMBLES’ ECM; 21 CDs, 300-page book, $108.98 The Art Ensemble of Chicago — a trailblazing group equally dedicated to minimalism and excursion, Pan-African folklore and avant-garde improvising — had been around for about a decade when it began releasing albums on ECM in 1978. The German label recorded the ensemble with an ear for detail and depth, making sure each vibraphone chime and trumpet slash came through with distinction, and fed into a spacious sound. This monumental box collects the Art Ensemble’s albums from the late 1970s and ’80s, plus group members’ various other ECM projects over the years, including some of the trumpeter Lester Bowie’s standout albums with Brass Fantasy and a number of the saxophonist Roscoe Mitchell’s finest recordings under his own name. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO JOHN COLTRANE: ‘1963: NEW DIRECTIONS’ Impulse!; 5 LPs, 16-page booklet, $149.98; 3 CDs, 20-page booklet, $29.98 In 1963, John Coltrane was about halfway into the avant-garde, pushing against an acoustic-jazz paradigm that he had seemed to master (his working quartet then was arguably the greatest in jazz history), and exploding the advanced harmonic systems he’d fashioned for himself. “1963: New Directions” includes every known track Coltrane recorded for Impulse! that fateful year, including the newly discovered recordings that were released in June as “Both Directions at Once;” his album with the vocalist Johnny Hartman; and landmark live albums from the Newport Jazz Festival and the club Birdland. RUSSONELLO VARIOUS ARTISTS: ‘NEWVELLE RECORDS, THIRD SEASON’ Newvelle Records; 6 LPs, $400 With Newvelle, the only way to play ball is to buy season tickets. This high-end label puts out six handsomely packaged albums a year — not reissues, but new music — and they’re not available à la carte. You can buy the entire 2018 set — Newvelle’s third season — now, or sign up to start receiving the 2019 albums, one by one, every two months. All of Newvelle’s recordings are out only on vinyl, and cannot be streamed anywhere. The packaging is part of the appeal: This year’s collection features abstract, irradiant artwork on each album cover by the Polish photographer Maciej Markowicz, and short fiction on each sleeve by Ingrid Astier. But the real reason to spring for this collection is the smartly chosen roster of talent and the rich, analog sound of the recordings. Season 3 includes enrapturing albums by some of jazz’s great lesser-known talents, such as the drummer Francisco Mela, the Icelandic bassist Skuli Sverrisson (in a glass-darkly duo with the guitarist Bill Frisell), and the trumpeter Jason Palmer.

2018,The Yoda of Silicon Valley,"Profiles in science Donald Knuth, master of algorithms, reflects on 50 years of his opus-in-progress, “The Art of Computer Programming.” Donald Knuth at his home in Stanford, Calif. He is a notorious perfectionist and has offered 
to pay a reward to anyone who finds a mistake in any of his books. CreditCreditBrian Flaherty for The New York Times For half a century, the Stanford computer scientist Donald Knuth, who bears a slight resemblance to Yoda — albeit standing 6-foot-4 and wearing glasses — has reigned as the spirit-guide of the algorithmic realm. He is the author of “The Art of Computer Programming,” a continuing four-volume opus that is his life’s work. The first volume debuted in 1968, and the collected volumes (sold as a boxed set for about $250) were included by American Scientist in 2013 on its list of books that shaped the last century of science — alongside a special edition of “The Autobiography of Charles Darwin,” Tom Wolfe’s “The Right Stuff,” Rachel Carson’s “Silent Spring” and monographs by Albert Einstein, John von Neumann and Richard Feynman. With more than one million copies in print, “The Art of Computer Programming” is the Bible of its field. “Like an actual bible, it is long and comprehensive; no other book is as comprehensive,” said Peter Norvig, a director of research at Google. After 652 pages, volume one closes with a blurb on the back cover from Bill Gates: “You should definitely send me a résumé if you can read the whole thing.” The volume opens with an excerpt from “McCall’s Cookbook”: Here is your book, the one your thousands of letters have asked us to publish. It has taken us years to do, checking and rechecking countless recipes to bring you only the best, only the interesting, only the perfect. Inside are algorithms, the recipes that feed the digital age — although, as Dr. Knuth likes to point out, algorithms can also be found on Babylonian tablets from 3,800 years ago. He is an esteemed algorithmist; his name is attached to some of the field’s most important specimens, such as the Knuth-Morris-Pratt string-searching algorithm. Devised in 1970, it finds all occurrences of a given word or pattern of letters in a text — for instance, when you hit Command+F to search for a keyword in a document. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Now 80, Dr. Knuth usually dresses like the youthful geek he was when he embarked on this odyssey: long-sleeved T-shirt under a short-sleeved T-shirt, with jeans, at least at this time of year. In those early days, he worked close to the machine, writing “in the raw,” tinkering with the zeros and ones. “Knuth made it clear that the system could actually be understood all the way down to the machine code level,” said Dr. Norvig. Nowadays, of course, with algorithms masterminding (and undermining) our very existence, the average programmer no longer has time to manipulate the binary muck, and works instead with hierarchies of abstraction, layers upon layers of code — and often with chains of code borrowed from code libraries. But an elite class of engineers occasionally still does the deep dive. “Here at Google, sometimes we just throw stuff together,” Dr. Norvig said, during a meeting of the Google Trips team, in Mountain View, Calif. “But other times, if you’re serving billions of users, it’s important to do that efficiently. A 10-per-cent improvement in efficiency can work out to billions of dollars, and in order to get that last level of efficiency, you have to understand what’s going on all the way down.” Or, as Andrei Broder, a distinguished scientist at Google and one of Dr. Knuth’s former graduate students, explained during the meeting: “We want to have some theoretical basis for what we’re doing. We don’t want a frivolous or sloppy or second-rate algorithm. We don’t want some other algorithmist to say, ‘You guys are morons.’” The Google Trips app, created in 2016, is an “orienteering algorithm” that maps out a day’s worth of recommended touristy activities. The team was working on “maximizing the quality of the worst day” — for instance, avoiding sending the user back to the same neighborhood to see different sites. They drew inspiration from a 300-year-old algorithm by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, who wanted to map a route through the Prussian city of Königsberg that would cross each of its seven bridges only once. Dr. Knuth addresses Euler’s classic problem in the first volume of his treatise. (He once applied Euler’s method in coding a computer-controlled sewing machine.) Following Dr. Knuth’s doctrine helps to ward off moronry. He is known for introducing the notion of “literate programming,” emphasizing the importance of writing code that is readable by humans as well as computers — a notion that nowadays seems almost twee. Dr. Knuth has gone so far as to argue that some computer programs are, like Elizabeth Bishop’s poems and Philip Roth’s “American Pastoral,” works of literature worthy of a Pulitzer. He is also a notorious perfectionist. Randall Munroe, the xkcd cartoonist and author of “Thing Explainer,” first learned about Dr. Knuth from computer-science people who mentioned the reward money Dr. Knuth pays to anyone who finds a mistake in any of his books. As Mr. Munroe recalled, “People talked about getting one of those checks as if it was computer science’s Nobel Prize.” Dr. Knuth’s exacting standards, literary and otherwise, may explain why his life’s work is nowhere near done. He has a wager with Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google and a former student (to use the term loosely), over whether Mr. Brin will finish his Ph.D. before Dr. Knuth concludes his opus. At age 19, Dr. Knuth published his first technical paper, “The Potrzebie System of Weights and Measures,” in Mad magazine. He became a computer scientist before the discipline existed, studying mathematics at what is now Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. He looked at sample programs for the school’s IBM 650 mainframe, a decimal computer, and, noticing some inadequacies, rewrote the software as well as the textbook used in class. As a side project, he ran stats for the basketball team, writing a computer program that helped them win their league — and earned a segment by Walter Cronkite called “The Electronic Coach.” During summer vacations, Dr. Knuth made more money than professors earned in a year by writing compilers. A compiler is like a translator, converting a high-level programming language (resembling algebra) to a lower-level one (sometimes arcane binary) and, ideally, improving it in the process. In computer science, “optimization” is truly an art, and this is articulated in another Knuthian proverb: “Premature optimization is the root of all evil.” Eventually Dr. Knuth became a compiler himself, inadvertently founding a new field that he came to call the “analysis of algorithms.” A publisher hired him to write a book about compilers, but it evolved into a book collecting everything he knew about how to write for computers — a book about algorithms. “By the time of the Renaissance, the origin of this word was in doubt,” it began. “And early linguists attempted to guess at its derivation by making combinations like algiros [painful] + arithmos [number].’” In fact, Dr. Knuth continued, the namesake is the 9th-century Persian textbook author Abū ‘Abd Allāh Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī, Latinized as Algorithmi. Never one for half measures, Dr. Knuth went on a pilgrimage in 1979 to al-Khwārizmī’s ancestral homeland in Uzbekistan. When Dr. Knuth started out, he intended to write a single work. Soon after, computer science underwent its Big Bang, so he reimagined and recast the project in seven volumes. Now he metes out sub-volumes, called fascicles. The next installation, “Volume 4, Fascicle 5,” covering, among other things, “backtracking” and “dancing links,” was meant to be published in time for Christmas. It is delayed until next April because he keeps finding more and more irresistible problems that he wants to present. In order to optimize his chances of getting to the end, Dr. Knuth has long guarded his time. He retired at 55, restricted his public engagements and quit email (officially, at least). Andrei Broder recalled that time management was his professor’s defining characteristic even in the early 1980s. Dr. Knuth typically held student appointments on Friday mornings, until he started spending his nights in the lab of John McCarthy, a founder of artificial intelligence, to get access to the computers when they were free. Horrified by what his beloved book looked like on the page with the advent of digital publishing, Dr. Knuth had gone on a mission to create the TeX computer typesetting system, which remains the gold standard for all forms of scientific communication and publication. Some consider it Dr. Knuth’s greatest contribution to the world, and the greatest contribution to typography since Gutenberg. This decade-long detour took place back in the age when computers were shared among users and ran faster at night while most humans slept. So Dr. Knuth switched day into night, shifted his schedule by 12 hours and mapped his student appointments to Fridays from 8 p.m. to midnight. Dr. Broder recalled, “When I told my girlfriend that we can’t do anything Friday night because Friday night at 10 I have to meet with my adviser, she thought, ‘This is something that is so stupid it must be true.’” When Knuth chooses to be physically present, however, he is 100-per-cent there in the moment. “It just makes you happy to be around him,” said Jennifer Chayes, a managing director of Microsoft Research. “He’s a maximum in the community. If you had an optimization function that was in some way a combination of warmth and depth, Don would be it.” Dr. Knuth lives in Stanford, and allowed for a Sunday visitor. That he spared an entire day was exceptional — usually his availability is “modulo nap time,” a sacred daily ritual from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. He started early, at Palo Alto’s First Lutheran Church, where he delivered a Sunday school lesson to a standing-room-only crowd. Driving home, he got philosophical about mathematics. “I’ll never know everything,” he said. “My life would be a lot worse if there was nothing I knew the answers about, and if there was nothing I didn’t know the answers about.” Then he offered a tour of his “California modern” house, which he and his wife, Jill, built in 1970. His office is littered with piles of U.S.B. sticks and adorned with Valentine’s Day heart art from Jill, a graphic designer. Most impressive is the music room, built around his custom-made, 812-pipe pipe organ. The day ended over beer at a puzzle party. Puzzles and games — and penning a novella about surreal numbers, and composing a 90-minute multimedia musical pipe-dream, “Fantasia Apocalyptica” — are the sorts of things that really tickle him. One section of his book is titled, “Puzzles Versus the Real World.” He emailed an excerpt to the father-son team of Martin Demaine, an artist, and Erik Demaine, a computer scientist, both at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, because Dr. Knuth had included their “algorithmic puzzle fonts.” “I was thrilled,” said Erik Demaine. “It’s an honor to be in the book.” He mentioned another Knuth quotation, which serves as the inspirational motto for the biannual “FUN with Algorithms” conference: “Pleasure has probably been the main goal all along.” But then, Dr. Demaine said, the field went and got practical. Engineers and scientists and artists are teaming up to solve real-world problems — protein folding, robotics, airbags — using the Demaines’s mathematical origami designs for how to fold paper and linkages into different shapes. Of course, all the algorithmic rigmarole is also causing real-world problems. Algorithms written by humans — tackling harder and harder problems, but producing code embedded with bugs and biases — are troubling enough. More worrisome, perhaps, are the algorithms that are not written by humans, algorithms written by the machine, as it learns. Programmers still train the machine, and, crucially, feed it data. (Data is the new domain of biases and bugs, and here the bugs and biases are harder to find and fix). However, as Kevin Slavin, a research affiliate at M.I.T.’s Media Lab said, “We are now writing algorithms we cannot read. That makes this a unique moment in history, in that we are subject to ideas and actions and efforts by a set of physics that have human origins without human comprehension.” As Slavin has often noted, “It’s a bright future, if you’re an algorithm.” All the more so if you’re an algorithm versed in Knuth. “Today, programmers use stuff that Knuth, and others, have done as components of their algorithms, and then they combine that together with all the other stuff they need,” said Google’s Dr. Norvig. “With A.I., we have the same thing. It’s just that the combining-together part will be done automatically, based on the data, rather than based on a programmer’s work. You want A.I. to be able to combine components to get a good answer based on the data. But you have to decide what those components are. It could happen that each component is a page or chapter out of Knuth, because that’s the best possible way to do some task.” Lucky, then, Dr. Knuth keeps at it. He figures it will take another 25 years to finish “The Art of Computer Programming,” although that time frame has been a constant since about 1980. Might the algorithm-writing algorithms get their own chapter, or maybe a page in the epilogue? “Definitely not,” said Dr. Knuth. “I am worried that algorithms are getting too prominent in the world,” he added. “It started out that computer scientists were worried nobody was listening to us. Now I’m worried that too many people are listening.”",The New York Times
2018,The ‘Funky Soulfulness’ of New York’s Immigrant Nativity Scenes,"The presepio is to Italians what the Christmas tree is to Germans. And the legacy of Italian immigrants is on display all over the city this time of year. It was the Sunday after Thanksgiving, and Joseph Sciorra was ready to build his presepio in his Williamsburg apartment. A Styrofoam base was in place on a small table in the corner of the kitchen. There were plastic containers and tape and nails and dried bunches of herbs to serve as vegetation. This year, his presepio — an elaborate Nativity and village scene traditionally built by Italians during Christmastime — would contain a pond, a stream and a waterfall for the first time. But just as he was starting to build, disaster struck. His pump broke. These tiny pumps, crucial for the waterfall, are an integral part of dozens of homemade presepi in New York City. The presepio — which originated in the 13th century in Rome — is to Italians what the Christmas tree is to Germans and Santa is to Americans. New Yorkers might be familiar with the presepio under the Christmas tree at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, a classical Neapolitan Baroque crèche. But to see the authentic, paisan versions Italian immigrants brought with them, you need to venture to neighborhoods like Ozone Park in Queens or Carroll Gardens in Brooklyn. “Everybody has a different method how they do it,” said Mr. Sciorra, 63. “There’s a funky soulfulness to the ones built here in New York City. They’re all very personalized.” Mr. Sciorra — director of cultural programming at the Calandra Institute at CUNY who has written about presepi in his book, “Built With Faith” — met with several maestri of the folk art tradition this fall to get tips on how to integrate water into his own mountain landscape. His first stop was in Ozone Park, Queens, where he met with Harris Taormina, who has built presepi for 55 years. His main presepio sits in his garage behind a window for the neighborhood to enjoy. Each winter, he goes through four or five gallons of blue antifreeze to keep the water flowing in cold weather. The water runs through an incredibly detailed village with hundreds of figures and farm animals. The daily life of Italians — the woman scrubbing her clothes in the stream, the man selling sausages, the shoemaker, the potter, the Sicilian cart drivers — are all mixed in with the holy family, the three kings, Herod and a line of Roman soldiers. Mr. Taormina, 79, a retired stockbroker, built his first presepio under the family Christmas tree in Queens when he was a boy, alongside his father. His wife’s family also built presepi when she was growing up in Italy. “I remember my brothers going to the woods to find the holly and the moss,” said his wife, Gilda Castiello. Her father and grandfather passed down their antique figures to Mr. Taormina, which he now incorporates into a second presepio he makes to go underneath the tree — like the one he and his father used to build. Neighbors and passers-by stop to gaze at the garage presepio, which is lit up throughout the season. “There used to be a lot of Italians around here,” Mr. Taormina said. “But now the Muslims come to see it and the Chinese and the Polish people. They all love it. There’s only one God.” Back in Brooklyn, 74-year-old John Miniero uses cork to build his own rugged landscape, houses and waterways in his presepio, which sits in a hand-built display outside his home in Dyker Heights. He doesn’t use antifreeze; he says it clogs the pump. Mr. Miniero, who lived on the Italian coast in Sorrento until he was 12, watched his father build the family presepio with fig branches and papier-mâché. Twenty years ago, Mr. Miniero started building his own in his Dyker Heights bakery, but when he retired, he put it outside his house and covered it in plexiglass. Some admirers stick money in the windowpane as a tribute. He’s constantly searching for his building blocks. “I look in the garbage — everywhere,” he said, laughing. “I must have spent hundreds of dollars in the dollar store.” A friend brings him moss from upstate when he goes hunting. Now and then, he buys more formal pieces from Fontanini, an Italian company that specializes in presepi. Every year, his outdoor setup changes a little. For 2018, he has incorporated a scene from the Amalfi Coast, adding a handful of fishermen and boats which he bought in Italy last August. He uses mirrors to add depth and make it seem as if his caverns go deep. “People say I’m an artist, but no,” he said, shaking his head. “Kids do it in Italy. It’s a dime a dozen.” Gianvito Bottalico, a retired M.T.A. employee who creates his own presepi in Bensonhurst, remembers building his first when he was a boy with his father inside an empty grape crate and hanging it on the wall in their home in Mola di Bari, on the Adriatic Coast. They used plastic, paper cutouts, cotton balls, whatever they could scrounge up. Flour mixed with water served as glue. “If we had a nickel to put together we would get a statue,” said Mr. Bottalico, 70, who came to America at age 19. Each year, he builds a presepio for the Federation of Italian-American Organizations on 18th Avenue and one for the Knights of Columbus on 85th Street. His personal presepio is built on the piano in his living room and still features basic materials: brown packing paper for the mountainside, milk cartons for houses, dried grape vines, cat litter. “When I put junk together, I create a place,” Mr. Bottalico said. “Now I exist.” He had a suggestion for Mr. Sciorra’s waterfall: use two-liter plastic bottles. In Williamsburg, the bottles were on Mr. Sciorra’s kitchen table, cut and ready to go. Mr. Sciorra’s father from Carunchio carried the tradition to Brooklyn in the 1950s, incorporating not only the holy family but a lion, zebra and crocodile. “It was his own creation,” said Mr. Sciorra. “It was my first sense it wasn’t just the Nativity scene.” Presepio builders in Italy sometimes incorporate political themes. Last year, Mr. Sciorra dabbled with that idea, making a scene with President Trump, same sex married couples and a border wall. After 9/11, he built a miniature Tora Bora and during the Iraq War, he built a battle scene with burned-out buildings and an angel parachuting in. The centerpiece for this year’s presepio, Mr. Sciorra’s 19th, will be the waterfall. Besides the plastic bottles, he will work with slate given to him by his brother and tree branches, which had been stored in his car. “The idea is to keep it fresh and new,” he said. Once there is a finished product, Mr. Sciorra usually has a viewing party for family and friends. “People bring friends and it’s like, ‘Who the hell is that person taking a picture of my presepio?’” he said, laughing. “It can get out of control. But it’s kind of fun.”",The New York Times
2018,The ‘Godfather of Animated Cinema’ Makes More Than Just Movies,"AMSTERDAM — The Czech master of Surrealist cinema, Jan Svankmajer, is revered by animators for his stop-motion movies that are by turns absurd, grotesque, erotic and horrific. In his short film “Lunch,” from the 1992 series “Food,” two restaurant patrons, ignored by a waiter, devour everything in sight: napkins, plates, cups, their own clothes and, ultimately, each other. In “Little Otik,” a feature film from 2000 based on a Czech fairy tale, a childless couple adopts a tree stump, which comes to life but then turns homicidal. How to interpret these darkly comic narratives? For a time during the 1970s, the Communist government of Czechoslovakia banned Mr. Svankmajer (pronounced SHVUNK-myer) from filmmaking, because they saw his movies as subversive. In an interview in Amsterdam last week, he said that this was “no tragedy” for him, because he always had been a multidimensional artist, and he used the hiatus as a time to work on his other creative project: Surrealist sculpture, lithographs, writing and drawing. These artworks, created while Mr. Svankmajer was unable to make films, are one of the most intriguing aspects of a new exhibition at the Eye Filmmuseum here, running through March 3. “Jan Svankmajer: The Alchemical Wedding” presents around 250 extraordinary artworks that give a glimpse into Mr. Svankmajer’s wild imagination. These are displayed alongside a dozen of his short films on large screens in its exhibition hall. The museum is also screening feature-length films such as “Alice” (1987), “Faust” (1994) and his most recent, “Insect,” released this year in a cinema program. “There are a lot of big names like Tim Burton, Terry Gilliam and the Brothers Quay for whom Jan Svankmajer is really the godfather of animated cinema,” said Jaap Guldemond, director of exhibitions at the Eye Filmmuseum. “Filmmakers know him, but the general public has no idea who Mr. Svankmajer is.” Mr. Guldemond visited Mr. Svankmajer’s studio outside Prague and his 18th-century country house in the Bohemian Forest, and said he was overwhelmed by the sheer abundance of artworks Mr. Svankmajer had created over his 50-year career. “There were piles of hundreds of his etchings and collages, and hundreds of sculptures, and we could choose what we wanted,” Mr. Guldemond said. “We didn’t have to get it from all kinds of different museums and collectors. It was just all there.” Mr. Svankmajer was born in 1934, and was 13 when Czechoslovakia came under Communist rule. He studied theater directing and puppeteering, and worked at the Semafor playhouse in Prague before joining the Laterna Magika, an experimental company sometimes called the world’s first multimedia theater. In the 1960s, he joined the Czech Surrealist Group and applied its principles to his art. “The audiences were leaving my productions disgusted,” he said, because they couldn’t understand the avant-garde aesthetics. “That was when I realized that cinema is like a kind of time capsule, like a can where you can preserve a stage production and wait for the viewer,” he said. “I decided to focus on using the language of cinema.” But making films in the Czech studio system meant that Mr. Svankmajer had to submit his proposals for approval, then submit the scripts, then the final film, and the censors could always reject the film at any stage. In 1974, after his film “Leonardo’s Diary” was presented at the Cannes Film Festival, his work was condemned by a pro-government newspaper. The movie he was working on at the time, “Castle of Otranto,” came under greater scrutiny, and censors demanded he make many changes. Mr. Svankmajer refused and as a result was banned from filmmaking. He could not finish his movie until 1979 when the prohibition was lifted. “I never was a political artist,” Mr. Svankmajer said “but I am an engaged artist, because Surrealism was always an engaged art. The idea of Surrealism is to change the world — that’s Marx — and to transform life — that’s Rimbaud,” he added, referring to the 19th century French poet. Mr. Svankmajer’s films combine many animation techniques, including claymation, drawn animation, montage, puppetry and stop-motion, sometimes using actors for live-action as well. He often darkens the mood by incorporating exaggerated sounds, like high-volume slurping or chewing, or juxtaposing lilting classical music over unsettling images. Many of Mr. Svankmajer’s two- and three-dimensional artworks are also based on this form of collage and assemblage, cutting and pasting. They include illustrations in books onto which he’s pasted images of eyes or genitals, or cut-up anatomical and scientific drawings with mismatched parts arranged in new configurations. His sculptures are fantastical animal amalgams, made from taxidermy, bones, fins, shells, horns or skulls combined into strange, hybrid creatures. “When I arrive in the studio and there’s this pile of bones and stuffed things and natural objects, I know that the beast is in there and I just need to find it,” Mr. Svankmajer said. “That’s the adventure.” The exhibition in Amsterdam also includes artworks created in the last decade or so. A series of “medium drawings,” Mr. Svankmajer said, were created recently by his wife, the Surrealist painter Eva Svankmajerova, even though she died in 2005. He has built himself a spiritualist chamber called the psychomanteum, where he looks into a mirror, summons her spirit and allows her to draw using his hands, he explained. Mr. Svankmajer remained straight-faced as he said this. “Of course, I don’t believe in ghosts,” he added. “This is a communication with my subconscious.” Mr. Svankmajer, 84, said he felt fortunate that he has been able to produce so much work over the years, and that he could do so now in the Czech Republic, without concerns about censorship. He still goes to his studio four days a week, where he’s currently working on a new series of lithographs and finishing up a novel that will be released in 2019, he said. He’s also completing a group of sculptures he calls “fractures,” which are made from bones, found objects and “discarded articles of daily use,” held together with bandages. “Fractures,” could be an apt title for Mr. Svankmajer’s life’s work, a process of breaking things apart and bandaging them back together as something else. Under communism, he said, “you had these waves of the grip being relaxed and the grip tightening, and I was lucky enough to have experienced two waves of relaxation of the regime,” he said. “I was unlucky enough to catch one wave of the tightening.” Asked how he thinks the censorship impacted his career as a filmmaker, he shrugged. “It turns out I was at my most productive period,” he said. When the authorities allowed him to make films again, he had “all these scripts and ideas.” “So in a sense you can even take advantage of the totalitarian system,” he said. “Provided that it collapses in the end.”",The New York Times
2018,The ‘It’ ’80s Party Girl Is Now a Defender of the Catholic Faith,"The Saturday Profile REGENSBURG, Germany — Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis breezed through her 500-room German palace, keys in hand and a bracelet of rubies and a Virgin Mary charm on her wrist. She stopped to admire the ornate chapel where her great-grandmother-in-law Crown Princess Helene had died in bed and where her friend Benedict XVI, the pope emeritus, once said Mass. Then she headed down to the medieval cloister where she preferred to say her daily prayers. In the crypt chapel, the diminutive, chatty and ebullient princess went silent as she removed her rose-tinted designer glasses, knelt in her Comme des Garçons pants on the upholstered kneeler and solemnly pressed her forehead against her laced fingers. Colored light poured in through the six stained glass windows and onto the 58-year-old’s checked Yves Saint Laurent jacket as Msgr. Wilhelm Imkamp, a conservative prelate once touted by conservatives as a potential archbishop of Berlin, offered his lone parishioner communion. The soles of her Hermès shoes — as white as the altar’s Carrara marble Jesus — faced the grating above the crypt where her deceased husband and his noble family’s ancestors lay in polished coffins. “Amen,” she said. Princess Gloria — once christened “Princess TNT” for her explosive years as a hard partying, art-collecting, punk-haired aristocrat — has grown into the sun queen around which many traditionalist Roman Catholics opposed to Pope Francis orbit. Her Regensburg castle is a potential “Gladiator School” for conservative Catholics on a crusade to preserve church traditions. Her Roman palace overlooking the ancient forum is a preferred salon for opposition cardinals, bitter bishops and populists like Stephen K. Bannon. Many of them are hoping to use the sex abuse crisis that amounts to the greatest existential threat to the church in centuries to topple the 81-year-old pontiff, who they are convinced is destroying the faith. Princess Gloria, who is close with Hillary Clinton, the former Vogue editor André Leon Talley and celebrities like Quincy Jones, rejected any suggestion that she was running a secret society out of her palaces, where she said she provided an open house in which a visitor could meet a “transvestite or a nun.” She said she thought the pope was “trying his level best,” but added with a laugh, he just “doesn’t sing my favorite hits first.” She argued that instead of the pope’s emphasis on inclusion, the church needed to honor its laws and doctrines and undergo a spiritual conversion, much like she had undergone when her husband died nearly 30 years ago, to a more missionary and orthodox belief. “We need to fight for the church,” she said, adding that Benedict had instilled in her the desire to “fight for the faith — not only to save the tradition, to save the faith, but also to fulfill your duties.” The princess sees her responsibility as feeding hundreds of hungry people in her refectory every day and being supportive of increasingly isolated priests. But some of the priests in her court have answered the call of duty by going to war. In August, Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò published a letter accusing Francis of covering up abuse. His charges have so far proved unsubstantiated, but Princess Gloria called him a “whistle-blower.” She recalled a “fabulous conversation” she had with him over the summer at a dinner party at the Rome residence of Cardinal James Harvey, an American and fellow archconservative. The evening was sponsored by the Napa Institute, a wealthy conservative American Catholic group run by Timothy Busch, who sits on the board of the conservative Catholic media outlets that published Archbishop Viganò’s letter. She said she did not talk with Archbishop Viganò about his bombshell letter, but hoped it would be “a wake-up call for the church.” Later that month, Archbishop Viganò sent a letter to his friend Cardinal Raymond Burke, the American leader of the anti-Francis resistance, regretting that he could not attend the cardinal’s birthday party at a Tuscan seminary. The reason, Princess Gloria explained, was that he was in hiding. “He had a good excuse,” she said. Still, it was a shame because it was a great party. Cardinal Burke — as close to her, she said, as a “family priest” — ate birthday cake in the shape of a red cardinal’s hat, held champagne in one glass and blessed seminarians with the other, and watched fireworks light up the sky in his honor. “The good people know how to party,” she said with a laugh, adding that Cardinal Burke deserved it, “because he’s been so persecuted.” Several of Princess Gloria’s close friends have had a rough time under Pope Francis. Last year, the pope fired Gerhard Ludwig Müller, the German cardinal and critic who was the church’s doctrinal watchdog. At her Rome palace, she introduced the cardinal to Mr. Bannon, who subsequently invited the German to his Washington headquarters, better known as the Breitbart Embassy. Mr. Bannon, who has become close to Cardinal Burke, himself sees the pope as a destructive force in the church. He envisions a Gladiator School for the theological and media training of right-wing Catholics hostile to Francis. And he has sought to persuade the princess to invest in it at a monastery in the town of Trisulti, nearly two hours outside Rome, that is operated by Dignitatis Humanae Institute, an anti-abortion group run by his friend Benjamin Harnwell. Cardinal Burke is the president of its advisory board. In a recent interview, Mr. Bannon said that he sensed a tipping point for a church besieged by crisis, and that his plan was to use Princess Gloria’s castle in Regensburg for a summer school while other prominent Catholic donors would fund the Trisulti project. Asked whether Princess Gloria was among those prominent donors, he raised a knowing eyebrow and said, “I cannot disclose any of the donors.” He acknowledged in a subsequent interview that he and Mr. Harnwell were “looking at a place” at the foot of St. Peter’s Basilica in Vatican City as a base for his political movement to elect populist politicians across Europe. “But it may also be the local beachhead of the Gladiator School,” he said. Princess Gloria said she welcomed Mr. Bannon’s contributions to the orthodox movement and found him to be an excellent communicator, political strategist and “Hollywood guy.” But she made it clear that she wasn’t cutting any checks. “We all want great things, but who is going to pay for it?” Princess Gloria, wearing a string of mothball sized pearls, asked rhetorically. She ridiculed the possibility of investing $100 million to turn the monastery, where she was horrified to encounter a colony of bats, into a school. “Sometimes men are dreamers and we women are more practical,” she said. “That’s why I said, ‘Great idea, start small.’” (Mr. Bannon said Friday he hoped to launch a small “prototype” course in the spring. He credited Princess Gloria as “a key player in Rome” and added he had not asked her to donate “given her already enormous support for the traditionalist Catholic project in Rome.”) But before Mr. Bannon helped the cause, Princess Gloria suggested, he first needed to get his own spiritual house in order. “I’m there to help, but I’m very strict and I say: ‘O.K., let’s go to church first. Change your life,’” she said. Asked specifically whether she meant she wanted Mr. Bannon to regularly attend church before he tried to fix it, she smiled. “I want to see all of my friends be faithful Catholics first. And then we can start.” Princess Gloria speaks from experience. Despite being raised a Catholic who spent summers with her grand aunt, a Benedictine nun, in the Black Forest, as a young woman she was less than serious about religion. At 19, the young aristocrat met the 11th Prince of Thurn und Taxis, the 53-year-old Johannes, before a Supertramp concert in Munich. In 1980, she married the eccentric and bisexual nobleman, whose family made a fortune as the postal service for the Holy Roman Empire. She then became the It Imperial Girl of the ’80s, hanging out in the clubs with Mick Jagger, Andy Warhol (he “went to church every day,” she says) and really anyone else you can think of. In 1990, her husband died, leaving her as a young widow and mother of three with hundreds of millions of dollars in debt. She got herself a business education, took the ancestral palace public, auctioned off the silver, jewels, wine and some of the art, and saved the family’s fortune. She credits the turnaround to “the grace of God” that convinced her “that I have to give something back.” She became more devout and befriended clergy, including Joseph Ratzinger, the future pope Benedict. But she was far from cloistered. She remained a New York high-society staple who this year celebrated Oktoberfest with the Clintons and was one of the roughly dozen women to attend Mrs. Clinton’s pre-2016 Election Day birthday party. (“A great woman,” the princess said, declining to share details. “It’s too early, in 10 years.”) And Princess Gloria still likes to go fast. In a golf cart (though not “the Rolls Royce of golf carts,” which she keeps in Rome), she zipped around the lush gardens, the medieval rectory where she feeds the poor, the stately courtyards and the recently refurbished wings of her castle. She said that if a local university were game to foot the bill, her place would make far better classrooms for a Gladiator School than a cold monastery outside Rome. “You see these, there is plenty of space for a school here,” she said. “And it’s heated!”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | The ‘Next America’,"How do we govern in the age that will begin with the 2020 election? Opinion Columnist I have this feeling that the 2020 presidential election in the United States will be unlike any in my lifetime — and not only because it will likely involve Donald Trump running as an incumbent — he alone is a one-man, three-ring circus — but also because the huge issue that should have been the focus of the 2016 election will be unavoidable by 2020. That is: How do we govern the “Next America’’? “You know William Gibson’s line, ‘The future is already here, it’s just not evenly distributed’? Well, the future is here, and now it’s starting to really get distributed. This is the Next America. But our institutions and political parties have not adapted to it,’’ Gautam Mukunda, a Harvard Kennedy School Research Fellow and the author of “Indispensable: When Leaders Really Matter,’’ remarked in an interview. By 2020, it will be impossible to ignore the Next America. “The basic premises of how the economy works have shifted under our feet and the government will have to respond.’’ This Next America will raise a whole web of new intertwined policy, legal, moral, ethical and privacy issues because of changes in technology, demographics, the environment and globalization that are reaching critical mass. Where do I start? A good place is with 5G — fifth-generation wireless systems. With the two telecom giants Verizon and AT&T now beginning to deploy 5G technology across the country, the metabolism of business, entertainment, education and health care will dramatically accelerate in the Next America, beginning around … 2020. Getting the most from artificial intelligence and machine learning — like deploying self-driving vehicles — requires quickly transmitting massive amounts of data with very low latency. We will have that capacity in the Next America. With 5G, a Hollywood movie that now takes six or seven minutes to download onto your iPad will take six or seven seconds and microsensors in your shirt will gather intelligence and broadcast vital signs to your doctor. As AT&T notes in one of its 5G ads, “Think of this as the next frontier in untethering, giving you the ability to take the ultrafast experience you have in your home or business with you virtually anywhere.’’ It could be as revolutionary as the internet. But it will require all kinds of new regulations to govern applications from self-driving cars to drone delivery systems to robots that will work as security guards and home health aides. An Associated Press report on Monday said that the government estimated there were currently “about 110,000 commercial drones operating in U. S. airspace, and the number is expected to soar to about 450,000 in 2022.’’ All of this new technology will have important implications for the education-to-work pipeline. My friend Heather E. McGowan, a future-of-work strategist, puts it this way: “The old model of work was three life blocks: Get an education. Use that education for 40 years. And then retire. We then made the faulty assumption that the next new model would be: Get an education. Use it for 20 years. Then get retrained. Then use that for 20 more years and then retire.’’ But in fact, in the Next America, argues McGowan, the right model will be “continuous lifelong learning’’ — because when the pace of change is accelerating, “the fastest-growing companies and most resilient workers will be those who learn faster than their competition.” That means that in addition to our traditional big safety nets — Social Security and Medicare — we will need new national trampolines. We will need to make some level of postsecondary education free to every American who meets a minimum grade and attendance requirement, so that every adult and every high school graduate can earn an associate degree or technical certificate free of tuition at a community college at any time. Tennessee has already done that. These same technological transformations mean the Next America will require changes in antitrust policy. Since the 1980s, antitrust policy judged if a company was getting too big largely by one question: Was the loss of competition hurting consumers through higher prices or fewer services? “But that definition is increasingly irrelevant in an age in which the most powerful companies in the world offer products and services for ‘free’ in exchange for personal data,” Rana Foroohar, the Financial Times technology columnist, noted in a June 24 essay. “This has provoked calls for a return to the definition of monopoly in the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act, which emphasizes the need to ensure that the economic power of large companies does not result in the corruption of the political process.’’ That’s because we are more than consumers, “we’re citizens,’’ notes Mukunda, “We have interests that stretch far beyond consumer pricing, and it’s the job of the government to protect citizens’ liberty, not just consumers’ interests. It says so right in the Constitution, and we’ve forgotten that.’’ Just one person — Mark Zuckerberg — controls Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram. The fact that he has shown himself to be much more interested in scaling his platforms than combating those who abused them for political and economic gain — and that his lieutenants were ready to go after their high-profile critics, like George Soros — should make breaking up or regulating Facebook a front-and-center issue in 2020. But just the raw political weight of behemoths like Facebook, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Apple needs a closer look. The Next America is more than technology. It literally will be born in 2020. The United States Census Bureau has predicted that by 2020, for the first time, “more than half of the nation’s children are expected to be part of a minority race or ethnic group.” That will begin a process by which by 2044 “no one racial or ethnic group will dominate the U.S. in terms of size,” NPR reported. Alas, though, the fiscal tools we need to build the Next America have been weakened by President Trump’s tax cuts. The federal deficit was not supposed to hit $1 trillion until 2020, but the White House now says it will hit that number in 2019. We’ve had deficits this size in response to the 2008 financial crisis, but we’ve never run one so huge during a boom. That means the Next America may have to be built in the face of higher interest rates on more debt, with less fiscal ammunition to stimulate the economy should it slow down or face a crisis. So the Next America may very likely have to raise taxes or trim military spending, or Social Security or Medicare — just when all the baby boomers are retiring. In sum, the Next America requires addressing each of those issues, and many more — from climate change to zoning rules — and how they interact. So the next election must too. The craziness around Trump has delayed much of this discussion. But 2020 won’t let us do that again. The Next America won’t wait.

2018,Theaster Gates Is a Toast of the Fashion and Art Circuit,"During Art Basel for his latest exhibition, the artist talked style and race, and recalled his run-in with a surprisingly un-diva-like Naomi Campbell. MIAMI BEACH — The image was arresting. Screened on a wall of the Freehand Miami hotel, it showed a bikini-clad woman playing volleyball on the beach. The blowup itself was not extraordinary, except that its subject was black. That photograph, first published in Ebony and Jet magazines in the 1950s, ’60s and ’70s and now part of “The Black Image Corporation,” a Prada-sponsored art installation by Theaster Gates, was compelling enough to freeze Naomi Campbell in her tracks. Sipping black tea on an upper floor of the hotel, the space tricked out like a midcentury living room in the tropics, Mr. Gates recalled Ms. Campbell’s reaction. “Naomi keeps saying to me, ‘Theaster, nobody ever showed me these images,’’’ he said. Growing up, as she told him, ‘all I saw was poverty, discrimination and protest images. Nobody ever told me that there was a black middle class.’” Much less, she might have added, a middle class stylishly and un-self-consciously cavorting on the beach. So rare were such pictures in mid-20th-century America, so far outside the mainstream, that they were bound to strike onlookers, black or white, as alien, if not downright subversive. “When you throw an 80-foot image of black people on the beach,” Mr. Gates said, “what you realize is that in our imaginations we haven’t seen black people playing volleyball on the beach.” Or for that matter, seen them visiting a haberdasher, primping at the mirror or simply gathering for cocktails in a lavishly appointed living room. Even now, those portraits may seem brash and perhaps a bit unsettling. “There are Haitians in Miami,” Mr. Gates said, “who don’t go to the water because they think ‘this beach was made for somebody else. It wasn’t made for me.’” That very audacity was a magnet to a gathering of high-visibility entertainers, athletes and tastemakers — Kanye West, Emma Roberts, Venus Williams and Chloë Sevigny among them — who paid court to Mr. Gates during a round of exclusive gatherings at the hotel during Art Basel Miami Beach this month. Mr. Gates, it happens, is the style world’s current cultural idol, cast by no less an arbiter than Miuccia Prada, whom he calls a mentor, as a towering figure, “that rare artist,” she said, “who seems to fill the space between art and ordinary life.” A more sweeping version of the show is on view through mid-January at the Prada Foundation in Milan. (Prada, among Mr. Gates’s most prominent champions, has been taken to task for a recent display that included a figurine resembling a Little Black Sambo.) Known chiefly as a so-called social practice artist, Mr. Gates, a sculptor, singer, and scholar of urban planning, has been roundly praised for his role in converting dilapidated buildings into affordable dwellings and community work spaces on the South Side of Chicago, where he lives. No surprise, then, that he is hailed as a figure of heroic dimensions, something of a savior to the area. But Mr. Gates was having none of it. “My intention was not saving others,” he said. “I was simply making things and hoped that the will to make things would have an impact.” His ambition, he would argue, is more circumscribed. I’m super-interested in the color black, the history of black painting,” he said. “My daddy made black paintings on roofs.” With that he stood up, miming with an imaginary mop to demonstrate the way his father tarred a roof. “He could keep it from leaking in a way that it didn’t look tacky,” Mr. Gates said. “Aesthetics don’t have to be far from us — it’s what I’m saying.” Another passion is digging through peoples’ things, “the more banal and the more seemingly unnecessary the better,” he said. “I feel like it’s the unnecessary stuff that, if it’s left alone long enough, could start to have its own meaning.” His propensity to find exaltation in the ordinary extends to the subjects of the black-and-white portraits lining the walls where he sat, part of an archive of some 13,000 photographs he licensed from the Johnson Publishing Company, once the nation’s largest black-owned publishing company, producing titles including Ebony and Jet. “These pictures demonstrate that we don’t necessarily need a superstar — the image of Muhammad Ali — to know that black people were beautiful strong and powerful in the ’50s and ’60s,” Mr. Gates said. “Add in the schoolteacher, the bus driver, the fireman” — he gestured broadly toward the photographs displayed around the room — “and that’s what to me gives all this its rightness.” When he was a boy, similar photographs, many shown alongside advertisements for Rice-A-Roni, Winston cigarettes and Sta-Sof hair spray, helped shape his vision of black identity and, to some degree, his sense of style. Talking fashion, Mr. Gates grew animated, bounding from his seat to point out a portrait of a radiant young woman, her hair sculptured at the crown into twin knobs, “Afro-puffs,” as they were known in the late ’60s and ’70s. “Look at that skin,” he said, his voice rising. The subject’s complexion was the product of a less polluted era, he said, “a time when people used to eat greens and sweet potatoes and when they drank — water.” “These were everyday black women, pre-Burger King,” he said. “Any one of them, by today’s standards, could have been a queen.” He may have a soft spot for ordinary people, but Mr. Gates has no problem exhibiting his work in a members-only setting. “Last night 500 people came to our opening, and it was a fire hazard,” he exulted. The place and the party may be exclusive, and that’s fine with Mr. Gates. “When you give everything away, sometimes people don’t want it.” he said. “But the beauty of this kind of project is that it creates desire.” A natural marketer and, as it happens, no stranger to fashion, Mr. Gates wore Carhartt pants, chalk white Prada lace-ups and an easy-fitting work shirt, copied from an original he bought at a thrift store and had remade in multiples by a tailor in Hong Kong. “I have nine colors of this shirt,” he said, ebullient. “I wear it every day, it’s my uniform.” The artist sees no taint or threat of compromise in his recent and seemingly improbable alliance with the world of style. Sure, fashion is a business, he allowed. So what? He sees nothing amiss in hitching his profile to that of a high-luster brand. (He will be represented for the first time in New York by the Gagosian Gallery.) “‘The Black Image Corporation’ is about the projection of images into the world,” he said. “What’s better than a fashion house to do that? It’s about right fit.” An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the ownership of the photographs featured in an installation by Theaster Gates. Mr. Gates licensed the images from the Johnson Publishing Company; he did not purchase them.",The New York Times
2018,Their Art Raised Questions About Technology. Chinese Censors Had Their Own Answer.,"HONG KONG — Artificial intelligence bots. 3-D printed human organs. Genomic sequencing. These might seem to be natural topics of interest in a country determined to be the world’s leader in science and technology. But in China, where censors are known to take a heavy hand, several artworks that look closely at these breakthroughs have been deemed taboo by local cultural officials. The works, which raise questions about the social and ethical implications of artificial intelligence and biotechnology, were abruptly pulled last weekend from the coming Guangzhou Triennial on the orders of cultural authorities in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong. The artists, from Europe, Australia and the United States, were not given an official reason why their works were rejected for the show, which opens on Dec. 21 at the Guangdong Museum of Art. The pieces did not touch on the Tiananmen democracy crackdown of 1989, independence for Taiwan or Tibet or the private wealth of Chinese Communist Party leaders — topics that are widely known to be off-limits for public discussion in China. As a result, some of the show’s curators and the affected artists have been left guessing as to why the works were banned. Their conclusion? The works were perhaps too timely, too relevant and therefore too discomforting for Chinese officials. “The news is really filled with concern about the gene editing of babies,” said Heather Dewey-Hagborg, an American artist whose work “T3511” was among those pulled from the show. “It definitely seems like a moment where I can imagine that art or any kind of content that deals with biotechnological futures and some of the vulnerabilities and the dark side of those futures might seem to be dangerous.” Ms. Dewey-Hagborg was referring to the explosive revelation last month that the Chinese scientist He Jiankui said he had created the world’s first genetically edited babies. Following the announcement, scientists in China and abroad condemned Dr. He’s conduct, calling it reckless and unethical. Against that background, a work like “T3511” by Ms. Dewey-Hagborg with Toshiaki Ozawa would seem to be especially timely. The four-channel video tells the fictional story of a biohacker who becomes obsessed with an anonymous donor whose saliva she purchases online. By analyzing the DNA in the saliva and using a genealogy website, the biohacker is able to identify the anonymous donor. According to Ms. Dewey-Hagborg, the video is intended to raise questions about biological commodification, privacy and bioethics. But in China, where officials are often incentivized to err on the side of caution and prioritize social stability above all else, stirring up public debate with hard-hitting questions about ethics is not always a welcome endeavor. Angelique Spaninks, director of MU, an independent art space in the Netherlands, and one of the curators of the Guangzhou Triennial, said, “The privacy stuff even makes me uncomfortable and of course the work is a very strong piece because of that.” But anything that creates discomfort, she said, “makes officials here nervous.” The other banned works include “The Modular Body,” an online science fiction story about using human cells and artificial organs to create a living organism. Created by a Dutch artist, Floris Kaayk, the work is intended to raise questions about the potential for 3-D printing of human organs, about extending life with the help of technology and about the desire to design life from scratch. Also pulled from the show was “im here to learn so :))))))” by Zach Blas and Jemima Wyman, a four-channel video that resurrects Tay, an artificial intelligence bot created by Microsoft in 2016 that was shut down in less than a day after users trained it to be a bigot. According to Mr. Blas, museum officials in China had initially asked to cut two lines in the video (an obscenity and a reference to Adolf Hitler) before cultural authorities decided ultimately to reject the entire work, which also deals with issues of feminism. A work by the artist Lawrence Lek, from London, was also pulled from the show, as was part of a multichannel video work by Harun Farocki, a filmmaker who died in 2014, according to curators. Huang Yaqun, the deputy director of academic affairs at the Guangdong Museum of Art, a state-backed museum and the host of the triennial, said that the decision to cut the works was based in part on their “incompatibility with the Guangdong people’s taste and cultural habits.” Though some were caught off-guard by the last-minute decision to pull works from the triennial, such setbacks are a frequent occurrence for many in China’s art circles when dealing with the country’s often unpredictable censorship review process. Contrary to the notion of China’s censorship apparatus as an all-powerful monolith, the effort to get an exhibition past cultural officials is often a constant negotiation and balancing act that can depend on factors including which authorities are in charge and what the local situation is. Exhibition organizers are often forced to come up with clever strategies to circumvent or assuage censors by, for example, showing a work without explanatory text or putting age restrictions on access to a show. “Usually, they reject work mentioning political or internal affairs or nudity,” said Victoria Jonathan, art director of Jimei x Arles International Photo Festival, which is held every year in the southern Chinese city of Xiamen and is a partner of the annual Rencontres de la Photographie d’Arles. “Sometimes they object to something because it’s related to the news. And sometimes their decision just doesn’t make sense at all.” China is not alone in pulling images that it deems potentially disturbing. Last year, the Guggenheim Museum removed three works by Chinese artists from a highly anticipated exhibition — including one featuring pit bulls on treadmills — after pressure from animal-rights supporters and others over the show, “Art and China After 1989: Theater of the World.” Some critics said the Guggenheim should have used the controversy as a moment to engage the public about difficult art. Though Ms. Spaninks, the Guangzhou Triennial’s curator, said she was disappointed with the decision to pull the current works, she was hopeful that the remaining pieces in the show, which is titled “As We May Think: Feedforward,” could still trigger debate about the future of science and technology. Assuming no further cuts are made to the show, the exhibition, which runs until March 10, will feature more than 40 artists including Lynn Hershman Leeson, Wang Yuyang and Tega Brain. Still, Mr. Kaayk, who said he had spent months preparing “The Modular Body” for the show, only to find out at the last minute that it had been banned, said in an email that he felt “very frustrated.” “Isn’t contemporary art meant to raise questions, and start discussions about important subjects in actuality and those of our near future?” he wrote. “What are China’s reasons for organizing all these big expensive ‘contemporary art’ manifestations if these questions, the core of contemporary art, freedom of speech, freedom of mind, are ignored and undermined?”",The New York Times
2018,"Their Plans Derailed by a Wildfire, Seniors at Paradise High School Wonder What’s Next","CHICO, Calif. — Gabe Price was having another rough day. As he had every morning since escaping the deadliest wildfire in California’s history, the 17-year-old had woken up beside his father on a sagging air mattress at his grandparents’ house, now crammed with four extra people and a dog. Stress filled the cramped rooms like smoke, always on the verge of flaring into another argument. Home — or what he had until recently known as home — is a pile of ashes. Paradise High School, where he is a senior, is cordoned off in an evacuation zone. Lessons are now all online, and Mr. Price desperately needed to find a Wi-Fi signal. So there he was, walking through a Muzak-filled shopping mall, where the Paradise school district had converted a former LensCrafters into a temporary school, wedged between a JCPenney and a toy store. “This is the most stressful environment I’ve ever been in,” said Mr. Price, over the buzz of Spanish and algebra lessons nearby. “There’s nowhere I can get fully comfortable and I’ve got so much work to do.” In the weeks since the Camp Fire killed at least 85 people and wiped out more than 18,000 buildings in Paradise and neighboring towns, those who fled have urgently searched for housing and normalcy, many still reeling from nightmares of the flames. The burden is particularly acute for Paradise High’s Class of 2019, 240 seniors on the cusp of adulthood whose post-graduation plans have been derailed by more pressing challenges. For Mr. Price, hanging over his current circumstances is an even bigger worry: how to pay for college. As captain of the track team whose season ended at a state meet a few weeks after the fire, he had hoped for an athletic scholarship. But with no track nearby to improve his running times, he fears that his best laid plans may also fall victim to the wildfire. “It’s not just me,” he said. “My entire grade is having to rethink our futures.” [Read: A Frantic Call, a Neighbor’s Knock, but Few Official Alerts as Wildfire Closed In] A tight-knit community that was already struggling economically — 67 percent of Paradise High School students qualify for free or reduced lunch — has been pushed closer to the edge. “These kids’ entire foundation has been wiped away,” said Lowell Forward, an engineering teacher at Paradise High, holding court at the mall’s improvised school in Chico, about 13 miles west of their former campus. Teenagers hunched over laptops in the food court, trying to tune out the shrieks of small children running through an indoor play area. “It’s not just that their house burned down or their parents lost their jobs,” Mr. Forward said. “The seniors were expecting a step-by-step preparation for graduation and beyond, and now that’s all up in the air.” Although the school district is offering tutoring at the mall and has provided its students with laptops, backpacks and school supplies to replace what they lost in the wildfire, many do not have access to the internet when they return to their temporary housing. Some don’t even have running water. Yet another challenge: the ticking clock of college applications deadlines, which many students, like Elie Wyllie, have already missed. Ms. Wyllie, 17, grew up in Paradise “way below the poverty line,” she said. Problems at home motivated her to get stellar grades. Her zeal for perfection made her Paradise High’s top tennis player and earned her the nickname The Comeback. She dreamed of becoming a cardiothoracic surgeon, believing that college was the sole path to changing her family’s fortunes. She was in the midst of applying to a dozen colleges, including Yale, when the inferno reduced her home to ashes. While California state schools extended their application deadlines, she still does not have all the paperwork they require. “Everything is crashing down,” she said. “Now I’ll be the only person in my family to have a future. They’re going to expect me to take care of them when I can barely take care of myself.” Overwhelmed, Ms. Wyllie said she has temporarily moved in with her A.P. history teacher, who is now retired. It was the only way she could do her homework and complete college applications, she said. “The Camp Fire tore up more than just my town; it took away my peace of mind,” she said. “Everything for the rest of my life is going to be affected by this.” [Read: After a Wildfire, Rebuilding Life Can Be Hardest for the Oldest] For the Class of 2019, there will be the time before the Camp Fire, and the time after. One event last weekend stood out for its normalcy: a college seminar at the Chico Marriott, where volunteers helped students fill out applications and financial aid forms. But despite how ordinary it felt, it also highlighted the challenges of planning ahead. “These kids want to put down an address for a house that no longer stands,” said Elizabeth Stone, an independent college consultant who organized the seminar. With her house untouched by the fire, Julionna Keers is luckier than most of her classmates at Paradise High. She lived in Magalia, a town up the road from Paradise that escaped heavy damage but was completely evacuated by authorities. In the ensuing chaos, Ms. Keers missed the S.A.T. on Dec. 1, which was the final scheduled exam that the California State University System allowed for applicants. For now, Ms. Keers, who has a part-time job, is focused on more immediate issues, like helping her parents pay for their weekslong hotel bill, which their home insurance does not cover. “My mind’s always been on school, but now it’s making sure my family is going to be O.K.,” she said. [See: ‘Hell on Earth’: The First 12 Hours of California’s Deadliest Wildfire] Suffering from survivor’s guilt, Ms. Keers has busied herself by trying to help less fortunate friends. Last Friday night, she drove to a suburb of Sacramento, where the Del Oro High School had turned its state division championship football game into a fund-raiser for two of her classmates. One student, Kaleb Nelson, a Paradise High football player and wrestler, was given a new generator, gift cards and enough donations to buy a used pickup truck. Later, in the glare of stadium lights, he cheered from the 20-yard-line in his white Paradise football jersey. “It’s really good to see football again,” he said, giving his girlfriend, Adrianna Marciella Orozco, a hug. It had been nearly a month since a neighbor pounded on his front door, screaming about the approaching wildfire. He ran barefoot toward his pickup truck, his girlfriend beside him, and inched along in traffic past woods wreathed in flames. His truck broke down shortly after they moved into his uncle’s trailer, which is parked on a Chico street and lacks electricity and running water. Standing beside him, Ms. Orozco, 17, said she could not forget the inferno that killed her four dogs and made her family homeless again. Racked by flashbacks of the burning heat on her skin, she is rethinking her life after graduation. She had planned to attend a community college near Paradise, but now is considering a school in Arizona surrounded by desert. “It’s too traumatizing to be around trees,” she said. An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a Paradise High School student who lost her home in the Camp Fire. Her name is Elie Wyllie, not Wylie.",The New York Times
2018,Their Romance Began on a Rooftop,"Mini-Vows Daina Ann Agee and Michael Vincent Mastrandrea were married Dec. 1. The Rev. Ronald L. Gothberg, a Lutheran minister, officiated at the couple’s house in Nashville. Ms. Agee, 33, is a teacher for English-language learners at Glencliff High School in Nashville. She graduated from Mount Holyoke College, received a master’s degree in education from Framingham State University in Massachusetts and received a second master’s degree, also in education, from Lipscomb University in Nashville. She is the daughter of Marcie Sheck Agee and David W. Agee of Henrico, Va. The bride’s father retired as a handyman in Oceanside, N.Y. Her mother retired as the bookkeeper for Long Island Lutheran Middle and High School in Brookville, N.Y. Mr. Mastrandrea, 34, is a revenue-cycle specialist in Nashville for Bluetree Network, a health care information technology company. He graduated from the University of Northern Kentucky and received an M.B.A. from the University of Tennessee. He is a son of Patricia A. Mastrandrea and Vincent A. Mastrandrea of Villa Hills, Ky. The groom’s mother is a clinical project manager at LBR Regulatory and Clinical Consulting Services in Florence, Ky. His father retired as a customer service agent for Delta Air Lines at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport in Hebron, Ky. Considering that the couple met in Malaysia, though both were born in New York and she was living in Taiwan at the time while he was on an extended international backpacking trip, it’s probably not that surprising that a geographic misunderstanding surfaced early in their relationship. In 2013, their paths crossed at a hostel in Kuala Lumpur that is known for its rooftop bar and party atmosphere. She was on her way to Nepal for a hiking trip, and he was headed to Bali to celebrate his birthday. He told her he was from Cincinnati. She told him that she taught English to schoolchildren in Taipei. “We had things in common — we’re both originally from Long Island, we have similar world views, we’re outward looking and really progressive, we like minimalist living, and are interested in politics,” she said, noting that the two stayed up until 3 or 4 in the morning talking. “There was just something about him that reminded me of New York, and of home.” The two commenced a friendship through Facebook messages, and some weeks later, when she was back in Taipei, he suggested that he might visit Taiwan for a week or so. “I was staying in a hostel for maybe five or six days,” he said, “and the assumption was that maybe I’d be staying in Taipei for a week or two. Ten days later or so, I moved into her apartment.” The couple shared their first kiss on another rooftop, and he stayed for five months. She told people her boyfriend was from Ohio. But then one day, she happened to look closely at his driver’s license, and saw that it was of Kentucky issue, not Ohio. And she suddenly found herself thinking that she had no idea who her boyfriend was. “I remember just standing in my bedroom saying, how am I going to react to this?” A quick geography lesson and a little humility settled the matter. “I didn’t know Kentucky was on the border with Cincinnati,” she said. “I had to look at a map of the United States!”",The New York Times
2018,There Are Lakers Not Named LeBron James — and They Are Not So Bad,"On Pro Basketball OAKLAND, Calif. — It did not seem confrontational, and he did not sound upset. But Kyle Kuzma wanted to make his feelings known. “I mean, it’s not like we’re panicking because he’s gone,” Kuzma, the second-year forward with the Los Angeles Lakers, said late Tuesday night. “We’re pros, too. We’re great players — or on our way to trying to be great players. So it’s all about that next-up mentality and having a will to win.” Kuzma was speaking with reporters in the visiting locker room at Oracle Arena not long after the Lakers had demolished the Golden State Warriors, 127-101, on Christmas Day, and the “he” to whom Kuzma was referring was LeBron James, the leader of the Lakers and the most dominant player of his generation. James had strained his left groin in the third quarter, leaving his teammates to fend for themselves against the N.B.A.’s reigning champions. The training wheels were off, and the Lakers’ lesser lights seized the opportunity. [Read: Lonzo Ball Strives to Be a Point Guard Fit for a King] In his own way, Kuzma appeared to be alluding to a lesson — that it is no easy thing to labor in James’s shadow — that all of James’s teammates eventually learn. And with that lesson often comes a resolve: to show that the other members of the team have some pride and skills, and are capable of at least approximating a competitive basketball team in James’s absence. For one night, the Lakers (20-14) proved as much — and they may have more opportunities ahead, starting Thursday against Sacramento. The Lakers announced Wednesday that James would not travel with the team to play the Kings and that his status was day-to-day after a magnetic resonance imaging test confirmed that the groin had only been strained, and not more seriously damaged. Shortly before the announcement, James posted on Twitter: “Dodged a bullet! Sheesh” and “#BackInNoTime.” “It’s uncharted territory, obviously, with this group,” Lakers Coach Luke Walton said Tuesday night, before the extent of the injury was known, “but this is what we’ve been talking about, and this is what we’ve tried to play for — not that he gets hurt, but being able to play and win and compete while he’s not on the floor. That’s progress, and our team is much better now than we were to start out the season.” James played in all 82 games last season with the Cleveland Cavaliers — but he will turn 34 on Sunday. The injury news comes during a stretch in which James has attracted different, if not more, attention than usual. Last week, in response to a question, he said he would love for Anthony Davis of the New Orleans Pelicans to join him in Los Angeles. Alvin Gentry, the coach of the Pelicans, then accused James of tampering with a player under contract, but the N.B.A. determined that James had not violated league policy. Gentry later defended the Lakers star, saying he had been put in a “bad situation” when he was initially asked about Davis. In either case, James was broadcasting the idea that he was open to upgrading the talent around him — and, in fairness, who wouldn’t want to play with an all-world talent like Davis? But the math goes something like this: One or more of the current Lakers would need to go to New Orleans in a trade for Davis, which must mean that James thinks they are expendable. A few days later, James made the rare public misstep of posting offensive lyrics on his Instagram account. He subsequently apologized in an interview with ESPN — “if I offended anyone,” he said. The lyrics, by the rapper 21 Savage, include the phrase “getting that Jewish money,” and James said: “I actually thought it was a compliment, and obviously it wasn’t through the lens of a lot of people.” Amid that situation, the latest episode of James’s H.B.O. show “The Shop” aired. In it, James described N.F.L. owners as “old white men” with a “slave mentality.” By Tuesday night, though, the focus was back on LeBron James the basketball player. He was brilliant, collecting 17 points, 13 rebounds and 5 assists as he led the Lakers to a 14-point advantage over Golden State early in the third quarter. But after lunging for a loose ball, James felt some discomfort in his groin, he said, and he may have aggravated the injury when he tried to make a defensive play. He soon left for the locker room. “I’ve never seen him hurt,” Lakers guard Rajon Rondo said. The Warriors rallied, cutting the lead to 2 late in the third quarter. But then something unexpected happened: The Lakers pulled away behind players like Rondo (15 points, 10 assists), Kuzma (19 points, 6 rebounds), Brandon Ingram (14 points) and Ivica Zubac, a 21-year-old center who finished with 18 points and 11 rebounds while shooting 9 of 10 from the field. Zubac has gotten an opportunity only in recent days, because JaVale McGee, the team’s starting center, has been sidelined by an illness. Zubac had barely been playing. “It’s tough, especially mentally — it’s the worst,” Zubac said. “Everyone’s saying: ‘You’ve got to stay ready. You’ve got to stay ready.’ And you know you can play, but there are a lot of guys ahead of you in the rotation, so you have to wait until someone goes down, and that’s your only chance. And you’ve got to step up. If you don’t step up at that time, you’re not playing, like, for the next 20 games.” Zubac has channeled that sense of urgency into incredible production, averaging 17.7 points and 8.7 rebounds while shooting 78.1 percent from the field in his last three games — and perhaps the rest of the team will look to him as an example if James is out for a while. “He’s a big part of us, obviously,” Kuzma said of James. “He makes us go. But that’s why it’s a team sport.”",The New York Times
2018,Theresa May Fights No-Confidence Vote Amid Brexit Disarray,"LONDON — Britain’s beleaguered prime minister, Theresa May, will face a no-confidence vote on Wednesday within her own Conservative Party, as lawmakers upset with her handling of Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union seek to topple her from power. Graham Brady, the chairman of the backbench 1922 committee of Conservative lawmakers, announced Wednesday morning that he had received letters of protest from more than 48 Conservative members of Parliament, the number needed under party rules to trigger a vote on her leadership. He said the contest would take place Wednesday evening. Mrs. May has been battered from multiple directions by her management of the European Union withdrawal, or Brexit. In particular, many hard-line Brexit supporters within her party believed she was not making a complete enough break with the bloc. [What is Brexit? A simple guide to why it matters and what happens next.] In recent days, she suffered two embarrassing setbacks in Parliament. Last week, the House of Commons voted her government in contempt of Parliament — the first time any prime minister had been censured in that way — for failing to release the advice her government’s lawyers had given on Brexit. And on Monday, she postponed a vote on the Brexit agreement she had negotiated with the European Union, acknowledging that it stood to be defeated by “a significant margin.” In fact, lawmakers say, views on the topic, which has dominated British politics for nearly three years, are so fragmented that no approach has majority support in Parliament, and probably not among Conservatives, either. A defiant Mrs. May appeared Wednesday morning outside 10 Downing Street, the prime minister’s official residence, to argue that the only beneficiaries of a vote of no confidence would be the opposition Labour Party. “I will contest that vote with everything I’ve got,” she said. “A change in leadership in the Conservative Party now will put our country at risk and create uncertainty when we can least afford it,” she added. “Weeks spent tearing ourselves apart would only create more division, when we should be standing together.” Still, before Wednesday’s vote, Mrs. May promised fellow Tories that she would step aside soon after the Brexit difficulties were over, according to reports from a Conservative Party meeting. That removed the generally unwelcome possibility that she would stand as party leader in the next general election. [Read more on what a No-Confidence Vote is and why Theresa May’s fate could be decided tonight.] Under the party’s rules Mrs. May needs to win around 158 votes in a secret ballot to remain as party leader and therefore prime minister. If she does so, then party lawmakers cannot mount another challenge to her leadership for a year. If she lost the vote, then the party would choose another leader over the coming weeks, and Mrs. May would not be eligible to compete for the position. The move comes at a critical time for Brexit, with European Union leaders scheduled to discuss the matter at a meeting on Thursday and Friday. Under current law, Britain is scheduled to leave the bloc on March 29 and if there is no agreement on terms for an orderly withdrawal, it could suffer a chaotic and economically damaging no-deal exit. The disarray in London undermined the British pound, which has fallen sharply against the dollar and the euro in recent weeks, though it later rebounded as large numbers of Conservative lawmakers publicly affirmed their support for Mrs. May. In Brussels, diplomats said they could see little benefit from Mrs. May’s travails, and that no new British leader would be able to change the fundamentals of the 585-page divorce agreement negotiated so painfully. The so-called backstop that is meant to guarantee free movement of goods over the Irish border is integral to any deal and cannot be made temporary or subject to unilateral dissolution. The main fear is that there is no majority in Parliament for any kind of Brexit deal, one diplomat said, like others speaking only anonymously, following diplomatic protocol. “Even the funny elements of this are actually tragic,” said another diplomat about Mrs. May and the Brexit saga. “I still hope Beckett, Kafka and Havel are not those who will finish writing this piece.” Mr. Brady said that he had informed Mrs. May about the 48 letters on Tuesday evening by phone. She will have the opportunity to address Conservative Party members before they cast their ballots, he said, adding that Mrs. May had pressed to hold the vote quickly because of the imminence of Thursday’s European Union summit meeting. If she loses the confidence vote, Mrs. May could in theory remain as prime minister until a successor as Conservative Party leader were selected. Mr. Brady said the process of choosing a successor would be likely to begin on Tuesday. A series of ballots would then whittle the contenders down to a final two, something that Mr. Brady said could be done by next Thursday, when Parliament is scheduled to break for the Christmas vacation. The final choice would be left to around 120,000 members of the Conservative Party who would vote by postal ballot. The timing for that process, and the duration of any campaign before the vote, has not yet been determined. David Gauke, the justice secretary, warned pro-Brexit lawmakers that if Mrs. May were ousted, it would increase the risk that Britain would have to postpone its departure from the European Union. He argued that a successor would not be chosen until the end of January or early February, after the date at which the Brexit deal is expected to return to Parliament for the critical vote. “It would be an act of self-indulgence to remove her as leader of the Conservative Party at this point,” Mr. Gauke told the BBC. Mrs. May made the same point, arguing that whoever succeeded her would not have time to negotiate a new withdrawal agreement by March 29, and so “one of their first acts would have to be delaying or even rescinding” Britain’s exit from the union. Wednesday’s vote will be conducted by secret ballot, which suggests that protestations of loyalty, even from cabinet ministers who took to Twitter to state their support, cannot be taken at face value. Pro-Brexit lawmakers have been threatening to unseat Mrs. May for months but last month failed to muster the 48 no-confidence letters, in part because of worries that the prime minister might win and that it could actually strengthen her. Faith in Mrs. May has ebbed after Monday’s damaging decision to avoid a parliamentary vote on Brexit, which drew condemnation from Conservatives as well as opposition parties. Now that a leadership vote is scheduled, the psychology could change because the question will be whether or not lawmakers want to keep Mrs. May for at least a year — one during which a general election could take place. Last year Mrs. May called a general election but lost her parliamentary majority after a campaign which was widely criticized. Mrs. May’s aides hinted on Wednesday that, if she wins the confidence motion, she could still stand aside at some point after Britain has formally left the European Union in March but before the next general election. That could persuade some lawmakers to lend Mrs. May their support in the vote on a temporary basis. Pragmatic Conservative members of Parliament may also be reluctant to risk giving the choice of a replacement to their party’s grass-roots members, many of whom favor a maximally radical approach to Brexit.",The New York Times
2018,Theresa May Finds No Joy in Brussels. Now What for Brexit?,"BRUSSELS — Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain headed home flustered and empty-handed on Friday after a blunt exchange at a European Union summit meeting, where Mrs. May’s entreaties for help to amend a withdrawal deal that would satisfy her Parliament were rejected. The outcome, which the British press described as a humiliation of Mrs. May, left her scrambling with no clear way forward as Britain hurtles toward its self-imposed deadline to withdraw from the European Union in less than four months. Instead of achieving a diplomatic victory in Brussels to salvage a chaotic week that nearly toppled her from power, Mrs. May engaged in an ill-tempered spat with the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker. He airily dismissed the idea of more negotiations on the deal known as Brexit. In a bracing moment of candor, Mr. Juncker called Mrs. May’s hourlong performance in Brussels before other European Union leaders “sometimes nebulous and imprecise.” Britain must be specific about what it needs, Mr. Juncker said, venting the frustration felt by European negotiators at Mrs. May’s tactics for more than two years. For Mrs. May, the summit was another ordeal after one of the most tumultuous five days in recent British politics. On Monday she abruptly postponed a Parliament vote on the Brexit deal, calculating that it would be defeated resoundingly. On Wednesday she survived a confidence motion among her own Conservative Party lawmakers, but more than one third of them voted to oust her, and she prevailed partly by promising that she would step aside before the next general election. Now she faces twin, seemingly insurmountable obstacles: continuing to negotiate with Brussels for something she can call a new concession, while trying to allay British lawmakers’ fears of being tied forever to the European Union under a “backstop” agreement on the border between Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and Ireland, which is part of the European Union. And she has to reschedule a vote in Parliament that she is widely expected to lose. Her conundrum won little sympathy from the bloc’s leaders during the two-day summit meeting. “When it comes to the future relationship, our British friends need to say what they want, rather than asking us what we want,” Mr. Juncker said. “And so we would like within a few weeks for our U.K. friends to set out their expectations for us, because this debate is sometimes nebulous and imprecise and I would like clarifications.” An offended Mrs. May appeared to confront Mr. Juncker Friday morning in a testy exchange and, though video of the encounter did not provide audio, broadcasters confirmed the altercation with the help of lip readers. Asked about it later, she said, “I had a robust discussion with Jean-Claude Juncker” who had been talking, she said, not about her but “about a general level of debate.” Stung by the criticism, Mrs. May insisted she had been “crystal clear” about what she needed. Some had predicted that Brussels would be a welcome relief for Mrs. May from the domestic political crisis. But as preparations accelerated on both sides of the English Channel for a chaotic exit without an agreement — which neither side wants — European officials suggested that her tactics had been wrong. Postponing the vote in the British Parliament on the withdrawal deal that was so painfully negotiated, and then appealing to the bloc for concessions that could help win passage, had been an error, these officials said. Brussels is unlikely to make even minor changes to help Mrs. May until after Parliament votes down the agreement, they said, noting that in the past, the bloc only moved to salvage a disaster once it had actually happened. To make concessions beforehand might allow pro-Brexit members of Parliament to demand more. But now, Parliament is unlikely to vote on the deal until January, and European Union leaders continued to insist that they would not agree to alter it. “I have no mandate to organize any further negotiations,” said Donald Tusk, president of the European Council. Mr. Juncker said “we have to lower the temperature,” but Mr. Tusk repeated that “we have to exclude any further opening of the withdrawal agreement.” Prime Minister Charles Michel of Belgium said that “very objectively, the signals that we heard yesterday are not especially reassuring about the capacity in Britain to be able to honor the engagement that was undertaken.” If, as predicted, Parliament rejects the 585-page divorce deal, there will be a renewed rush to win over British lawmakers who are concerned about the Irish border. That would require not just reassuring words, which were readily available here Thursday and Friday, but more legally binding interpretive documents, of the kind used in the past to get around objections from parliaments of member states or regions. Those could be drafted and approved in another emergency European Union summit meeting in late January. Then, officials hope, the British Parliament might agree to the deal on a second vote. The danger is that, after the latest debacle in Brussels, Mrs. May could lose the first vote in Parliament by such a margin that the deal is effectively killed. So Mrs. May said on Friday that there would be more talks with the European Union, while putting her best gloss on the formal conclusions that emerged from the meeting, which were mildly encouraging and which, she said — rather stretching the point — “have legal status.” While Britain is scheduled to leave the European Union on March 29, mid-February seems more like the ultimate deadline. British lawmakers must pass supporting legislation and the European Parliament must ratify the deal. Of course there are other possibilities for Brexit, which was set in motion in 2016, when 52 percent of the British electorate voted to leave the union. The British Parliament, which currently seems to have no majority for any particular deal, but also seems to have a majority wanting to avoid a “no-deal” outcome, could try to rescind Britain’s withdrawal, or take over the Brexit process from Mrs. May’s government, an option supported by advocates of closer ties to the bloc like those enjoyed by Norway. Or it could, despite Mrs. May’s current objections, vote for a second referendum, while asking Brussels to delay the March 29 deadline. But what precisely such a plebiscite would ask and how soon it could be arranged are open questions, and to delay March 29 would require consensus from the other 27 member states. Planning for a no-deal exit — which officials predict would be chaotic and economically damaging — will accelerate now, Mr. Juncker said, as did Mrs. May. A senior French official said the discussion Thursday night with Mrs. May, which included nearly an hour of questions and answers with her counterparts, was not acrimonious. But others said that Mrs. May was often interrupted, including by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who asked, “But what is it that you want?” Mrs. May’s only hope is that growing concern about a no-deal Brexit will concentrate minds among British lawmakers so that they vote through her plan, however much they dislike it. Yet many of her lawmakers are angry about the “backstop” plans to prevent physical checks after Brexit on goods at crossing the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Under that plan, the whole of the United Kingdom would stay in a customs union with the European Union until a long-term arrangement can be made, while Northern Ireland would be subject to even more of Europe’s rules. Mrs. May wants legally binding assurances that this will be a temporary situation, and Britain will not be trapped in a relationship that obliges it to obey rules it will have no role in shaping. What she would like is known in diplomatic jargon as a “Joint Interpretive Instrument,” a legal clarification of the meaning of the deal, separate from the agreement itself. Experts argued that Mrs. May had made another basic error by promising her own lawmakers something she had yet to secure from the European Union, and therefore gambling on the willingness of Brussels to help her. Peter Ricketts, formerly the head of Britain’s Foreign Office, said he had awaked to the news of Mrs. May “appealing to others to help her out of dilemmas of her own making.” “I cannot understand why she weakly undertook in the Commons to get further legal assurances from the E.U.,” he wrote on Twitter. “Setting herself up for failure that further diminishes the UK.”",The New York Times
2018,Theresa May Got Stuck in Her Car. Some Saw a Perfect Brexit Metaphor.,"Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain found herself stuck on Tuesday afternoon. This time, it wasn’t the intractable negotiations over Brexit that left her trapped. Instead, it was a stubborn car door that refused to unlock, leaving her stranded in the back seat as Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany looked on. Video of the episode showed repeated efforts by those inside and outside the car to open the door, to no avail. Finally, moments later, Mrs. May managed to emerge to shake hands with the German leader. The awkward entrapment — though just seconds long — offered what seemed to some an appropriate metaphor for Mrs. May’s struggles as she makes a desperate bid to secure new assurances from Europe on Britain’s plan to leave the European Union after she postponed a parliamentary vote on the issue at the last minute. On social media, Mrs. May’s struggle to exit the vehicle was viewed as a sign of her difficult position as she tries to win approval for a Brexit plan that seemed to anger all sides of the debate. Samantha Power, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations, called the scene “Brexit personified.” After leaving the car, Mrs. May met with Ms. Merkel at the chancellor’s office in Berlin as part of a European tour in an effort to salvage the Brexit deal. The British Parliament was scheduled to vote on the agreement on Tuesday, but Mrs. May on Monday delayed the vote after it became clear that the plan would not be approved. Mrs. May is hoping her whirlwind tour will help secure new assurances that make her deal with the European Union more palatable to British lawmakers. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, tweeted that he had had a “long and frank discussion” with Mrs. May, and that it was clear that Europe wanted to reach an agreement with Britain. “The question,” he wrote, “is how.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Theresa May Is Determined — and Doomed,"She has Britain’s grudging respect. And not much more. Ms. Prince is the author of the biography “Theresa May: the Enigmatic Prime Minister.” And so Theresa May limps on — bruised, battered and with less authority than ever to enact any real policies, destined to serve only as a vehicle for delivering Brexit. There is a sense that we’ve finally reached a tipping point this time. Yes, she’s survived, but the wounds from Wednesday’s no confidence vote, while not immediately fatal, appear impossible to fully recover from. When she does finally go — and we now know that her departure will be sooner rather than later — the sense of loss in the country may be keener than expected. For there’s a paradox at the heart of Britons’ relationship with the woman who is still, for now, their prime minister. It is the times when she is at her weakest that they — grudgingly — seem to warm to her. Having been widely derided as a “May-bot” during the last general election for her robotic media appearances and then, for not entirely unconnected reasons, going on to lose her majority in Parliament, many who’d mocked her for blowing an election she herself had called found themselves undergoing an unexpected change of heart. Perhaps it was the cough — the calamitous tickle in her throat that struck as she was delivering her keynote speech at the 2017 Conservative Conference, making her words inaudible even as the set fell apart around her and a protester pranked her. Or maybe it was the dance that did it: her self-deprecating sashay onto the stage a year later, poking fun at herself for the unbearably awkward jig she performed during a trip to Africa. Somewhere along the line, the hostility — in some places, at least — turned to sympathy. The tone of the columns, on the left and right alike, grew less strident; the social media din was turned down a notch or two. But more important, out in the real world people began to speak of her with something approaching fondness. Over the last few months, as her ministers walked out on her, a narrative began to emerge of a determined woman remaining at the helm while those actually responsible for triggering Brexit — the flamboyant but flaky ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, the Donald Trump-ally Nigel Farage, the unreliable former-Brexit Secretary David Davis — abandoned ship when the waters got choppy. If, on radio phone-in programs, Mrs. May was still subjected to accusations of being a “modern-day Chamberlain,” she also received support from callers like Ellen, who lamented that “those people who started this all off have all walked away and left you to it and they just want to stand on the sidelines shouting.” On Wednesday, at perhaps her lowest ebb, facing mutiny from her own side and an implacable impasse in her efforts to drive through her only major policy, a withdrawal agreement from the European Union, this same dynamic was apparent: A collective sigh of exasperation at the distraction that the Conservative infighting was posing at a time of national crisis. The more angry her own members of Parliament grew at her swing away from a hard Brexit, the more sympathy she seemed to attract outside Westminster for the extra burden being placed on her by her own side at a time when she is shouldering the heaviest of loads. Many seem to feel this way despite themselves: voters who have despised her Conservative Party all their lives, including, privately, a number of opposition Labour members of Parliament, admit to a grudging admiration for her calmness and stoicism in the face of extreme provocation — or if not that far, then at least empathy for the raw humiliation she’s endured over the past two years combined with, on occasion, appreciation of her willingness to take responsibility while others fled. (It helps that her internal opponents are, by contrast, largely unsympathetic: a lineup of pale, male, plummy-voiced toffs, encapsulated by Jacob Rees-Mogg, unofficial leader of the Tory Brexiteers, whose references to obscure dates in history and love of his “nanny” ceased to be charming to most ordinary voters about six months ago.) The most recent opinion poll by YouGov showed that a majority agree that no other Conservative leader would be able to negotiate a better Brexit deal. There appears, however, to be little correlation between feelings toward Mrs. May in the country and those within her parliamentary party. In Wednesday’s secret ballot, more than a third of her party’s members of Parliament declared themselves opposed to her leadership, a bitter personal blow to anyone, let alone a politician who must now pick herself up, head to Europe and try to square the Brexit circle once again. However much the British public may have developed a quiet respect for Mrs. May, it will do her little good in either Brussels or Westminster over the next few months. There was already a sense that her premiership, for all her ambitions to achieve something tangible on the domestic front, would always be defined by Brexit. On Wednesday, that became close to official: To win over waverers, she has been forced to promise that she will not lead them into the next general election, which is planned for 2022. In reality, in a country that prefers managed transitions, she now has little more than two years in office, and possibly substantially less. This concession will have broken her heart. Mrs. May came to office vowing to break down the country’s remaining class barriers and introduce a level playing field. There was a specific pledge to help those who felt “left behind” or saw little for their hard work: the disenfranchised and undervalued. That went out of the window within a year as the daily grind of trying to deliver Brexit sucked the energy out of British politics. For some time, she had clung to the hope that she could somehow survive Brexit relatively unscathed and spend the second half of her premiership building something she could call a legacy. Now she’s finally running out of road. Rosa Prince is a freelance political journalist and author covering British and American politics.

2018,"Theresa May Survives Leadership Challenge, but Brexit Plan Is Still in Peril","LONDON — Britain’s prime minister, Theresa May, survived the gravest threat yet to her embattled leadership on Wednesday, winning a party confidence vote and averting a leadership battle that threatened to plunge the country into prolonged crisis. But the victory celebration, if any, is likely to be short-lived. While Mrs. May survived to fight another day, the future of her stalled plan to leave the European Union looked bleaker than ever. She still lacks the votes in Parliament to pass it. She stands little chance of winning the concessions from Europe that she needs to break the logjam. And the surprisingly strong vote against her within her own party underscores the difficulty she faces in winning approval for any plan for Britain to leave Europe, or Brexit, as the deadline for withdrawal looms. For one moment, however, after a week of humiliating setbacks, the prime minister could savor her win. “Here is our renewed mission,” she said outside her offices at 10 Downing Street after the vote on Wednesday. “Delivering the Brexit that people voted for, bringing the country back together and building a country that truly works for everyone.” But even that moment was tempered by loss. Mrs. May won the vote only after promising that she would step aside soon after the Brexit agonies were over, according to reports from a meeting of Conservative Party lawmakers preceding the vote. That pledge removed the generally unwelcome possibility that she would stand as party leader in the next general election. Mrs. May, said George Freeman, a Conservative lawmaker, had made clear “that she has listened, heard and respects the will of the party that once she has delivered an orderly Brexit, she will step aside for the election of a new leader.” In the vote on Wednesday, on a confidence motion called by her own Conservative Party, Mrs. May won the support of 200 Conservative lawmakers, while 117 voted against her. The protest vote exceeded many forecasts, and is expected to compound her difficulties in Parliament, where her enemies were already pressuring her. “This was a terrible result for the prime minister,” said Jacob Rees-Mogg, a leader of the hard-line pro-Brexit faction. The vote does give her some breathing room. Under the Conservative Party’s rules, she cannot be challenged again by her own lawmakers for another year, which at least offers some stability for moving the Brexit plan forward. Had she lost, the Conservatives would have been thrust into a divisive, drawn-out process that would have stretched well into the next month. The delay would have threatened the country’s ability to reach a deal by the March deadline, potentially resulting in the messy prospect of a no-deal Brexit. Nevertheless the victory came at a price, laying bare the opposition within her own party ranks to Mrs. May, who leads a government that has no parliamentary majority. The confidence vote was called after weeks of discord when at least 48 Conservative lawmakers submitted the letters of protest required to force it. Mrs. May canceled a trip to Dublin where she had hoped to talk to her Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar, about changes that might help build support in the British Parliament for her Brexit proposals. But it had already been clear that she was in deep political trouble, battered from multiple directions by her management of the European Union withdrawal. In particular, many hard-line Brexit supporters within her party believed she was not making a complete enough break with the bloc. In recent days, she suffered two embarrassing setbacks. Last week, the House of Commons voted her government in contempt of Parliament — the first time any prime minister had been censured in that way — for failing to release the advice her government’s lawyers had given on Brexit. And on Monday, she postponed a vote on the Brexit agreement she had negotiated with the European Union, acknowledging that it stood to be defeated by “a significant margin.” In fact, lawmakers say, views on the topic, which has dominated British politics for nearly three years, are so fragmented that no approach has majority support in Parliament, and probably not even among Conservatives. Nobody knows, really. But these are the likeliest scenarios. Mrs. May argued Wednesday morning that the only beneficiaries of a vote of no confidence would be the opposition Labour Party. Having survived it, she now faces an uphill task to garner sufficient support for her withdrawal agreement with the European Union, a lengthy legal document that Brussels has warned is the only deal on the table. John Springford, deputy director of the Center for European Reform, a London-based research institute, said that the size of the vote against her “is an even clearer signal that she won’t be able to get her deal through Parliament, and makes it even more likely that when she puts the deal to the vote she will lose that.” On Thursday she is scheduled to travel to Brussels to meet leaders of the 27 other European Union countries to try to secure some reassurances that might help her win a vote on the Brexit plans. She has promised to allow lawmakers to decide the matter by Jan. 21. If there is no agreement then, Britain could be facing a chaotic departure on March 29. Or not. There could be a second referendum, a mutually agreed extension of the negotiating period or even, as Mrs. May has warned her party, no Brexit at all. What does not seem to be in the cards, for now, at least, is the general election that the opposition Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has been angling for throughout the Brexit process. While Mrs. May has maintained a public face of optimism over securing some pledges from the European Union intended to reassure her own lawmakers, she is unlikely to win any game-changing concessions. Her strategy appears to be to delay the critical vote — now probably in the middle of January — and to hope that the growing risk of a disorderly departure brings some lawmakers back into line. But many doubt that will work. “Clearly, her last throw of the dice is count down the clock and try to bounce people into voting for it,” Mr. Springford said. “But I am not convinced she will win that vote. I don’t think that she can get meaningful concessions from the European Union that would be enough to get her over the line. “The best hope is that everybody calms down over Christmas, that they start to really worry about no deal, and that some more moderate people signal that they will support her. But everyone is now so high up their pole that I am not sure they can climb down.” In Brussels, diplomats said they could see little benefit from Mrs. May’s travails, and that no new British leader would be able to change the fundamentals of the 585-page divorce agreement negotiated so painfully. That applies to the so-called backstop that the pro-Brexit lawmakers are particularly incensed about. That provision would insure the free movement of goods over the Irish border in the event that a free-trade agreement is not reached in the two-year transition period after Brexit. What is especially galling for the Brexiteers is that it would continue indefinitely, or until the European Union decides it is no longer needed. The main fear is that there is no majority in Parliament for any kind of Brexit deal, one diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity according to diplomatic protocol. “Even the funny elements of this are actually tragic,” said another diplomat. “I still hope Beckett, Kafka and Havel are not those who will finish writing this piece.” OpinionRosa Prince",The New York Times
2018,Theresa May Tried to Lead Britain to a Brexit Compromise. Was It Too Late?,"LONDON — The full weight of two and a half years of struggle was visible on Prime Minister Theresa May’s face when she appealed to her colleagues to let go of their passionate, polarized beliefs and support her plan to leave the European Union in a vote on Tuesday. “This argument has gone on long enough,” she said. “It is corrosive to our politics. And life depends on compromise.” If Mrs. May’s appeal for compromise has rung hollow, it is due in part to her own choices. As she negotiated Britain’s departure from the European Union, she was secretive about her intentions, like a poker player holding her cards to her chest. Early on, she expended vast reserves of energy reassuring the hard-line faction of her party that she was on their side, declaring boldly that “no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain.” By the time she revealed her true plan, presenting the country with a compromise that should have appealed to moderates, she had few reserves of trust or loyalty to draw upon. “She has not prepared the nation for what a compromise looks like,” said Katie Perrior, who served briefly as Mrs. May’s director of communications after she became prime minister. “At the beginning there was so much hard talk. ‘These are my red lines.’ Now people are trying to match the hard-talking Theresa May with another, more compromising one. She has not really explained that gap.” Mrs. May, 62, could have been the perfect person to carry a message of compromise. She is an old-fashioned English public servant, devoid of bombast and rhetorical flourish, and uninterested in personal power. She had not created the churning whirlpool of ideology and grievance around Britain’s exit from the European Union, and this gave her some authority to bring it to an end. During the weeks since Nov. 15, when Mrs. May released a 585-page agreement on withdrawing from the bloc, the prime minister has exhibited an air of noticeable calm, as if she is watching something predictable unfold. In fact, she has long anticipated this moment of exposure, the point where, as Ms. Perrior put it, “you have to jump off the fence.” She fully expected to face the wrath of hard-liners in her party. A bigger surprise, it seems, was the rejection of moderates. Ian Dunt, the author of “Brexit: What the Hell Happens Now,” said Mrs. May had been so preoccupied by fractures within the Conservative Party that she failed, until now, to address splits in the country. “She has been a divider,” he said. “It’s only now she presents herself as a pragmatic centrist option. You need to build a reputation as a unifier. It’s not enough to turn around after two and a half years and say, ‘I’m a unifier.’” Oddly, Mrs. May’s weaknesses as a politician — her dislike of the spotlight, her lack of a political tribe — were part of why she was chosen as prime minister in the first place. In 2016, the country was exhausted with upper-crust game players like David Cameron, her predecessor, who had casually led the country into turmoil by promising a referendum on leaving the European Union, never expecting that the Leave side would win. To a fragile, stunned country, Mrs. May looked like a “safe pair of hands.” The daughter of a small-town vicar, she was diligent and cautious, not a member of any of Westminster’s political camps, or party to back-channel conspiracies. She had shown toughness and flashes of bravery in six years as home secretary. In the evenings, when her colleagues fanned out to social clubs and dinner parties, she would dine alone with her husband in the Commons. Some of this aloofness was natural: When she rose through the party, she was one of very few senior women. “I think she’s always been a bit of an outsider in her own party,” said Ayesha Hazarika, an author and political commentator. “I think she always cut quite a lonely figure, but then a lot of women on the Labour side did, too. I wouldn’t fault her for her historic lack of tribe.” Brought into office with the central goal of negotiating Brexit, Mrs. May set about winning the confidence of her party’s right wing — not a simple task since in the referendum campaign she had supported remaining. She built a team that including dedicated Brexiteers, among them her closest adviser, Nick Timothy, and echoed their thoughts in early speeches. “Too many people in positions of power behave as though they have more in common with international elites than with people down the road, the people they employ, the people they pass in the street,” she said at a Conservative Party conference in October 2016. “If you believe you’re a citizen of the world, you’re a citizen of nowhere,” she said. “You don’t understand what the word ‘citizenship’ means.” She followed this up by articulating a series of “red lines,” promising to exit the customs union, single market and European Court of Justice. These promises would box her in, glossing over the fact that leaving the customs union would require establishing a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. But they kept her hard-line critics on board. “She has got us to this position the only way she could, by exaggerating her Brexitiness initially and keeping the Brexiteers on side as long as she could,” said Anand Menon, a professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King’s College London. “If your objective is to keep Theresa May in Downing Street, this might have been the only way she could do it.” With the publication of her withdrawal agreement, Mrs. May ended her fence-sitting — and enraged the hard-Brexit faction. Daniel Hannan, one of the founders of Vote Leave, said her deal “ends free movement, but otherwise keeps us in the E.U.” The worst betrayal, he said, was her acceptance of the so-called Irish backstop, which locks Northern Ireland into continued membership in the customs union until a trade deal is mutually agreed upon. “Mrs. May has never properly grasped why 17.4 million of us voted Leave,” he said. “She seems to think that if she presents something — anything — that can technically be labeled Brexit, we will be satisfied.” Her critics on the left say she wasted precious time soothing hard-line supporters of Brexit. If Mrs. May had begun to build alliances with business, Scottish Unionists, Labour moderates and members of the Green party, she might have laid the groundwork for compromise, said Ms. Hazarika, a longtime adviser to Labour politicians. “The country was very, very divided,” Ms. Hazarika said. “I think the mistake she made, she should have reached out to other people at that stage. I think she could have found allies.” Mrs. May’s secretive style, though helpful strategically, made it difficult to build those bridges. “This is not a poker game,” she said. “This is the most important decision this country will take since the Second World War.” Historians will dispute whether such a thing was ever possible. The justice minister, Rory Stewart, who in recent days has emerged as one of the country’s most passionate voices for compromise, said the prime minister had no choice but to be cautious as she threaded her way through a field of adversaries. He said that those pushing for a hard Brexit, like the Tory lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg, were “never going to be comfortable with us remaining in a close, comfortable arrangement with the E.U.” and that the notion that Labour moderates would help her was delusional. “There has never been a time since the Second World War where Labour has ever crossed the floor to help the Conservative Party at a time of crisis,” Mr. Stewart said. Mrs. May’s strategy could collapse this week. If she leaves, it will be with the admiration of many Britons, who respect her uncomplaining grit. Ms. Perrior, her former aide, said Mrs. May was intent on protecting the Conservative Party — “it’s the main thing she loves, along with her husband, Philip” — from fatal fracture. “She knew this was going to be ugly and awful, and it is,” she said. “But there is a bit about her which says, ‘I look around and there is no one I can hand the reins to who I think would do a better job.’” Mr. Menon, the professor, was less sympathetic. “She used inflammatory language that divided the country,” Mr. Menon said. “One of her legacies is a country that is now profoundly divided. It is divided across a dimension which raises a frightening possibility that our politics is going to be a culture war.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Theresa May and the Conservative Will to Power,"The divisions are deep, but Britain’s ruling party knows how to stand together when the time comes. Mr. Bale is a professor of politics at Queen Mary, University of London. LONDON — So Prime Minister Theresa May lives to fight another day. She won Wednesday’s vote of no confidence: 200 members of her party stood by her; 117 did not. Indeed, under the Conservative Party’s rules, it will be another year before her opponents in the party can try to unseat her as leader. But does her victory really resolve anything? There’s been speculation that the deep divisions and factional fighting between the hard-line Brexiteers and the Conservatives’ less Euroskeptic wing might do more than just unseat the prime minister; it might ultimately break the party apart, with some members coalescing around a nationalist, even populist, alternative while their less strident colleagues join a putative “centrist” party committed to a more moderate, more open style of politics. Aren’t we, then, looking at a truly existential threat to the world’s oldest, and arguably most successful, party? Probably not. Of course, past performance is no guarantee of future performance, but the Conservative Party’s “will to power” has seen it through many crises in its 200-year history. Holding office, not doctrinal purity, has always been its No. 1 goal. It often bends but it rarely breaks. Even Brexit, however bad things seem, is unlikely to change that. No one is saying, of course, that “Europe” doesn’t matter. Britain’s relationship with the Continent has long posed a problem for the party, not least because the economic advantages it seems to offer involve a trade-off with national sovereignty, something Conservatives care about deeply. This has been the case since the 1970s, when Edward Heath, the prime minister at the time, had to rely on Labour votes in Parliament in order to bring Britain into the European Economic Community, the European Union’s predecessor. Most of Mrs. May’s problems since she took office in the wake of the 2016 Brexit referendum stem from her dogged determination to secure an exit from the European Union that simultaneously restores Britain’s control over migration, but without tanking the economy and necessitating a hard border in Ireland. (Indeed, she’s done little else in her tenure.) Those problems don’t look likely to go away just because she won Wednesday’s no-confidence vote. The Brexit process remains up in the air, and Mrs. May’s deal with the European Union is still unpopular with many in her party. It’s entirely possible that to break Britain out of the Brexit logjam, she may have to agree to a “softer” Brexit than she would have liked, or perhaps even to a second referendum. Neither of these would be popular among Conservatives — particularly if the latter resulted in a vote to remain. But even then, the party would almost certainly manage to pull itself together rather than fall apart, focusing on what its factions, despite everything, can still agree on. That’s because even more than the Conservatives care about their divisions over Brexit, they care about what they share in common: a conservative agenda and a determination to keep a left-wing Labour Party from gaining a parliamentary majority. Believe it or not, most Conservatives are in broad agreement. When it comes to the economy and the role of the state, they are all pretty much Thatcherites now. True, there are a few Conservative members of Parliament who would like to see a little more public spending and investment, a more compassionate attitude to those on welfare, and some slightly tougher regulation of business. But the differences between them and the rest of their colleagues (most of whom want to keep spending, taxes and regulation as low as possible without setting off an overwhelming electoral backlash) are largely differences of degree, not of kind. That means that there is a post-Brexit agenda that the Conservatives can unite around: free trade with as many countries that will do deals with “global Britain,” cutting red tape that supposedly suffocates small business, overcoming the obstacles that have stymied the growth of homeownership under a party that has long lauded its commitment to a “property-owning democracy,” and health and education provisions lean enough to ensure that tax-funded spending on public services doesn’t crowd out the private sector. Time and time again, after fights that might have broken other parties — the vicious arguments over free trade in the 1920s is perhaps the most apposite example — the Tories have prevented seemingly permanent splits from becoming fatal. Clearly, it’s proving incredibly hard right now to fulfill the decision to leave the European Union. But because there’s still more that unites the Conservative Party than divides it — particularly when it comes to keeping taxes and regulation low, keeping capital flowing, and keeping a socialist Labour Party out of power — even Brexit, in the end, is unlikely to tear it apart. And who knows. With the clock ticking louder and louder, and with Mrs. May now apparently safe, this underlying agreement might still combine with the party’s traditional will to power to allow her, after all, to oversee a smooth departure from the European Union next March.

2018,"Theresa May, China, Michael Cohen: Your Thursday Briefing","Asia and Australia Edition (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Theresa May survives a leadership challenge, a Huawei executive gets out on bail and President Trump’s former lawyer receives a prison sentence. Here’s the latest: • Theresa May survives no-confidence vote over her Brexit plan. The British prime minister survived the gravest threat yet to her leadership, winning a confidence motion called by lawmakers in her own party. Mrs. May won the support of 200 Conservative lawmakers, while 117 voted against her. But the sizable opposition could further imperil her Brexit efforts, experts said. → What next? Under Conservative party rules, Mrs. May can’t be challenged again for a year, which could lend some stability going forward. → Go deeper: The divisions around Brexit reflect wider political turmoil that has engulfed the European continent, including the countries that were once considered sources of stability, writes our chief European diplomatic correspondent. → Also: Days after saying Britain said it would suspend its so-called “golden visas,” the government backtracked without providing an explanation. _____ • New wrinkles in U.S.-China relations. Trade negotiations between China and the U.S. seemed to be making progress — but our reporters have learned that the Trump administration is preparing a new series of actions against Beijing’s trade, cybersecurity and economic policies. Above, a car factory in China. Adding to the urgency of the crackdown: The Marriot hack that exposed the data of around 500 million guests was traced back to a Chinese intelligence-gathering effort, according to U.S. officials. But President Trump complicated the narrative, saying he’d be willing to intervene in the U.S. case against Meng Wanzhou — the Huawei executive arrested in Canada on accusations that she violated sanctions against Iran — if that would help close a trade deal with China. Ms. Meng has been released on bail awaiting extradition to the U.S. Compounding tensions, Beijing has said that a Canadian former diplomat detained in China worked for an organization that was not legally registered, but didn’t divulge any specific accusations or even officially confirm his arrest. Some experts see the case as retribution for Ms. Meng’s arrest. → Go deeper: Here’s a list of other foreigners who have recently been detained in China for undisclosed reasons. _____ • Michael Cohen sentenced to three years. The penalty for President Trump’s former lawyer, above, was partly for his role in a hush-money scandal that could threaten Mr. Trump’s presidency. After federal agents raided Mr. Cohen’s office and home, he turned on the president and made the remarkable admission in court that Mr. Trump had directed him to arrange payments to a porn star and a former Playboy model before the 2016 election. Prosecutors also announced that the tabloid publisher American Media Inc., which played an important role in keeping those women silent, was cooperating with them. Mr. Cohen’s sentencing involved a guilty plea in a second case as well, filed by the special counsel, Robert Mueller. He admitted that he lied to Congress, failing to divulge the extent of Mr. Trump’s involvement in negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow during the election campaign. “I blame myself for the conduct which has brought me here today,” Mr. Cohen told the court, “and it was my own weakness and a blind loyalty to this man that led me to choose a path of darkness over light.” → Separately, lawyers for Michael Flynn, President Trump’s first national security adviser, asked a federal judge for leniency ahead of his sentencing next week. He has admitted to lying to the F.B.I., and has since cooperated with the special counsel investigation. _____ • ‘Subtle Asian Traits’ becomes a not-so-subtle global hit. When a group of Asian-Australian students started their Facebook group in September, it was to share jokes and memes about their experiences “being brought up in the in-between,” as one founder put it. Now “Subtle Asian Traits” has amassed nearly a million followers, bringing together a young international audience to reflect on the complicated experience of first-generation Asian immigrants. “We don’t have to explain stuff,” another founder explained. Above, six of the group’s nine founders. _____ • A Chinese oil tycoon, Ye Jianming, above left, established high-profile connections in Washington to broker business deals in the U.S. and around the world. But now Mr. Ye is in Chinese custody and his empire is crashing down. • The Indian government named a former finance ministry official to lead the central bank. He was a high-profile backer of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s troubled effort to recall much of the country’s paper currency. • Hotels around the world are turning their lobbies into communal working spaces not just for guests but for locals too, unlocking their Wi-Fi and offering snacks. • U.S. stocks were up. Here’s a snapshot of global markets. • The Vatican removed two cardinals implicated in sexual abuse cases from a powerful council, including George Pell of Australia who has been facing charges of sexual abuse in legal proceedings that are subject to a news media gag order in the country.

Here’s a look at their original reviews of the movies that have since endured. Maybe the world is not so small after all — even in an age of mass culture. In Spain, drumming parties called tamboradas go around the clock for days. Across Georgia, athletes perform chidaoba — wrestling accompanied by music. And in Kazakhstan, horse farmers celebrate the new breeding season with songs, dances and games. The cultural agency of the U.N. recently added these traditions, and more, to its List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. The idea is to recognize and preserve unique and impalpable rituals that are passed down through generations. Unesco acknowledges music and dance, hunting practices and traditional crafts, knowledge about nature and the universe — in short, the things that tell us who we are. Traditions in danger of vanishing are given a special designation. This year those included traditional Egyptian hand puppetry and Syrian shadow play, which is pictured above.

2018,"Theresa May, Strasbourg, Nancy Pelosi: Your Wednesday Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning, It’s a busy news day today, particularly in Europe, where Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain faces the most serious threat yet to her leadership, and a gunman is at large in France after a deadly shooting at a Christmas market. Developing The shooting at a street market in Strasbourg, France, was an act of terrorism, officials said today, as the police continued an intensive search for the gunman. Members of Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative Party are scheduled to hold a ballot in Parliament tonight, a new and potentially lethal threat to her leadership. Under party rules, Mrs. May needs to win 158 votes from the 315 Conservatives in Parliament to stay as party leader and therefore prime minister. If she does, party members can’t challenge her leadership again for a year. If she loses the vote, she must withdraw and another leader will be chosen over the coming weeks. Why now: Mrs. May’s prospects have been endangered by the crisis over her negotiations on Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union and her decision on Monday to postpone a crucial parliamentary vote. Explainer: We examine some of the possible replacements if Mrs. May loses tonight’s vote. News analysis: Britain, France and Germany are all facing political change or upheaval. For the European Union, the question is who will guide the bloc into an uncertain future. Our chief diplomatic correspondent reports from Brussels. The president vowed on Tuesday to block full funding for the government if Democrats refused to allocate money for his long-promised wall on the southwestern border. In a preview of the division coming to Washington in January, when Democrats assume control of the House, Mr. Trump argued with Representative Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer in front of reporters. Lawmakers face a Dec. 21 deadline to keep much of the government open, and the president has said $5 billion for the wall must be included in their spending package. Closer look: Taking responsibility for a potential shutdown is the latest way in which Mr. Trump has upended political convention, our chief Washington correspondent writes. Fact check: We assessed some of Mr. Trump’s claims on Tuesday about the wall. From Opinion: If Tuesday’s meeting was any indication, it’s going to be a rough two years, a member of The Times’s editorial board writes. The cyberattack on the hotel chain that collected personal details of roughly 500 million guests was part of a Chinese intelligence-gathering effort against Americans, according to two people briefed on the investigation. The discovery comes as the Trump administration plans to target China’s trade, technology and economic policies, perhaps within days. The moves reflect a growing concern that the trade truce negotiated two weeks ago by President Trump and President Xi Jinping might do little to change China’s behavior. If you missed it yesterday: Meng Wanzhou, the Huawei executive whose arrest has heightened trade tensions between the U.S. and China, was granted bail of 10 million Canadian dollars, or about $7.5 million. Ms. Meng was detained in Vancouver and is awaiting extradition to the U.S. Another angle: China said today that a former Canadian diplomat detained in Beijing worked for an organization that was “not registered in China legally.” Senators narrowly confirmed a federal appeals court judge on Tuesday, even though the American Bar Association had questioned his understanding of “complex legal analysis” and his “knowledge of the law.” The judge, Jonathan Kobes, a 44-year-old Senate aide who has tried six cases in his life, is the second of President Trump’s judicial nominees to be deemed unqualified by the bar association but then confirmed. The impact: Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has called Republican judicial confirmations “the most significant, long-term contribution we are making to the country.” Another angle: Mr. McConnell said on Tuesday that the Senate would vote on a criminal justice bill before the end of the year, reversing course and teeing up a bipartisan policy achievement that has eluded lawmakers for years. The Daily: On today’s episode, one of our congressional reporters discusses the push for criminal justice reform. With opioid deaths soaring, police departments and bystanders with cameras are posting raw, uncensored images of drug users passed out with needles in their arms and babies in the back seats of their cars. In interviews with our reporters, the subjects talked — some for the first time — about the bleak, humiliating versions of themselves circulating in viral videos. New climate change warning: The Arctic has been warmer over the last five years than at any time since records began in 1900, a U.S. scientific agency announced on Tuesday, and the region is warming at twice the rate as the rest of the planet. Sentences for former Trump aides: Michael Cohen, President Trump’s onetime lawyer, is to be sentenced today at 11 a.m. Eastern. On Tuesday, lawyers for Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser, asked a judge to spare him prison time, suggesting that the F.B.I. agents who interviewed him last year had tricked him into lying. Earthquake in Tennessee: A 4.4-magnitude quake struck this morning in the eastern part of the state, rattling homes as far away as Atlanta. There were no immediate reports of damage. Google chief’s testimony: Sundar Pichai faced more than three hours of questions in front of the House Judiciary Committee, as Republicans expressed concerns about unfair treatment of conservatives and lawmakers in both parties zeroed in on privacy issues. Settlement in Charlie Rose case: CBS News reached a legal settlement with three women who had accused Mr. Rose of sexually harassing them. The network fired Mr. Rose, the host of “CBS This Morning” and a correspondent on “60 Minutes,” last year. Snapshot: Above, backstage at an annual ball in Moscow on Tuesday for students from military schools. The ball, which attracted students from across Russia, was a revival of a tradition from czarist times. “Clueless” on stage: A musical version of the 1995 film opened Tuesday night in New York. The adaptation by the film’s writer-director, Amy Heckerling, is “affable but limp,” our critic writes. Late-night comedy: The hosts all noticed the Oval Office drama between President Trump and Democratic leaders: “It looks like Trump’s border wall is right on track to still never be built,” James Corden said. What we’re reading: This Lifehacker post on not caring when people don’t like you. Tim Herrera, our Smarter Living editor, said he just stumbled across it again. “It's a simple fact of life that you can’t — and won’t — please everyone,” he says. “Coming to terms with that can be freeing.” Bake: This intense cookie, featuring molasses, chocolate and fresh ginger.

A heated session of the British Parliament turned to chaos Monday night when a member of the House of Commons grabbed a five-foot-long, silver-gilt mace and tried to leave the chamber. The mace represents the crown’s authority, and Parliament can’t sit or pass laws without it. Traditionally, the person in charge of guarding the mace — and restoring order after rare mace-snatchings — is the sergeant-at-arms. The sergeant’s role, which dates to 1415, is to escort the speaker of the house before each sitting, carrying the mace during the procession, and to maintain order during the sitting. You can’t miss the sergeant — the traditional uniform includes a frilly lace collar and cuffs, silk stockings and black patent-leather shoes. A sword can also come in handy. After Monday’s breach of protocol, the troublemaking lawmaker said: “They stopped me before I got out of the chamber and I wasn’t going to struggle with someone wearing a huge sword on their hip.” That’s it for this briefing.

2018,There’s More Religion Than You Think in Bach’s ‘Brandenburgs’,"One of the most persistent myths about Bach is that his work is marked by a fundamental conflict between the sacred and the secular. According to this view, Bach’s ideal appointment was his stint from 1717 to ’23 as Kapellmeister (director of music) for Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Köthen. Leopold’s court observed the Calvinist faith, a liturgically austere branch of Protestantism that prohibited elaborate music in its church services. So here — unlike in his previous positions at the Lutheran court of Weimar and at Lutheran parishes in Arnstadt and Mühlhausen — Bach was freed from having to continually oblige the church. He could focus instead on “pure” instrumental music, like the “Brandenburg” Concertos, today’s holiday-season standbys. [See what our critics chose as the best classical events of 2018.] [And listen to our favorite recordings of the year.] But was that truly his goal? Listeners and scholars who speak of Bach’s works as “sacred” versus “secular” generally understand these terms to mean “religious” as opposed to “nonreligious.” Bach and most of his contemporaries, however, don’t seem to have understood sacred and secular to be mutually exclusive categories. The distinction they observed was between liturgical music (for the church service) and secular music (out in the world). Secular and liturgical works were both religious: A central purpose of all serious-minded music, wherever performed, was to honor God. Consider Bach’s manuscripts for the Six Harpsichord Concertos (BWV 1052–57) and the church cantata “Now come, savior of the gentiles” (BWV 62), both of which open with his inscription “Jesus, help me” right before the first bar of music and close with “To God alone the glory” after the last bar. Those today who view religion negatively sometimes go even further and view Bach’s church cantatas as essentially instrumental concertos, with the religious texts more or less extraneous. But historically informed interpretation suggests the opposite: Bach’s instrumental concertos, including the “Brandenburgs,” are essentially church cantatas with implicit (and therefore harder-to-read) “texts” that do have real meaning. In the 1721 presentation manuscript that he dedicated (probably as a veiled job query) to “His Royal Highness: Monseigneur Christian Ludwig, Margrave of Brandenburg & So Forth,” Bach had called this collection “Six Concertos with Various Instruments.” The name “Brandenburg” Concertos was coined in the 19th century by the leading Bach biographer Philipp Spitta. (We can be grateful that Bach and Spitta were unaware that Ludwig’s true primary title was Margrave of Schwedt: The “Schwedt” Concertos doesn’t have much of a ring to it.) Scholarly consensus now holds that Bach composed some of the “Brandenburg” Concertos during his Köthen tenure and others in his final years at Weimar. But although his aristocratic employers, had they known about it, might have disapproved of his formally dedicating any of “their” music to someone else, it hardly seems likely that in 1721 Bach could have drawn upon an untapped hoard of concertos. So by all indications, the “Brandenburgs” would have been included in the weekly programs of the Köthen palace concerts, and these pieces do indeed line up well with Leopold’s documented interests. Remarkably, the prince’s investiture festivities, in 1716, had included not only a superabundance of concert offerings, but also a scholarly oration exploring how musical order and societal order are analogous. As it happens, each of the six “Brandenburgs” delves into issues of hierarchy and order. The Sixth is musically and socially the most unconventional of the set. Two violas, with cello, are pitted against two viols, with violone. At the time, violas were customarily low-rent, undemanding orchestral instruments, while viols were high-end, virtuoso solo instruments. Bach reversed these roles, such that the violas perform virtuosic solo lines while the viols amble along in repeated eighth notes. Pursuing these two radical instrumental treatments within the same work was unprecedented (and wouldn’t be imitated). It’s an excellent musical illustration of the time-honored theme of the “world upside down.” Visual examples include mice chasing cats; servants riding on horseback while noblemen have to go behind on foot; and peasants serving communion in the cathedral while priests sweep the adjacent streets. These kinds of inversions play a significant part in Christian scripture, which frequently proclaims that with God the first shall be last while the last shall be first; the lowly shall be exalted while the exalted shall be brought low. The function of the world upside down imagery in Bach’s Lutheranism, as in scripture, was not to foment earthly upheaval, but to inspire heavenly comfort: The hierarchies of this sinful world are a necessary injustice for the sake of order, but, in light of the equality that awaits the blessed in paradise, they are ephemeral. A marvelous example of inverted imagery in Bach’s church cantatas is the fourth movement of “Whoever lets only the dear God rule” (BWV 93), where a soprano-alto duet gives voice to a hymn text by means of instrument-like countermelodies, while the violins and viola nonverbally intone the actual hymn tune. Voices and instruments, upside down. All three movements of the Fourth “Brandenburg” feature a solo violin part that is continually overshadowed by a duo of lowly recorders. Today’s listeners revel in the violin’s isolated flurry of activity about three minutes into the first movement: The audiences at Leopold’s palace, however, would have heard this as an egregious breach of musical and social decorum. The violin’s rowdy flare-up occurs not within an episodic solo section, as it ought properly to have done, but interloping into the start of the group refrain, an elegant French court dance led by the pair of recorders. A parallel example of a soloist’s hollow virtuosity fluttering atop an elegant dance-like group refrain is the alto aria from Bach’s church cantata “Whoever may love me will keep my word” (BWV 74). Here the violin’s jangling figurations serve to bolster the text’s notion that Jesus’s blood renders the enraged rattling of hell’s chains as comically useless: In the first movement from the Fifth “Brandenburg,” the three soloists — flute, violin and harpsichord — work episode-by-episode to undercut the sway of the ensemble refrain, set in the “stile concitato” (the militant style, projected by repeated 16th notes): At their second episode, the flute and violin take up bits of the group refrain’s pitch content, but reconfigure it in the “stile affettuoso” (tender style, here projected by smoothly connected pairs of eighth notes): It’s only a few steps from there before the harpsichord — in pre-1721 concertos, conventionally just a humble chordal-accompaniment instrument — assumes an ever more unruly star-soloist character and completely overwhelms the ensemble: The most powerful example in Bach of undermining the “stile concitato” by “stile affettuoso” occurs in the aria for bass and chorus from his church cantata “Hold Jesus Christ in remembrance” (BWV 67), where Satan the violence-bringer is stunningly subdued by Jesus the peace-bringer: In the egalitarian treatment of his eccentric combination of soloists for the Second “Brandenburg,” Bach abandoned altogether the hierarchies of his “various instruments.” Here the high-and-mighty trumpet, lofty solo violin, middling oboe and lowly recorder uncharacteristically perform interchangeable lines of undifferentiated passagework: A similar leveling of the Baroque orchestra can be found in the interchangeable writing for trumpets, strings, oboes and recorders in the choruses from the cantata “Jerusalem, praise the Lord” (BWV 119): The fluidity between the secular and liturgical in Bach is also illustrated by the fact that several Brandenburg Concertos find repurposing in his church cantatas for Leipzig, where he moved after Köthen. Bach employed the first movement from the First “Brandenburg” — doubtless on account of its riotously flamboyant horn parts — as the Sinfonia for “False world, I do not trust you” (BWV 52); and he arranged a souped-up version of the first movement from the Third Concerto — with its triadic trinity of three violins, three violas and three cellos — as the Sinfonia for “I love [God] the most high with all my mind” (BWV 174). Accepting the idea that the “Brandenburg” Concertos harbor social and religious designs needn’t involve downplaying the magnificence of Bach’s artistic gifts. But insisting on exclusively aesthetic contemplation of his works — or implying that in the “Brandenburgs” he was freed from the perceived burden of including religious content in his music — pales their meanings, diminishes their complexity and reduces their stature.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | There’s a Lot of Killing in Thou-Shalt-Not-Kill States,"When it comes to the death penalty, guilt or innocence shouldn’t really matter to Christians. Contributing Opinion Writer NASHVILLE — Until August, Tennessee had not put a prisoner to death in nearly a decade. Last Thursday, it performed its third execution in four months. This was not a surprising turn of events. In each case, recourse to the courts had been exhausted. In each case Gov. Bill Haslam, a Republican, declined to intervene, though there were many reasons to justify intervening. Billy Ray Irick suffered from psychotic breaks that raised profound doubts about his ability to distinguish right from wrong. Edmund Zagorksi’s behavior in prison was so exemplary that even the warden pleaded for his life. David Earl Miller also suffered from mental illness and was a survivor of child abuse so horrific that he tried to kill himself when he was 6 years old. Questions about the humanity of Tennessee’s lethal-injection protocol were so pervasive following the execution of Mr. Irick that both Mr. Zagorski and Mr. Miller elected to die in Tennessee’s electric chair, which was built in 1916. (The state spruced it up in 1989.) Their choice says something very clear about Tennessee’s three-drug execution cocktail, as Justice Sonya Sotomayor noted in a dissenting opinion to the Supreme Court’s decision not to hear Mr. Miller’s case: “Both so chose even though electrocution can be a dreadful way to die,” she wrote. “They did so against the backdrop of credible scientific evidence that lethal injection as currently practiced in Tennessee may well be even worse.” Electrocution might not be any more humane than death by lethal injection, in other words, but at least it offers a speedier hideous death. Presumably this is the same thinking behind the position taken by 51 death-row prisoners in Alabama who want to die in an untested nitrogen gas chamber rather than by either the electric chair or lethal injection. Nitrogen gas. That’s where we are in the whole ungodly machinery of capital punishment: Human beings are choosing to die by nitrogen gas. Here in red-state America, the death penalty is supported by 73 percent of white evangelical Christians and by even a solid majority of Catholics — 53 percent, despite official church teaching to the contrary — according to a Pew Research Center survey released in June. The three men Tennessee most recently executed were all convicted of especially brutal murders — in Mr. Irick’s case the rape and murder of a little girl left in his care; in Mr. Miller’s the murder of his girlfriend, a young woman with cognitive disabilities. Mr. Zagorksi murdered two men who were meeting him to buy a hundred pounds of marijuana with cash. Death-row inmates are not sympathetic figures. Not that being a sympathetic figure gets you very far here in Execution Alley in any case. In 1998, Texas executed a woman who became a born-again Christian while in prison. In 2015, Georgia executed a woman who had earned a theology degree on death row. It’s hard not to notice that all these inmates, sympathetic or not, were killed in the Bible Belt, in states where a sizable portion of the population believes they live — or at least believes they should live — in a Christian nation. Mr. Miller was the second inmate in the South to be executed last week, and two more — one in Texas and one in Florida — will die at state hands by Thursday. That’s a lot of killing for the thou-shalt-not-kill states and at a time of year that’s particularly ironic. What is Advent, after all, but a time of waiting for the birth of a baby who will grow up to be executed himself? For many anti-abortion Christians, there’s no contradiction between taking a “pro-life” position against allowing a woman to choose whether to continue a pregnancy and taking a “tough on crime” position whose centerpiece is capital punishment. An unborn fetus, they argue, is innocent while a prisoner on death row is by definition guilty. But for a true “pro-life” Christian, guilt or innocence really shouldn’t be the point. Cute and cuddly or brutish and unrepentant, human life is human life. It doesn’t matter whether you like the human life involved. If you truly believe that human life is sacred, right down to an invisible diploid cell, then you have no business letting the state put people to death in your name, even if those people have committed hideous crimes. There are numerous pragmatic reasons to abolish the death penalty. It doesn’t deter crime. It doesn’t save the state money. It risks ending an innocent life. (The Death Penalty Information Center lists the names of 164 innocent people who have been exonerated after serving years on death row. The most recent, Clemente Javier Aguirre, was released from a Florida prison just last month.) It is applied in a haphazard and irrational manner that disproportionately targets people of color. It puts prison staff in the untenable position of executing a human being they know personally and often truly care for. But the real problem with the death penalty can’t be summed up by setting pros and cons on different sides of a balance to see which carries more weight. The real problem of the death penalty is its human face. A person on death row is a person. No matter how ungrieved he may be once he is gone, he is still a human being. And it is not our right to take his life any more than it was his right to take another’s.

2018,Opinion | There’s a Wave of New Prosecutors. And They Mean Justice.,"These district attorneys should make jail the exception and eliminate cash bail. Ms. Bazelon is a staff writer at The New York Times Magazine. Ms. Krinsky is the executive director of Fair and Just Prosecution. In the past two years, a wave of prosecutors promising less incarceration and more fairness have been elected across the country. Republicans and Democrats are among the reformers, and they’re taking over district attorney offices in red and blue states. Five progressive D.A.s have been elected in major cities in Texas, of all surprising places, most recently in Dallas and San Antonio. In Houston, Kim Ogg was elected D.A. two years ago, and in the face of opposition from more than a dozen local judges, she has supported a lawsuit challenging the cash bail system for misdemeanor cases. Local prosecutors, who handle 95 percent of the criminal cases brought in this country, are well positioned to take reform into their own hands because of their broad discretion over whether and how to prosecute cases and what bail they decide to seek against defendants. And they’re exercising that discretion in new ways. In Chicago, State Attorney Kim Foxx raised the threshold for felony theft prosecution to reduce the number of shoplifters who go to jail. In Philadelphia, the D.A., Larry Krasner, has instructed his prosecutors to make plea offers for most crimes below the bottom end of Pennsylvania’s sentencing guidelines. In Kansas City, Kan., District Attorney Mark Dupree created a unit to scrutinize old cases haunted by questionable police practices despite opposition from local law enforcement. More broadly, many of these new, progressive prosecutors are declining to prosecute low-level marijuana offenses and have stopped asking for bail in most misdemeanor cases. But they’ve also encountered tough headwinds. We’ve seen these new district attorneys in action, and with input from two policy groups, the Justice Collaborative and the Brennan Center for Justice, we’ve come up with a set of principles and priorities to promote a progressive model of prosecution. There are 21 principles in all that offer D. A.s a blueprint to transform both their own offices and, with a push from advocates on the outside and help from other leaders on the inside, their justice systems. Since laws and practices vary from state to state, some of our recommendations won’t suit all jurisdictions. We intend them as a starting point. Our recommendations begin with the premise that the level of punishment in the United States is neither necessary for public safety nor a pragmatic use of resources. Prosecutors can address this first by routing some low-level offenses out of the criminal justice system at the start. For the cases that remain, they can help make incarceration the exception and diverting people from prison the rule, a principle advanced by the district attorney in Brooklyn, N.Y., Eric Gonzalez. Finally, prosecutors should recognize that lengthy mandatory sentences can be wasteful, since most people age out of the period when they’re likely to reoffend, and also don’t allow for the human capacity to change. As prosecutors know, locking people up makes them more prone to committing offenses in the future. They can lose their earning capacity and housing, leaving them worse off, often to the point of desperation. And so the community is often better served by interventions like drug or mental-health treatment, or by restorative justice approaches, in which a person who has caused harm makes amends to the victim. In some cases, the best response is to do nothing. Achieving results, of course, matters more than making promises. In Brooklyn last Friday, the police arrested Jazmine Headley as she sat on the floor of a food stamp application office because there were no available chairs. The officers yanked her 1-year-old son from her arms, and the D.A.’s office charged her with resisting arrest and other offenses. Although prosecutors agreed to release her without bail, Ms. Headley was held at Rikers Island on a warrant from New Jersey for credit card fraud. The arrest was captured on video and outrage ensued. On Tuesday, Mr. Gonzalez said he was “horrified by the violence” on the video, promised to investigate and moved to dismiss the charges. But this arrest shouldn’t have happened in the first place, and the response from the D.A. illustrates the back-and-forth between reformers on the outside and an elected prosecutor on the inside. If making jail the exception in criminal cases sounds revolutionary, it shouldn’t. In many cities and counties, misdemeanors make up about 80 percent of the criminal docket. With few exceptions, locking people up for these low-level offenses, and for felonies that don’t involve serious violence or injury, is the wrong approach. The states of California, New Jersey and New York have cut the rate of incarceration by about 25 percent even as crime has fallen at a faster pace than it has nationally. In other words, locking up fewer people has correlated with making states safer, not less safe. Nationally, the population of teenagers in detention has also dropped by half alongside a major decline in the crime rate among young people. Internationally, crime is down in developed countries where incarceration always remained relatively low. To keep people out of jail who don’t need to be there, prosecutors have to rethink whether and how they charge defendants in criminal cases. Too often, they bring the maximum charges or stack charges to gain leverage: The bigger the threatened sentence, the more reason defendants have to plead guilty rather than risk everything at trial. A fair process begins with screening cases rigorously as early as possible, so cases supported by only weak evidence can be declined or dismissed. When charges are brought, they should reflect the facts and circumstances of each case, so that they’re designed to achieve a just result, not the heaviest possible penalty. Prosecutors should also treat kids as kids. This means taking science and adolescent brain development into account, and not criminalizing typical adolescent behavior such as fistfights or infractions at school. It also means expunging juvenile records for many of the cases that are resolved or when no new charges are incurred after a few years so young people have a second chance. And it means refraining from trying people under the age of 18 as adults, except in very limited circumstances involving serious violent offenses. Prosecutors should work to end the devastating impact the justice system has on people because they’re poor, by pushing for the elimination of cash bail and fines and fees that people cannot reasonably afford to pay. D.A.s should also push to shrink the number of people — currently about five million — who are under some form of probation or parole. Excessive supervision increases the likelihood that people who are otherwise at low risk of reoffending will end up incarcerated for technical violations like breaking curfew. Some states have shortened supervision periods with no increase in reoffending. Certain criminal charges and convictions carry especially harsh consequences for immigrants, triggering detention and deportation proceedings. Being jailed before trial also increases the likelihood of being detained and deported by federal immigration officials. Entangling the local justice system in immigration enforcement erodes trust, discouraging immigrants from reporting crime and appearing as witnesses in court. To build trust, prosecutors should consider the immigration consequences of the charges they choose to bring. Too often, D.A. offices operate like a black box, with crucial decisions about charging and pleas hidden from public view. District attorneys should collect and share data so that the public can hold the system accountable. They should track the outcome of cases by race to flag disparities, findings of prosecutorial and police misconduct, and the number of people who go to jail because they can’t pay bail. They should also post data on diversion programs, incarceration rates and what all this costs taxpayers. In a democracy, people tend to value and uphold the law when they perceive it as fair. As these new D.A.s reimagine the American model of prosecution, they should be pragmatists, focused on the well-being of the communities that elected them. Fairness and safety aren’t a trade-off. They complement each other. This new corps of prosecutors can lead the way toward doing more justice with more mercy.

2018,These 5 Numbers Explain Why the French Are in the Streets,"PARIS — President Emmanuel Macron of France is facing the toughest crisis of his leadership after three weeks of violent protests across the country. “Yellow Vest” demonstrators have demanded that the government give financial relief to large parts of the population that are struggling to make ends meet. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe sought to calm the furor on Tuesday by suspending a planned fuel tax increase for six months, reversing a policy that had set off the revolt. But it’s not apparent that this single concession can clear the streets. The Yellow Vest movement — whose followers wear or display high-visibility vests used in emergencies — has morphed into a collective outcry over deeper problems that have plagued France for years: declining living standards and eroding purchasing power. Both of which have worsened in the aftermath of Europe’s long-running financial crisis. Here are some numbers that explain why France has erupted. France, like other Western countries, has seen a deep gap grow between its richest and poorest citizens. The top 20 percent of the population earns nearly five times as much as the bottom 20 percent. France’s richest 1 percent represent over 20 percent of the economy’s wealth. Yet the median monthly income is about 1,700 euros, or $1,930, meaning that half of French workers are paid less than that. Many of the Yellow Vest demonstrators are protesting how difficult it is to pay rent, feed their families and simply scrape by as living costs — most notably fuel prices — keep rising while their household incomes barely budge. It wasn’t always this way. Living standards and wages rose in France after World War II during a 30-year growth stretch known as “Les Trente Glorieuses.” Pay gains for low- and middle-income earners continued through the early 1980s, thanks to labor union collective bargaining agreements. But those dynamics unraveled as successive left-leaning French governments sought to improve competitiveness in part by compressing wage gains, according to the French economist Thomas Piketty. Average incomes for low- and middle-income earners stagnated, growing by around 1 percent a year or less. The rich got richer, as top earners saw income gains of around 3 percent a year. Increasingly generous executive pay for very high earners has helped tip the scale. French workers are still better off than those in Italy, where real wage growth has been negative since 2016. Real wages there fell 1.1 percent between the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2017, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. But while real hourly wages are rising in France, that growth has come slowly, even more so since the end of the eurozone debt crisis in 2012. France is the third biggest economy in Europe after Britain and Germany, and the world’s sixth largest before adjusting for inflation. Visitors to Paris can come away with the impression that the glitz of the French capital means the rest of the nation is just as well off. But French economic growth was stagnant for nearly a decade during Europe’s long-running debt crisis and had only recently begun to improve. The quality of the recovery has been uneven. Large numbers of permanent jobs were wiped out, especially in rural and former industrial areas. And many of the new jobs being created are precarious temporary contracts. Growth is key to improving working conditions for those who have been protesting. But while a nascent economic recovery before Mr. Macron took office has helped generate jobs, growth has cooled to a 1.8 percent annual pace, in tandem with a slowdown in the rest of the eurozone. The growth slowdown makes it harder to resolve another French problem: the large numbers of people out of work. Unemployment in France has been stuck between 9 percent and 11 percent since 2009, when the debt crisis hit Europe. Joblessness has drifted back down to 9.1 percent today from 10.1 percent when Mr. Macron was elected. But it is still more than double the level in Germany. Mr. Macron promised to lower unemployment to 7 percent by the next presidential election in 2022, and has acknowledged that a failure to do so could fan the flames of populism. But to achieve that, the economy would have to grow by at least 1.7 percent in each of the next four years, which is by no means certain, according to the French Economic Observatory, an independent research group. Mr. Macron has tried to re-energize the French economy. This year, he demanded an aggressive overhaul of the nation’s rigid labor code to help employers set the rules on hiring and firing, and bypass longstanding restraints that discourage employers from hiring new workers. The provisions also limit unions’ ability to delay change, by allowing individual agreements to be negotiated at the company or industry level between bosses and workers. Those reforms have helped draw companies like Facebook and Google to France. But they could take years to show results for average workers. And the reforms have angered workers who see a plot to strip them of hard-won labor rights in favor of big business. As part of his plan to stimulate the economy, Mr. Macron cut taxes for France’s wealthiest taxpayers during his first year in office, including by creating a flat tax for capital income. But the centerpiece of the tax package, and the one that has drawn the most ire from protesters, did away with a wealth tax that applied to many assets of France’s richest households, replacing it with one that applied only to their real estate holdings. That lowered by €3.2 billion, or $3.6 billion, the amount of revenue the state received this year. There has been little evidence of a stimulus effect. Instead, Mr. Macron has earned a reputation for favoring the rich — one of the biggest sources of anger among the Yellow Vest protesters. While high earners have enjoyed tax breaks under Mr. Macron’s fiscal plan, purchasing power fell last year for the bottom 5 percent of households. The majority in the middle, about 70 percent, saw no gain or pain either way, according to the French Economic Observatory. Even before the Yellow Vests took to the streets, Mr. Macron realized that support was withering, and his government tried to pivot toward those left behind in the previous round of tax cuts. His 2019 budget, unveiled in October, will grant breaks next year worth €6 billion for middle- and low-income earners. It also includes an €18.8 billion reduction in payroll and other business taxes to encourage hiring and investment. While polls show that the Yellow Vests have the backing of three-quarters of the population, questions have swirled about how much pain the protesters are really experiencing — or how much of the outpouring can be chalked up to a centuries-old culture of demonstrating against change. France protects citizens with one of the most generous social safety nets in the world, with over one-third of its economic output spent on welfare protection, more than any other country in Europe. In 2016, France spent around €715 billion on health care, family benefits and unemployment, among other support. To get that help, French workers pay some of the highest taxes in Europe. While taxes are greatest on upper-income earners, France also has a value added tax of 20 percent on most goods and services. Together with the fuel tax that Mr. Macron’s government just vowed to suppress temporarily, such measures tend to hurt the poor, while the wealthy barely notice them.",The New York Times
2018,These Celebrities Actually Want to Host the Oscars,"It’s been more than a week since Kevin Hart was announced as host of the 91st Oscars ceremony and then stepped down in response to criticism over homophobic Twitter posts. The Motion Picture Academy still hasn’t found a replacement. That’s because it’s a thankless job. As a recent “Saturday Night Live” skit put it: “Who will risk everything for the chance to gain nothing?” No wonder many celebrities would rather not put their reputations on the line when the gig draws so much criticism. While there’s a chance the academy will go on with no one at all, the world hasn’t given up just yet. Many stars have suggested names. Some have even nominated themselves. If the academy had to choose a host, here are the brave people who would be happy to take up the challenge. After Hart said he was out, Nick Kroll and John Mulaney, the stars of “The Oh, Hello Show,” jokingly announced on Twitter that they, or rather, their aging Upper West Side alter egos George and Gil, had been chosen to replace him. And they’re taking the job very seriously. Let’s be clear: The academy has not offered the role to Kroll and Mulaney. (At least, not yet.) One Twitter commentator bristled at the prank, to which the comedians responded, “Baseless attacks like this from the media are the reason people are afraid to pretend to host the Oscars.” In an episode of “The View,” the four-time Oscar host Whoopi Goldberg said she thought forgoing a host altogether is a “dumb idea.” She then suggested that the academy consider her for the fifth time, despite the fact that she thinks she is also “problematic.” She explained: “Half of the country sometimes is really mad at me. The other half is O.K. until tomorrow, and then they’re pissed at me!” Goldberg revisited the host question later that week during a segment on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” when she nominated the actor Ken Jeong. “He would be brilliant,” she said. “And it would also constitute the first Asian-American to host the Oscars.” That same night, Jeong was a guest on “Late Night With Seth Meyers,” and he unabashedly declared: “If I do not become the host of the Oscars, I will consider not only my career but my life a failure.” Jeong later told TMZ he would be happy to be considered for any role during the ceremony: “It would be an honor to cater the Oscars! It’d be an honor to be a medic on set! I’d do that for $3.” (After all, he’s more or less qualified: Jeong was a doctor before going into show business.) On Dec. 6, the actress and late-night host Busy Philipps succinctly offered to take Hart’s place, writing on Twitter, “I AM AVAILABLE.” On Dec. 7, she reiterated: “I will say this again. I AM TECH AVAIL.” Later that day, Philipps nominated herself for the third time and suggested six other women for the job. A few days later, Philipps made yet another plea: “I host a late-night show four nights a week now. This has all been a ruse to practice for the big night. I should be the host!” One of the most embarrassing moments in Oscar history was when the academy went without a host in 1989. Viewers still remember the “nightmare” opening number by Rob Lowe and Eileen Bowman, who played a giggly Snow White. Despite that debacle, Lowe has offered to host again — this time as his laughable plastic surgeon character from the Liberace biography “Behind the Candelabra.” If anyone has taken the Oscar host question to heart, it’s Patton Oswalt. It all started when Stephen King endorsed the comedian for the job. “He’s funny, sharp-tongued, and he knows film,” the author wrote on Twitter. (Steve Carell seconded that choice.) When TMZ approached Oswalt with the idea, he said “of course” he would host if offered — just not right now. “I would hire Tiffany Haddish or Billy Eichner; use me in the future,” he said. It didn’t stop there. Shortly after, Oswalt, who has emceed an awards show for the Writers Guild of America, wrote a very lengthy Facebook post in which he listed his candidates for the job and explained why he thought he wasn’t a good choice. “When I hosted the WGA Awards last year, I pleaded during my opening monologue that NEXT year’s WGA Awards needed to be a woman or POC or LGBTQ or all three or ANYTHING but another straight white male,” Oswalt wrote. “Us straight white males, despite what certain Twitter accounts say, are doing fine.” The “Evil Dead” star has fought countless monsters in B-movie thrillers. But can he handle the academy? Even before Hart stepped down, the stand-up comic Rhea Butcher raised her hand and showed off her Oscar-worthy wardrobe. When Hart actually dropped out the next day, Butcher took to Twitter again: “HOW ABOUT A LGBTQIA+ ONE I LOOK GREAT IN A TUX.” The comedy writer Megan Amram (“The Good Place”) has made it her life’s mission to win an Emmy. In her web series, “An Emmy for Megan,” Amram meets the minimum requirements to qualify for a nomination in the short form comedy or drama series category. But as per recent rule changes, her series no longer makes the cut. So she’s looking to the Oscars. The “Gilmore Girls” actor is advocating a populist vote. Remember Tom Green, of “The Tom Green Show”? The Canadian comic has been fairly quiet in recent years. But last week he saw an opportunity to resurface his name in the cultural conversation. Given Green’s track record as an outrageous prankster, it’s safe to say the academy will probably pass on his offer. After all, who needs a wild card onstage after the 2017 envelope mix-up?",The New York Times
2018,These Democrats Will Soon Have the Power to Investigate the White House. How Far Will They Go?,"Feature In two weeks, congressional Democrats will return to Washington with the authority to investigate a White House that is suspected of foreign collusion, conflicts of interest and mismanagement of the federal government. From left, Jerrold Nadler, Adam Schiff and Elijah Cummings.CreditCreditBobby Doherty for The New York Times At noon on Jan. 3, the 435 members of the House of Representatives of the 116th Congress will convene for the first time in the Capitol. The chaplain will offer a prayer, the clerk will lead the chamber in the Pledge of Allegiance and a roll-call vote will be held to elect Nancy Pelosi speaker of the House. Then the new speaker will grasp the gavel and swear in the representatives-elect — their right hands raised, some of them clutching Bibles or Torahs or Qurans in their left. There will be speeches and family photos and, among the Democrats, who will now be in the majority, much celebration. But before any of that happens, Representative Elijah Cummings will have sent out letters. One letter will have been jointly addressed to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, demanding the age, gender, country of origin and current location of every child who was separated from his or her parents under the Trump administration’s immigration policy. Another will have gone to Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel, asking for the identities of any senior White House officials who have used — as Hillary Clinton once did — nongovernment email accounts to conduct official business. The White House chief of staff will have received a letter, also addressed to the heads of multiple federal agencies, requesting information and documents about the use of government-owned aircraft for personal travel and private aircraft for official travel. Outside the government, the Trump Organization will have received one asking for a complete accounting of all the payments it has received from foreign governments or foreign-government-owned entities since Donald Trump’s election. Each letter will have been written on stationery bearing the seal of the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and signed with Cummings’s looping signature over the word: “Chairman-designate.” Elected to the House in 1996, Cummings, 67, represents a majority-African-American district anchored in Baltimore. He is a son of two former sharecroppers turned Pentecostal ministers; his bald head and booming baritone project a ministerial — and authoritative — presence. Until now, Cummings’s greatest national renown came in 2015: During the riots that followed Freddie Gray’s death from injuries he sustained in a Baltimore police van, Fox News broadcast live coverage of the congressman walking through the city’s streets, bullhorn in hand, urging calm and shouting at protesters to go home. “I’m not trying to do anything extraordinary,” Cummings told me of the letters. “I’m trying to do what the Constitution says I’m supposed to do.” It was election night, and he was at a small party in Baltimore, where he had just been informed by a colleague, Representative John Sarbanes of Maryland, that the networks were declaring that Democrats would have a majority in the House of Representatives for the first time since 2011. “Mr. Chairman!” Sarbanes said in breaking the news. The midterm results effectively brought an end to Trump’s legislative agenda, or at least the parts of it that Democrats find objectionable. But the victory gives Democrats little legislative power of their own. If by some miracle any Democrat-authored House bill makes it through the Republican-controlled Senate, Trump’s veto pen awaits. What the House Democrats will have, however, is oversight authority: the ability to hold hearings and request documents and, if necessary, issue subpoenas to uncover and expose all the incompetence and misconduct and outright corruption that they suspect permeates the executive branch under the current occupant of the White House. “Make no mistake, Democrats will honor our constitutional responsibility to exercise oversight of the Trump administration and get the American people the answers they deserve,” Pelosi said in a statement. “Voters delivered a check and balance on the president that will hold him and his administration accountable for the abuses of power and culture of corruption that have consumed Washington.” Trump is already besieged by the investigation led by Robert Mueller, the special counsel, into Russian interference in the 2016 elections and by multiple probes by the United States attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York into his family business. In January, he will face a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives that suddenly has the power to open a third investigative front against him — power that will reside, in large part, in Cummings’s office. That power is both broad and subtle. The Oversight and Government Reform Committee’s mandate is investigation, across the whole range of federal government operations — and even into the private sector. (The three-year congressional investigation into the use of steroids in Major League Baseball in the 2000s was a House Oversight production.) Other committees have the power to investigate, too, but none have so expansive a remit. “Oversight,” says former Representative Henry Waxman of California, the Democratic chairman of the committee from 2007 to 2009, “has jurisdiction over the world.” This has given Cummings’s predecessors a unique ability to shape the public perception of recent presidencies — particularly when, as will be the case in January, it is a president of the other party. Many of the familiar details of the George W. Bush administration’s outing of the covert C.I.A. agent Valerie Plame, emergency-response failures during Hurricane Katrina and disastrous reconstruction of Iraq were ferreted out by Waxman, who led the Oversight and Government Reform Committee for the last two years of Bush’s second term. The congressional investigations of the Obama administration — into claims that the Internal Revenue Service targeted Tea Party groups and that the Justice Department allowed guns to be illegally trafficked across the Mexican border — that dominated Fox News chyrons after Republicans took back the House in 2011 were started by Waxman’s Republican successor, Darrell Issa. As a rule, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee is a sleepy place when the same party controls Congress and the White House. But even by these standards, the committee’s performance during the first two years of the Trump administration has been unusual. Under the chairmanship of Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah and then, after Chaffetz resigned in June 2017 and took a job at Fox News, Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, the committee essentially turned a blind eye toward the executive branch. On matters big (like the firing of the F.B.I. director, James Comey, or the administration’s botched response to Hurricane Maria) and comparatively small (like Trump’s decision to revoke the security clearance of the former C.I.A. director John Brennan), the Oversight Committee did not seem interested in doing much real oversight. “If the president’s party on Capitol Hill becomes subservient to the executive branch and just becomes an appendage of that, then Congress basically loses its meaning,” Tom Davis, the Virginia Republican who was chairman of the committee during part of Bush’s presidency, from 2003 to 2007, told me. “We turn into a parliamentary operation.” Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, puts it even more bluntly. “Looking back over the first two years of the administration,” he says, “I can’t point to a single example, House or Senate, where any committee or subcommittee actually fulfilled its role of doing oversight.” Over the past two years, as the committee’s ranking member, Cummings issued 64 subpoena requests; they were requests because the minority party can’t issue subpoenas without the majority’s approval. Chaffetz and Gowdy rejected them all. And even when Chaffetz or Gowdy did ask the Trump administration for information, they didn’t push very hard. “I was able to get them to jointly request documents that we needed to do our job,” Cummings told me, “but when the administration basically said, ‘Screw you’ — and the administration basically said that to every request — they refused to back it up with a subpoena.” Indeed, the first requests Cummings will send out as the incoming Oversight chairman — the letters about family separation, nongovernment emails and government-owned aircraft for personal travel — will be those that Chaffetz and Gowdy jointly sent with him over the past two years and that the administration largely ignored. At the time, Cummings counseled his Republican colleagues to put aside the politics of the moment and to think long-term. “I get in these guys’ ears, and I talk to them heart to heart,” Cummings says. “I told them, ‘Trump is 72. I’m 67. You all are still young guys. Why are you trying to carry this guy’s water? After he’s dead, you’re going to be living with this [expletive].’ ” Congress’s oversight responsibilities originated from an incident on Nov. 4, 1791, when a 1,400-soldier military expedition led by Arthur St. Clair, then governor of the Northwest Territory and a former general officer in the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War, was routed in what is now Ohio by a confederacy of warriors from three Native American tribes. Nearly 700 soldiers were killed and 300 wounded. The House of Representatives established a select committee to investigate the defeat and authorized it to “call for such persons, papers and records as may be necessary to assist their inquiries.” President George Washington was initially concerned that Congress had overstepped its bounds. But after Washington’s cabinet — including Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton — unanimously counseled him otherwise, he agreed to cooperate with the investigation, turning over the documents that had been requested. In the 226 years since the committee investigated — and ultimately absolved — St. Clair, Congress has performed its oversight and investigative functions with varying degrees of enthusiasm, competence and responsibility. For every Senate investigation into the Teapot Dome scandal — which brought down Albert Fall, Warren Harding’s secretary of the interior, in 1923 for accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes from oil barons — there’s Senator Joseph McCarthy’s use of his chairmanship of the Committee on Government Operations in the 1950s to search for Communists in the government. In the decades after Watergate, both the Senate and the House conducted rigorous, and bipartisan, investigations into topics including intelligence-agency abuses and military-procurement fraud, producing meaningful reforms in the process. That heyday came to an end, however, when Republicans took back the House in 1995, giving them control of it for the first time in 40 years. Once Newt Gingrich was installed as House speaker, he merged several House committees with responsibilities to monitor government agencies into a single panel, naming it the Government Reform and Oversight Committee. The new committee had the broadest oversight jurisdiction of any in Congress — a power Gingrich quickly weaponized against the Clinton administration. He filled over half the G.O.P.’s committee seats with freshmen who arrived on the wave of his Republican revolution, and in 1997 made Representative Dan Burton of Indiana its chairman. An ardent Clinton foe, Burton had already proposed investigating the suicide of the deputy White House counsel Vince Foster — Burton infamously conducted amateur forensics tests, reportedly by shooting melons in his backyard — and how much money the White House was spending on postage to respond to letters that children had written to the Clintons’ pet cat, Socks. In his six years as chairman, Burton issued more than 1,000 unilateral subpoenas and demanded everything down to the White House holiday-card list. But his Javert act ultimately became too much even for Republicans. For all his exertions, Burton proved unable to find concrete evidence of serious wrongdoing on the part of the Clinton administration. He repeatedly undermined himself, as in 1998 when one of his top aides — Trump’s future deputy campaign manager David Bossie — released transcripts of the jailhouse phone conversations of Hillary Clinton’s old law partner and former Associate Attorney General Webb Hubbell, who was convicted of fraud for overbilling clients, that seemed to implicate Clinton in the overbilling. Democrats later showed that the transcripts had been misleadingly edited, and Bossie was pressured to resign. “We’d just put our foot out,” recalls Henry Waxman, who was the top Democrat on the committee during Burton’s chairmanship, “and he’d trip over it.” Gingrich eventually stopped giving sensitive investigative assignments to Burton’s Oversight Committee. In 2003, Tom Davis took over as the Oversight Committee chairman and established what became the standard mode of low-key defense when the chairman’s own party is in the White House. “I had to show the party flag,” Davis says of fighting off some Democratic demands for investigations of the Bush administration. But when it came to big issues — like the Bush administration’s slow and poorly executed response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 or the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff’s contacts with President Bush and other White House officials — Davis, much to the consternation of some of his fellow Republicans, led rigorous investigations. “He had a concern about oversight,” Waxman says, “and he thought the questions we wanted to pursue were legitimate and worthwhile.” After Democrats took back the House in the 2006 midterms, Waxman became Oversight Committee chairman. He was an aggressive but careful investigator; unlike Burton, he didn’t initiate an inquiry at the first whiff of scandal, nor did he succumb to some of his Democratic constituents’ blood lust. “I’d go to some of the Democratic clubs back home, and people would say, ‘Why haven’t you imprisoned George W. Bush?’ ” Waxman recalls. “I had to tell them we don’t have the power to imprison people. There was a widespread belief that there’s a prison right there in the Capitol.” But Waxman’s investigations into the failures of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, profiteering by the military contractor Blackwater and the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s dangerous policy of housing families displaced by Hurricane Katrina in trailers with unhealthful levels of formaldehyde, among others, harked back to the heyday of post-Watergate oversight. His hearings calling executives from A.I.G. and Lehman Brothers to testify about their role in the 2008 financial crisis helped lay the groundwork for Congress’s most substantial attempt in decades to rein in the financial sector, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. One of Waxman’s most trusted lieutenants on the Oversight Committee was Cummings, who proved so adept at political theater that Waxman and his staff often relied on him to ask the most crucial questions of hostile witnesses testifying before the committee. Even today, Oversight veterans speak in awed tones about a 2007 hearing when Cummings questioned the State Department’s inspector general, Howard Krongard, about claims that he impeded a federal investigation into Blackwater. During testimony, Cummings informed Krongard that committee staff had discovered that Krongard’s brother was at a Blackwater advisory board meeting in Williamsburg, Va.: “This meeting is taking place right now,” Cummings said, “as we speak.” Krongard resigned from the State Department a few weeks later. “It was like a Perry Mason moment,” Waxman says. During their years in the minority, Cummings and his roughly 35-person committee staff, led by its director, David Rapallo, became skilled at conducting investigations without much political or legal leverage. In 2017, a Democratic investigator for the Oversight Committee, scrutinizing Michael Flynn, Trump’s first national-security adviser, reviewed Flynn’s 2016 security clearance renewal application and noticed that Flynn took a trip to Saudi Arabia in 2015 — during which he claimed to stay at a hotel that did not exist and to attend a conference that did not occur. Robert Mueller went on to investigate Flynn’s suspected efforts to broker a $100 billion energy deal between Saudi Arabia and Russia’s nuclear-power agency. Combing through the unpublished supporting evidence of an inspector general’s report, Democratic committee staff found emails that appeared to show that Trump, in spite of his own denials, had ordered the reversal of plans to move the F.B.I. headquarters to a suburban location and off Pennsylvania Avenue, where it currently sits across from the Trump Hotel — a reversal that would benefit his hotel by preventing commercial developers from building a competing property across the street. “The Cummings people did a lot of great investigative work without formal tools,” says Phil Barnett, who was the staff director of the Oversight Committee under Waxman. “Now they will have formal tools.” In September, Pelosi invited Cummings to her Capitol office, along with two other Democratic congressmen who, if the party won the House in November, would become chairmen of committees with powerful investigative mandates: New York’s Jerrold Nadler, of the Judiciary Committee, and California’s Adam Schiff, of the Intelligence Committee. There they were joined by several Democratic representatives who worked previously as prosecutors: Joe Kennedy of Massachusetts, Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland and Eric Swalwell of California. Pelosi told the group that they shouldn’t take the outcome of the midterms for granted. At the same time, she said, the Democrats needed to begin thinking about how they would conduct oversight of the Trump administration — and the strategizing needed to start now. Like Cummings, Nadler and Schiff chafed at their committees’ Republican chairmen’s lack of interest and outright interference during the Trump presidency. Mueller’s investigators have spent months building an increasingly sweeping case about Russian meddling in the 2016 elections, implicating and indicting several of Trump’s closest associates to date. But under the chairmanship of the Republican Devin Nunes of California, the House Intelligence Committee — which has a clear constitutional authority to conduct some of the same investigatory work as Mueller — produced a report that breezily concluded that there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government and that, contrary to the official consensus of the American intelligence community, the Russian government was not even seeking to help elect Trump. Committee Democrats said they were shut out of the drafting process and publicly condemned the report. Nunes also initiated parallel investigations of the F.B.I. and the Justice Department for what he claimed was “criminal activity and fraudulent behavior” in an effort to hurt Trump’s campaign — investigations that Schiff contends actively sought to thwart exactly the kind of oversight the committee was supposed to be doing. “I think that the mission for the chairman has been protecting the White House, protecting the president and furthering a political narrative which is completely at odds with the facts,” Schiff told me. When Immigration and Customs Enforcement, following a new and unprecedented Trump administration policy, separated more than 2,300 immigrant children from their families at the Southern border this spring, the Republican-led Judiciary Committee did not hold a single oversight hearing for Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, whose agency falls under the committee’s oversight jurisdiction. Other committees, too, had their own lists of Trump-administration oversight oversights: the Natural Resources Committee’s lack of interest in Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke’s suspected ethical and managerial misdeeds, which have been the subject of at least 17 federal investigations, for instance; or the Veterans Affairs Committee’s refusal to look into whether three Trump friends, all Mar-a-Lago members, improperly influenced a $10 billion contract to modernize veterans’ health care records. “The oversight job, after two years of Donald Trump,” says Representative Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat who serves on both the Oversight and Judiciary Committees, “is like coming upon a 73-car pileup on the highway.” With so many targets, and so many hungry Democrats, “there’s the potential for oversight fratricide next year,” says a senior Democratic official on the Intelligence Committee, noting the overlapping jurisdictions of the various committees. There’s also the potential for distraction. “The question is, do you want to be the Breaking News Committee that just investigates the issue of the day?” asks Swalwell, who sits on the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees. “Or do you want to look at broader, longstanding core issues?” At that September meeting and at multiple gatherings of members and their staffs over the subsequent weeks and months, an initial strategy — and a division of labor — began to take shape. Schiff, the incoming Intelligence Committee chairman, will play a major role. One of his top priorities will be protecting — and assisting — Mueller’s investigation, and one of his first acts in the new Congress will be trying to get to the bottom of one of the more tantalizing mysteries of the whole Russia affair: Whom did Donald Trump Jr. speak to on his phone in between calls setting up the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russians peddling dirt on Hillary Clinton? Trump Jr. claims he can’t remember, and the call appears as a blocked number on his phone records. Nunes refused to ask Trump Jr.’s cellular provider for the blocked number. “That phone call may lead to a place the Republicans didn’t want to go,” Schiff says, “and so they were unwilling to get the answer.” Schiff wants the answer and will press the provider for it. Nunes’s investigation may not have produced much, but under his leadership, the committee did conduct hundreds of hours of interviews: with Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Roger Stone and other key figures in the Russia matter. On Nunes’s orders, almost all the transcripts have remained in the sole possession of the committee, which has, among other things, kept them out of the hands of Mueller’s investigators. Schiff plans to publicly release the remaining transcripts when the new Congress convenes in January. In November, Michael Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer, pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about a Moscow real estate project Trump pursued. Cohen was caught by Mueller’s investigators only because he publicly released his opening statement to the Intelligence Committee. Referring to the unreleased transcripts, Swalwell told me: “I just wonder how many more crimes are just sitting in the basement of the House Intelligence Committee that Mueller doesn’t know about because he hasn’t seen that they lied to us.” Schiff is also interested in examining Trump’s business dealings — including whether Russians laundered money through the Trump Organization — from a counterintelligence perspective. “What would be most compromising to our nation and our national security is if a hostile foreign power has leverage over the president of the United States,” Schiff told me. Or as the senior Democratic Intelligence Committee official says: “Whenever Putin is alone in a room with Trump with just the two of them and their translators, like they were in Helsinki, is Putin reminding him that he has an Excel spreadsheet of how many rubles are parked in Trump Tower?” One afternoon in late November, Nadler, the incoming Judiciary Committee chairman, was in his congressional office. The walls were bare, save some exposed nails. All the pictures and framed bills that once hung on them were piled in a plastic-lined dumpster in the reception area — “Jerry’s bucket of achievements,” Daniel Schwarz, Nadler’s communications director, joked. Nadler was in the process of moving to a space closer to the Judiciary Committee’s offices. The congressman from the Upper West Side became the top Democrat on the committee in December 2017 after John Conyers, the long-serving Michigan representative, resigned from Congress over sexual-harassment claims. Nadler has been a Trump bête noire since the 1980s, when, as an assemblyman, he fought to prevent Trump from building a proposed 150-story building in his district, where Trump hoped to live in an apartment on the top floor. After his election to Congress in 1992, Nadler made sure Trump didn’t receive federal mortgage guarantees for the project. “I didn’t want him to be the tallest man in the world there,” Nadler told me. Trump described Nadler in his 2000 book, “The America We Deserve,” as “one of the most egregious hacks in contemporary politics.” The Judiciary Committee is endowed with the authority to start impeachment proceedings against a president, as committee Republicans did against Bill Clinton in 1998, and as committee Democrats did against Nixon in 1973. Nadler is thus probably the committee chairman most likely to find himself caught between the expectations of the Democratic base and the political and institutional realities their representatives are now subject to. “If they’re successful at doing their jobs, then they’ll bring forth more information about Trump’s wrongdoing, and the logical conclusion will be impeachment,” says Kevin Mack, lead strategist for the liberal billionaire Tom Steyer’s group Need to Impeach, which has gathered nearly 6.5 million signatures supporting Trump’s impeachment. And if Democrats don’t impeach Trump? “What you’re saying by not attempting to stand up for the rule of law is that the rule of law is not the most important thing to you,” Steyer told me. “Complaining about something is not doing something about it.” When Nadler ran to succeed Conyers as the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, his pitch included a leaflet he wrote and distributed to his fellow Democrats, which said that he was “our strongest member to lead a potential impeachment.” Since clinching the chairmanship, however, Nadler has become much more circumspect, at least publicly, about impeachment. “It’s too early,” he told me in November. “It’s a very momentous step. It has real consequences.” Even if Robert Mueller or congressional Democrats uncover what he concludes are impeachable offenses, Nadler told me, he would want to begin impeachment proceedings only if he believes that, by the end of the process, there would be an “appreciable fraction of the Trump voters” who support Trump’s impeachment. “You don’t want to tear the country apart,” Nadler said. “You don’t want a situation where for the next 30 years half the country is saying, ‘We won the election; you stole it from us.’ ” He added an interesting caveat, however: “Now notice I didn’t say an appreciable fraction of Republican senators. It’s the Trump voters. Because it might be — I’m not saying it is, but it might be — that the Republican Party becomes so one-sided, or such a cult group in effect, that no matter what the evidence is, no matter what the malfeasances are, they” — Republican senators — “would never agree to break from the president.” Still, as he sat in his emptying office, Nadler did not sound like someone eager to lead a potential impeachment. “The fact that you find impeachable offenses and the fact that you think you can prove impeachable offenses,” he said, “doesn’t necessarily mean the offenses rise to the level of importance where you should impeach.” When I spoke to Nadler a couple of weeks later, after federal prosecutors said that Trump directed Michael Cohen to make payments in violation of campaign-finance laws to squelch a sex scandal, he still sounded cautious. “I don’t think things have changed, really,” Nadler said. “We know a little more, but there’s a lot more to know.” In the days after the election, Nadler began firing off “preservation letters” to the White House, the Justice Department and other agencies warning them that “concealing, removing or destroying” any documents related to Jeff Sessions’s firing or Mueller’s investigation “may constitute a crime.” In January, the committee’s first order of business, Nadler said, will be to call Matthew Whitaker, the acting attorney general, to testify; Whitaker, who has a thin legal résumé, was tapped by Trump to replace Sessions and will hold the job until the official nominee for attorney general, William Barr, is confirmed by the Senate. From the moment Whitaker was appointed, Nadler told me, “It was clear that Trump wanted him to be his hatchet man.” When Whitaker comes before the committee, Nadler said, he will ask him: “Have you told Mueller not to follow some line of inquiry? Have you told him not to indict somebody? What instructions have you given to him, if any? Have you communicated with the White House about these matters in any way or with the president’s lawyers in any way? What have you told them? Those kinds of questions.” Nadler’s to-do list goes far beyond Whitaker. There is the Justice Department’s decision not to defend the Affordable Care Act in a lawsuit brought by Republican state attorneys general; the Trump administration’s family-separation policy; whether the White House improperly interfered with the F.B.I.’s background check into Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. “In the last two years, the Republicans in Congress, their basic idea has been: Let the Trump administration do what it wants, let there be no oversight,” Nadler said. In a normal presidency, this would have been problematic, but with Trump in the White House, Nadler argued, “there are real challenges to the democratic norms that we haven’t seen the likes of since the Civil War.” The result, he said, is that “we have a real crisis now.” On the last Thursday in November, the House Oversight Committee held what was most likely its final hearing of the year, and Cummings’s final hearing as the ranking member. It was devoted to the 2017 hurricane season and the Trump administration’s response to Hurricane Maria, and Cummings believed it was long overdue. He initially asked Gowdy to hold hearings on the matter back in September 2017, nine days after Maria devastated Puerto Rico. Gowdy refused and continued to turn down requests for a hearing for more than a year. Now Gowdy had finally scheduled the hearing in the lame-duck session on a day Democrats were holding their leadership elections. As a result, when the hearing began, only six of the committee’s 41 members were present. “Our Republican colleagues have promised to accommodate us, and I appreciate it,” Cummings said when it was his turn to speak, “but they would not move the hearing to a different day, and they would not even move up the start time by 30 minutes so we could ask Administrator Long our questions.” He was referring to the head of FEMA, Brock Long, who was testifying that day. He lit into Gowdy. “I greatly respect the chairman, as a person, as an attorney and as a friend, but this is not transparency, this is not accountability and this is certainly not oversight.” If Cummings is perceptive of the tactics being used against him to defend a president, it’s because, not so long ago, he was the one doing the protecting. He became the top Democrat on the committee when Republicans took back the House in the 2010 midterms, and the new chairman, Darrell Issa, promised to hold hundreds of hearings into the Obama administration. Cummings was the first line of defense against the coming investigative onslaught. “Mr. Cummings was very smart and deliberate and methodical, and was a perfect foil to Darrell,” says Kurt Bardella, Issa’s former spokesman and later a spokesman for Breitbart, who last year renounced the G.O.P. and became a Democrat. Cummings batted back Republicans’ most incendiary charges against Obama by pointing to the lack of any real evidence, and repeatedly provoked Issa into own goals, like the time Issa received negative coverage for ordering Cummings’s microphone cut off when Cummings tried to make a statement at the end of a hearing. Cummings proved a similarly effective opponent to Gowdy on the special committee investigating the 2012 attack on the United States mission in Benghazi, Libya — which Gowdy led and on which Cummings was the top Democrat — and then to Chaffetz, who succeeded Issa as Oversight Committee chairman. Cummings’s friends are quick to point out that Issa, Chaffetz and Gowdy will not be serving in the next Congress. “They all quit after having to deal with Elijah!” Waxman says. “Darrell pursued headlines,” Bardella told me. “He wanted visibility and publicity.” During the Trump presidency, he argues, “Cummings can focus on substance, and the reality is, they have so much more to work with on substance than we did. Our approach was, there could be corruption, there could be waste, fraud and abuse. We already know those things exist with Trump. There’s no fishing expedition required.” And yet, those Obama-era investigations made an indelible mark on politics. Congressional Republicans may never have been able to prove that Obama’s I.R.S. unfairly singled out Tea Party groups for scrutiny; or that Eric Holder tried to hide the facts about a failed Justice Department investigation into gunrunning along the Mexican border, called Fast and Furious, that resulted in the death of a Border Patrol agent; or that Hillary Clinton, as secretary of state, tried to cover up a bungled response to the Benghazi attack — but you might not know this if you spend much time on conservative media or the Trump rally circuit. Burton’s probing of the Clinton administration occurred in the old-media landscape of the 1990s, when the expectations of the press — and of the public — were that for a congressional investigation to be considered successful, it needed to produce the factual goods. But Issa and his successors, by virtue of right-wing-media megaphones like Fox News (which was in its infancy during the Clinton years) and Breitbart, were able to conduct investigations as a kind of post-truth theater, where proving charges was less important than making them, loudly and repeatedly. By the time of the 2016 presidential campaign, a Fairleigh Dickinson University survey found that 44 percent of Republicans and a full half of Trump supporters believed it was “definitely true” that “as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton knew the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi was going to be attacked and did nothing to protect it.” The challenge of conducting oversight in this post-truth political environment is not lost on Cummings and other Democrats. “I watch Fox News every now and then,” Cummings told me, “and the reason why I watch Fox News is, I’m trying to see how they can twist things around and make them sound so like the Democrats have some conspiracy against the president — and they do a good job of it.” Democrats worry about what will happen if they turn up concrete evidence of presidential wrongdoing in their investigations and a sizable portion of the electorate simply refuses to believe it. It’s also very likely that Trump, having already broken so many other norms, will have few qualms about breaking the norm of cooperating, or even feigning cooperation, with congressional investigations. “If the president treats the Congress the way he has Bob Mueller, we can expect the administration to respond to many of our requests with stonewalling and invective,” Schiff says. “It’s very possible the administration will decide they’re not going to compromise on anything, and litigate everything.” David Bossie, the Dan Burton aide who stepped down for misleadingly editing and releasing the Hubbell transcripts, remains an informal adviser to Trump; he has gone so far as to suggest in a recent interview with Jacqueline Alemany of The Washington Post that the White House should encourage people subpoenaed by House Democrats to plead the fifth or even flee the country. Congressional Republicans have also sent a message by picking Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, perhaps Trump’s most staunch and outspoken defender on Capitol Hill, to serve as the top Republican on the Oversight Committee. “When the caucus picked Jordan,” Tom Davis says, “they really picked confrontation.” The most disheartening prospect for Democrats is what that confrontation could ultimately reveal: just how little leverage — political and legal — a divided Congress has in a fight with a president like Trump. If Trump administration officials refuse to comply with subpoenas, Democrats could vote to hold them in contempt of Congress. But that’s a largely toothless gesture. Even if the House does succumb to the Democratic base’s desire and impeaches Trump, the G.O.P.-controlled Senate would almost certainly never convict. What’s more, impeachment could backfire. “You don’t want to reward an offender like the president with martyrdom,” Eric Swalwell, who’s currently exploring his own presidential run in 2020, told me. “That would be the worst outcome — that he gets more popular, that his base grows because of it.” Surveying the task ahead of him, Cummings says, “This will be one of the hardest things I’ve ever done.” On a recent afternoon, he sat in his congressional office and contemplated the possibility that he’d fall short. In the past year and a half, Cummings was hospitalized for nearly five months because of a serious knee infection and complications from a heart-valve replacement. “My saddest thought,” he said, “is that there will be damage done which will not be corrected during my lifetime and perhaps for a long time.” Democrats realize that they’ll have to wage their battle in the court of public opinion — and Cummings believes that will require eventually winning over at least some of his Republican colleagues to his side. “There is one incentive for them: love of country and democracy,” he said. “We have to try to help them get there. We have to try to help their constituents see what they’re doing and what they’re not doing and try to bring them back to some sense of normalcy.” Seated at the top of the dais in the Oversight Committee hearing room at the sparsely attended hearings into Hurricane Maria last month, Cummings tried to get a head start on doing just that. He noted how FEMA hadn’t been responsive to his entreaties for information over the last two years. He told Long, the FEMA head, that his attitude would have to change and that he expected answers to a new a batch of questions before the end of the year — after which Cummings would be the one holding the gavel. “I guarantee you, Administrator Long,” Cummings said, raising his hand and pointing a long, knobby finger, “this hearing will not be your last before this committee.”",The New York Times
2018,These Men Are Waiting to Share Some Feelings With You,"In meetings and retreats, chastened menfolk are working stuff out. On a Monday night in a sparsely decorated room in Midtown Manhattan, a group of approximately 20 men including an endocrinologist, a sportscaster, a policeman and an employee of the United Nations were baring their souls. “I’ve been digging deep with my girlfriend and we are having those talks about moving forward in our relationship, and I’m having nights where I can’t sleep,” said Andrew Cummings, 44, an opera singer in New York who has performed at Carnegie Hall. “I’m angry that my health is deteriorating. I’m not ready to be an old man,” said Jeff Nichols, 70, a former consultant. “I’m checking in with some anger. I didn’t get accepted to the Ashtanga Institute, and I smashed two candles, which I know isn’t very yogic,” said another man, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of professional repercussions. Ranging in age from 30 to 70, the men were gathered as part of the ManKind Project (MKP), a 33-year-old nonprofit with 24 chapters in the United States and 11 regions abroad. It focuses on men’s emotional well-being, drawing on elements like Carl Jung’s theories of the psyche, nonviolent communication, breath work, Native American customs, and good old-fashioned male bonding. Minus ogling women, drinking or fist fighting, of course. The goal, according to many affiliated with MKP, is to break down patriarchal and hierarchical ideas of masculinity. And the place to start is where another man, Socrates, did centuries ago: with the mandate of “know thyself.” MKP translates this as a process of cultivating awareness around one’s emotions, so they aren’t projected onto others in harmful and destructive ways. This is accomplished through a series of facilitated exercises, some of which involve props, aimed at bringing feelings to the surface and to hold a mirror to oneself. Men, who are less likely than women to seek out individual therapy, are increasingly looking for outlets in this fraught cultural moment of political acrimony, widespread economic instability and major societal reckoning over their behavior. The new popularity of mindfulness, yoga and wellness has helped men shift their focus away from work relationships, said Lucas Krump, 39, a founder of Evryman, a for-profit company that brings men together to talk about their feelings. (Mr. Krump used an exercise metaphor for his venture: “CrossFit for your emotions.”) Started in 2016 and now a B Corp (a business with a codified social mission), Evryman has grown to over 800 men in around 85 groups across 50 cities. Its slick website — black and white portraits of men, many of whom have the requisite millennial beard — touts a finding from psychology researchers that most men would rather be electrically shocked than be left alone with their thoughts. More sobering, in 2017 men committed suicide 3.5 times more often than women. At MKP, membership is at an all-time high and enrollment is up 8 percent over last year, said Boysen Hodgson, the director of marketing and communications. “With Time’s Up Now and #MeToo, many men know they have to be more accountable,” Mr. Hodgson said. “A lot of them are saying, ‘I don’t want that to be me. I don’t want that to be how men are seen in the world."" Eka Darville, 29, an actor on the Netflix show “Jessica Jones,” has been involved with MKP since 2012. “The stoic male who doesn’t express or share his emotions, I see that as being extremely detrimental,” Mr. Darville said in a phone interview. “A lot of pathologies in society, such as entitled masculinity, are related to men who are repressed. The evolution from boyhood to manhood isn’t something that naturally happens.” MKP helped him navigate becoming a father of two. “There is no way I could have done that without a brotherhood telling me all the bull I was projecting onto my wife but also hold me with compassion,” he said. Many participants in these groups, including Mr. Darville, first try them in the form of a weekend retreat: The commitment is low, the camaraderie is high, and it can feel reassuringly like a return to summer camp (with faint echoes of the poet Robert Bly’s 1990 treatise, “Iron John”). MKP’s retreat is the New Warrior Training Adventure, which has been completed by over 60,000 men: a two-day initiation of sorts that costs, on average, $675 and includes blindfolded walking tours and cold showers for those who choose. Some retreats have optional nudity, in an effort to promote healthy body image. “The weekend is a little strange at first,” recalled Zvika Krieger, 35, who attended one 11 years ago and now helps to facilitate the MKP retreats in the Bay Area, where he runs a technology policy organization. “You are pushed emotionally, but there is certainly nothing that happens you are ashamed of after.” After completing the New Warrior Training Adventure, many men join Integration Groups, or I-Groups, where they continue, on a weekly basis with the guidance of a trained peer facilitator, the “work,” as it is called in MKP, that was started during those 48 hours. I-Groups are attended not just by woke, liberal elites on the coasts. Kansas City, Mo.; the greater Carolinas; Atlanta; Indianapolis; Milwaukee; Memphis; and Louisville, Ky., all have sizable groups, according to the organization. Evryman has a half a dozen groups in Montana and over 20 in the Northern Rockies. In March, one of its retreats will take place in Logan, Ohio, the first in the Midwest. The Evryman weekend is called the Open Source Retreat ($475 to $975, depending on accommodations) and brings together 50 men and eight leaders who have completed something called Men’s Emotional Leadership Training (MELT) “to set aside cultural norms and be transparent, honest, and vulnerable with each other,” to quote from the company’s literature. The goal is to “leave feeling like we shed 30 pounds of emotional baggage.” Ebenezer Bond, 42, the founder of a marketing agency, said that until getting involved with Evryman he hadn’t had a cathartic drag-it-out cry since he was 16. The retreat he attended in late 2016 opened the floodgates. “I was skeptical at first — I even deleted an initial email with the invitation to the weekend,” Mr. Bond said. “But it was the single most transformational experience I’ve had as an adult male. I was able to express emotions in front of other men, something I’d never done before.” Simon Isaacs, who was invited by Mr. Bond to a later retreat, said he “panicked” when he learned, five minutes before he arrived at Race Brook Lodge in Sheffield, Mass., that there would be no consumption of alcohol and minimal cellphone use. “I thought, ‘What am I supposed to do: express myself?’” he said. Now Mr. Isaacs, 38, a founder of the millennial parenting site Fatherly, attends a weekly Evryman group and calls it part of his “emotional retraining.” Perhaps the biggest endorsement is Mr. Isaacs’s wife, who has told him to “keep going.” “I’m a work in progress,” he said. Chimezie Uzodinma, 32, an information-technology professional in New York who has been involved with MKP for a decade, credited his weekly group for pulling him out of hopelessness and despair. “There was a moment when I thought I was going to die alone and I was very depressed,” he said. But MKP and Evryman are very clear that they are not offering group therapy. “We don’t pretend to be counselors or therapists, but sometimes people come at the suggestion of their individual psychotherapist,” said Scott Fried, a motivational speaker who works with at-risk teenagers and often facilitates his I-Group on Monday nights in New York. Still, personal-development groups such as this have raised concerns about unlicensed therapeutic work. “There is no meaningful accountability for Large Group Awareness Training,” Rick Alan Ross, an expert on cults, wrote in an email, using the term to refer to a personal training program that claims to help people reach their full potential. Mr. Ross said he has received complaints about MKP and a similar group, the Sterling Institute’s Men’s Weekend, which bills itself as two days of “introspection, fun, heartbreak, and triumph. “ However, elements of the MKP philosophy and curriculum have been used in state prisons since 2009 through the Freedom Within Prison Project, a nonprofit that helps incarcerated men work through their emotions. The main facilitators of the prison groups are five men who credit MKP as the catalyst for their nonprofit. And in a 2010 peer-reviewed article about men’s health and social outcomes, researchers concluded that “MKP-related beliefs and social support significantly predicated positive outcomes.” At Evryman, Mr. Krump said he and other organizers “intentionally didn’t include spirituality” in their approach. “The groups, which don’t have specific leadership, start with a rather agnostic meditation. Then participants share how they are feeling and try to identify where those sensations are appearing in the body. Next is a more in-depth round in which the men are asked whether they have met “their stretch”: a commitment or goal for the next week based on what the person had worked on in the group. These can vary from making time to do restorative yoga every day, to connecting on a deeper level with family over the holidays — something Peter Nesbit, 34, a finance executive at a software company, said he was able to do over Thanksgiving weekend with his parents in South Dakota. Then each man is given around 10 minutes to talk more at length about what’s going on with himself. Group members ask probing follow-up questions: “How do you feel? What do you need to let go of? What do you want? What do you need from the group?” The prodding often elicits frustration, anger and sadness. Screaming into a pillow is not uncommon. “I’m just afraid to be with myself. I don’t want to feel fragile and afraid,” said Kevin Hermann, 27, an entrepreneur, at one Monday evening Evryman group at a Williamsburg loft. There is something undeniably powerful about a group of people, let alone men, sitting and listening intently — cross-talk, interrupting and giving advice are highly discouraged — without distraction or interruption. And eye contact is a must. This may sound like basic conversational etiquette, but “holding space,” as it’s called in the personal development world, is, at a minimum, cathartic in era of constant distraction and always looking for the next best thing. In some cases, it can feel quite profound. Sex, sexuality and relationships are big topics. “We have millennials come to groups or training whose introduction to sex has been through porn, and no one talked to them about the link between sex, intimacy and love,” Mr. Krieger said. Now in his 30s, Mr. Krieger, who also goes to therapy, says he feels lucky to have started the MKP when he was 24, before he was married or became a father. “I can now see when I’m shutting down, or I’m really getting defensive,” he said. And in the #MeToo era, issues of reconciling past sexual behavior come up, said Ben Fleisher, 40, who runs a men’s group in Woodstock, N.Y. “We had one situation where someone talked about how they reached out to a woman because he felt like he may have crossed the line, but the woman didn’t think it was sexual assault,” said Mr. Fleisher, 40, an alumnus of Sterling’s Men’s Weekend who works as an acupuncturist. “This topic in general is an area where we need to dig deeper. Many men are struggling to come to terms with #MeToo and how they feel complicit in abuses, even if they aren’t the perpetrators, by not taking a more active stand for a woman’s sovereignty.” Lest this all comes off as self-indulgent, devotees of men’s groups say blunt-force honesty is something that keeps them coming back. “I’m very verbose and have a lot of opinions,” said Mr. Krieger, who has been training for almost seven years to be in a volunteer leadership position in the MKP. “I started getting feedback that it was totally killing the energy in the circle and wasn’t leaving room for other people. Since I’m the boss at work, no one is going to tell me that to my face.” Some are unflinching in requesting feedback. Instead of having a blowout party on his 50th birthday, Mr. Fried told his I-Group that he wanted each person to tell him something he needed to work on. Mr. Fried, now 55, said the experience made him realize that “I come with a lot of victimhood because I got infected with H.I.V. But the group has called me on that and helped me recognize that I’m a powerful man.”",The New York Times

2018,"Opinion | These Toilet Seat Lids Aren’t Gold-Plated, but They Cost $14,000","The Pentagon has to clean up its confusing and wasteful budget. Mr. Grassley is a Republican senator from Iowa. In a July 21, 2017, memo, the secretary of defense, James Mattis, made promising comments about his ambitions to end wasteful spending at the Pentagon. He wrote that he expected “leaders at all levels in the department to exercise the utmost degree of stewardship over every penny” spent and that “only by instilling budget discipline, by establishing a culture of cost awareness, and by holding ourselves accountable, can we earn the trust and confidence of the Congress and the American people that we are the best possible stewards of taxpayer dollars.” I’ve spent more than three decades reviewing egregious spending at the Defense Department. The sentiments expressed in the memo were encouraging, so much so that I sent Secretary Mattis a letter of support. Since then, however, it seems the department has done very little to change its ways. Over the past few months alone, the Defense Department has had to explain why it’s been paying $14,000 for individual 3-D printed toilet seat lids and purchasing cups for $1,280 each. These are just the latest examples on a long list of unacceptable purchases made by the department, including $436 for hammers in the 1980s, and $117 soap dish covers and $999 pliers in the 1990s. These wasteful expenditures reflect major underlying financial problems at the department, whose 2019 budget is more than $700 billion. If it had its financial house in order, overpriced parts and contracts might have been detected before ever being approved. Effective internal controls to catch and deter fraud, waste, abuse and theft serve as a firewall that would help prevent misuses of taxpayer dollars. In 1990, Congress passed the Chief Financial Officers Act, which requires every federal agency to prepare a financial statement that is subject to audit by either the inspector general or an independent accounting firm. The auditors review the statements and render an opinion: clean, incomplete or failure. The goal is to hold government accountable by identifying and fixing financial problems. Since then, nearly all federal agencies have been able to produce a clean audit annually except for the Defense Department, because of its broken accounting systems. The Pentagon is made up of many branches and agencies with multiple accounting systems. There are hundreds of different accounting systems with hundreds of different processes. This convoluted infrastructure is the perfect environment for waste, fraud and abuse. For example, with so many different systems in place it is easy — whether by design or accident — for supporting documentation like receipts and contract guidelines to vanish. Without the ability to account for every dollar spent, there is no way for the Defense Department to produce a clean audit. There’s also no way of knowing exactly how much or on what money is being spent. Taxpayers pay billions of dollars annually to fund Pentagon programs that are supposed to increase battle readiness, support military personnel and protect national security. Every wasted dollar weakens America’s military might and takes resources away from our men and women in uniform and their families. Last month, the Pentagon released the results of its recent full financial audit, produced at a cost of more than $400 million. They were disappointing but not surprising. Without an accounting system that can provide usable data, an audit is a waste of taxpayer money. What was surprising was the reaction from Pentagon officials. A deputy defense secretary told reporters, “We never thought we were going to pass an audit.” The tone of the comment speaks volumes about a lasting cavalier attitude at the Pentagon regarding reckless spending of taxpayer dollars. It would be smart of the department to fix its accounting systems before spending hundreds of millions of dollars on any future audit that will render the same predictable results. Americans routinely balance their checkbooks, scrutinize their credit card statements and review their banking phone apps to manage their household budgets. There’s no reason the Defense Department can’t effectively do the same thing. Some in Congress have tried to pressure the department to get its financial house in order. In 2015, I worked with a Democratic colleague, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, to try to pass the Audit the Pentagon Act, which would have provided incentives to the Defense Department to produce a clean audit. But the measure was not brought up for a vote. I also co-sponsored an amendment to the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, the Pentagon’s main spending bill, that would have required the Pentagon to report how much it spends preparing for audits and to verify data within its accounting systems. Again, the legislation went nowhere. Ultimately Pentagon leaders must hold every department under them — including the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps — accountable for their financial failings. They need to heed the words of Secretary Mattis and live up to his promise that they’ll be good stewards of taxpayer dollars.

2018,They Are Suing Trump and Fear Retaliation. A Judge Rules They Can Stay Anonymous for Now.,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] When four people sued President Trump and the Trump Organization, accusing them of using the Trump name to entice vulnerable investors to enter sham business schemes, the plaintiffs took the highly unusual step of asking a judge for permission to proceed under pseudonyms. Lawyers for the plaintiffs, who are listed in the lawsuit with names like Jane Doe and Richard Roe, said in court papers that their clients feared retaliation if their names became public. The lawyers cited Mr. Trump’s “history of wielding his wealth, stature and Twitter account to attack people whom he perceives to be his enemies,” including people who sue him. On Thursday, the judge, Lorna G. Schofield of Federal District Court in Manhattan, agreed with them, ruling that the plaintiffs could keep their names concealed for now, as their lawsuit moved forward. “The manner in which the president has used his position and platform to affect the course of pending court cases,” Judge Schofield said, “is really without precedent.” “Whether instigated by him or by his supporters,” she added, “the harms at issue here are not hypothetical. They are real, significant and present an unwarranted obstacle to those who would seek to vindicate their rights in federal court.” The four plaintiffs have been described in court papers as a hospice worker, a self-employed formerly homeless man, a food delivery driver and a mother of three who works at a national retail store. Each invested in ACN, a telecommunications marketing company, after watching promotional videos featuring Mr. Trump, the suit said. The company paid Mr. Trump millions to endorse its products. The lawsuit, which seeks class-action status, alleged ACN was one of several get-rich-quick schemes that Mr. Trump promoted as legitimate business opportunities “to enrich themselves by systematically defrauding economically marginalized people.” The suit, filed in late October just days before the midterm elections, was underwritten by a nonprofit, the Tesseract Research Center, whose chairman has donated to Democratic candidates. The center is funding the lawsuit by paying attorneys’ fees and costs, the plaintiffs’ lawyers have said. The suit also names as defendants three of Mr. Trump’s children — Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump. Judge Schofield said her ruling would allow the plaintiffs to proceed confidentially until she ruled on a defense motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which could be months away. She said the plaintiffs could renew their request at that time. A plaintiff’s lawyer, Roberta A. Kaplan, said, “We are pleased that the court, recognizing the reasonableness of our clients’ fears of reprisal by defendants and their supporters, has permitted the plaintiffs to proceed under pseudonyms for the time being.” A lawyer for the defendants did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. After the suit was filed, a lawyer for the Trump Organization called the allegations completely meritless and said the suit was “just another effort by opponents of the president to use the court system to advance a political agenda.” In court papers filed recently, lawyers for the defendants denied that identifying the plaintiffs would pose a risk of retaliation to them, and said it was “inherently unfair” to allow them to proceed anonymously. “Mr. Trump is, after all, the sitting president of the United States,” the lawyers wrote, “and when such scurrilous allegations are made against him in a publicly filed lawsuit, the public has a profound interest in knowing who is making the allegations, so that it can assess the accuracy of what is being alleged and inform itself as to the credibility of the accuser.”",The New York Times
2018,They Bonded as Cabbies in the 1980s. Now One Is Helping his Ailing Friend,"In 1979, just before midnight on New Year’s Eve, Jack Padberg parked his taxi at 52nd Street and Broadway. It was far enough from Times Square to avoid the crowd but near enough that he could still watch the ball drop. David Meyer, in a cab of his own, tried for a similar view — but instead found himself surrounded by revelers, who lifted the old Dodge off the ground, Mr. Meyer still in it, while chanting: “Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!” This was one of many stories shared between the best friends and former cabdrivers one evening last fall, after Mr. Meyer, 67, had helped Mr. Padberg, 75, move into a rehabilitation facility for older people. A series of falls and surgeries had left Mr. Padberg — a former soldier and aspiring actor who moved to New York in 1969 with nothing but a suitcase and a 1958 Buick convertible — weak and incapable of performing most daily tasks. Mr. Meyer made it his mission to help his friend recover. New York is a hard city to grow old in. It’s even harder for those who spent their careers in low-wage professions, with meager benefits and scant opportunities for saving. For drivers lacking health insurance, medical complications can take them out of the game entirely. This is what happened to Mr. Padberg, who today cuts a slight figure but nevertheless retains a witty composure. The native Oklahoman has a wiry beard and speaks with a gentle rasp. Mr. Meyer, originally from Ohio, stands a head taller than his friend. A natural performer, he loves telling stories, so much that his tales tend to swerve and smack into each other. The men belonged to a generation of drivers who moved to New York to become painters, poets, actors and musicians in the 1960s and ’70s. As flop-haired liberals, they stood in sharp contrast to the veteran cabbies of the ’50s and ’60s, then famous for their folksy wisdom. “We had this sense we were on the edge of history,” Mr. Meyer said. After all, the taxicab was an indelible icon of New York then, embodying both the sizzling energy and stark loneliness of the city. Mr. Meyer and Mr. Padberg were the guys behind the wheel when “Taxi” was a wildly popular sitcom in living rooms across the country. They were the guys, too, who might have been eyed with apprehension after Martin Scorsese’s “Taxi Driver” had screened in movie theaters. Mr. Padberg moved here first. After graduating from the University of Oklahoma with a degree in French, he enlisted for a short stint in the Army, which he spent in Nuremberg, Germany. When he got home, he sought acting work at a theater in Oklahoma City, but all roles had been filled for the coming season. With nothing to lose, he figured, Mr. Padberg moved to New York. It was the summer of ’69. In June, police had raided the Stonewall Inn, leading to riots that galvanized the city’s gay community. To many, the city felt like a powder keg ready to blow. But to Mr. Padberg, then 26, it was everything he’d ever wanted. He went to plays. He stayed out too late. And for the first time in his life, he dated men. In 1971, he found a one-bedroom walk-up in a renovated brownstone on West 83rd Street — the very same apartment he’s called home ever since. Mr. Padberg worked odd jobs and auditioned for roles, but in 1974 he decided it was time to find steady work. “Everyone I knew either waited tables or drove a cab,” he said. “I picked the cab.” At the same time Mr. Padberg started driving, Mr. Meyer, a senior at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, had gotten himself arrested for streaking. Barely allowed to graduate, he too had tried his hand at acting in Cleveland and Stamford, Conn., before finding his way to New York and becoming a cabdriver. The friends met in 1980 at a taxi garage on West 55th Street. As Mr. Padberg put it, the men “started talking and never stopped.” Mr. Padberg also became close with Mr. Meyer’s girlfriend and future wife, Cynthia Berry Meyer. When Mr. Meyer was out at night prowling for night fares, they would sometimes hang out together and watch popular TV shows, like “Dallas.” Ms. Berry Meyer recalls Mr. Padberg as a handsome man, always dressed impeccably — the type of guy, she said, who liked to get caught up in the “swirling vortex” of New York. She remembers a younger Jack Padberg ambling down Central Park West at night, while singing Judy Garland: “I happen to like New York; I happen to like this town.” It’s this love for the city that so tightly bound Mr. Padberg and her husband, Ms. Berry Meyer said. It was Mr. Meyer whom Mr. Padberg first called last summer when his health took a turn for the worse. After Mr. Padberg underwent emergency surgery, Mr. Meyer immediately flew to New York from Bermuda, where Ms. Berry Meyer’s career had taken the couple in 2011. Sleeping on the couch in Mr. Padberg’s apartment — cluttered with decades’ of accumulated books and records — Mr. Meyer arranged for caregivers to help Mr. Padberg before returning to Bermuda. But then Mr. Padberg developed new health issues, including a severe loss of appetite and energy. Then he started falling. Mr. Meyer flew to New York again. One morning, when Mr. Meyer was out, Mr. Padberg found himself alone and immobile, wedged between his bed and a radiator. Firefighters had to break into his apartment to get him off the ground. In the hospital, doctors discovered that an infection from the surgery had spread throughout Mr. Padberg’s core. After weeks more of convalescence, nurses thought it would be best for Mr. Padberg to move into assisted living. Mr. Meyer knew that this would result in his friend losing his rent-stabilized apartment of 40-plus years. He intervened, selecting a rehab facility, instead, for Mr. Padberg. “I just want to give Jack a chance to get back to the life and apartment he loves,” Mr. Meyer said. “Jack gave me access to the city I knew back then. It still exists there in his apartment.” Back in Bermuda, Mr. Meyer stayed in constant contact with his friend and with the staff of the rehab facility. He frequently found himself correcting paperwork errors and misunderstandings. More than once, he scrambled, from abroad, to delay Mr. Padberg’s discharge, scheduled by one staff member when others had told him that Mr. Padberg could still barely walk. If he was still weak, Mr. Meyer said, how did Mr. Padberg have any chance of climbing the 28 steps leading to his apartment? On one visit last January, Mr. Meyer and Mr. Padberg took a yellow cab to the apartment to practice on the stairs. During the ride, Mr. Meyer told the driver that the two men were once cabdrivers themselves and proceeded to regale him with tales of their glory days. The driver didn’t seem to care. Throughout the apartment, there were Post-its written by Mr. Meyer from over a year ago: “Drink water every hour.” “Exercise every day. Stairs, too.” “Every day, a little stronger.” While Mr. Padberg rested in a chair, Mr. Meyer paced the living room making frantic calls. The rehab facility had somehow gotten the impression that Mr. Padberg had left for good. Mr. Meyer assured them that his friend would return that evening. There was always another fire, it seemed. “What I want to know is, what happens to the guy who doesn’t have a friend?” Mr. Meyer said. Ms. Berry Meyer, at home alone in Bermuda, began to worry that her husband’s judgment was clouded by nostalgia. Mr. Padberg’s apartment had been a fixture of Mr. Meyer’s experience in New York for decades; now it was a veritable oasis; a comforting time capsule in an Uber-filled city. As Mr. Meyer said himself one day, delirious after hours of running errands in the city for his friend: “What I’m doing, I’m trying to save Jack. I’m trying to save New York.” Mr. Padberg was finally discharged from rehab last summer. He was still wobbly, but he agreed to use a cane when a nurse told him it looked handsome. “Oh, well, I’ll use it, but only because you want me to,” Mr. Padberg told her. Of course, Mr. Meyer was there. He ensured his friend’s paperwork was squared away and accompanied him to the apartment. When they arrived, a neighbor complimented Mr. Padberg on his weight loss. “Yes, I lost nearly 70 pounds,” Mr. Padberg said. “But I wouldn’t recommend to anyone to do it the way I did.” Mr. Padberg’s health is still uncertain, but day-to day-life is now as it should be for an older New Yorker. He cooks his own recipes. He reads old books and magazines. Mr. Padberg also goes to physical therapy twice a week and volunteers at a neighborhood food bank. He has fallen several times, but he stubbornly rejects Mr. Meyer’s estimation of how often. Last week, Mr. Padberg and Mr. Meyer returned to the rehab facility — but this time to sing carols for the residents. In a red scarf and reindeer sweater, Mr. Padberg gave his full-throated best to “Joy to the World,” “Silent Night” and his favorite, “Hark! the Herald Angels Sing.” The carolers toured the floors and even visited individual rooms. Mr. Padberg declined, however, to stop by the room he had occupied for so long. “I think I know what it looks like,” he said. As Mr. Padberg continues his recovery, he is taking more walks around his neighborhood. On one-way streets, he walks against traffic, he said, allowing him to see the city as he never did when he was a driver.",The New York Times
2018,They Grabbed Her Baby and Arrested Her. Now Jazmine Headley Is Speaking Out.,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] Jazmine Headley took her baby boy to a public benefits office in Brooklyn on a recent Friday to find out why the city had abruptly stopped paying for him to go to day care while she worked cleaning offices. Nearly four hours later Ms. Headley, 23, left the Boerum Hill facility in handcuffs, after police officers and security guards pried her son from her arms in a chaotic arrest that began when she got into a dispute over whether she was allowed to sit on the floor. The incident, caught on cellphone videos and shared widely online, has propelled her into the center of a public reckoning over how the city treats people seeking public assistance. In the last week, Ms. Headley has become a cause célèbre for New Yorkers who depend on food stamps and cash public assistance and who say they are often met with hostility and are sometimes threatened with arrest at city benefits offices. “It’s the story of many other people, it’s not just my story,” Ms. Headley said in an interview. “My story is the only one that made it to the surface.” Her arrest highlighted the tension that plays out in public benefit offices throughout the city every day. People seeking benefits are usually under tremendous financial strain and are dealing with an unyielding bureaucracy, and city workers at these offices are under pressure to follow rules, ferret out abuse and keep order. Those strains occasionally boil over into physical confrontations and arrests, officials said, an outcome that can have lifelong consequences for people already struggling at the bottom of the economic ladder. Since January 2017, law enforcement agencies have been called to food-stamp offices across the city 2,212 times and have arrested 97 people, mainly for assault and offenses against public administration, the police said. Ms. Headley had had a difficult two years — a disappointing move to North Carolina, a failed relationship with her son’s father and an arrest on charges of credit-card fraud in New Jersey. On Thursday, she notified the city that she plans to file a potentially lucrative lawsuit to prevent what happened to her from happening to others. The political fallout from her detention was another blow to Mayor Bill de Blasio’s image as a champion of the poor. Mr. de Blasio has apologized to Ms. Headley, but he drew harsh criticism from other Democrats for waiting several days before condemning the arrest. For the city’s police commissioner, James P. O’Neill, who has committed to training officers to recognize unconscious biases and to de-escalate tensions, the incident raised questions about whether that coaching is taking hold among officers. “They never asked me my name,” Ms. Headley said. “They never said, ‘Hello, who are you?’ They never asked me.” In the interview, Ms. Headley said she tried to leave the office with her son shortly after the police showed up. The officers had been called because Ms. Headley had a heated argument with a female security guard, who told her she could not sit on the floor. She picked up her baby and started to leave, but the police said the guard grabbed her arm, and they all tumbled to the floor. Ms. Headley said she tried again to go, but a male police officer told her it was too late. She went into “defense mode,” she said. “In my head, I told myself they’re not going to let me leave,” she said. “I was so afraid. I was combative with my thoughts.” Ms. Headley grew up in Brooklyn, where she is raising her son, Damone Buckman III, in her mother’s apartment in the Brevoort Houses, where she has lived since she was 3 years old. She went to public schools and worked briefly at a nonprofit that helps developmentally disabled adults. Suzanne Jones, the program’s case manager, said that Ms. Headley was driven and knew how to stand her ground. “You don’t roll over Jazmine,” she said. “She’s always going to push her way through.” Ms. Headley stayed on with the nonprofit, Jewel Human Services, for nine months until she said she fell in love and moved to Charlotte, N.C., to join her boyfriend. That summer, she was arrested outside Trenton, N.J., and charged with taking part in an identity theft and credit-card fraud scheme, prosecutors said. The police seized five phony cards with her name on them. Her relationship broke up around the time she gave birth to Damone in June 2017, her mother said. Her savings from her job at a Belk department store ran out a couple of months later, and she returned to New York, where she went on public assistance — a monthly allowance of $280 in food stamps and $140 in cash. In September, she went back to work cleaning offices part time for $13 an hour. Her benefits were cut after she started working, but the city still paid $1,200 each month for Damone’s day care. Then that payment stopped, too. Ms. Headley had taken that Friday off work after the owner of her son’s day care told her Damone could not return if the payment issue was not fixed. She packed a bag with snacks for him, as well as his favorite toy, a figurine of Chase, a police dog who stars on the children’s television show, PAW Patrol. “My main objective was to get there, handle business and get home,” Ms. Headley said. With Damone in a stroller, she arrived a few minutes before 10 a.m. at the Human Resources Administration office on Bergen Street and took a number for her turn to talk to a case worker who handles child-care assistance. At 12:20 p.m., she said, her turn came and a case worker told her that she would have to reapply for child care benefits, a process that could take up to a week. Determined to accomplish something, she decided to check the status of her cash allowance, for which she had reapplied in November. That meant taking another number, and more waiting. By then, Damone was getting restless. She said she took him to a play area, but workers turned her away because he is not toilet trained. All the seats in the main waiting area were taken, she said, so she sat on the floor with her back against the blue wall and talked to Damone, who was in a stroller to her right. A security guard came over and told Ms. Headley that she was blocking a fire zone and needed to move. Ms. Headley said she refused, noting that there were trash and recycling bins against the wall on the other side of Damone’s stroller. “I just remember being talked to very viciously,” she said. “It was more or less: ‘You’re going to do what I say, and that’s it.’” The exchange grew heated, Ms. Headley said, and another security guard — the city calls them peace officers — came to demand that she move. Incensed, Ms. Headley said she asked to talk to a supervisor. The guards walked away, Ms. Headley said, and 10 minutes passed. Then they returned with two police officers. She picked Damone up and rose to her feet. One of the police officers told her they did not want to arrest her and she began to leave, holding Damone and pushing the stroller. [Watch a video of Ms. Headley’s arrest.] Her memory of what happened next is blurry, she said. The police said the first guard grabbed Ms. Headley’s arm and they fell to the ground. “I should’ve left, and I didn’t because if I would’ve left, my son would not have the things that he needs,” Ms. Headley said. Body-cameras worn by the officers recorded the guard telling Ms. Headley that if she did not leave she would be taken to central booking and the city’s child-welfare agency would take her son away, according to a person briefed on the matter. “You’re a joke,” Ms. Headley replied, then turned to go, according to the person who was briefed. The peace officer replied: “Really?” then lunged at Ms. Headley and grabbed her arm, the person said, and “everyone tumbles down.” If the guard “had just swallowed it, this would have been over,” a law enforcement official briefed on the body-camera evidence said. A video posted on Facebook shows Ms. Headley trying to reason once more with the officers. “Let me get up,” Ms. Headley tells the police officers, who appear to be speaking to her. “I have my rights. I have my rights.” She sits upright on the floor, then says, “Don’t touch me when I get up.” But the two officers then restrained her while the two guards stripped Damone out of her arms. The baby shrieked while onlookers yelled at the police to leave her alone. Ms. Headley fought hard to hold onto him, gripping his shirt in her teeth. Gregory Floyd, the guards’ union president, said the guards, Bettina Barnett-Weekes and Toyin Ramos-Williams, tried to reason with Ms. Headley for 40 minutes before the police arrived, and that there were rows of seats available in the waiting area. He said Ms. Barnett-Weekes was bitten during the fracas. As Ms. Headley’s arrest began drawing attention worldwide — the Facebook videos have been seen more than 1.3 million times — the city social services commissioner suspended the two security guards and started the process of firing them. “I could only see my children in that situation, and it’s just heartbreaking,” the commissioner, Steven Banks, said. Mr. Banks said his agency was reviewing tactics for dealing with people accompanying children and would retrain the peace officers. The guards also will now be ordered to talk to a supervisor before calling the police, unless there is an immediate threat to someone’s safety, he said. The bureaucratic headache that kept Ms. Headley at the Brooklyn office for hours is not unusual. The practice of prematurely closing public benefits cases and forcing recipients to reapply is so common that advocates for the poor have a word for it: churning. “They call the cops for everything, even if you’re smoking outside,” said Mae Green, an administrator at Bethel Baptist Church, a few doors down from the Boerum Hill office. Synthia Jean, 38, said she left the Boerum Hill office last month after waiting six hours for officials to reissue a check that was dated for April, but had arrived in November, and to give her an identification card to cash it. She said public benefits offices are “just a bunch of aggravation in one place.” The Police Department has defended the actions of the two officers, saying the security guards were to blame for the incident getting out of hand. The Civilian Complaint Review Board is investigating the arrest. Police officials did not respond to questions about whether the officers followed the department’s protocols. For Ms. Headley, the outpouring of sympathy that followed publicity of the arrest has brought her some relief. She is being represented by the Midtown law firm, Emery Celli Brinckerhoff & Abady. Her public assistance benefits have been restored. The Brooklyn district attorney dropped charges of resisting arrest and child endangerment, and New Jersey authorities agreed to dismiss the unrelated charges against her if she completes a pretrial diversion program. “What happened was completely unacceptable and should never happen again in New York City,” Mr. Banks said.",The New York Times
2018,They Grew Closer Despite a Geographical Distance,"Mini-Vows Samantha Brianne Webb and Brendan Patrick McCarthy were married Dec. 7 at the Mansion in Mountain Lakes, N.J. The Rev. Ross Lang, a Presbyterian minister, officiated, with Msgr. John J. Carroll taking part in a ceremony that incorporated both Presbyterian and Catholic wedding traditions. The bride, 35, works in the investor relations department at Bain Capital in New York. She graduated from New England College in Henniker, N.H. She is a daughter of Cyndi Webb of Mountain Lakes, and the late Bill Webb. The bride’s father was a Major League Baseball television sports director for both Fox Sports and New York Mets telecasts on SNY. He directed 17 World Series, 18 All-Star Games and many other significant sports events, including the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Canada. He also won dozens of Emmy Awards as part of various broadcast teams throughout his career, and seven individual Emmys. In 2016, he was elected to the Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame. Mr. McCarthy, who is 40 and works in Billings, Mont., is an assistant United States attorney for the District of Montana. He graduated from Notre Dame, from which he also received a law degree. He is a son of Carolyn S. McCarthy and G. Daniel McCarthy of Scottsdale, Ariz. The groom’s father retired as a partner in Gibbons, a law firm in Newark. He was previously general counsel of the Hewlett-Packard Financial Services Company in Murray Hill, N.J. Ms. Webb and Mr. McCarthy first met in March 2017 during a ski trip in Big Sky, Mont. “There was just something so captivating about him,” Ms. Webb said. “He was super-funny and charismatic, and a gentleman in an old-school kind of way, which reminded me of my dad.” Two weeks after they met, Mr. McCarthy went on a business trip to Columbia, S.C., and arranged to meet Ms. Webb for a long weekend in Charleston, about two hours away. “She was smart and beautiful and someone who made me laugh so easily,” said Mr. McCarthy, who grew up in Chatham, N.J. “Though I felt she was completely out of my league, I thought ‘Well, let me at least give this thing a shot.’” After exploring Charleston together, they had dinner at a local bistro and decided to continue seeing each other despite the fact that they were living on opposite sides of the country, she in Boston and he in Billings. “Talking with her was so easy, it was as if she was someone I had known my whole life,” Mr. McCarthy said. “We also have a lot in common given the fact that we grew up not far from each other in New Jersey.” Ms. Webb said she is looking forward to the day when she and Mr. McCarthy can eliminate the distance between them. “It’s been about two years since we’ve been going back and forth to see each other,” she said, “but I’m anxious to begin living with Brendan and starting a family together.”",The New York Times
2018,They Look Like the Emperors’ Clocks. But Are They Real?,"A legal dispute in New York is part of a broader questioning of the authenticity of some ornate timepieces that have come on the market from China. Mechanical clocks of the sort once revered by Chinese emperors and said to be more than 100 years old are increasingly turning up at auction, but some experts question their authenticity. This clock is now the subject of a lawsuit.CreditCreditLam Yik Fei for The New York Times BEIJING — To stroll through the Hall for Ancestral Worship deep within the Forbidden City is to appreciate the fascination that ornate mechanical timepieces held for successive emperors of China. Many were brought to the Ming and Qing courts as precious gifts by European ambassadors from the 17th century to the 19th. Others were later manufactured in local workshops in Beijing, Suzhou and especially, Guangzhou, in southern China. All are marked by a stunning level of intricacy, their chimes sounding while mechanized ducks paddle, mounted figures ride their steeds and waterfalls splash down, in carefully wrought landscapes. The hall in the Forbidden City, now a museum, has 1,600 of them, but few ever appeared on the auction market until recently. “They are blindingly rare in real life,” said Simon Bull, a clock specialist in Taunton, England. In recent years, though, experts say a growing number of reproduction clocks have hit the market, posing as the real thing. The counterfeits were drawn, they say, by the prices paid for real clocks, such as the $3.8 million fetched by a Qing dynasty table clock sold at auction by the socialite Patricia Kluge in 2010. “The moment you start seeing them two, three, four, five times a year, and the same model — that was the big warning,” said Mr. Bull, who was featured as an expert on BBC’s “Antiques Roadshow” on television. In one case being litigated in New York, a dealer in timepieces based there is suing a California auction house, asserting that the pair of clocks he paid $607,000 for in 2016 had been misrepresented as being at least 100 years old, when they were actually modern reproductions. “Rather than being more than a century old, the clocks were approximately five years old, and they were manufactured in Beijing by a company that sells virtually identical clocks as modern reproductions for about $20,000 a piece,” the buyer’s lawyer, Ted Poretz, wrote in the lawsuit filed in federal court. The complicated case highlights the difficulty of adjudicating what is real and what is fake in this market for such elaborate — and ostensibly centuries-old — timepieces. In the court papers and an interview, Mr. Poretz said he had been able to identify the maker of the clocks as Li Qiusheng, the owner of the Tianjin Edwin Clock Company in Tianjin, a port city southeast of Beijing. He said the clocks appear to have been brought to market in the United States by Mr. Li’s son, Edwin, a California dealer who sells clocks under the name EM Time Company. Li Qiusheng, reached by telephone, disputed the suggestion that he produced fakes. He said the clocks were genuine, dating to the 1920s, though he acknowledged that old clocks often need repairs that require using modern parts. “When the clock doesn’t work, you need to replace the components,” he said. “If a wheel gear is broken, for example, you need to replace it with a new one.” A lawyer for his son, Edwin, Steve Sherman, noted that neither Li had been named by the buyer as a defendant in the suit. He said the son had no financial interest in the clocks and had only acted as an intermediary for his father. He “was basically acting as an interpreter,” Mr. Sherman said. Mr. Li said that he had once operated a workshop, but later only collected and sold the ancient clocks from a space on the fifth floor of an office building in Tianjin. He is well known in a district not far away that is filled with antique shops, including several selling old clocks and new replicas. Shopkeepers there offered differing accounts as to whether Mr. Li had manufactured reproductions, simply collected them or was in the business of repairing period clocks, as he said. A clock and watch expert from Canada who visited Mr. Li’s Tianjin company in 2014 said he had the impression that it manufactured reproductions, though he did not see any automaton models of the sort described in the lawsuit. “It was a light industrial workshop,” said Ron Good, the collector, who has a special interest in Chinese horology. Clars Auction Gallery of Oakland, Calif., which sold the clocks, described the federal lawsuit against it as baseless and said it had relied on the consignor’s assurances of authenticity. In addition, it said the purchaser, Ye Olde Time Keepers Inc. of New York City, was a “sophisticated, trade” purchaser who had used its own expert to validate the authenticity of the clocks before paying. “The buyer thus relied not on statements by Clars,” the company said, “but rather on its own diligence — conducted with the assistance of its elite, international industry connections, and resulting in a ‘green light,’ as communicated by the buyer to Clars prior to its making payment for the clocks.” After that statement, Clars made a new filing on Thursday asking to introduce the Lis into the case and saying they had concealed the clocks’ “apparent status as modern reproductions, rather than antiques.” Clars had described the clocks in its auction catalog as “a rare pair of Chinese ormolu bronze automaton clocks” manufactured in a workshop in the southern port city of Guangzhou. The old clocks were “believed to be a gift to the head of household and his spouse meant to impart good wishes for fortune, luck and longevity,” the catalog stated. Clars dated them to roughly the late 19th or early 20th centuries, according to the court papers. The musical clocks are each about two and a half feet tall, are wound with a key and have delicate bronze-colored metal leaves that lift to reveal revolving figures depicting the Eight Immortals, mythological figures revered in Taoism and secular Chinese culture and often depicted in paintings and sculptures. Twisting glass tubes simulate falling water. Mr. Li said that one alteration to the clocks involved the figurines, which were originally made of ivory. Since the United States banned the import of ivory, he replaced those with plastic replicas. He said he had received about $480,000 for the two but was not aware of how the auction house represented them. Mr. Poretz denied that his client had had a specialist study the clocks before paying, but said he did have an expert look at them later. The expert found that the clocks did not show the sort of wear usually seen in items that old. Instead, the clocks had been constructed with modern brass, and with screws and other materials not available until later in the 20th century, at the earliest, his report said. “It is clear that they are effectively brand-new,” Richard Higgins, the Shrewsbury, England, expert hired by the purchaser, wrote. The court papers say that, after the purchaser had questioned whether the clocks were actually reproductions, Clars provided a certificate of authenticity from the China Horologe Association. But, the papers say, the document was for a different, single clock and that the association, a trade organization, “is not in the business of providing authentications for antique Chinese clocks.” A woman at the association in Beijing confirmed that it did not provide certificates of authenticity. Experts from the association were not available this week to comment. China has a long and esteemed role in the evolution of timekeeping. These mechanical clocks were introduced in about 1601, when a Jesuit missionary, Matteo Ricci, gave two timepieces to the Emperor Wanli. Known as “zimingzhong,” or self-sounding bells, they were used by European missionaries and foreign ambassadors as a cultural link between China and the West. High-ranking members of the imperial court or wealthy merchants commissioned clocks with ever more complicated movements, and the European timepieces became an important part of court life. The models were imported from Europe or based on European designs, though the Chinese workshops later added motifs of their own. Mr. Bull, who is not involved in the legal case, said intricate, musical automaton clocks fell abruptly out of fashion in China after the early decades of the 19th century and few, if any, were being produced as the 20th century dawned. Another expert, Matthew Hopkinson, who is based in London, said that before the recent surge, he typically saw one clock of this type appear on the market in a year. Now, he said, he often sees as many as three. “Suddenly these clocks were fetching 10 times the amount they were previously,” Mr. Hopkinson said. “When prices go up, the counterfeiters move in and start making reproduction ones.” He urged vigilance to protect the market for legitimate antique timepieces. “There are still good clocks coming onto the market,” he said. “You have to be careful vetting them.”",The New York Times
2018,Things Are Getting Interesting,"daily crossword column Alex Eylar grows us a puzzle. MONDAY PUZZLE — The only nice thing about winter, as far as I’m concerned, is that these are the months when the gardening catalogs arrive in the mail. The bone-chilling cold is held at bay by dreams of what I will plant in the spring, as I flick through pages of greenery over mugs of hot coffee. Should I plant all vegetables, or should I leave room for some tasty herbs? Is this the year I finally put in that fig tree I’ve coveted? The answers are still months away and, as the weather warms up, my only wish is that I will be able to stand in the middle of my little plot of land and watch it thicken. Wait, what? That’s not the phrase I would normally use to describe my gardening adventures, but it is a hint to cracking Alex Eylar’s puzzle. A smooth and easy solve, overall, with some entries that seem a bit tough for a Monday, but regular solvers shouldn’t have a problem with it. 19A: Hand up if you remembered to dust the SAFES behind your paintings. I always forget, too. 33A: “Pop a fly?” is not a baseball term in today’s puzzle. “Pop” is a synonym for “hit,” and the answer is SWAT. 11D: Not familiar with BOFFO? We covered this Variety magazine slang in one of our weekly “What the Heck Is That?” Mr. Eylar has developed a theme set consisting of four entries and a central revealer at 37A. The revealer clue (“‘Now things are getting interesting” … or a hint to the first words of 17-, 24-, 45- and 57-Across”) tells us that we should focus on the first words of each of the theme entries. When read from top to bottom of the grid, those words are: DIRT GRASS BUSH JUNGLE That’s a thickening of a plot of land in some volumetric sense, since a JUNGLE is bigger than a BUSH, which is taller than GRASS, which is taller than the DIRT from which it grows. 57A seems like a good enough segue as any, so here’s an old anti-joke about jungles. It’s high noon in the Amazon jungle, and the heat is inescapable — a sweltering, thick soup of hot air all around. The monkeys lay still on their perches, fanning themselves with palm fronds, lazily napping because it’s all they can make the effort to do. The jaguars search the high tree branches for a cool breeze, looking for any reprieve from the crushing humidity and suffocating heat. The alligators sit submerged in the river with just their nostrils above the surface, unwilling to let any other parts of their bodies touch the hot air. The capybaras roam the jungle floor, hunting out shady glens but finding no escape from the humidity. The jungle is, for once, quiet — the chirps, the roars, and the howls have all been silenced by the overpowering heat. On the shore of the river, one hippo turns to another and says, “You know, I just can’t get it through my head that it’s Thursday.” Almost finished solving but need a bit more help?

2018,Things That Contain 59-Across,"daily crossword column David Steinberg challenges us. FRIDAY PUZZLE — I predict this puzzle by David Steinberg will be a divisive one for solvers. On the plus side, there are some very crunchy, challenging general-knowledge entries, with tough cluing that might not be in many wheelhouses. On the minus side, there are some very crunchy, challenging general-knowledge entries, with tough cluing that might not be in many wheelhouses. Let me roll that back for a moment. What I’m saying is that Mr. Steinberg’s puzzle has a lot of stuff in it that you either know or you don’t, and I’m not entirely sure that the crossings will be of much help here. Take 17A, for example. You might or might not know the “1997 Notorious B.I.G. hit,” GOING BACK TO CALI, but if you are trying to get it through the crossings, you had better know what ELOCUTE and FECUND mean, or that a PICA is 12 points, typographically speaking, or what a CELESTA is. And heaven help you if you don’t know that the Lego company is run by the DANES. And I, personally, missed out on reading “Gil Blas,” so the bottom stack was tough for me, but at least the crossings were a bit easier, so I was able to discover its author, ALAIN-RENÉ LESAGE. On a separate note, please help me welcome Caitlin Lovinger back tomorrow to the weekend Wordplay columns. 1A: Hi, kids! If LEADER OF THE PACK is a phrase that doesn’t resonate with you as an answer for the clue “Dominant figure,” this song may help you remember it for next time. 32A: This took me a while, because I don’t think of ANGORA as a relative to cashmere. One fiber is from a rabbit and one is from a goat. They’re both soft and hairy. Maybe that’s the relationship. 45A: The wording of the clue, “‘If u ask me …’” is a hint that the answer should be text speak. The answer is IMO, which stands for “In My Opinion.” 51A: Cute. “New toy?” is not what you got for Christmas, but hints at a newborn toy breed of dog, so the answer is PUP. 59A: This is a clue that nicely evokes the answer. It’s not Inception, mind you, but “Things that contain 59-Across that contain 59-Across that …” is MATRYOSHKA DOLLS. 26D: This was a total guess on my part. When someone thanks me in French for doing something nice for them, I answer “de rien,” which means “It’s nothing.” That’s the only way I’ve ever heard the French version of “You’re welcome.” Nevertheless, the phrase in this puzzle is “Je vous en PRIE.” 57D: Once again, we need to look at a specific word in the clue “Pairs of nines?” — in this case “nines” — and figure out where the pair is. There are two Ns in the word, so the answer is the written out version of the letter, or ENS. This puzzle started as just a top stack that I’d fallen in love with. The seed was GOING BACK TO CALI, though ALFA ROMEO SPIDER was high on my list as well. I initially wasn’t making much headway in the bottom, so I set the puzzle aside for a while. Eventually I picked it back up again and tried MATRYOSHKA DOLLS in the bottom slot … suddenly, everything started working! Constructing can be a lot like solving.

2018,This Designer Says You Can Make a Shoe Out of Anything,"For the latest installment of Make T Something, Paul Andrew pays tribute to an iconic high heel. Salvatore Ferragamo’s women’s creative director, Paul Andrew, grew up around textiles. During his childhood in England, his father worked as the Queen’s upholsterer at Windsor Castle, and Andrew has demonstrated a similar affinity for materials, creating innovative but timeless shoes for both his own eponymous line and Ferragamo. “One of my first designs for the house rested on a golden flower heel galvanized in a car factory,” he says, referencing a sandal with a metallic flower-shaped heel. “The craft is in the design, never limited to the material.” Still, when we asked Andrew to take part in our Make T Something series — for which a person must create something in under one hour using only basic crafting supplies, a copy of The New York Times and one wild-card item of their choosing — he admits it was a challenge: “It was the first time I’ve attempted the complicated construction of shoe design with paper!” The piece he makes in the video above is a tribute to Ferragamo’s signature “F” wedge, a design that the house originated in 1947 and that Andrew frequently reimagines in his own collections. An earlier version of this article misstated when the Ferragamo ""F"" wedge was designed; it was 1947, not the 1970s.",The New York Times
2018,This Dracula Ant’s Jaws Could Make It the Fastest Animal on Earth,"Trilobites You could call it an ant speed record. The Dracula ant is not much of a traveler. Located mostly in the tropics of Africa, Australia and Asia, the tiny creatures spend most of their lives burrowed into tree trunks or underground, to the endless frustration of scientists who would like to study them. So, imagine the surprise of the researchers who recently discovered that Dracula ants may be the fastest animals on earth. To be clear, you could easily beat the Dracula ant in a foot race. But one species, Mystrium camillae, has a pair of ingeniously-designed mandibles that can snap at 200 miles per hour, according to a study published Wednesday in Royal Society Open Science. That’s 5,000 times faster than you can blink your eye and 1,000 times faster than you can snap your fingers. It’s also three times faster than the mandibles of the trap-jaw ant, the previous fastest-moving insect on record. The findings provide new insight into ant evolution and could help engineers design more powerful and efficient machines. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Fredrick Larabee, an entomologist at the Smithsonian Natural History Museum, had been studying ants with powerful jaws at the University of Illinois in 2014 when his colleague, Andrew Suarez, was lucky enough to collect two colonies of Dracula ants in Borneo. “We had spent four or five years trying to get a single colony,” containing thousands of insects, said Dr. Larabee. “But we were never able to get more than a few workers.” Once Dr. Suarez brought the colonies back to his Illinois lab, the researchers quickly realized that their equipment wasn’t powerful enough to study them. “The ants were so fast that we couldn’t slow their motion down with the cameras we had,” said Dr. Larabee. “That’s when we knew we were onto something special.” They transported the ants to Duke University, where they could film them with a camera that captured up to 1 million frames per second. (The camera at the University of Illinois could capture only 100,000 frames per second.) They also used X-ray imaging to study the mandibles in three dimensions. They found that unlike trap-jaw ants, whose jaws snap close from an open position, this Dracula ant uses its mandibles much like a pair of snapping fingers. The ant presses two small appendages together, spring loading them with potential energy, until one slides past the other. The immense force generated by the pent-up energy can be used to stun or kill prey, which are then brought back to the nest and eaten. It takes just 0.000015 seconds for the appendages to accelerate from 0 to 200 miles per hour. By comparing the jaws of Dracula ants and trap-jaw ants, a genus of tropical ant whose mandibles reach speeds of 140 miles per hour, researchers can see how similar functions evolved in different ways. Dr. Larabee and his team also plan to further study how the Dracula ant uses its mandibles in the wild. Of course, records are made to be broken, and with the increasing availability of high-speed cameras making it easier to clock rapid animal movements, Dr. Larabee anticipates the Dracula ant won’t hold the speed record for long. “I suspect there are several other animals that are faster,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,This Graduate School Helped Make New York Appealing to Amazon,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] In the rush to get to class, Eliza Harkins used to forget the things she needed most: notebooks, eyeglasses, phone charger and lunch. So Ms. Harkins teamed up with a classmate, Sarah Le Cam, to do something about it. They came up with a device that slips inside a bag, backpack or suitcase and keeps track of items using radio-frequency identification technology. If a wallet is not returned to the bag, the device sends a cellphone alert. If the cellphone is missing, the device beeps. The women are part of a new generation of technology whizzes emerging from Cornell Tech, a graduate school on Roosevelt Island in the East River that started with just seven students in 2013. Since then, Cornell Tech has become one of the most visible symbols of New York City’s booming technology sector — and a major selling point in the bid to persuade Amazon to build a headquarters in Queens. Cornell Tech’s dean and vice provost, Daniel Huttenlocher, sits on Amazon’s board of directors, and Amazon executives visited the campus as part of the city’s efforts to woo the company. Ferries provide direct service between the Cornell campus and Long Island City, Queens, where the company will build the headquarters. The school’s graduates and researchers have parlayed their ideas, skills and ambition into more than 50 start-up companies that have raised a total of $60 million from investors and created about 200 jobs. One start-up, Nanit, sells a smart baby monitor online and in stores, while three others have been acquired by companies, including one by Adobe. So far, 534 of the school’s graduates — of whom, more than 60 percent remain in the city — have been hired by Google, Bloomberg, Microsoft and other technology companies. “It really sends a message to the broader tech industry and also the whole world that New York City is serious about tech,” said Julie Samuels, executive director of Tech: NYC, a nonprofit industry group. Citywide, the technology industry employs more than 320,000 people, according to Tech: NYC. Many work in what Ms. Samuels calls an expanding “ecosystem” of more than 7,000 small start-up companies. New York’s ascendance as a technology hub was reaffirmed by Google’s announcement on Monday that it would create a $1 billion campus in the West Village that would allow the company to double the size of its 7,000 employee work force in the city. Cornell Tech is rooted in a 2010 competition among universities to open an engineering-and-science center on city-owned land. It was part of efforts by Michael R. Bloomberg, then the mayor, to diversify the city’s economic base, which had traditionally relied on Wall Street and other finance jobs. Cornell University and its partner, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, won $100 million and a spot on Roosevelt Island. As the school has flourished, it has drawn criticism from some Cornell students, faculty members and others over its relationship with Technion. Some Roosevelt Island residents have also complained about the continuing campus construction, while others said Cornell Tech had not paid enough to support local neighborhood services, such as street cleaning and landscaping. “They’re a very prestigious institution that is free-riding off the backs of a working population to function in an environment that they really are not adequately paying for,” said Joyce Short, a writer and longtime resident. All the money and attention showered on Cornell Tech has, at times, overshadowed other schools. New York University, which also took part in the 2010 competition, is creating a $380-million tech hub for emerging media, technology and the arts in the former headquarters of New York City Transit, then known as the New York City Transit Authority. Across the street, its Tandon School of Engineering runs several incubators for start-ups. Josh Hartmann, a former chief technology officer for Travelocity and Amplify who now teaches at Cornell Tech, said technology-focused schools are an integral part of what he called a “virtuous cycle” that drives the city’s tech industry. The schools attract faculty members and support research, both of which draw more students. The students increase and diversify the talent pool, which in turn brings more companies. Cornell Tech’s 340 students are enrolled in seven programs, from electrical and computer engineering to law, technology and entrepreneurship. By 2037, it is expected to have at least 1,800 students. It started in borrowed space at the Google building in Chelsea and moved last year to the first three buildings on its new campus. On a recent evening, students were huddled together in “the collaboratory” — Cornell Tech’s version of a library with tables and smart boards. Downstairs, the school’s “studio_code:” displayed seven principles for innovation, including “Build Things That Matter” and “Don’t Be a Jerk.” Every student is assigned to a team that works with more than 50 companies, including Amazon and Samsung, on real-life problems that begin with, “How might we …” Mr. Huttenlocher said that part of the challenge is learning to work together across different backgrounds, interests and programs. In the spring, students team up on their own to develop start-ups and then present them to parents, technology leaders and investors. Last May, four teams were chosen from dozens of entrants. Each team received a $100,000 award, including office space, to pursue its start-up. Ms. Harkins, 27, said their device — called a Kipit — resonated with anyone who has ever forgotten a passport and missed a flight, or failed to pack a clean baby diaper. “It’s stress in the day and it really shouldn’t exist, it’s so trivial,” she said. “There wasn’t anything out there that really helped.” Ms. Le Cam, 24, who studied computer science, wrote the app for the device, which keeps track of every item marked by a chip-implanted sticker. The prototype started out shaped like an egg, but testers gave that a thumbs down because it would not fit in small bags. It was flattened, and took on a pocket shape. Another team is building a website to help people take care of older relatives by covering legal and financial planning, in-home care safety and timesaving services, such as meal deliveries. “I did not expect to start my own company,” said Darya Moldavskaya, 28, a co-founder of ReverCare. But Cornell Tech’s entrepreneurial culture is contagious, she said. “You’re in an environment where everyone is thinking about it,” Ms. Moldavskaya said. A separate program within Cornell Tech, the Jacobs Runway Startup Postdoctoral Program, offers funding, offices and training for academic researchers for up to three years — far longer than most incubators — to develop more complex technology. Sophie Zaaijer, 36, is working on a start-up, FIND Genomics, that provides software that compares DNA evidence from crime scenes to databases and registries for on-site identification within minutes. Neel Madhukar is a co-founder of a start-up, OneThree Biotech, that uses artificial intelligence software to analyze biological, chemical and clinical data to identify new drugs to treat diseases. Dr. Madhukar, 27, who has a doctorate in computational biology and medicine, said he had learned how to write a business plan, pitch to investors and hire employees. Cornell Tech’s 30 faculty members include Deborah Estrin, an associate dean and director of the health technology program, who this year was awarded a prestigious MacArthur fellowship, which is known as a genius grant. Daniel D. Lee was hired away from the University of Pennsylvania with a joint appointment as professor of electrical and computer engineering at Cornell Tech and executive vice president for Samsung Research. The school’s operating budget is $50 million annually and is covered partly through student tuition, which starts at $54,584 a year and increases to $102,652 for a master’s in business administration. The school has also raised $815 million in private donations, including $350 million from Atlantic Philanthropies, whose founder is a Cornell graduate, and $100 million from Bloomberg Philanthropies. The school’s technology lessons have spilled over to the neighborhood. Cornell Tech has supported computer science instruction at the public elementary and middle school. Its students have taught classes at a senior center on protecting against online fraud and created a web page featuring open spaces on the island for the gardening club. Jay Jacobson, 82, a retired lawyer who lives on Roosevelt Island, recently worked with Cornell Tech students to address a daily problem for older people: how to carry a shopping bag when holding onto a walker? They came up with a 3-D-printed hinge to attach to a walker. “I’m so glad I’m part of their community,” he said. “It’s just a delight to have them.” An earlier version of this article misidentified the Downtown Brooklyn building where New York University’s new tech hub is located. The building is the former headquarters of New York City Transit, then known as the New York City Transit Authority. It is not the former headquarters of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, of which New York City Transit is a subsidiary.",The New York Times
2018,This Internet Person Thinks Your ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’ Memes Are Terrible,"“I don’t know anything about this.” — Larry David. Jason Richards is known as @Seinfeld2000 on Twitter, where he explains what the world would be like if “Seinfeld” were on TV today. He messaged me recently to explain that he was incensed by the misuse of a meme that he says he popularized three years ago. This meme consists of adding the theme music from “Curb Your Enthusiasm” to an unrelated video clip, often zooming in on someone who is visibly trapped in an awkward situation and thereby making light of the person. In 2019, he said, he is looking to help end the meme. I invited him to tell me more, so he did. (This interview was stitched together from many, many direct messages, and a telephone conversation, and edited for clarity, coherence and grammar.) — JONAH ENGEL BROMWICH Jason Richards: Thank you. Before we get into it, I just want to preface this by saying I’m glad you’re taking some time to discuss this serious subject. I understand that this is a confusing time for digital media. Instagram keeps adding widgets and baubles nobody wants in an effort to make us spend more time staring into Kylie Jenner’s vacant eyes. Most of Facebook’s users are dead. News publishing start-ups are struggling, with companies like Mic being sold because they spent their funding on a gold foosball table that says WOKE on it that doesn’t work because every player is a replica of Colin Kaepernick taking a knee. These days the desire to create shareable content is stronger than Stephen Miller’s desire for hair that looks as real as it does on the outside of the can. So I can see how whenever there’s an awkward moment that happens publicly — any awkward moment at all — people working at media companies would immediately rush to make it into a “Curb Your Enthusiasm” meme, without putting any of the love into the content that made it such a beloved meme to begin with. So can you give me some examples? Sure, let’s start with this one. First of all it’s a vertical video. You know, let’s have the wherewithal to record horizontally here, this isn’t Aunt Linda using her Android for the first time. Let’s rein it in, let’s be calm enough to hold the phone in the correct position, first of all. We’re recording a flat-screen and not even facing the TV at the correct angle; it’s off to the side. This is so haphazard. We see someone’s disgusting cupboard above the television. Now we’re zooming in manually. This is pathetic. And also … this is funny on its own. One thing I make sure of is the person we’re zeroing in on has some philosophical situational kinship to Larry David. This guy is trolling Trump. He’s not in an uncomfortable situation; he holds the power here. I can’t really think of an episode of “Curb Your Enthusiasm” where Larry David emerges victorious and is getting his reward as the camera swoops in on him. It’s a complete inversion of the “Curb” formula. It’s just fundamentally wrong. This meme isn’t about just identifying anything, isolating it and putting in the music. But is it just this one guy? Or are there lots of these bad uses? Mr. Richards quickly found four more examples as well as “the one that really set me off,” which came from The Daily Beast’s Twitter account. It’s not just people working at media companies who are abusing the meme. Celebrities (or “celebs” for short) are now exploiting it for their own viral success. Jaden Smith? I would expect this type of online self-indulgence from Will, Jada, Willow or even Trey, but I thought you had more integrity than this. I guess I was wrong. Why do so many of these include the president? The not-very-funny answer is that Trump is such a dominant figure across all media. And a lot of people on Twitter want to see him look like a loser. How can you get mad at people for ripping you off when the meme is taken from somewhere else? I’ve sort of appointed myself the social media guardian of Larry David and HBO slash Warner Media’s intellectual property. I justify that by being something of an originator, I might go as far to call myself a pioneer of this meme, much like Marie Curie or Alexander Graham Bell, spreading knowledge of a pre-existing truth. I suppose maybe the best way to say this is that within the territory of Twitter, I am the gatekeeper of this meme, this particular way of using this content. Larry David has no social presence. In a way, I’m his unintentional surrogate and I like to think that he would absolutely agree. In fact, if you happen to reach out to Larry David for this article and he declines to comment or doesn’t respond, that silence would qualify as absolute consent and complete agreement with me. Mr. David did, in fact, respond, when asked to comment on the phenomenon. “I don't know anything about this,” he said in an email. “Every now and then someone will send me something with 'Curb' music at the end. Some of them I find mildly amusing, some not. Have never really given it any thought except for wondering why anyone would do it."" I wonder if you can retire a meme. It kind of reminds me of the cartoonist who drew Pepe. (Matt Furie's creation, Pepe the frog, was appropriated by white supremacists, leading him, in one memorable phrase, to go “legally nuclear.”) Oh yeah Matt Furie … but I think that kind of worked in the long run! I am retiring the “Curb Your Enthusiasm” meme on Jan. 1, 2019. Beginning next year, no one will be allowed to make a video where they zoom in on an uncomfortable moment and add the “Curb Your Enthusiasm” theme song to it capped with an abrupt end credit. And you might say: @Seinfeld2000, how ever will you enforce this ban? As usual, I’m already 100 steps ahead of you. I’m working with disgraced Twitter C.E.O. Jack Dorsey to ensure that anyone who attempts to post one of these memes will be immediately exiled from the platform. Just to give you an update on this plan, so far, I have DM’ed Jack with the proposal and I am awaiting a response. As soon as he reads my DM, I’m sure he’ll make this initiative his top priority, over adding an edit button or banning Nazis, people who send death threats, and worse, people who link to their SoundCloud accounts the moment a tweet gets over 500 RTs. If this plan doesn’t work for WHATEVER reason, here are three tips for when you’re attempting to make your own Curb Your Enthusiasm meme, which will never be as good as mine, to seem less pathetic: Choose good moments. In today’s always-on culture, cringe-worthy events happen all the time. Be a good editor and pick only the moments that will work best. Usually these will have to be drawn out and painful enough to accommodate the first 12 seconds of the “Curb Your Enthusiasm” theme and have a character suffering in the center of it all. Have you found a moment where an athlete laughs awkwardly for a moment? That’s not quite right. I know, but everyone on Twitter is laughing about it. Still, be strong. A better moment will come along soon. Let the hacks take this one on. No sloppy iPhone screen records. Download the video and open it in iMovie and use the Ken Burns effect, just like the professionals do. This is the Curb Your Enthusiasm meme, not amateur hour at Captain Johnny’s Two-Cent Peanut Circus. Have some respect. Stay true to “Curb Your Enthusiasm."" No juxtaposing credits over the video or cutting the shape of the video square. Is that what the show is like? No. Do you even watch the show? Lastly, I just want to leave you with a thought. One thing I’ve always tried to promote on my Twitter account is the idea of imagination. I ask what “Seinfeld” would be like today and like to make my own suggestions, but there’s really no wrong answer. The only real answer is: “Seinfeld” today is whatever you want it to be. Is it imaginative to just use the “Curb Your Enthusiasm” meme anytime something slightly weird happens on TV or social media? That’s a rhetorical question, and so I’m not obligated to answer, and yet I will: It simply is not. And so that’s why I am leaving this tired meme, which I am largely responsible for, in 2018, which is almost over.",The New York Times
2018,This Is Ralph Lauren’s Barber,"Fixtures Want the “gentleman cut”? Clemente Dimonda is your guy. Clemente Dimonda climbed into the barber chair, explaining how he came to operate a barbershop in Manhattan, and to cut the hair of a generation of men’s wear executives, including Ralph Lauren. “I used to work on Jamaica Avenue,” in Queens, Mr. Dimonda said. “One of the old men, Sicilian guy, he used to work in the shop where I used to work.” In the stories of Mr. Dimonda, who is from Naples, barbering is filled with moments of high drama. In his Italian-accented English, he went on: “One day, this man grab me by the jacket like this” — Mr. Dimonda seized his suit vest with both hands — “and he say, ‘Look at me!’ I say, ‘I look at you!’ He say, ‘You’re too qualified for this area. You got to go to New York. You make a lot of money.’” The barber raised his finger and poked the air to finish: “I never forget.” That was 50 years ago. Today, Mr. Dimonda still wields a pair of scissors at age 85. He is known for giving what he calls a “gentleman cut, no crazy look, high class, clean-cut,” and for using old-fashioned supplies like witch hazel, cotton necklaces to catch loose hair and monogrammed capes. Designed by Mr. Lauren and rather unusually tucked into the eighth floor of the Polo Ralph Lauren headquarters at 650 Madison Avenue, Mr. Dimonda’s operation looks, as one customer described it, like “the sort of a barbershop you’d expect to see on an ocean liner in the ’30s.” Mr. Dimonda’s voice swells with admiration when discussing his most famous client and patron. He began cutting the fashion designer’s hair in the late 1960s, “when he was a regular guy.” He styled Mr. Lauren when he appeared on the cover of Time in 1986, and on many other magazine covers, and still tends to his hair today, though not as frequently since the designer has come to prefer longer locks. Pictures of the barber with Mr. Lauren adorn the shop walls, and Mr. Dimonda recalled the time another customer, an executive for Saks Fifth Avenue, cast a disparaging eye on them. “He say, ‘Why you have a picture of him in the shop?’ I say, ‘Take it easy. Be like him and I put your picture up.’ It’s impossible to find another man, a generous man, like Ralph. The best.” Mr. Lauren praised Mr. Dimonda as well. “Clemente has a very interesting personality. He’s a fun guy to talk to,” he said on the phone. “The persona is one thing, but his expertise as a guy who knows how to cut hair is the most important thing.” For many years, Mr. Dimonda operated a barbershop on Fifth Avenue and 46th Street, and before that at the Berkshire Hotel, where Winthrop Rockefeller was a client. It was there that he cut the hair of the executives who worked for the fabric mills and clothiers, who in turn introduced him to Mr. Lauren. As Mr. Lauren’s business grew and he became busier, it was harder for him to interrupt his workday to visit Mr. Dimonda, he said: “I asked, How would he like a barbershop? I built him a classical barbershop. There’s no rent. It was convenient for me and good for Clemente because I said if he wants any accounts to come in, that’s fine with me.” Mr. Dimonda initially had trouble adjusting to the move into the Ralph Lauren offices, 27 years ago. He felt that some employees didn’t understand his stature in the trade, or why he was in their pantry using the coffee machine. He recalled: “One of the ladies — she was a big shot, now she’s out — she say, ‘Oh, too many people over here.’ Later, when she saw me and Ralph walk down the street together, then she become my best friend.” Mr. Dimonda smiled as he remembered the triumph: “Now she knows who is Clemente. Who’s a barber who got this kind of relationship with the clientele?” In recent years, some of Ralph Lauren’s young female employees have adopted Mr. Dimonda as a grandfather figure. They created and run his Instagram account, and stop in to see him during work hours. Jessica Malot, a graphic designer for Polo Ralph Lauren, has visited Mr. Dimonda at home on Long Island, where he lives alone as a widower, to help him hang drapes. White-haired and bushy-mustached, compact and courtly, Mr. Dimonda always wears a tailored suit and tie, often set off with a fedora. He reigns over his shop like the king of a tiny city-state, banishing customers who have shown him disrespect and yelling across the partitioned space for the second barber and manicurist under his employ. “Margarita! Margarita!” Mr. Dimonda was shouting. Margarita Andrade, a manicurist who has worked for him for 13 years, answered wearily, “Yes, Clemente.” Mr. Dimonda ordered, “Give him one of those pictures. It’s right on the top drawer.” The Xeroxed newspaper article, from 1991, described Mr. Dimonda as the barber “whose clientele reads like a who’s who of men’s wear.” The garmentos came in part to hear industry gossip; what one executive said in the barber’s chair often got passed on to the next. Many of the people cited — Kenny Bates of Roger LaViale; Cliff Grodd of Paul Stuart; Peter Strom of Polo Ralph Lauren — are now dead or out of the industry. But some of Mr. Dimonda’s clientele from that period remain, including Alexander Julian, the men’s wear designer, who was scheduled to come in that afternoon. While he waited, Mr. Dimonda told of how he also cut the hair of Tommy Hilfiger, who “used to come here for an excuse,” Mr. Dimonda said, suggesting that Mr. Hilfiger was less interested in a “gentleman cut” than in getting a look around the Polo offices. “He used to come at night all the time,” Mr. Dimonda said. “One night I show him out, I say, ‘Tommy, let’s go.’ He say, ‘No, go ahead, I follow you.’ I say, ‘No. You follow me.’ And since then, no more Tommy.” Mr. Hilfiger did not return a request for comment. Mr. Dimonda recently had a blowup with another customer, a millionaire businessman, over the prices he charges, which run $80 plus tip for a cut up to $150 for the full treatment of a cut and a shave. After he took a car service from Long Island to dye and trim the man’s beard, Mr. Dimonda felt he was underpaid. “I tell him, ‘Don’t come here no more.’ I got a reputation. I throw the people out. I love you. But don’t take advantage of me.” Mr. Dimonda sighed. “After the operation, I lose control very fast,” he said, referring to his open-heart surgery eight years ago. He has cut back his hours, from 8 o’clock to around 3, and takes a car service to work. He tends to longtime customers and passes new clients to Frank Statella, the barber who works the shop’s second chair. More mild-mannered than Mr. Dimonda, Mr. Statella came to America from Italy the same year, 1961, and also started working in barbershops as a boy in impoverished postwar Southern Italy (Sicily in his case). He is slightly younger, at 73. Mr. Julian appeared in the doorway, calling out to Mr. Dimonda, “Il Maestro! Il Maestro!” Balding, with an overgrown beard, Mr. Julian sat in the barber’s chair, and Mr. Dimonda draped him with a cape made from his own shirting fabric. “This man is not a barber,” Mr. Julian said. “This man is a sculptor.” Mr. Dimonda beamed with pride.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | This Is What Our Yemen Policy Looks Like,"Meet Abrar, 12, who is starving in part as a consequence of the American-backed Saudi Arabian war in Yemen. Opinion Columnist ADEN, Yemen I’m giving up most of my column space today to introduce you to Abrar Ibrahim, a 12-year-old girl in Yemen who weighs just 28 pounds. Nothing I write can be as searing or persuasive or true as Abrar is in this photo. Abrar is starving in part as a consequence of the American-backed Saudi Arabian war in Yemen. Members of the United States Congress are considering measures that would end our country’s support for the war. They should look at Abrar. Her emaciation reflects the reality that United States policies are contributing to the deaths of children in Yemen by the tens of thousands. It is wrenching for me as an American to travel across this country and see the toll of my country’s actions. The most common war casualty in Yemen is not a soldier with a bullet but a child who is starving. True, there are complex roots to the suffering in Yemen, but the United States is a partner in a war that has collapsed Yemen’s economy and kept fishermen, like Abrar’s father in the port city of Hudaydah, from going to sea to haul in their catches. So Abrar is now fighting for her life in a hospital in Aden. American and Saudi officials think of the Yemen war as a way to check Iran. It has failed in that and has accomplished little more than leaving 12 million Yemenis on the brink of famine. Already, 85,000 children may have died. We are complicit. Saudi and American officials say that the enemy, the Houthi rebels who govern much of the country, are oppressive and are backed by Iran. That’s true. But how do we explain to Abrar that because we want to make a point, she must starve? The parents of starving children allowed photos to be taken because they hope that people outside their country will act differently if they understand the human cost of three years of war. Doctors don’t know if Abrar will survive. She deserves our hopes and prayers, and an end to this shameful war. Look at Abrar, and any additional commentary seems superfluous.",The New York Times
2018,This Is the Best ‘Messiah’ in New York,"If you grew up thinking of Handel’s “Messiah” as a sweet, staid pageant, a holiday ritual involving a little nap and a stand-and-deliver “Hallelujah” chorus, the forces of Trinity Wall Street offer the gritty, fearless cure, from Dec. 13-17, with what stands apart as New York’s best. (The Dec. 16 performance will be webcast live at 3 p.m., then available on demand.) “We want to touch people,” Julian Wachner, Trinity’s director of music and the arts and the conductor of its “Messiah,” said in a recent phone conversation. “We want it to not be your grandmother’s ‘Messiah.’” That desire can be a cliché — after all, no one says they want to perform your grandmother’s “Messiah” — but Trinity, more than anyone else, actually makes it happen, expanding your sense of what the piece can be and do. [Read more about some of this year’s holiday-themed events.] I remember my first encounter with the annual Trinity presentation, in 2011. Most takes on “Messiah” have settled into a pattern: A chorus is joined by a quartet of soloists — often fancy opera singers — who trade off Handel’s gorgeous arias. But Trinity drew its soloists, more than a dozen of them, from the ranks of its own choir. Immediately a formal concert became a collective rite. Not all of those soloists were perfectly polished, but there was something affecting about the bits of roughness. The arias were transformed beyond the usual displays of sumptuous vocalism; they were urgent, even desperate communication. The choir included male altos, with a whiteish, trumpeting tone; the Trinity Baroque Orchestra was composed of period instruments, with a reedy tang. Dense yet airy, with biting diction and dramatic dynamic shadings, the Trinity choir sang a furious “Surely he hath borne our griefs” and an “All we like sheep have gone astray” of rollicking, almost celebratory intensity, egged on by a muscular, unrelenting orchestra. “We’re very much believing it’s Baroque music,” Mr. Wachner said. “There’s dance, there’s energy to it. There’s not this sense that you do one movement, wipe your brow, turn your page, and do the next movement. Opera was the basis of everything that Handel knew, and oratorio was a development through that.” Trinity continues to experiment with its performance. Last year, Mr. Wachner switched the traditional genders of all the solos, inspired by the strengths of the roster he had at the time. (Imagine a bass singing “He was despised,” traditionally taken by a female alto.) There was, Mr. Wachner admitted, a bunch of hate mail in the aftermath, but also a lot of responses that spoke of how special the experience had been and how much it revealed about the score. This year, some but not all of the assignments will be gender-switched, for a version neither fully experimental nor fully traditional. Perhaps even more important, while Trinity Church is closed for two years of renovations, “Messiah” will be performed in the far more intimate St. Paul’s Chapel. “Trinity elicits hushed tones,” Mr. Wachner said. “There is a separation, like at Carnegie Hall. At St. Paul’s, it’s more of a communal feeling.” This fresh location promises to emphasize what is most memorable about Trinity’s presentation: its visceral drama and elemental energy. As it happens, Mr. Wachner was first exposed to “Messiah” as a boy chorister at St. Thomas Church Fifth Avenue, which often is the first high-profile performance of each holiday season (this year, Dec. 6) and sets a generally high, graceful standard for the weeks that follow. • After practicing a few weeks ago with a program of early music — including Handel’s “Water Music” — under the baton of Emmanuelle Haïm, the New York Philharmonic is turning to another Baroque specialist, the conductor Jonathan Cohen, for “Messiah” this year (Dec. 11-15). The instruments will, of course, be modern, but the orchestral forces are likely to be substantially reduced from full symphonic strength and vibrato, one assumes, will be at a minimum. The quartet of soloists includes the countertenor Anthony Roth Costanzo, fresh from a series of ambitious staged performances juxtaposing works by Philip Glass and, happily, Handel. The Philharmonic will be joined by the Westminster Symphonic Choir, which also does the piece (through Dec. 9) with the Philadelphia Orchestra and its music director, Yannick Nézet-Séguin, who just made his debut in the same position with the Metropolitan Opera and who leads a notably sensitive “Messiah,” operatic without being overblown. 212-875-5656, nyphil.org; 215-893-1999, philorch.org • Masterwork Chorus, one of the amateur groups that dominated the “Messiah” scene a few decades ago, brings the work to Carnegie Hall on Dec. 20. Also at Carnegie, Kent Tritle leads the 200-voice Oratorio Society of New York (Dec. 17) and, not long after, the far smaller Musica Sacra (Dec. 19). 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org",The New York Times
2018,This Is the Most Important Week of the N.F.L. Season. Here’s Why.,"An N.F.L. game played in December counts the same as a game played in September — and yet, it doesn’t. The later it gets, every play grows fraught with consequence in a way it didn’t, it couldn’t, before the season’s final thrust. Week 15 abounds with pivotal clashes, and the results will both tidy the playoff picture and muddle it deeper. Of the 16 games, 12 feature at least one team that holds a playoff spot or is within a game of one. Distilled further: Six of those matchups are between contending teams. An interactive calculator that lets you explore every team’s path to the N.F.L. playoffs. The games that most figure to influence the playoff field will be contested in Pittsburgh, Minneapolis, Indianapolis and Kansas City, where this critical week begins Thursday night, with first place in the A.F.C. West — and, more, potentially — at stake for the Chiefs and the Chargers. [N.F.L. Week 15 Predictions: Our Picks Against the Spread] With assistance from The New York Times’s Playoff Simulator, here’s a look at how those games will shape each of the involved teams’ postseason chances. (Note: The numbers may change slightly every time you refresh the simulation. Don’t worry about small differences.) Sunday, 4:25 p.m. Eastern, on CBS Three weeks ago, the Pittsburgh Steelers had the second-best record in the A.F.C. Three straight losses later, the Steelers, with a loss on Sunday to New England, could face the prospect of not winning their own division, and potentially not even advancing to the postseason. Unfathomable as that may seem, Pittsburgh’s playoff odds, currently at 68 percent, crash to 48 percent with a loss, and its division title odds fall to 45 percent. Defeating the Patriots would pump up the Steelers’ playoff chances to 87 percent and their division chances to 78 percent, fending off the Baltimore Ravens for at least another week. The Patriots’ concerns are equally dire because, face it, THEY PROBABLY WON’T EARN HOME-FIELD ADVANTAGE IN THE A.F.C. PLAYOFFS. Excuse the all caps there, but that’s a huge stinkin’ deal in New England, which has hosted the conference championship game in five of the last seven years. The Patriots have neither clinched a playoff berth nor their 97th consecutive A.F.C. East title (or is it their 98th?). As it stands now, though, they have a 67 percent chance of earning their ninth consecutive first-round bye but only a 6 percent chance of the No. 1 seed. Should they shove Pittsburgh deeper into the abyss, the Patriots get a bye in 88 percent of the Simulator’s scenarios and the top seed 15 percent of the time. For all of New England’s dominance in recent years, the Patriots don’t make the Super Bowl when they lack home-field advantage in the playoffs. Their last three road playoff losses have come in the conference championship: 2014 and 2016 at Denver, and 2007 at Indianapolis. A loss in Pittsburgh wouldn’t assure New England of playing on wild-card weekend — the Patriots would still have a 52 percent chance if earning a bye — but it would surely heighten the drama quotient heading into the final two weeks. When they host Buffalo and the Jets. Oh, well. Sunday, 1 p.m. Eastern, on Fox The longest winning streak in the N.F.L. belongs to the team lampooned for trading a first-round pick for receiver Amari Cooper. But with 35 receptions for 584 yards and five touchdowns in his last five games, Cooper has helped propel the Cowboys to five consecutive victories. Without him, Dallas most likely would be meandering on the periphery of the playoff race instead of entrenched in first place in the N.F.C. East, a division title all but guaranteed. A win Sunday at Indianapolis would clinch that title for the Cowboys, who probably won’t catch New Orleans or Los Angeles for a first-round bye. They could still overtake Chicago, the expected N.F.C. North champion, for the No. 3 seed, but the Simulator deems it far more plausible that the Cowboys finish fourth in the conference — a 76 percent chance, at present, that drops to only 70 percent if Dallas beats the Colts. Considering the logjam of 7-6 teams currently led by Baltimore, it’s hard to envision Indianapolis sneaking into the playoffs if it loses Sunday. Then again, it was hard to envision Indianapolis winning at Houston, which had won nine in a row, after the Colts had been shut out by Jacksonville a week earlier. The Colts have a 31 percent chance of making the postseason and those odds plunge to 20 with a loss Sunday. Defeating Dallas would also maintain the Colts’ slimmer-than-a-microphone-stand hopes — currently 9 percent — of capturing the A.F.C. South, regardless of how division-leading Houston fares against the Jets on Saturday. Thursday, 8:20 p.m. Eastern, on Fox And now, for Patrick Mahomes’s next trick. After a masterful escape against the Ravens on Sunday, Mahomes can seal the A.F.C. West title and a first-round bye for Kansas City — and all but lock up the No. 1 seed — with a victory Thursday night at home against the Chargers. With their two-game lead over New England and Houston, the Chiefs would have a 97 percent chance of snaring home-field advantage throughout the playoffs by overcoming Los Angeles. A loss creates some suspense across the final two weeks, diminishing the Chiefs’ probabilities of securing a bye in the playoffs to 75 percent and the top seed to 64 percent. Any other year the Chargers would be poised to win the division and host a playoff game. Just their luck that their best team since 2009 happens to coalesce the same year that a division rival fields one of the most electrifying offenses in league history. Imagine the Chargers finishing with the second-best record in the conference but entering the playoffs as only the No. 5 seed. It’s quite possible; they are the A.F.C.’s first wild-card team in 87 percent of the Simulator’s scenarios. A loss Sunday has no impact on the Chargers’ playoff chances. But if they beat Kansas City for the first time since 2013, their odds of winning the division swell to 26 percent from 11. Though the teams would be tied atop the A.F.C. West, Kansas City would hold the tiebreaker because of its better record in divisional games. Sunday, 1 p.m. Eastern, on CBS All that separates the Dolphins — a team that lost four of five earlier this season, features one of the N.F.L.’s more feeble passing offenses, and has a defense that ranks among the league’s worst in stopping the run, the pass and teams on third down — from the No. 6 seed, at present, is one fewer victory than Baltimore against common opponents. Yeah, we’re dumbfounded, too. The Simulator has watched enough of the Dolphins this season to peg their chances of emerging as a playoff team from this morass at about 20 percent. Those chances increase to about 38 percent with a win at Minnesota and plunge to 12 percent with a loss. Which, it should be noted, is still better than the 0.1 percent probability they had of beating New England on Sunday, trailing by 5 with the ball at their 31-yard line and 7 seconds remaining. If the Dolphins’ laterals galore could generate a 69-yard game-winning touchdown as time expired, then they can certainly win at Minnesota. The Vikings’ inadequacies were on full display in a 21-7 loss Monday night at Seattle. They fired their offensive coordinator, John DeFilippo, on Tuesday. The Seahawks (8-5) have a 98 percent chance of capturing a playoff spot, which, since the Rams already clinched the N.F.C. West, would be a wild card. The other wild-card spot, remarkably enough, still has a decent chance of going to Minnesota, which makes the playoffs in 51 percent of scenarios. The mediocrity (or worse) in the N.F.C. — hello, Panthers, Eagles, Packers and Falcons — has by default elevated the Vikings to contender. From their perspective, Sunday’s matchup with Miami is one of the bigger swing games of the week. A victory over the Dolphins inflates Minnesota’s odds of making the playoffs to about 68 percent, while a loss drops them to about 22 percent.",The New York Times
2018,"This Metal Is Worth More Than Gold, and It Scrubs Your Car’s Exhaust","Palladium, a silvery-white metal used in cars and sometimes jewelry, has topped gold in commodities trading for the last three days. Gold was long the most valuable of precious metals, until, suddenly, it wasn’t. Last week, an obscure and far less sexy rival called palladium swung ahead, for the first time in 16 years. Gold briefly retook the lead, but spot palladium prices have beaten out gold prices for the past three days. Palladium hit a record high on Wednesday before settling in at $1,255.12 an ounce at the market close in London on Thursday, according to data from SP Angel, an investment research firm. Gold was $1,243.02 an ounce. It is an impressive dethroning aided by economic shifts, antipollution legislation, union campaigns by mine workers and global trade negotiations. Until recently, palladium was perhaps best known for sharing a name with several popular entertainment venues and for powering the fictional arc reactor mechanism hooked up to Iron Man’s heart. Its primary purpose is far less glamorous: More than 80 percent of the world’s palladium is used in the catalytic converters that help vehicles manage their pollutant output. Palladium is one of the best-performing commodities of 2018. Its price has surged more than 50 percent in the past four months. Some dealers have sold out of the metal. For at least the near future, palladium will most likely remain in high demand and short supply, experts said. Here, we explain how a metal usually ignored in favor of gold, silver and platinum has recently eclipsed them all. A cousin of platinum and traditionally much less expensive, palladium is part of a family of metals known as the “noble metals” because they resist corrosion and oxidation. Palladium was discovered in the early 1800s by William Hyde Wollaston, a British scientist. It was named after Pallas, a recently identified asteroid. Silvery-white and durable, the metal is used in surgical instruments, dental alloys and in cellphones and other electronics. Jewelers like Jenny Windler in Berkeley, Calif., sometimes use it because it is hypoallergenic and “not too fussy to work with,” she said. Palladium was also less expensive than other precious metals like gold or platinum. In the past few months, palladium men’s rings have been among the most popular search terms on her online store, Ms. Windler said. But she uses the metal in less than 10 percent of her products. Recently, Ms. Windler was buying platinum online and noticed a price chart that listed palladium as more expensive. “I thought, ‘that can’t be right; it must be some kind of typo,’” she said. Increasing efforts to regulate tailpipe emissions in the 1970s paved the way for palladium’s gradual popularity. The metal, along with platinum and rhodium, helps keep toxic exhaust in check by reacting with carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxide to make them less harmful. For decades, palladium has been a major, but largely unseen, component of cars. A shift away from diesel vehicles, whose catalytic converters rely more heavily on platinum, has intensified the demand for palladium, especially in Europe. Sales of gasoline-fueled cars had surged for several years until this year. Tighter emissions regulations have led automakers to use more palladium. Demand for the metal for catalysts will reach a record high of 8.5 million ounces this year, according to the consulting firm Metals Focus. But car sales are beginning to soften. In the United States, drivers are keeping their cars longer and, faced with rising interest rates, are hesitating to replace them. President Trump is pushing ahead with his proposal to significantly roll back emissions rules for cars and light trucks. In China, demand for palladium could be tempered by worries about the slowing economy, tariffs by the Trump administration and curbs on lending to consumers. “That’s collectively weighing on demand for new cars,” said Rohit Savant, the director of research at the commodities research firm CPM Group. Palladium is extremely rare, mostly generated as a byproduct of platinum mined in South Africa and nickel mined in Russia. Palladium’s price spiked in the early 2000s in reaction to disruptions in supply from Russia and increased interest in catalytic converters. Demand for palladium has steadily increased for eight years and is expected to outstrip supply by 1.2 million ounces in 2018, and Metals Focus has forecast “further, sizable deficits to come.” As supply tightens, palladium’s price has climbed. In South Africa, contentious wage negotiations with unionized miners and complaints about hazardous working conditions in recent years have resulted in strikes (and occasionally violence) that have sometimes stymied production. Many mining companies are loaded with debt and trying to cut costs, analysts said. Mining more palladium requires more platinum mining. But diesel’s decline, exacerbated by the emissions cheating scandal that engulfed Volkswagen in 2015, has depressed platinum prices. “The political environment for running platinum mines in South Africa, and the economics, have been getting worse and worse,” said John Meyer, a mining analyst at SP Angel. “Platinum mining has fallen a long way: It’s difficult, it’s dangerous and it’s extremely difficult to run.” Sibanye-Stillwater, a South African company, runs the only commercial palladium-generating mines in the United States and expects to produce 468,000 ounces this year from its Montana facilities. A growing percentage of palladium comes from recycling. The metal is usually stripped from old catalytic converters and electronics, smelted and refined for reuse. Most palladium is sent straight from the mine into the automotive supply chain. Although the federal government began issuing an official one-ounce palladium coin last year, palladium is “not a big bar-and-coin market,” said Philip Newman, the director of Metals Focus. Investors are generally involved in palladium futures or exchange-traded funds. The metal, Mr. Newman said, is “a niche.” Even as the prices for most other metals struggled this year, palladium hit high after high. Experts expect it to stay elevated for at least a few months. But coming investments by mining companies and shifts in clean-air technology could cause the price to slip. In Russia, the Norilsk Nickel mining giant indicated this week that it would spend more than $12 billion to raise production over the next five years. The company is the world’s largest producer of palladium. Investors might move into gold and other safe-haven assets as they digest predictions of slowing global growth, the roiling equities market and the fading effects of last year’s tax cuts in the United States, analysts said. And the push toward cleaner vehicles could result in more electric cars, which do not require catalytic converters. Electronics and automotive companies, such as Toyota, are developing technologies that use fewer precious metals. “The last thing any of these companies want is huge swings in prices,” Mr. Savant said.",The New York Times
2018,This Provocative Band Played North Korea. Now They’ve Made an Album About It.,"LJUBLJANA, Slovenia — On a recent afternoon, Ivan Novak, a member of the Slovenian rock group Laibach, went for a walk in the hills overlooking the country’s capital, Ljubljana. In between stops to pet passing dogs, he explained what it was like when Laibach became the first Western band to perform in North Korea. In 2015, the group made headlines around the world — many bemused — when they played a show in the insular, communist country that consisted mostly of over-the-top covers from “The Sound of Music.” An album of the same name featuring some of those songs — including “Maria,” reworked to ask, “How do you solve a problem like Korea?” — has just been released as a final document of the trip. The technical setup for the Pyongyang show, held in a theater next to the headquarters of North Korea’s secret police, left a little to be desired, Novak said. “There was one plug for everything,” he said. Its cord had to be stuck down with tape so people didn’t trip over it. North Korea’s censors turned up during rehearsal to listen and demand changes, he added. “They kept telling us the songs had to be quicker: ‘Happy tune! Happy tune!’ ” Officials also asked if Laibach’s lead singer, Milan Fras, could be dropped from the show, Novak said, partly because his voice — a deep growl — sounded uncannily like Kim Il-sung, the grandfather of the current ruler Kim Jong-un, singing and might disturb the audience. (After negotiation, Fras ended up performing.) “We didn’t mind,” Novak said of the censorship. “They’re very sensitive about music. They want it to always be nice, and upbeat.” Novak continued to recount memories from the tour, making the whole process of playing North Korea sound so enjoyable and interesting that it didn’t sound as if the band had been in one of the world’s most repressive nations. “Of course it’s a totalitarian country,” Novak said, with a shrug. “But which country is not totalitarian nowadays?” Laibach was a surprising choice for North Korea. Since forming in 1980 in Trbovlje, a mining town, when the country was part of Yugoslavia, they have been one of Europe’s most provocative bands. They started out playing bombastic industrial music, appearing on stage in old army uniforms and making heavy use of symbols and poses that suggested fascism or extreme nationalism. Laibach is the German name for Ljubljana, used by occupying German forces and collaborators in World War II, and some in 1980s Yugoslavia thought the band were Nazi apologists or right-wing extremists. The authorities banned them from performing under that name. “In the time of socialism, they almost provoked a revolution,” said Marina Grzinic, a Slovenian philosopher who has written about Laibach since the 1980s. “They wanted to force us to think about our history,” she added. “It was necessary to be shocking, to shake everything up, to force people to think.” Alexei Monroe, an academic who has also written extensively about the group, said, “They wanted to explore the relationship between art and totalitarianism.” Laibach used totalitarian symbols, taking them to absurd extremes as a way of mirroring society and showing where it might be headed, he said. The band has made albums exploring many different kinds of power, Monroe added, exercised by everything from nations to corporations, often changing their musical style each time. (They have covered “Jesus Christ Superstar” as well as a selection of national anthems.) It wasn’t just in Yugoslavia that Laibach caused confusion. They were equally misunderstood when they first went to the United States. A 1988 review in The Times described the band as “either an ugly phenomenon or a didactic joke — and a loud one either way.” (The same review highlighted one song’s lyrics — “Let’s make the United States of America first again” — which now seems 30 years ahead of its time.) Laibach’s refusal to explain themselves fueled the misunderstandings. When asked in the 1980s by the German newspaper Die Zeit if they were Nazis, for instance, the band replied in a written statement, “We are Nazis as much as Hitler was an artist.” They have largely left the explaining to others, such as academics like Monroe and Grzinic. Slavoj Zizek, the Slovenian left-wing philosopher, once wrote, “Laibach does not function as an answer, but as a question.” Monroe agreed with this. In Slovenia, the band’s politics are widely seen as far left, he said. But Laibach wants to provoke and perplex. “If there were no uncertainty, it wouldn’t be Laibach anymore,” he said. “Why should I explain?” said Novak, 60, who officially does “the lights” for the band’s shows, but also shapes its music and artistic choices, when asked to talk about Laibach’s motivations. “If you are a poet, you don’t talk about your poems. You don’t say, ‘When I wrote “water,” I actually meant something completely different.’ ” “Especially if you write modern poems,” he added. “Those are complicated.” The band has recently gained fans in the alt-right who like their outfits and pomposity, Novak said. He laughed at the idea, but refused to denounce it. “We simply don’t belong to anyone,” he said. Novak said the band wanted to cover “The Sound of Music” long before they visited North Korea. Learning that North Koreans love the movie gave them an excuse. “It’s one of the few American films they’re allowed to watch. They learn English with it, apparently,” he said. It was a way of communicating across the cultural and musical divide, he added. He denied there was any provocation behind the choice. “Climb Every Mountain,” for instance, was not intended as a call for the North Korean people to rise up, he said. “It’s a purely sexual song,” he added, before going into a long explanation of the Freudian aspects of “The Sound of Music.” “What’s the point in going to North Korea to destroy the system that is going to change by itself anyway, slowly?” Novak said. “They live a life they believe is the best possible life, most of them.” If he wanted to provoke anyone with the trip, it was Westerners who are willing to believe anything about North Korea, he added. A few hours after the walk, Novak went to a “Balkan sushi” restaurant in the middle of Ljubljana for dinner. “It’s raw meat, basically,” he said. “I’m a vegetarian, but here I eat meat.” Novak was joined by other members of the band, including Fras, who spoke in a high-pitched voice, completely different from the rumbling bass of his singing style, and Boris Benko, a singer who also took part in the North Korean trip. “I thought that by going we’d learn something about North Korea,” Benko said. “But actually when you go there, you realize you’ll never know anything. Because you’re never sure. Is this real what we’re seeing? Is this staged? You’re always questioning.” Isn’t that a lot like watching, or meeting, Laibach? Benko laughed, and avoided answering the question.",The New York Times
2018,This Robin in a Sun Hat (and the Government) Want You to Stay Safe This Holiday Season,"The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission’s approach to social media is designed to save lives and get laughs at the same time. Here are its best holiday safety tips. The acting chairman of the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission, Ann Marie Buerkle, wants to keep you safe this holiday season. Handsome Ron would like the same. Handsome Ron is one of the many characters that Joseph Galbo, the commission’s social media specialist, developed to put a fresh spin on tried and true safety tips. Via the agency’s Twitter, Instagram and Facebook accounts, Mr. Galbo takes the C.P.S.C.’s standard safety messages and, as he thinks of it, puts them “in a fun wrapper.” To create that fun wrapper, he pairs whimsical graphics featuring recurring characters, like Handsome Ron, a sun hat-sporting robin inspired by Ron Swanson from the television show “Parks and Recreation,” or Forcefield Baby, one of Mr. Galbo’s early creations, with text-based safety messages about topics ranging from Halloween costume dangers to not walking while texting. “We have a challenge at the C.P.S.C. to get what we consider extremely important information to the consumer. There’s just so much noise out there, and so one of the avenues that we’ve chosen is,” Ms. Buerkle said with a laugh, “I’ll call it nontraditional.” Mr. Galbo is aware that he needs to walk a fine line with his messaging. “The mission of the agency is to protect consumers, and that’s something we always have to be working toward,” he said. “So even with the crazy names and the zany characters and the pictures of birds, it’s important that people are learning.” According to the commission, cooking is the No. 1 cause of residential fires — and as the holiday season gets underway, that number triples, with some 1,800 kitchen fires occurring on Thanksgiving Day alone. There are simple steps to take to stay safe while cooking, starting with not leaving food unattended on the stove or in the oven. “Stand by your pan!” one clever C.P.S.C. graphic reminds you — and when it’s put that way, who could forget? While cooking, avoid wearing loose clothing or long sleeves that can catch on fire, and keep flammable items like potholders and paper or plastic bags away from the stove. Perhaps most critically, check that there are working fire extinguishers and smoke detectors in your home. “Many of these safety tips apply year round,” Ms. Buerkle said, “but certainly during the holiday season, when people are cooking more, we see the number of incidents go up.” As the commission’s Twitter account will remind you, not all heroes are smoke alarms, but all smoke alarms are heroes. Fire hazards abound during the holiday season, and not just in the kitchen. Holiday décor like Christmas trees, candles and holiday lights can also take a quick turn for the dangerous. If you have a live Christmas tree in the home, make sure it has plenty of water, because dry trees are a major cause of home fires during the holidays — the commission estimates that there are 100 Christmas tree fires annually — as this video dramatically demonstrates. Artificial trees, too, can be fire hazards and so, when buying one, the C.P.S.C. advises looking for the “fire resistant” label. Christmas trees, whether real or artificial, should be placed well away from heat sources like fireplaces, vents and radiators. Keep lit candles away from flammable items, so when setting up a menorah or kinara, take note of its surroundings; all burning candles should be placed on a stable, heat-resistant surface where children and pets cannot reach them or knock them over. Burning candles should be kept within sight and extinguished before leaving the room, and wicks should be trimmed to a quarter of an inch. Holiday lights with broken or cracked sockets, frayed or bare wires or loose connections can also start fires, and each set of lights, new or old, should be checked before being hung. When shopping for holiday gifts for children, Ms. Buerkle stressed the importance of heeding age labels to buy age-appropriate toys. “Parents want to think their child is ahead of the curve and they’re really smart,” she said. “But the age determination, or grading, means something.” Ms. Buerkle warns that buying a toy graded for an age older than its recipient could have small parts that make it unsafe. If you’re looking for categories of toys to avoid entirely, look no more: The majority of toy-related deaths involving children under 15 are caused by riding toys, like nonmotorized scooters and tricycles; toys with small parts — including small balls — which are choking hazards; and perhaps surprisingly, balloons. (Uninflated balloons pose choking or suffocation risks to young children, and their strings are a strangulation risk.) If you do buy a riding toy, be sure also to buy protective gear, like helmets and pads.",The New York Times
2018,This Sandwich Is a Luxurious Holiday Gift to You,"Eat With my dad, money was always a bit of a wild ride. Sometimes he got the bills paid, but other times he really didn’t. Champagne at Christmas many years; administratively withdrawn from school campuses for unpaid tuition some others. While raising a family of seven on an artist’s mercurial paycheck, he managed some miracles. His genius was in his agility in toggling between the flush and the lean, sometimes in the same year — the five kids piled into the station wagon and taken with our very best table manners to the Russian Tea Room for chicken à la Kiev, for the Rockettes at Radio City, walking Fifth Avenue to the tree — in spite of the electricity’s being shut off or having to siphon gas for the car. With deep practice I’ve learned to braid them into one single experience without having to switch back and forth at all. Caviar for the holidays, yes, but not rolled in on the proper silver cart, with the glittering shaved ice, the warm blini tucked in the white napkin, the mother-of-pearl spoons. I’m saying, rather, a kind of louche, very likable but humbler deal: a sandwich. With domestic farmed caviar, spooned between two thin pieces of white toast, with boiled egg and crème fraîche and chopped scallions in there, too, for an affordable, but luscious and haute, lowbrow sandwich. All at once a little messy and a little decadent and a little modest. As my father would cheerfully say, “Diamonds and burlap!” He was a big fan of maxims like that, repeated with such frequency and pleasure when he landed on ones he found of particularly good use, meant to protect us and inspire us, I’d like to think, even if sometimes they misfired and grazed your ear like a stray bullet: “The world doesn’t need another mediocre painter!” to the high school senior hoping to apply to art school. “Professionals deliver; amateurs explain why they couldn’t!” to the 9-year-old who wasn’t able to get the shifter on the sit-down mower into gear. One that never seemed to sting, though: “Nobody has any new ideas; it’s all in knowing who to steal from!” It continues to be particularly useful. The idea for a caviar sandwich is not mine; it comes from the Oyster Bar at Grand Central, where it is, I say with sincere and grateful respect, not executed as well as it could be. But we’ve fixed that here. You need to start with good white toast; Pepperidge Farm “Very Thin” is our preferred. It isn’t sweet like so many shelf-stabilized loaves, and it has excellent structure to stand up to the ingredients — delicate with a very satisfying dry crispness once toasted. Butter the toast and spread the crème fraîche, lavishly, from edge to edge — wall to wall, as we say — so that there will be no empty dry dull bites no matter where you dig in. And be sure to lay on the eggs, the caviar, the chives with as much generous abandon as you can muster. An ounce of good caviar from a reputable source is going to run some 50 bucks at least. If you can swing it, one more spoonful, one more schmear — then all the better. Stretching the tin of caviar into a sandwich that could conceivably treat four people is already all the parsimony the dish can take. We run this as a single appetizer at the restaurant for the holidays. Does it feed four? I think the only way to answer this is to know what kind of year you are having and to decide if the kids’ tuition comes first or last! As my dad always said: “It’s shortsighted to let money be the reason you don’t do something.” Being a little more cautious myself, I’ll split this sandwich with my wife, Ashley, but our impeccably fabulous friend Patti — the giant glittering studs in her ears are not cubic zirconia — orders three of her own, in a row, when she visits us at Prune. Since we are all here on the eve of the many special events that come in a quick series at this time of the year — Christmas, New Year’s and Valentine’s Day back to back to back — when caviar is the Thing, the true and only thing, indisputable and expected, it strikes me as a perfect time for the caviar sandwich. Even if you are sitting in the dark in your apartment in long johns and you have to share one four ways. Recipe: Caviar Sandwich cooking",The New York Times
2018,This Type of Illiteracy Could Hurt You,"the new old age More than half of older Americans lack the skills to gather and understand medical information. Providers must simplify, researchers say. Every time her parents pick up a new prescription at a Walgreens in Houston, they follow Duyen Pham-Madden’s standing instructions: Use the iPad she bought for them, log onto FaceTime, hold up the pill bottles for her examination. Her mother, 79, and father, 77, need numerous medications, but have trouble grasping when and how to take them. The label may say to take one pill three times a day, but “my dad might take one a day,” said Ms. Pham-Madden, 56, an insurance purchasing agent in Blue Springs, Mo. “Or take three at a time.” So she interprets the directions for them, also reminding her mother to take the prescribed megadose of vitamin D, for osteoporosis, only weekly, not daily. Part of their struggle, Ms. Pham-Madden believes, stems from language barriers. The family emigrated from Vietnam in 1975, and while her parents speak and read English, they lack the fluency of native speakers. But recently, Ms. Pham-Madden said, her father posed a question that anyone grappling with Medicare drug coverage might ask: “What’s the doughnut hole?” [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Researchers refer to this type of knowledge as “health literacy,” meaning a person’s ability to obtain and understand the basic information needed to make appropriate health decisions. Can someone read a pamphlet and then determine how often to undergo a particular medical test? Look at a graph and recognize a normal weight range for her height? Ascertain whether her insurance will cover a certain procedure? Most American adults — 53 percent — have intermediate health literacy, a national survey found in 2006; they can perform “moderately challenging” activities, like reading denser texts and handling unfamiliar arithmetic. Just 12 percent rank as “proficient,” the highest category. About a fifth have “basic” health literacy that could cause problems, and 14 percent score “below basic.” Health literacy differs by education level, race, poverty and other factors. And it varies dramatically by age. While the proportion of adults with intermediate literacy ranges from 53 to 58 percent in other age groups, it falls to 38 percent among those 65 and older. The percentage of older adults with basic or below basic literacy is higher than in any other age group; only 3 percent qualify as proficient. Why is that? Compared to younger groups, the current generation of “older adults were less likely to go beyond a high school education,” said Jennifer Wolff, a health services researcher at Johns Hopkins University. Moreover, “as adults age, they’re more likely to experience cognitive impairment,” she pointed out, as well as hearing and vision loss that can affect their comprehension. Consider the recent experience of a retired 84-year-old teacher. All her life, “she was very detail-oriented” and competent, said her daughter, Deborah Johnson, who lives in Lansing, Mich. But a neurologist diagnosed mild cognitive impairment last summer and prescribed a drug intended to ameliorate its symptoms. It caused a frightening reaction — personality changes, lethargy, dizziness, sky-high blood pressure. Ms. Johnson thinks her mother might have overdosed. “She told me she thought, ‘This is going to fix me, and I’ll be O.K. So if I take more pills, I’ll be O.K. faster.’” Yet health literacy can be particularly crucial for seniors. They’re usually coping with more complicated medical problems, including multiple chronic diseases, an array of drugs, a host of specialists. They have more instructions to decipher, more tests to schedule, more decisions to ponder. Low health literacy makes those tasks more difficult, with troubling results. Studies indicate that people with low literacy have poorer health at higher cost. They’re less likely to take advantage of preventive tests and immunizations, and more apt to be hospitalized. It may not help much that future cohorts of older adults will be better educated. “The demands of interacting with the health care system are increasing,” Dr. Wolff said. “Ask any adult child of a parent who’s been hospitalized. The system has gotten increasingly complex.” That doesn’t mean patients deserve all the blame for misunderstandings and snafus. Rima Rudd, a longtime health literacy researcher at Harvard University, has persistently criticized the communications skills of health institutions and professionals. “We give people findings and tell them about risk and expect people to make decisions based on those concepts, but we don’t explain them very well,” she said. “Are our forms readable? Are the directions after surgery written coherently? If it’s written in jargon, with confusing words and numbers, you won’t get the gist of it and you won’t get important information.” A few years ago, Steven Rosen, 64, had spent more than two months at a Chicago hospital after several surgeries. Then a social worker came into his room and told his wife Dorothy, “You have to move him tomorrow to an L.T.A.C.” “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Ms. Rosen recalled saying. “What’s an L.T.A.C.?” Question: Was she demonstrating inadequate health literacy, or should the social worker have clarified that L.T.A.C.s — long-term acute care hospitals — provide more care than nursing homes for very ill patients? Aware of such issues, health care organizations are scrambling to try to make information more accessible and intelligible, and to help patients of all ages understand an often bewildering environment. They’re hiring squadrons of care coordinators and navigators (sometimes too many), and redesigning and rewriting pamphlets and forms. They’re teaching medical students to communicate more clearly and to encourage patients’ questions. They’re turning to technology, like secure websites where both patients and family members can see test results or ask questions. “It’s not the silver bullet we hoped for,” said Amy Chesser, a health communications researcher at Wichita State University, pointing out that many patients are reluctant to turn to provider websites. But the potential remains. For now, though, often the primary health literacy navigators for older people are their adult children, most commonly daughters and daughters-in-law. “In the best of all worlds, she’d just be the daughter,” Dr. Chesser said. “But we need her to serve other roles — being an advocate, asking a lot of questions of the provider, asking where to go for information, talking about second opinions.” The current cohort of people over 70 grew up in a more patriarchal medical system and asking fewer questions, Dr. Wolff pointed out. Her research shows that while most seniors manage their own health care, about a third prefer to co-manage with family or close friends, or to delegate health matters to family or doctors. Duyen Pham-Madden plays the co-managerial role from hundreds of miles away, keeping spreadsheets of her parents’ drugs, compiling lists of questions for doctors’ appointments, texting photos to pharmacists when the pills in a refilled prescription look different from the last batch. She’d probably score well in health literacy, but “sometimes even I get mixed up,” she said. What’s the Medicare doughnut hole? “I had to look it up,” she said. Once she did, she wondered, “How do they expect seniors to understand this?”",The New York Times
2018,"This Week in Arts: ‘Stan & Ollie,’ Winter Jazzfest, Marie Kondo on Netflix ","Dec. 28. John C. Reilly knows the value of a great partnership, and since September he’s doubled up in “Ralph Breaks the Internet” (with Sarah Silverman), “The Sisters Brothers” (Joaquin Phoenix) and “Holmes & Watson” (Will Ferrell). Now comes “Stan & Ollie,” opening Friday, Dec. 28 in New York and Los Angeles before a national rollout on Jan. 25. In it, Reilly plays the outsize Oliver Hardy to Steve Coogan’s diminutive Stan Laurel, snagging a Golden Globe nomination for best performance by an actor in a motion picture, musical or comedy. “Stan & Ollie” has plenty of both — the classic slapstick, the sweetly zany song-and-dance routines — as it follows the legendary duo through variety halls in 1953 Britain while the men try to jump-start their stalled careers. And their bickering wives (Shirley Henderson and Nina Arianda) say what their husbands dare not. But mostly it shines a light on the tender twilight of Laurel and Hardy’s enduring collaboration, and the hurdles — Hardy’s gambling and poor health, Laurel’s lingering resentment after Hardy briefly went solo — that threatened to stop the show. KATHRYN SHATTUCK Jan. 4-12; winterjazzfest.com. It’s never hard to find jazz in New York City, where one night’s worth of bookings can range from classic bebop to the most outré fringes of the avant-garde. That might explain the sheer breadth of Manhattan’s largest and most forward-looking jazz festival, the Winter Jazzfest, which has steadily expanded steadily its founding as a one-day, one-location concert in 2005. This year’s edition supplements its two-day marathon on Jan. 11 and 12 (over 100 artists across 11 downtown venues) with a half one on Jan. 5, featuring a comparatively manageable six stages. The festival’s 2019 artist-in-residence, the genre-agnostic singer, bassist and bandleader Meshell Ndegeocello, will perform during both the full and half marathons. She will also helm a Prince tribute concert at Le Poisson Rouge (Jan. 4) and play from her own catalog at the intimate club NuBlu 151 (Jan. 10). In total, the festival shows jazz at its most expansive and inclusive: It’s the only Stateside jazz festival to participate in Keychange, a program that encourages festivals to reach gender parity in their lineups by 2022. NATALIE WEINER Jan. 1; Netflix.com. Haven’t heard of Marie Kondo and her mission to “spark joy” by decluttering the world? You must have been buried under a mountain of stuff. The Japanese Kondo achieved cultish devotion upon the 2014 publication of “The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up,” with its charmingly singular rule: Hold each item and if it doesn’t elicit a sensation akin to cuddling a puppy, then send it packing — but not before honoring its former place in your life with a “thank you.” Now, timed perfectly to resolutions season, Netflix is unveiling “Tidying Up With Marie Kondo” on New Year’s Day. In eight episodes, Kondo tutors Americans at pivotal points in their lives — a new marriage, a baby’s arrival, an empty nest, a husband’s death — in her KonMari Method, which advocates simplifying, organizing and storing in five categories (clothing, books, paper, miscellaneous, which she calls komono, and sentimental items). Then there’s folding, folding, folding, accompanied by crying, crying, crying. “I’m so excited because I love mess,” says an exuberant Kondo, who believes that a clean home results in happier relationships.

The dancers aren’t the only ones on the brink of exhaustion by the end of this jam-packed festival, which started 10 years ago as the brainchild of Thomas Benjamin Snapp Pryor. Mercifully, it’s a good tired. This year’s American Realness features new works by Miguel Gutierrez, Marissa Perel and Sujata Goel, along with five United States premieres. Eight encore productions include Gillian Walsh’s “Moon Fate Sin,” Nora Chipaumire’s “100% Pop/Shebeen Remix” and Jack Ferver’s “Everything is Imaginable.” Yet Realness, running 10 days at 12 venues across New York City, offers more than performances. Five lecture performances will explore ideas around creative practice and protest. And Emily Johnson’s “Kin” series, Jan. 5-10, at Performance Space New York will highlight the work of five Indigenous artists from Australia, along with the New York-based Muriel Miguel. The only problem will be fitting it all in. GIA KOURLAS Through June 23, 2019; mcny.org. Don Freeman is most famous for his 1968 children’s book “Corduroy,” about a lonely department-store teddy bear finding a friend. The story is sweet but deeply melancholy, and Freeman’s illustrations, which combine saturated colors with a muscular line, have a beguiling gravity. The Californian transplant and Art Students League of New York alum, who died in 1978, also applied his talent to vistas of the city in the 1930s and ’40s.

WILL HEINRICH Jan. 3-Feb. 9, romanticcentury.org. The great Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini was in his 60s when a gang of fascists assaulted him in 1931 Bologna for refusing to play their anthem. With Benito Mussolini in power at home and Adolf Hitler ascendant in Germany, Toscanini looked on in horror as European nations codified bigotry into law and hurtled toward war. Hitler once sent him a fawning letter, hoping in vain to lure him to perform at the Bayreuth Festival. Mussolini wiretapped Toscanini’s hotel room and, overhearing him decry anti-Jewish measures, had his passport taken away. Eve Wolf’s multimedia “Maestro,” a music-drenched historical drama that follows Toscanini through the ’30s and ’40s, mixes in an affair of the heart, too, as the world comes apart. Starring the leonine Australian actor John Noble (“Fringe”) as Toscanini, and produced by the Ensemble for the Romantic Century, the show is based partly on the conductor’s letters to his much younger lover. Performances start on Thursday, Jan. 3, at the Duke on 42nd Street in Manhattan. LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES Jan. 3-5; nyphil.org. The conductor Paavo Jarvi is a mainstay at the New York Philharmonic: This March marks the 20th anniversary of his first appearance with the orchestra, and last season he led a bracing account of Sibelius and Rachmaninoff. This week, Jarvi fills in last-minute, as the hotly anticipated debut of conductor Mirga Grazinyte-Tyla was postponed because of the birth of her first child. The dependably revelatory Jarvi will oversee a program including not only two repertory chestnuts — Dvorak’s Cello Concerto, with the soloist Gautier Capuçon, and Ravel’s “Daphnis et Chloé” Suite No. 2 — but also a lesser-heard movement from Sibelius’s enchanting “Lemminkainen Suite.” WILLIAM ROBIN",The New York Times

Starwood loyalists have yet another reason to be mad. The rewards program integration with Marriott’s (the two hotel companies started a long merger process in 2016) has not been going smoothly, and on Friday, Marriott announced an enormous breach of the database of its Starwood reservation system. Information about 500 million guests — including some customers’ names, addresses, dates of birth, passport numbers, email addresses and phone numbers — was lifted from the company’s networks. The breach was larger than the Equifax debacle last year. Police officers, prosecutors, tax authorities and other agents descended on Deutsche Bank headquarters in Frankfurt on Thursday, as part of an investigation into whether the bank helped clients launder money in an offshore tax haven. Management board members’ offices were searched the next day, dramatically raising the stakes for the bank. Deutsche Bank said it was cooperating with the authorities. It’s had a lot of practice: The raid is only the latest dose of turmoil for Deutsche, which for years has seen significant executive turnover and legal settlements running into the billions.

2018,This Week’s Wedding Announcements,"All of the weddings right here on one handy page for you. Considering that Daina Agee and Michael Mastrandrea met in Malaysia, though both were born in New York and she was living in Taiwan at the time while he was on an extended international backpacking trip, it’s probably not that surprising that a geographic misunderstanding surfaced early in their relationship. In 2013, their paths crossed at a hostel in Kuala Lumpur that is known for its rooftop bar and party atmosphere. She was on her way to Nepal for a hiking trip, and he was headed to Bali to celebrate his birthday. He told her he was from Cincinnati. She told him that she taught English to schoolchildren in Taipei. “We had things in common — we’re both originally from Long Island, we have similar world views, we’re outward looking and really progressive, we like minimalist living, and are interested in politics,” she said, noting that the two stayed up until 3 or 4 in the morning talking. “There was just something about him that reminded me of New York, and of home.” The two commenced a friendship through Facebook messages, and some weeks later, when she was back in Taipei, he suggested that he might visit Taiwan for a week or so. “I was staying in a hostel for maybe five or six days,” he said, “and the assumption was that maybe I’d be staying in Taipei for a week or two. Ten days later or so, I moved into her apartment.” Read more. Bethany Lowery and Joseph Zielinski met in May, 2017 through the dating app Bumble. “I found Joe’s profile refreshing,” Ms. Lowery said. “There were no vanity photos or Kurt Vonnegut quotes. Instead he talked about his love of volunteering, which drew me to him.” “He seemed down-to-earth and thoughtful,” she added, “without trying too hard to impress.” Mr. Zielinski was immediately attracted to a picture of Ms. Lowery standing in front of the United States Capitol at the 2017 Women’s March. “I could tell that she was strong and independent,” he said. On their first date, at a professional soccer game in Indianapolis, Mr. Zielinski playfully said to Ms. Lowery that if the game had been rained out, he was prepared to impress her with his knowledge of 19th-century feminists. “At the end of that date, I texted my brother that I had just met my wife,” Mr. Zielinski said. “We got along so naturally, I didn’t have to try and be anyone else around her but myself.” They began seeing each other as often as possible, and despite a stark difference in personalities — “she is outgoing and tends to be dramatic,” he said, while “he is more the quiet and analytical type,” she said — they found those differences to be complementary. Within three weeks, they had exchanged “I love yous,” and within three months, they were so convinced they had a future together that they began shopping for wedding rings. Read more.

When asked who had kissed the other first, Ms. Ughetta, laughing much harder, said, “I think it was a tie.” They dated throughout high school and continued as an item through most of their time together at North Carolina, but in their last semester as seniors, their relationship “hit a serious rough patch,” as Ms. Ughetta put it.

Along the way, they discussed a great many matters of the heart, everything from the reasons their longtime relationship made so much sense to the senseless death of Ms. Ughetta’s mother, who had died two years earlier from nonsmoker’s lung cancer and became her inspiration for pursuing a career in oncology and end-of-life care. “Many things were mended during the course of that trip,” Ms. Ughetta said. “Above all, we realized how much we always enjoyed each other’s company.” Read more.

2018,"This Winter, Don’t Just Sit by a Crackling Fire. Smell Like It, Too.","Skin Deep Log cabin perfumes are here to make your winter extra cozy. “I bloom indoors in the winter like a forced forsythia,” the author and naturalist Annie Dillard wrote in 1973. “I come in to come out.” Winter, as a season, is all about being inside — physically and metaphorically. It is about regrouping, hunkering down, searching internally for inspiration. Fragrance is all about bottling our deepest desires and selling them right back to us; and this season, people very much want to smell like timber and bonfires. They want perfumes that not only bloom indoors but smell like the inside of a cozy wooden house. Log Cabin Perfumes, as I have taken to calling the growing category of scents that evoke a cold snap all year round, are fairly new to the market. A decade ago, only a few niche fragrances prominently featured notes like Scotch pine, birch tar, gunpowder, palo santo and wood smoke. In 2009, Serge Lutens released Fille en Aiguilles, a cult hit that smells like a Christmas tree farm, and slowly the hibernal trend began to trickle through the indie perfume world. Now, the demand for wearable wintry mixes has exploded. “These scents are experiencing a renewal and will be with us for some time,” said John Biebel, the perfumer behind the indie fragrance house January Scent Project. “It’s a bit of escapism, but actually to many it may be a desire to return to ‘real’ life, full of unfiltered smells of the forest, the mountains, the freshly cracked wood branch and pine cones underfoot.” Mr. Biebel’s newest scent, Burvuvu, is a wonderfully complex marriage of two different types of cedar (the dry, dusty Virginia varietal and the sweeter, milkier red cedar) as well as tree lichen and an unexpected note of wild mushrooms. The result smells like an antique wooden chest filled with muddy soil. Cedar is a common theme among Log Cabin scents. Cedarise, a new scent from the Parisian house Hermetica, contains cypress, vetiver root and the slightest citrus squeeze of pink grapefruit. Bois Sikar, the latest release from Atelier des Ors, another Parisian line, layers nutmeg and gooey styrax resin atop a base of cedar leaves, which lends the entire composition the exact scent of a glass of overly peated single-malt scotch. No two Log Cabin scents smell alike — they invoke more of a mood board (chilly, smoky, ponderous) than a cohesive olfactory profile. What they have in common is that they tend to be woody, unisex and very strong. Mr. Biebel attributes this aromatic excess to the way skin reacts to perfume in low temperatures. “Heavier and smokier scents evaporate slower off our skin in winter because our skin is much colder,” he said. “In summer this would all happen too quickly. Winter allows us to breathe in resins and smokiness at a trickle, which has a beautiful haunting quality.” Franco Wright, the co-founder of the popular Los Angeles boutique Scent Bar and the online retailer Luckyscent, has seen a demand for perfumes that smell like being swaddled in lumberjack flannel, even in a city that stays balmy all year round. “By reminding us of simpler times and pleasures, even the most powerfully rugged winter scents can gift us a feeling of extreme coziness,” he said. Simple pleasures are part of the Log Cabin scent allure. They encourage us to slow down and breathe deeply. Many contain green, herbal notes that can induce a camphorous, cleansing feeling. This year, the gothic perfume house Sixteen92 in Dallas released the Fall of the House of Usher, a scent that is so rich with pine and fir needles that it can clear your sinuses. The Brooklyn house D.S. & Durga found inspiration in medicinal woods for the new Amber Kiso, which, according to the co-founder David Moltz, contains “an old world base of vanilla and myrrh and holy Japanese woods, like hinoki and maple, the kind that ritual samurai would rub on their blades.” Smudge, a new scent from Heretic, a New York line founded by Douglas Little, who also happens to be the nose behind Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop perfumes, takes the concept of winter cleansing to a near literal level. The star of the perfume is an overdose of white sage, which when combined with labdanum, juniper and violet leaf, smells like a heady incense that one might burn to purify their home (or cabin). If there is one Log Cabin scent that truly exemplifies the category, in that it smells like a snow globe crunched into a bottle along with candy canes and firewood, it is Dasein’s Winter, which has gained a true cult following over the last five years. The perfumer, Samantha Rader, who works as a psychology clinic director in Los Angeles when she isn’t blending scents at home, wanted to make a fragrance that “smells like Christmas, but is a perennial.” She settled on an icy cocktail of Scotch pine, blue spruce, French lavender and black cardamom, which she began selling in 2013 at just three local boutiques. She sold 100 bottles of Winter in less than a week and suddenly had more orders than she could fill. “There is a whole back-to-the-earth movement going on with the aesthetic elite right now — potato sack dresses, neutral colors, less grooming,” Ms. Rader said. “People want the perfume equivalent of slow cooking.” At first, in order to fill the huge demand for Winter and still keep her day job, Ms. Rader decided she would release the scent only once a year, from October to January, in a limited batch. She has kept the tradition going, even as she started selling in 80 stores. She wants Winter to feel special, like a sacred holiday happening. The perfume regularly sells out every year, and when it is gone, it is gone. “I get emails all year long for it,” Ms. Rader said. “People saying they will pay triple if I make them a bottle. I’m touched. But the fact that they can only get it when the scent of pine is in the air is part of the magic.”",The New York Times

2018,"Thomas Altizer, 91, Proponent of ‘God Is Dead’ Theology, Dies","Thomas J. J. Altizer, one of a handful of radical theologians in the 1960s who espoused that “God is dead,” died on Wednesday in Stroudsburg, Pa. He was 91. His daughter, Katharine Altizer, said the cause was complications of a stroke. Dr. Altizer, who lived in Mount Pocono, Pa., was under hospice care at the time. The idea that God was dead had been around for centuries, most prominently with Nietzsche in the late 1800s. But after World War II and the Holocaust, it re-emerged in the United States, as Dr. Altizer, who taught religion at Emory University in Atlanta, and others questioned whether a benevolent God could exist. The subject burst out of the ivory tower on April 8, 1966, when a stark Time magazine cover, all black with bold red letters, pointedly asked: “Is God Dead?” The article, highly nuanced on the theme, focused mostly on how science and secularism were supplanting religion. But in a country where 97 percent of adults said they believed in God, it touched off a ferocious backlash against the magazine and led to the vilification particularly of Dr. Altizer, who was more visible than the others, spoke to the press and had a certain theatrical flair. “God is dead,” he asserts with finality in a documentary produced for National Educational Television after the Time article came out. “This God is no longer present, is no longer manifest, is no longer real.” He even went on the “Merv Griffin Show,” a popular television talk program, though the event, held before a live audience in a Broadway theater, was a debacle. He was given two minutes to speak. “The response was a violent one,” he wrote later, “forcing the director to close the curtains and order the band to play forcefully, and after this event a crowd greeted me at the stage door, demanding my death.” His theology was esoteric and not easily understood, leaving most people, including many clergy, to react viscerally to its basic premise. Confusing matters was that the few theologians in his intellectual circle — including William Hamilton, Paul M. Van Buren and Rabbi Richard Rubenstein — did not agree among themselves on how God had died, why he had died or what his death meant. They were essentially writing God out of the picture, but they did not consider themselves atheists; Dr. Altizer called himself a Christian atheist, further muddying the waters. “He was one of the country’s most hated, misunderstood, radical and prophetic voices of the past century,” said Jordan E. Miller, who taught religion at Stonehill College in Massachusetts, wrote articles with Dr. Altizer and considered him a mentor. The “God Is Dead” cultural moment, such as it was, was short-lived. A year after the Time article, Dr. Altizer lamented that he was no longer “the bad boy of theology” but felt more “like the invisible man.” But he had inflamed evangelicals, and his lasting effect may be that he helped give rise to the religious right. “I suggest that both evangelical and mainline Protestantism’s development from the late 1960s were a reaction against his theology,” said Christopher D. Rodkey, who is pastor at St. Paul’s United Church of Christ in Dallastown, Pa., and who also considered Dr. Altizer a mentor. Thomas Jonathan Jackson Altizer was born on May 28, 1927, in Cambridge, Mass., a descendant of Thomas Jonathan “Stonewall” Jackson, the Confederate general. His parents — Jackson Duncan Altizer, a lawyer, and his mother, Frances Helen (Greetham), a prominent socialite, who later worked for the American Red Cross — were in Massachusetts for only a short period, soon returning home to Charleston, W. VA., where they raised Thomas and his two younger sisters, Jane and Nell. The family, which traced its lineage to the nation’s founders, was wealthy. While much of the rest of the country had plunged into the Great Depression, the Altizers lived in a world of servants, socialites and formal dress for dinner. Dr. Altizer’s daughter said in a telephone interview that her father “had a deep sense of shame of his family’s wealth.” He often ate in the kitchen with the African-American servants. Ms. Altizer, who is a family therapist, said that Thomas’s father was an alcoholic, that Thomas tried to protect his mother from his father’s abuse and that he was prone to periods of despair. At the same time, she said, he was a natural showman. He acted in an amateur theater and commanded attention when he walked into a room. Although he was ashamed of his privilege, she said, his heritage — and his namesake — imbued him with confidence. “He rejected the politics of Stonewall Jackson,” Dr. Miller said in a telephone interview. “But having that ancestry was a validation for him that he was doing what he needed to do.” Dr. Altizer was married three times and divorced three times. His first wife, Gayle Cygne (Pye) Altizer, was the mother of his son, John. His second wife, Alma (Barker) Altizer, was the mother of his daughter. His third wife was Barbara (Walters). In addition to his daughter, Dr. Altizer is survived by his son and two grandchildren. Dr. Altizer graduated from Stonewall Jackson High School in Charleston in 1944 and briefly attended St. John’s College in Annapolis, Md., before enlisting in the Army, where he worked on radios for bombers. After the war, he went to the University of Chicago, graduating with honors in 1948. He received his master’s in theology from the university’s divinity school in 1951 and a Ph.D. in history of religions from its graduate school in 1955. Dr. Altizer had hoped to become an Episcopal priest. But, as he wrote in his memoir, “Living the Death of God” (2006), he failed a rigorous psychiatric evaluation; a psychiatrist told him that he would probably be institutionalized within the year. He had just been through a turbulent period, he wrote, having “experienced an epiphany of Satan.” He then had another epiphany, he added, that was more angelic but that nonetheless led to a religious conversion “to the death of God.” Blocked from becoming a priest, Dr. Altizer spent Sundays serving as a lay minister at a multiracial Episcopal mission on Chicago’s South Side. Going on to a teaching career and speaking at conferences, he often lectured in the style of a preacher. “He often wore bright-colored clothing and spoke with a gusto and passion that wasn’t typical at an academic conference,” Dr. Rodkey said. “Sometimes he was yelling.” Dr. Altizer taught briefly at Wabash College in Indiana before leaving in 1956 for Emory, where he gained the most attention over the next 12 years. In 1966, when the Time article came out, he also wrote two of his roughly 20 books: “Radical Theology and the Death of God,” with Dr. Hamilton, and “The Gospel of Christian Atheism.” While many called for his ouster from Emory, the administration stood by him. But he left in 1968 to teach English at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Dr. Altizer, who moved to the Poconos in 1996, maintained that his views had been misunderstood and the anger directed toward him misplaced. But, he wrote in his memoir, “while I offended many permanently, and lost every hope of a foundation grant or a major academic appointment, I have never regretted the offense that I gave.”",The New York Times
2018,"Thomas Carter, Accused of Harassing Employees, Has Left His Restaurants","The restaurateur Thomas Carter and the chef Ignacio Mattos, who together built an influential group of quirky-cool Manhattan restaurants from 2013 to 2017, have formally ended their relationship. Mr. Mattos has bought all of Mr. Carter’s interest in Estela, Café Altro Paradiso and Flora Bar, the restaurant group said in a statement on Friday. This move makes Mr. Carter the first New York City restaurateur recently accused of harassing employees to be entirely ousted from his businesses. A spokesman for the group said that from now on, Mr. Carter would not benefit financially in any way from the restaurants. The chef Mario Batali and the restaurateurs Ken Friedman and Julian Niccolini continue to collect profits from the enterprises they built. In August, Mr. Carter stepped away from his three restaurants after the website Eater published an article detailing a pattern of verbally abusive and sexually suggestive behavior by the restaurateur, based on interviews with more than 30 former employees. The article also quoted several unnamed people as saying that Mr. Mattos, the more publicly celebrated of the two partners, had been aware of Mr. Carter’s behavior. Both men apologized publicly, but denied that Mr. Carter had done anything other than use inappropriate language. The two men were partners in the restaurant group, Matter House; Mr. Mattos acted as chef and Thomas Carter as sommelier and floor manager. The hip, modern minimalism that they specialized in was instantly appreciated by customers and critics. President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama made it a stop on one of their “date nights” in New York City. Together, the three restaurants hold six stars from the New York Times critic Pete Wells, who named Flora Bar one of the best new restaurants of 2017. Mr. Carter did not comment on his departure from Matter House, but his lawyer, Lawrence Haut, said the group’s statement had been approved by both parties. It read, in full: “Ignacio Mattos and Thomas Carter have come to a mutual agreement to part ways, with Mattos purchasing Carter’s interests in Estela, Cafe Altro Paradiso and Flora Bar. Carter has resigned from all of his positions and will no longer be associated with the restaurants or management company.” In an email, Mr. Mattos said, “Right now I’m focusing on my staff, and very grateful for the team I work with every day.”",The New York Times
2018,"Thomas Keller Opens Another Napa Valley Spot. This Time, It’s a Taqueria.","Off the menu An expansion for the award-winning Dead Rabbit, a restaurant closing in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, and more restaurant news. Thomas Keller, the world-famous chef and restaurateur, is adding to his busy portfolio in Yountville, Calif., in the Napa Valley with a casual taqueria. He had the opportunity to take over a local fixture, Hurley’s restaurant, when its owner decided to retire. “It’s a beautiful location,” Mr. Keller said. “But I didn’t know what to do with it, so I thought about what the town needed.” Yountville already had Italian, French and American restaurants, including Mr. Keller’s French Laundry, but Asian and Mexican were missing. He decided on Mexican, a cuisine he has never explored, and contacted Susana Trilling, a food writer who has a cooking school and inn in Oaxaca, Mexico. It turned out that her son, Kaelin Ulrich Trilling, who was born and raised in Oaxaca, was a chef and had even been doing consulting in New York. “We saw eye-to-eye,” Mr. Keller said. Mr. Trilling, 26, got the job and traveled throughout Mexico before opening the restaurant. Though his menu is fairly simple, it includes various regional specialties, like an assortment of moles, often made from chiles and spices imported from Mexico. Tortillas are made from corn ground and nixtamalized in-house. “We’re making them by hand; we expect to hand-press 700 to 800 a day,” he said. Tacos feature braised short-rib barbacoa, roasted pork “al pastor” and slow-cooked pork carnitas. Marinated wood-grilled fish and wood-grilled skirt steak are also offered. The restaurant is decorated with pieces from Mexican artisans. “We have to respect the traditions,” Mr. Trilling said. The name is that of a celebratory parade and feast frequently held in Oaxaca. (Opens Dec. 30) 6518 Washington Street, Yountville, Calif., 833-682-8226. From the day it opened in 2013, the Dead Rabbit, an award-winning bar with a brogue, has been a sardine can. Now, the founders and managing partners, Jack McGarry and Sean Muldoon, and their partners have taken over some floors in an adjacent building and are using its ground floor to more than double the size of the popular taproom. So now it’s maybe more like two sardine cans. There are additional stools and elbow room at a long bar, several counters and some tables, including two enclosed booths for eight to 10 called “snugs.” The second-floor parlor, a somewhat Victorian-looking pub serving elaborate cocktails, is also extending into the new building but will not open for about eight weeks. The expansion has permitted the owners to renovate and enlarge the kitchen, so they are adding dishes like steak and fries, fish sandwiches and chicken curry. 30 Water Street (Broad Street), 646-422-7906, deadrabbitnyc.com. It has been a little more than a year since this restaurant was opened by the chef Jean-Louis Dumonet, who has not been in the kitchen of a New York restaurant for quite some time (he was at a private club), and his wife, Karen Dumonet.

2018,Opinion | Those Gas-Guzzling SUVs,"letter An environmentalist says Congress needs to act to erase a false distinction. To the Editor: In “Emissions Surge, Hastening Perils Across the Globe” (front page, Dec. 6), the quickening rate of global carbon emissions is likened to a “speeding freight train.” “Gas-guzzling SUV” might be the better analogy. Sadly, America has led the way in creating a global appetite for these lumbering, fuel-wasteful giants. When Congress created a more lenient standard for “light trucks” as a detour around corporate average fuel efficiency standards in the 1970s, the stage was set for a full cast of trucks masquerading as passenger vehicles. In November, light trucks garnered more than 70 percent of new motor vehicle sales. Instead of wringing our hands at the closing of GM plants that make ordinary cars, why don’t we call on Congress to create a unified fuel efficiency regime that erases the fake distinction between cars and light trucks? In doing so, we would begin to correct an environmentally catastrophic wrong here at home while sending a strong, if belated, message to the many countries where car ownership is rapidly rising and SUVs are becoming the new vogue.

2018,Thousands of Migrant Children Could Be Released After Sponsor Policy Change,"The Trump administration announced on Tuesday that it planned to ease onerous security requirements for sponsors of migrant children, meaning that thousands who have been parked in shelters for months could soon be released and reunited with family members. In a major policy reversal, the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the care of migrant children through its Office of Refugee Resettlement, said that it would no longer require that all members of a household where a child is to live be fingerprinted. Instead, fingerprints will be required only of the adult who is sponsoring the minor, typically a parent or another relative. Sponsors of migrant children who cross the border and are taken into custody of the United States authorities must still pass criminal and extensive background checks, the agency said in a statement. However, others in the same home will not be subjected to that extra vetting, which was introduced by the administration in June. As a result, it will take significantly less time to place children with their families, and their stays in the shelters will be much shorter. The agency said in its statement that it was “in the best interest of the unaccompanied children” for it to modify the policy. Some 15,000 migrant children, including adolescents who crossed the border alone and young children who were separated from their parents, are currently warehoused in more than 100 shelters in the United States. In an interview broadcast on National Public Radio on Tuesday, an assistant secretary at Health and Human Services, Lynn Johnson, put it bluntly: “The children should be home with their parents. The government makes lousy parents.” She added that the extra screening “is not adding anything to the protection or the safety of children.” Ms. Johnson said that about 2,000 children in shelters are to be released in the next four or five days to parents who have already been screened. The lengthy warehousing of minors had come under attack from immigrants’ advocates, Democratic lawmakers and medical professionals, who had expressed concern about its detrimental effect on the mental health of the children. “Studies have shown that the institutionalization of children in general, and away from their families, has serious deleterious affects on their psychological and physical health, as well as their growth and development,” said Amy J. Cohen, a child psychiatrist who is an expert on trauma. “It’s a tremendous relief to hear that the government is finally going to enable these children to be reunited with family so that they can start the healing process,” said Dr. Cohen, who has interviewed migrant children in shelters. The influx of migrant youths reaching the border alone, along with the Trump administration’s monthslong practice of separating children from their families and the stringent security screening of potential sponsors, had stretched the shelters to nearly capacity. In June, the federal government erected a tent city on federal land in Tornillo, Tex., about 35 miles southeast of El Paso, as a temporary home for a few hundred migrant children. Several months later, it had expanded the camp to house about 2,800 minors, most of whom were transferred there from traditional brick-and-mortar shelters that were overflowing. The creation and expansion of the desert shelter showed the degree to which the Trump administration had taken a disaster-oriented, militaristic approach to the housing of migrant youths who entered the country illegally, often fleeing gangs or poverty in their home countries. Most of the children at Tornillo have been waiting for the results of F.B.I. checks on their potential sponsors. On Tuesday, staff members at a large complex in Texas operated by BCFS, a nonprofit network of shelters, received notice that they should prepare to release nearly half the children there in the coming days. A worker at the shelter, who asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak to the news media, said that staff members had also been advised to attend a meeting on Wednesday to learn the details of the new government policy. The worker said that many children at the shelter, which has a capacity of about 240, had been showing signs of “psychological duress” as their stay there dragged on. The worker said that some migrant youth had been at the facility for close to a year. “The longer they are here, the more they act up with incidents of aggression toward staff and other minors,” the worker said. The worker attributed the protracted stay to the burdensome fingerprinting and screening process, which took months to complete. The process also inhibited some relatives from collecting the children if others in their household, who were undocumented immigrants, refused to be fingerprinted out of concern that they could be deported. The number of Central American migrants who began leaving their countries and heading to the southwest border surged in 2014, and included many unaccompanied minors, typically adolescents, and parents with children. The wave ebbed in the first year that Donald Trump was in office but has since strengthened.",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | Three Choices on Brexit, None Good","Pity poor Theresa May and her faltering plan for Britain to exit the European Union. Whatever it is, her critics are against it. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. If the British were to follow the German press, they’d find a suggestion in the tabloid Bild that the unofficial motto of British politics has become: “If it’s real then I don’t want to know.” But the hard-core Conservative Brexiteers who decided to try to overthrow Prime Minister Theresa May on the eve of a European Union summit, or the Labourites who revel in mocking her, most likely don’t read Bild or any other “Continental” newspapers. In the rowdy badinage of Parliament, leaving the European Union often seems a purely domestic issue in which nostalgia for empire, political ambition and British pride largely exclude any thought of European Union interests or other realities. Rare is the politician who would suggest that modern Britain should welcome inclusion and a leadership role in a Europe with which it shares so much common history and values. Far more common are declarations along the lines of the song from the old Marx Brothers film “Horse Feathers”: “I don’t know what they have to say / It makes no difference anyway / Whatever it is, I’m against it!” In one of those traditions in which Britain abounds, a party challenge to Mrs. May had to be initiated by 48 letters from Conservative members of Parliament. Not surprisingly, most came from strong backers of leaving the European Union, who for reasons not entirely clear concluded that the prime minister’s failure to bring the withdrawal agreement she had negotiated with the bloc to a vote in Parliament earlier this week made this an opportune time to unseat her as party leader, and in that way, as prime minister. They failed, 200 to 117, but the bitter divisions in the Conservative Party left clear that any version of her agreement stood little chance of ever passing Parliament. One of the more widely cited of the 48 letters was from Owen Paterson, a former secretary of state for Northern Ireland and an ardent Brexiteer. Part of it read: “It was a mistake to treat Brexit miserably as a problem to be solved rather than an exciting opportunity to be grasped. The U.K. is the world’s fifth largest economy. We are a key NATO member, a permanent U.N. Security Council member, a Commonwealth realm, a nuclear power. We are the source of the English language, the common law and occupy the ideal time zone for global trade. Yet from the outset we have approached these negotiations as a feeble and unworthy supplicant.” The most flamboyant of the Brexiteers, Boris Johnson, sounded a similar theme in a typically cheeky article in the current Spectator, claiming he had heard that an unnamed cabinet minister decided to support Mrs. May’s European Union deal because otherwise there was a risk that the manufacturers of Mars Bars would lose access to two key ingredients. “What kind of a country is this? Are we going to abandon a thousand years of national self-rule, and adopt foreign laws — over which we have no control,” wrote Johnson, because they can’t be bothered “to make whatever preparations are necessary for the microscopic risk of us running out of Mars Bars?” The funny Mr. Johnson had already contributed the term “cakeism” for the Brexit delusion when he declared, “My policy on cake is pro having it and pro eating it.” Cakeism is hardly restricted to hard-core Brexiteers. The Labour Party and much of the British public seem to share the illusion that there is a way to reap all the benefits of a single European market and customs union while rejecting freedom of movement and other European Union rules they don’t like. The reality, as Bild would put it, is that the political spectacle in Westminster has not brought Britain any closer to any shared and reasoned notion of how to leave, or stay in, the European Union. Mrs. May has bought time, this week by putting off a vote on her deal and then surviving the Conservative challenge. Under the rules, her Tory foes can’t begin another rebellion for a year, and while they were keen to humiliate her, they are wary of bringing down the entire government for fear of a general election that would usher in the old-school leftist Jeremy Corbyn and his Labour Party. So the three fundamental options have not substantially changed: a negotiated deal, no deal, no Brexit. And for all of Britain’s grand history, Europe will not give it free cake or Mars Bars.

2018,"Three Dates in Three Years, Then They Clicked","Mini-Vows Scott Keller Sanders and Peter Scott Wilson were married Dec. 17 at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau in New York. Angel L. Lopez, a staff member of the New York City Clerk’s Office, officiated. Mr. Sanders (left), 55, is an interior designer with offices in New York and Palm Beach, Fla. He graduated from Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio and received an associate’s degree in interior design from Parsons School of Design. He is the son of Shirley A. Sanders and Charles I. Sanders of Piqua, Ohio. Mr. Wilson, 63, retired as a partner in the New York law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore, where he was a member of the mergers and acquisitions practice. He graduated from McGill University in Montreal and received a law degree from Harvard. He is a son of Marie K. Wilson of New York and Donald J. Wilson of Santa Fe, N.M. It was hardly love at first sight in 2004 when the couple met at Hell, a bar in the meatpacking district known for having a vintage-looking jukebox with an eclectic selection. “I was out with one of my best friends,” Mr. Wilson said. This friend knew the friend accompanying Mr. Sanders that night. “I thought Scott was cute, and started talking to him.” They exchanged numbers, and a week later Mr. Wilson asked Mr. Sanders to see “Wicked,” which had just opened on Broadway. “Peter was very sweet, and very smart, but I wasn’t ready to settle down,” Mr. Sanders said. “It didn’t connect. There were no sparks.” Mr. Wilson could quickly sense that, and they went their separate ways. “You know when people are going through the motions,” Mr. Wilson said, but a year later after they ran into each other in the beach town Fire Island Pines on Long Island, Mr. Wilson decided to try again, asking Mr. Sanders out to dinner in the West Village. “It was pleasant enough, but he still wasn’t looking for a relationship,” Mr. Wilson said. In July 2006 that seemed to change when Mr. Wilson ran into Mr. Sanders at an Empire State Pride Agenda tea dance in the Hamptons. “I was really happy to see him,” said Mr. Sanders, who accepted an invitation to what he thought would be a dinner party at Mr. Wilson’s house a couple of weeks later. “It was his birthday,” said Mr. Sanders, who recalled thinking, “Oh no, I didn’t bring a present.” He decided to set things right by asking Mr. Wilson if he could take him out to dinner to celebrate. “That was a good sign,” Mr. Wilson said. A couple of weeks later, they had a romantic dinner at Wallsé, an Austrian restaurant in the West Village. “We had a corner table,” Mr. Sanders said. “It was very special. Very relaxed. It clicked.” After that dinner they saw each other a lot that summer in the Hamptons, and then subsequently in New York. “That was a nice start,’’ Mr. Wilson said. “I just sensed he was at a different place.” Five years later they adopted a dachshund, Bailey, and are now building a house in the Hamptons on a bluff six stories above Gardiners Bay. “The part I love about this, is that we’re creating a home together,” Mr. Sanders said.",The New York Times
2018,Three French Novels You Should Read,"The Shortlist TELL THEM OF BATTLES, KINGS, AND ELEPHANTS By Mathias Énard Translated by Charlotte Mandell 144 pp. New Directions. $19.95. Énard imagines that in 1506, Michelangelo Buonarroti steps away from his work on the tomb of Pope Julius II, and from the vagaries of his powerful patron, to travel to Constantinople at the invitation of the Sultan Bayezid to design a bridge across the Golden Horn. The author presents a few alluring pieces of evidence, pulled from archives, to suggest that such a thing could have happened — mention of an invitation by Michelangelo’s biographer, travel journals the sculptor sent his brother, a recently uncovered sketch — but the rest is a rush of invention of a kind that is conceivable from few other contemporary writers. There is a lush materiality to Énard’s prose, thick and smooth, so that following the artist’s expeditions through Ottoman opium dens feels nearly as immersive as being in them. Michelangelo’s guide is an ingratiating poet named Mesihi who chauffeurs him to what he calls the “Santa Sophia Basilica” — today known as the Hagia Sophia — and to outdoor markets where animals are sold alongside men and to an evening concert where Michelangelo is drawn into an infatuation with an androgynous dancer whose sex he is unable to decipher. There is an unsubtle quality to Énard’s insistence on fluidity — between male and female, and especially between East and West — and his past work is invariably mentioned in the same breath as Orientalism, though it’s not so easy to articulate the precise relationship. But reading “Tell Them of Battles,” originally published in French in 2010, feels somehow radical in 2018, provoking a kind of wistfulness at the wonder and uncertainty that Michelangelo experiences in his confrontation with foreignness in “this disturbing city, at once familiar and resolutely other,” and the novelty of his artistic discovery, such as when “the always surprising voices of those human church bells on top the minarets confirm for him, along with the shadows lengthening on his page, that the sun has just set.” After all, the Taj Mahal was partly designed by a Turk, the most important cathedral of the Kremlin built by an Italian. “Beauty comes from abandoning the refuge of the old forms for the uncertainty of the present,” Énard’s Michelangelo says to himself as he sits down to sketch out a viaduct that never will be. [ See the Book Review’s selection of 100 Notable Books and 10 Best Books of 2018. ] SLEEP OF MEMORY By Patrick Modiano Translated by Mark Polizzotti 136 pp. Yale University. $24. Modiano’s Paris is a Paris that no longer exists, and that, too, in our era of mythic nostalgias, feels political in its way. Possibility flickers through the city’s streets, the potential of new encounters set against those eternal slate-colored facades — “Sleep of Memory” is a throwback to a Paris where life still happened on the terrasses, before everyone retreated into laptops and phones and before time was money, when some happenstance meeting in the morning might turn into an afternoon with an unknown ending. In a kind of hybrid of novel and memoir, Modiano has crafted a brooding narrator who summons this Paris through recollections that jump from era to era — from the boarding-school days of a truant who has taken the train back from the Haute-Savoie to skip around the city, unbeknown to his self-absorbed parents; to the boy’s elderly incarnation 50 years later, reflecting on the landmarks that tied those two selves together — mostly books and women, which he doesn’t evaluate, just chronicles, in fact and detail, hoping that his words, “like magnets,” might link together chapters that form a book, or a life. Modiano owes much to Proust, though his postmodern drifting is far easier to read; there is warmth to be drawn from those unbidden memories, reminiscences of attending a strange party on a cold winter night many years ago conjuring not so much regret as simple pleasure. It can be hard to discern real life from the books the narrator reads, which have titles like “Practical Dictionary of the Occult Sciences,” “The Eternal Return of the Same” and “Dreams and How to Direct Them.” There is so much suggestiveness that eventually the narrative must, and does, lead to a crime, though in Modiano’s handling the story becomes less a whodunit than a way out of what he describes as the “tangled dream from which I had just awoken.” In sum, he observes that “if anyone had asked me what was the point of all this, I think I would have answered simply, ‘I’m trying to solve the mysteries of Paris.’” STRIKE YOUR HEART By Amélie Nothomb Translated by Alison Anderson 135 pp. Europa. Paper, $15. Nothomb, a Belgian writer who resides in Paris, is one of France’s most prolific authors. But there is something about her work that lacks a center; she’s the girl who sits at the back of the writing seminar, so busy churning out pages that you never really get to know her. “Strike Your Heart” takes up the trendy topic of female relationships, this time within the context of family. Diane is a preternaturally precocious child, made so by her mother, the pinup-perfect Marie, who is so thoroughly governed by her dependence on female competition for self-worth that she considers her infant daughter to be her greatest rival, and neglects her. Diane develops a protective ability to analyze her mother, and this is where Nothomb’s writing feels stretched; at age 5, Diane demonstrates a rather remarkable acuity. In a silent speech to her mother, she observes, “If there is one virtue you are lacking, it is tact.” The novella is packed with melodrama that whisks the story along at an unforgiving pace, as Diane grows up into an ambitious and independent medical student, while her younger sister, who was showered with love for unclear reasons, is needy, unstable and unreliable. Nothomb courses through love, jealousy, betrayal and ambition as Diane seeks to create a mother-daughter relationship with Olivia, a young professor she admires, only to be disappointed by Olivia’s shallowness. Unfortunately, perhaps because Nothomb writes so quickly, her characters feel uninhabited, their feelings simmered down to bare fundaments rather than rendered real, with humor employed to skip over any deeper complications of relationships rather than to pan them for what is interesting and true. In the end Nothomb’s writing is fablelike, so that when the threads of the story converge into a morality tale, as those who have suffered and been wronged find revenge and solace in one another, it’s not so surprising, if a little facile. An earlier version of this review incorrectly described the terminal points of a bridge in the novel “Tell Them of Battles, Kings, and Elephants,” by Mathias Énard. Michelangelo designs the bridge to cross the Golden Horn in Constantinople; it is not “a bridge that will join Asia to Europe.” The same item misspelled the surname of the book’s translator; she is Charlotte Mandell, not Mandel.",The New York Times
2018,Three Months in the Advice Mines,"Times Insider What I’ve learned from being our Sunday Business “Work Friend” advice columnist. Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. I’m spending three months moonlighting as a work-life advice columnist for the Sunday Business section, writing a column called “Work Friend.” After me, someone else will dispense the advice — someone properly licensed and up-to-date on all their shots, we can hope. I also have a day job here, running the Styles desk, and you should stop reading this and read that section first, as it is much better than the other sections. In the course of trying my best to provide honest advice to bosses and peons alike, I’ve unfortunately discovered that I only have two or four ideas about life. None of these ideas are particularly original, either. Somehow long-running advice columnists, or really any kind of regular columnist or other Pez dispenser of thoughts, can reiterate their ideas for months or decades. There are only so many ways that one can say that money is corruption and our society will, and probably should, die because of our sick, unending devotion to it. (Happy holidays!) I suspect that for many people writing about ethics, these touchstones or worldviews aren’t expressed explicitly in the work, or perhaps aren’t even acknowledged by the writer at all. Instead, opinion-havers — that’s all of us, because what is an opinion column but advice given that no one requested? — impose their worldviews on people. They do not think that they have different ideas from others. Instead they think they have the only conceivable ideas. (The history of the etiquette column is party to this, as it’s about the One True Way to be.) They believe they are as one with the fountain of all sources, the original thought. That is why many, particularly men, keep their passion subterranean. They believe and enact the ruse that Janet Malcolm called “the pose of fair-mindedness, the charade of evenhandedness.” As it happens, in the course of my short career as an advice-giver, the great bulk of my unhappy email and direct messages has arrived from men. I do not believe that I would get all these emails if my name were clearly male (oh, to be a Tom or a Ted). But I no more expect a reader to decide that I have divined the one true truth of a situation than I would expect every reader of Ross Douthat to come to crave the return of the WASP ruling elite. At best, after all, a work friend is someone who says something alien and upsetting and objectionable, forcing you to plumb your own values. And a critic, a columnist or an agony aunt, being passionate, should not make everyone or maybe even anyone happy. Ms. Malcolm wrote: “If the writer actually didn’t care one way or the other how things came out, he would not bestir himself to represent them.” No man is a high road. Dispassion is fraud. Many of the men who complain to me, or to my bosses, simply misunderstand. Some of them disagree; some of them are looking for an argument. At least a few are lonely. (Same!) But mostly we have, in the end, had a great experience together. I try to remind unhappy readers that I am but one little burst of pixels, one half-page on Sundays; that we have such a vast abundance of riches in news and entertainment and opinion, such amazing journalism arriving from Laos to Lagos to Los Angeles, and an onslaught of special sections both in print and online. Not to mention the Styles section, which, as you know, is so much better than everything else! Commenters and letter writers tend to agree: They tell me about what they love in The New York Times — the crossword, the magazine, our spectacular graphics, the photography from around the world. We have nice talks in the end. It’s cool. I like our readers. You’re smart. So the best good thing about my stint as an advice columnist has been talking to readers. I am quite relieved that you can hold the idea that even if I’m not for you, or that I’m possibly even Very Bad, you still respect the value in the big diverse bundle that makes up The Times. We both understand that everyone’s work friend would be everyone’s work fool. Keep up with Times Insider stories on Twitter, via the Reader Center: @ReaderCenter.",The New York Times
2018,Three New Chilling Page-Turners Feature Unlikely Psychopaths,"The Shortlist INHUMAN RESOURCES By Pierre Lemaitre Translated by Sam Gordon386 pp. Quercus. $26.99. At the heart of Lemaitre’s twisted workplace thriller is a diffident, unassuming 57-year-old businessman, Alain Delambre, who has been unable to land a job after having been laid off four years ago. In that time he’s cobbled together barely enough money to survive by doing menial work: handing out fliers, sorting packages and cleaning offices. One morning, when a short-fused mailroom supervisor assaults him, Delambre surprises himself by head-butting the man and breaking his nose. “Violence is like drinking or sex,” Delambre thinks afterward. “It’s a process, not an isolated phenomenon. We barely notice it set in. … I was perfectly aware that I was angry, but I never expected it to turn to cold fury.” He’s fired for misconduct, of course, but before despair can set in he applies, through a headhunter, for an H.R. position at a huge multinational firm. Much to his surprise, he makes it to the final round, only to find that he and the other candidates are to be given a most unusual test: They must administer a realistic hostage situation involving company management — with Arab actors posing as terrorists — and then “assess senior executives subjected to violent and sustained stress.” His wife, Nicole, thinks it’s sick and doesn’t want him to take part. “You’re able to have scruples and morals because you have a job,” he tells her bitterly. Lemaitre is very good at depicting Delambre’s diminishment by scores of tiny humiliations, each one a sharp little blade slicing down to his very soul. With every passing page, the ordinary man who once was a loving husband and father loses a little more control. It happens so slowly, so inexorably, that before you know it Delambre is buying a real Beretta for the hostage-taking drill. The drama builds to a tense showdown when Lemaitre inexplicably shifts narrators, causing some last-minute lurching. But he powers through it, and you won’t see his final twist coming. AN ELDERLY LADY IS UP TO NO GOOD StoriesBy Helene TurstenTranslated by Marlaine Delargy 171 pp. Soho. $12.99. The star of this deliciously noir short story collection, Maud, is nearly 90, with a cloud of “snow-white” hair twisted into a thick “old-fashioned chignon,” and she hobbles about her neighborhood with a wheeled walker. It’s a decoy: Using it makes her look weak and helpless, and Maud likes that — because she is anything but. Like Miss Marple, she is a benign-looking senior citizen with murder on her mind. Maud doesn’t solve murders, though. She commits them, usually when someone breaches her peace and quiet. In fact, in each of these crisp, mordantly funny tales, someone around her dies, usually in spectacular fashion. Tursten takes readers deep inside Maud’s head as she plots the demise of anyone who crosses her. In “An Elderly Lady Has Accommodation Problems,” a conniving local sculptor who specializes in penises — made of wood, clay, concrete and even Play-Doh — goes after Maud’s desirable prewar apartment. So the old lady dispatches her using a piece of the sculptor’s own artwork (a penis cast in bronze, to be specific). In “An Elderly Lady Seeks Peace at Christmastime,” Maud must take measures into her own hands when her upstairs neighbor begins beating his wife, causing an unbearable racket. “Maud had been unable to concentrate on the film starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers on TV that night. All she could hear was quarreling and shouting from upstairs.” At one point in “The Antique Dealer’s Death,” Detectives Irene Huss and Embla Nystrom — who star in Tursten’s two ongoing mystery series — arrive to figure out why there’s a dead man in Maud’s apartment. They’d like to nail her for the crime but don’t have enough evidence. (“I wouldn’t invite that old woman for tea anytime soon,” a neighbor is advised.) Here’s hoping Tursten brings back the flinty homicidal octogenarian for more adventures. SOMEONE LIKE ME By M.R. Carey 501 pp. Orbit. $26. Liz Kendall is dying. Her abusive ex-husband has pinned her to the kitchen floor amid spilled grocery bags, and he’s strangling her, “his wild eyes overflowing with hate.” Suddenly Liz thwarts the attack by smashing a bottle of Heinz malt vinegar and viciously grinding the shards into his face. She isn’t sure how it happened: It didn’t feel like her hand, it felt like someone “slipping inside her body and her mind and moving her like a puppet.” But it happens again a few days later when she ramps up the violence during a parking dispute at her daughter’s school. It’s like the “good” Liz — the one who’s always tried to do the right thing, the one who wants to make sure her two kids have a loving home — gets taken over by a much darker Liz, one who’s standing up for herself no matter what the cost. Just then Liz’s 16-year-old son, Zac, befriends Fran, a young woman who’s been scarred by her own horrific ordeal. When Fran first meets Liz, she notices that “Zac Kendall’s mom was changing. Nothing else was. The rest of the room looked fine. … It was like there were two of her at the same time, overlapping each other and holding the exact same pose, but not quite in sync when they moved so you caught the lag if you were looking at the right moment.” Suddenly, sharply, so deftly you hardly notice, Carey steers the novel straight into horror territory. One moment you’re ready to attribute Liz’s angry episodes to the trauma she’s suffered, and the next you realize there’s something far more malicious fueling her anger. “What was it that had changed Zac’s mom?” Fran wonders. “And what had it changed her into?” There are some rough patches, to be sure — a ridiculous subplot involving Fran and a prison visit, an unresolved story line involving the ex-husband. But these are minor quibbles in what is otherwise a first-rate, superbly paced paranormal thriller.",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | Throwing Open the Schoolhouse Doors, Once and For All","Turning Points Turning Point: Between 2000 and 2018 the number of African children enrolled in primary school more than doubled, rising from 60 million to 150 million. In 1848, republican revolts against European monarchies ended in failure and repression. The year was said to be a turning point at which history failed to turn. Almost certainly 2018 will mark a similar turning point. The year saw Donald Trump’s protectionism, Chinese expansionism, a reborn nationalism in India and Japan, Iranian empire-building, and Russian opportunism all combine to undermine the international cooperation that has sustained the 70-year-old postwar global order. Among the casualties have been agreements on climate change, nuclear weapons and trade, as the world suddenly appears divided and leaderless. For the time being at least, lip service is being paid to the United Nations’ internationally sanctioned Sustainable Development Goals, which set ambitious deadlines to end illiteracy, avoidable disease, malnutrition and extreme poverty by 2030. But there is now growing evidence that, despite the valiant efforts of António Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, and his deputy, Amina J. Mohammed, these goals are being subverted by our collective failure to agree on a means to finance them. The fourth Sustainable Development Goal — equitable and inclusive quality education for all — commits us to make our generation, by 2030, the first in history to send every child to school. Today, the shameful reality is that 260 million children aren’t going to class. Among those in school, a total of 400 million will leave before they turn 12, and more than 800 million, half the developing world’s boys and girls, will end their secondary schooling with no recognizable qualifications for the modern work force. A recent World Bank study shows that child marriage could become a thing of the past if all girls attended school. Unfortunately, about 230 million of the 430 million school-age girls in low- or lower-middle-income countries will never complete their secondary education, according to the Unesco Institute for Statistics. And female illiteracy has a devastating effect on a community’s health, with infant mortality in Africa far higher among uneducated mothers. Despite the scholastic mountain we have to climb, international aid for education has fallen over the past decade from 13 percent of all aid to just 10 percent. At just $10 per child per year, that’s not even enough money to cover the cost of a secondhand textbook. The much-vaunted public-private partnerships that were expected, in the words of the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and United Nations, to turn “billions into trillions,” have yet to materialize, and while global health and educational institutions in developed countries are blessed with outstanding private philanthropists, global education has yet to discover its latter-day Andrew Carnegie. Business investments in global education have been a fraction of the investments in global health or the environment. With only 12 years until the 2030 deadline to achieve universal education, we are at a moment of truth. Barring a dramatic shift in policy, 200 million school-age children will not be in class in 2030. Instead, they will most likely be on the streets, where they will be easy prey for extremists who will exploit our broken promises on education as proof that peaceful coexistence can never work. If they aren’t on the streets, these millions of young people, denied educational and employment opportunities in their home countries, will be on the move. Unless some of the world’s wealth moves to Africa, Africans will increasingly move to the world’s wealth, as millions of would-be migrants convince themselves that being poor in a rich country is better than being rich in a poor country. The $10 billion International Finance Facility for Education can break through the aid stalemate. Proposed by the Education Commission, an international initiative I chair, the fund is focused on the more than 700 million children living in the world’s lower-middle-income countries, which themselves contain the vast majority of refugees and displaced children. These 50 or so countries are too poor to finance the cost of universal education themselves, but too wealthy to qualify for substantive grants from multilateral development banks. The loans that are available carry a 4 percent interest rate. As a result, only $350 million, or 50 cents per child per year, is devoted to education in these nations. By offering developing countries affordable financing, the new fund will plug a yawning chasm in the architecture of international aid. It will be created from guarantees provided by donor countries: $2 billion leveraged up by borrowing in the marketplace into $8 billion worth of funding. And this will be supplemented by $2 billion of grant aid, allowing us to cut the interest charged on the loans. Converting a $2 billion grant into $8 billion of aid will make the funding we offer go four times as far as conventional aid. In return for this enhanced international financing, developing countries would be called upon to double their own investments in education, from the current 2 to 3 percent to a 4 to 5 percent share of national income. This would be enough to create the additional 200 million schools needed to finally get all children into the classroom. A global fund for education on a scale that matches the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria would help honor our long-delayed promise of education for all and bring one of the worst-funded Sustainable Development Goals within reach. It would also send a timely message to the world: that even in the most insular and protectionist of environments, we can advance international cooperation and prove that globalization can still work for those who have been left behind.

2018,"TikTok, a Chinese Video App, Brings Fun Back to Social Media","The Shift About an hour after downloading TikTok, the popular video-sharing app, I experienced a bizarre sensation, one I haven’t felt in a long time while on the internet. The knot in my chest loosened, my head felt injected with helium, and the corners of my mouth crept upward into a smile. Was this … happiness? TikTok — a quirky hybrid of Snapchat, the defunct video app Vine and the TV segment “Carpool Karaoke” — is a refreshing outlier in the social media universe. A so-called challenge video on TikTok, from the user @spellmantwinz, which encouraged users to make videos of themselves chomping down on food to the beat of a song. There are no ads. There’s no news, unless you count learning about viral dance crazes. There are few preening Instagram models hawking weight-loss tea, and a distinct lack of crazy uncles posting Infowars clips. Instead, TikTok — a Chinese-made app that was known as Musical.ly until ByteDance, the Chinese internet conglomerate, acquired the company in 2017 and merged it with a video app it owned — has a simple premise. Users create short videos set to music, often lip-syncing along, dancing or acting out short skits. The app contains templates and visual effects to spice up the videos. There is also a live-streaming feature that allows users to send virtual “gifts” to their favorite creators, which can be bought with real money. The rest works like any other social app — followers, hashtags, likes and comments. It doesn’t sound like much. But, somehow, it adds up to what might well be the only truly pleasant social network in existence. I feel comfortable making that call because I go on social networks for a living, and I have spent thousands of hours wading through an unholy slurry of Twitter spammers, Instagram scammers, teenage YouTube fascists and baby boomers whose brains have been turned to pudding by too many Facebook memes. TikTok has none of that. Instead, it’s that rarest of internet creatures: a place where people can let down their guards, act silly with their friends and sample the fruits of human creativity without being barraged by abusive trolls or algorithmically amplified misinformation. It’s a throwback to a time before the commercialization of internet influence, when web culture consisted mainly of harmless weirdos trying to make each other laugh. “It’s a bit of an escape,” said Billy Mann, a TikTok creator who uses the platform to make comedy videos for his more than 650,000 followers. “It’s a safe haven for people that are seeing the world on fire and being like, ‘I need silliness,’” he said. TikTok’s earnest goofiness has turned off some skeptics. But it’s hard to argue with the numbers. The app recently passed six million users in the United States, according to a report from the market research firm Sensor Tower. As of Friday, it ranked No. 4 among free apps in Apple’s app store, ahead of Snapchat, Netflix and Facebook Messenger. Globally, the app, whose Chinese version is called Douyin, had 500 million monthly active users as of July, making it bigger than Twitter and about half the size of Instagram. Currently, TikTok makes money through virtual gift sales and brand collaborations, such as a Guess-sponsored “fashion takeover.” There are no ads inside the app, although the company's privacy policy leaves room for them in the future. TikTok, which is privately held, does not disclose financial information, but Sensor Tower estimates that it took in roughly $3.5 million in October. TikTok’s success has spawned legions of influencers, users with millions of followers and household-name status among teenagers. And it has propelled ByteDance, which also owns a suite of other social media and news apps, to a reported valuation of $75 billion, making it one of the most valuable start-ups in the world. TikTok’s global head of marketing, Stefan Heinrich, said in a statement that the company’s mission was to “capture and present the world’s creativity, knowledge and moments that matter, directly from the mobile phone.” In perhaps the clearest sign that TikTok is on to something, Facebook is trying to kill it. Last month, the company quietly released Lasso, a clunky clone that borrowed many of TikTok’s core features and even tried to siphon off some of its power users. Lasso got off to a slow start, and is now the 687th most downloaded photo and video app in the United States, according to the mobile data company AppAnnie. The executive leading the Lasso team, Brady Voss, left the company shortly after the app was released. (Facebook declined to comment, and Mr. Voss did not respond to a request for comment.) Before I go any further, let’s get one thing out of the way: If you’re reading this, you are almost certainly too old to feel at home on TikTok. The company declined to provide information about its users, but judging from what’s on the platform, the median TikTok user seems to hover in the midteens. TikTok is full of acne-studded faces, barely concealed tween angst and impenetrable youth-culture references. As far as I can tell, there is no way for adults to use it without feeling as if they are chaperoning a high school dance. Officially, TikTok users must be 13 or older to join. But the age-verification process is easy to circumvent, and while browsing the platform, I stumbled upon several videos starring people who appeared to be much younger. In its previous incarnation as Musical.ly, TikTok drew fire from some privacy advocates, who accused it of pushing the limits of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, a law that prohibits the collection of certain types of information from users younger than 13. “It’s clearly a really popular, cool site, but you also have the issue of kids being significantly too young for it,” said James P. Steyer, the chief executive of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that reviews tech products for families. “It’s not that the content on TikTok isn’t O.K. for your 15-year-old. It’s what happens to your 6- or 7-year-old.” While using TikTok, I never saw examples of bullying or harassment. (Both of which are prohibited by TikTok’s community guidelines, as is sexually explicit content.) There are, however, a decent number of videos featuring teenage girls dancing suggestively — which, if you are a 31-year-old newspaper columnist and not a 16-year-old boy, is fairly unsettling. A TikTok spokeswoman said in a statement that promoting safety and positivity on the platform is “our top priority.” She added, “we periodically add to and adjust our protective measures, policies and moderation efforts to support the well-being of our users.” Last year, after two other apps owned by ByteDance were criticized by Chinese officials for promoting objectionable content, the company’s chief executive, Zhang Yiming, said that it would increase the ranks of its content moderation team to 10,000 moderators, from 6,000. The TikTok spokeswoman declined to say how many of those moderators work for TikTok, or whether content standards for American users differ from those for users in China, where famously strict censorship laws apply. Free-speech advocates might bristle at TikTok’s Chinese ownership, and privacy hawks have raised questions about how the company handles users’ personal data. But perhaps because it is more heavily moderated than other networks, TikTok mostly feels safe and wholesome. Julia Alexander, a fellow TikTok convert at The Verge, called it “a rare social app that isn’t infested with hateful rhetoric.” One popular genre of TikTok video is the “challenge,” a kind of video skit that is acted out en masse. One challenge, #eatonthebeat, encouraged users to make videos of themselves chomping down on food to the beat of a song. Another challenge, #chooseyourcharacter, encouraged users to mimic a video game’s character selection screen. Then there are the running jokes attached to specific songs — like “Good Girls Bad Guys,” a song by the band Falling in Reverse, which is used for a genre of video in which a user appears first in nerdy, unattractive clothes, and then cuts abruptly to a made-over version of himself in sunglasses, leather jackets or other bad-boy attire. Despite TikTok’s teens-only vibe, some adults have started to trickle on. Jimmy Fallon, the late-night TV host, recently joined the site and started posting his own challenges. The comedian Amy Schumer recently made a TikTok video, and prominent YouTubers like Jake Paul have tested the waters. Is TikTok a Facebook killer? No, probably not. For all the variety in its videos, it is still a fairly limited app, with a more narrow appeal than more populist social platforms. But by purposely limiting its features, by resisting the temptation to monetize its users aggressively and by keeping trolls and bullies off its platform, TikTok has done something truly impressive — it has built a social network that is genuinely fun to use. There might be a lesson there.",The New York Times
2018,Time Names Person of the Year for 2018: Jamal Khashoggi and Other Journalists,"Time magazine named a group of journalists, including the murdered Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi, as its person of the year for 2018 on Tuesday, honoring their dedicated pursuit of the truth despite a war on facts and tremendous obstacles, including violence and imprisonment. The choice was a nod to the spread of misinformation in the United States and abroad by leaders who have sought to quash critical independent journalism. And it offered a not-so-subtle rebuke to President Trump, an avid follower of the Person of the Year honor who, when asked last month about the upcoming decision, replied, “I can’t imagine anybody else other than Trump.” Besides Mr. Khashoggi, the honorees include the staff of the Capital Gazette newspapers in Maryland, where five people were shot dead in June; Maria Ressa, the founder of Rappler, a news start-up under attack by the authoritarian president of the Philippines; and U Wa Lone and U Kyaw Soe Oo, two Reuters journalists imprisoned in Myanmar after reporting the massacre of Muslim men. Time magazine published covers honoring each of the recipients, who were collectively called “the guardians of truth.” “It became clear that the manipulation and abuse of truth is the common thread of so many of this year’s major stories, from Russia to Riyadh to Silicon Valley,” Edward Felsenthal, Time’s editor in chief and chief executive, said during the announcement on NBC’s “Today” show. Mr. Khashoggi’s brutal murder in October, at the hands of assassins in the Saudi embassy in Turkey, prompted international outrage at the regime of Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince, whom the Central Intelligence Agency concluded ordered his death. The Washington Post, where Mr. Khashoggi was a contributing opinion writer, led an outcry that eventually rattled the Trump White House, an ally of the crown prince. In a Twitter post, Karen Attiah, the editor who recruited Mr. Khashoggi to write for The Post, thanked Time for the honor and shared an adage that she attributed to her late colleague: “Some depart to remain.” “I wish he was here, I wish he could see this, and I wish we could give him a copy,” Ms. Attiah, the global opinions editor at The Post, said in an interview. “It’s obvious that the story has resonated with people in a way that few stories do. “It sends a signal to everyone in the Saudi regime that committed this,” she added, “and to the people who, like Jamal, are the ones fighting for the rights of free expression. It tells everyone that the story is not over yet, and we are all watching.” Ms. Attiah said she sent a text message on Tuesday to one of Mr. Khashoggi’s sons, notifying him about the recognition for his father. He responded with an emoji that depicted a pair of praying hands. The Person of the Year honor — a marketing gimmick that began in the 1920s — is meant to recognize an individual or a group of people for influencing the year’s events. This was the first time that Time’s editors awarded the honor to someone who had died. Mr. Khashoggi was a well-known dissident and writer in the Middle East and beyond, the editors noted, but his work reached a far wider audience after his violent death at the hands of a team of Saudi agents who killed and dismembered him in October. “It is also rare that a person’s influence grows so immensely in death,” the editors wrote. One Time cover shows 14 members of the Capital Gazette. Paul W. Gillespie, a photographer there, said on Tuesday morning that he wished “it did not take losing our five Guardians of the Truth @WendiWinters, Rob Hiaasen, Gerald Fischman, John McNamara & Rebecca Smith to show #JournalismMatters.” “And now I am crying thinking about all the things that happened that day,” Mr. Gillespie wrote on Twitter. Time announced the recipients almost a year to the day that Mr. Wa Lone and Mr. Kyaw Soe Oo, reporters for Reuters, were invited to a dinner with the police and then arrested and accused of violating Myanmar’s colonial-era Official Secrets Act. The journalists had been reporting on the mass killings and ethnic cleansing by soldiers and Buddhist mobs in Rakhine State. They were sentenced to seven years in prison in September. “On the eve of marking a full year behind bars, we hope this recognition will draw continued awareness to their unjust arrest and imprisonment in Myanmar, and reaffirm the essential role of a free press around the world,” Heather Carpenter, a Reuters spokeswoman, said in an email on Tuesday. “Every day that Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo remain in prison is an assault on press freedom.” Time editors chose the group of journalists from a list of 10 finalists, which were revealed on Monday. Other candidates included President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia; Ryan Coogler, the director of the movie “Black Panther”; and the “separated families” who were detained in Mr. Trump’s crackdown on immigration at the border. The runners-up for person of the year, according to Mr. Felsenthal, were Mr. Trump, who has called the news media the “enemy of the people” and was the recipient in 2016, and Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. Last year, Time also honored a group of people for person of the year: “the silence breakers,” the women who came forward to accuse powerful men of sexual abuse and harassment as part of the worldwide #MeToo movement.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Time for G.O.P. to Threaten to Fire Trump,"Republican leaders need to mount an intervention. Opinion Columnist Up to now I have not favored removing President Trump from office. I felt strongly that it would be best for the country that he leave the way he came in, through the ballot box. But last week was a watershed moment for me, and I think for many Americans, including some Republicans. It was the moment when you had to ask whether we really can survive two more years of Trump as president, whether this man and his demented behavior — which will get only worse as the Mueller investigation concludes — are going to destabilize our country, our markets, our key institutions and, by extension, the world. And therefore his removal from office now has to be on the table. I believe that the only responsible choice for the Republican Party today is an intervention with the president that makes clear that if there is not a radical change in how he conducts himself — and I think that is unlikely — the party’s leadership will have no choice but to press for his resignation or join calls for his impeachment. It has to start with Republicans, given both the numbers needed in the Senate and political reality. Removing this president has to be an act of national unity as much as possible — otherwise it will tear the country apart even more. I know that such an action is very difficult for today’s G.O.P., but the time is long past for it to rise to confront this crisis of American leadership. Trump’s behavior has become so erratic, his lying so persistent, his willingness to fulfill the basic functions of the presidency — like reading briefing books, consulting government experts before making major changes and appointing a competent staff — so absent, his readiness to accommodate Russia and spurn allies so disturbing and his obsession with himself and his ego over all other considerations so consistent, two more years of him in office could pose a real threat to our nation. Vice President Mike Pence could not possibly be worse. The damage an out-of-control Trump can do goes well beyond our borders. America is the keystone of global stability. Our world is the way it is today — a place that, despite all its problems, still enjoys more peace and prosperity than at any time in history — because America is the way it is (or at least was). And that is a nation that at its best has always stood up for the universal values of freedom and human rights, has always paid extra to stabilize the global system from which we were the biggest beneficiary and has always nurtured and protected alliances with like-minded nations. Donald Trump has proved time and again that he knows nothing of the history or importance of this America. That was made starkly clear in Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis’s resignation letter. Trump is in the grip of a mad notion that the entire web of global institutions and alliances built after World War II — which, with all their imperfections, have provided the connective tissues that have created this unprecedented era of peace and prosperity — threatens American sovereignty and prosperity and that we are better off without them. So Trump gloats at the troubles facing the European Union, urges Britain to exit and leaks that he’d consider quitting NATO. These are institutions that all need to be improved, but not scrapped. If America becomes a predator on all the treaties, multilateral institutions and alliances holding the world together; if America goes from being the world’s anchor of stability to an engine of instability; if America goes from a democracy built on the twin pillars of truth and trust to a country where it is acceptable for the president to attack truth and trust on a daily basis, watch out: Your kids won’t just grow up in a different America. They will grow up in a different world. The last time America disengaged from the world remotely in this manner was in the 1930s, and you remember what followed: World War II. You have no idea how quickly institutions like NATO and the E.U. and the World Trade Organization and just basic global norms — like thou shalt not kill and dismember a journalist in your own consulate — can unravel when America goes AWOL or haywire under a shameless isolated president. But this is not just about the world, it’s about the minimum decorum and stability we expect from our president. If the C.E.O. of any public company in America behaved like Trump has over the past two years — constantly lying, tossing out aides like they were Kleenex, tweeting endlessly like a teenager, ignoring the advice of experts — he or she would have been fired by the board of directors long ago. Should we expect less for our president? That’s what the financial markets are now asking. For the first two years of the Trump presidency the markets treated his dishonesty and craziness as background noise to all the soaring corporate profits and stocks. But that is no longer the case. Trump has markets worried. The instability Trump is generating — including his attacks on the chairman of the Federal Reserve — is causing investors to wonder where the economic and geopolitical management will come from as the economy slows down. What if we’re plunged into an economic crisis and we have a president whose first instinct is always to blame others and who’s already purged from his side the most sober adults willing to tell him that his vaunted “gut instincts” have no grounding in economics or in law or in common sense. Mattis was the last one. We are now left with the B team — all the people who were ready to take the jobs that Trump’s first team either resigned from — because they could not countenance his lying, chaos and ignorance — or were fired from for the same reasons. I seriously doubt that any of these B-players would have been hired by any other administration. Not only do they not inspire confidence in a crisis, but they are all walking around knowing that Trump would stab every one of them in the back with his Twitter knife, at any moment, if it served him. This makes them even less effective. Ah, we are told, but Trump is a different kind of president. “He’s a disrupter.” Well, I respect those who voted for Trump because they thought the system needed “a disrupter.” It did in some areas. I agree with Trump on the need to disrupt the status quo in U.S.-China trade relations, to rethink our presence in places like Syria and Afghanistan and to eliminate some choking regulations on business. But too often Trump has given us disruption without any plan for what comes next. He has worked to destroy Obamacare with no plan for the morning after. He announced a pullout from Syria and Afghanistan without even consulting the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, or the State Department’s top expert, let alone our allies. People wanted disruption, but too often Trump has given us destruction, distraction, debasement and sheer ignorance. And while, yes, we need disruption in some areas, we also desperately need innovation in others. How do we manage these giant social networks? How do we integrate artificial intelligence into every aspect of our society, as China is doing? How do we make lifelong learning available to every American? At a time when we need to be building bridges to the 21st century, all Trump can talk about is building a wall with Mexico — a political stunt to energize his base rather than the comprehensive immigration reform that we really need. Indeed, Trump’s biggest disruption has been to undermine the norms and values we associate with a U.S. president and U.S. leadership. And now that Trump has freed himself of all restraints from within his White House staff, his cabinet and his party — so that “Trump can be Trump,” we are told — he is freer than ever to remake America in his image. And what is that image? According to The Washington Post’s latest tally, Trump has made 7,546 false or misleading claims through Dec. 20, the 700th day of his term in office. And all that was supposedly before “we let Trump be Trump.” If America starts to behave as a selfish, shameless, lying grifter like Trump, you simply cannot imagine how unstable — how disruptive — world markets and geopolitics may become. We cannot afford to find out. Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram. An earlier version of this article misstated the frequency of false or misleading claims told by President Trump. It was an average of almost 11 a day during his first 700 days in office, not five a day.",The New York Times
2018,"Times Critics Discuss the Year in Books, From Triumphs to Disappointments","The Times’s staff critics talk with each other about the wide variety of reading they did in 2018. Near the end of each year, The Times’s staff critics — Dwight Garner, Parul Sehgal and Jennifer Szalai — share their favorite books among those they reviewed over the previous 12 months. But as you might imagine, as professional critics and general bibliophiles they read far more than is represented on those lists — books their colleagues reviewed, books they found by chance, books that had been teetering on their to-read piles while they attended to the demands of their jobs. Below, they talk about the wide variety of writing they enjoyed, authors who disappointed them and larger trends they noticed in the literary world. — John Williams, Daily Books Editor and Staff Writer What were some of the books published this year that you didn’t review but admired? DWIGHT GARNER One is Deborah Eisenberg’s book of stories, “Your Duck Is My Duck”; another is Christopher Bonanos’s “Flash,” his biography of the tabloid photographer Weegee, which cast a lurid glow. (Parul reviewed the Eisenberg beautifully, as did Jennifer the Bonanos.) I was moved by the poet Tony Hoagland’s final book of poems while wishing it had a better title: “Priest Turned Therapist Treats Fear of God.” Clive James’s book-length poem “The River in the Sky” is superb, an epic lament, written in late life, filled with exact and moving observations about life and culture. “If my ashes end up in an hour-glass,” he wrote, “I can go on working.” I generally dislike books about bookselling because they’re treacly and self-satisfied, but Shaun Bythell’s subversive “The Diary of a Bookseller” is an antidote. Finally, Jonathan Meades’s “The Plagiarist in the Kitchen: A Lifetime’s Culinary Theft,” a defiant cookbook written “in praise of the unoriginal,” is delicious to read and even better to cook from. JENNIFER SZALAI I was really impressed by Anand Giridharadas’s “Winners Take All,” a close look at how do-gooder elites love to talk about changing the world while clinging to their privileged perch. It’s elegant and tough — a chapter called “The Critic and the Thought Leader” is particularly brilliant — but it never shades into contempt. Eric Klinenberg’s “Palaces for the People” is another one; he shows how our physical environments can encourage (or discourage) social connections. I read Joanne B. Freeman’s “The Field of Blood,” about politicians slugging it out on the floor of Congress in the years leading up to the Civil War, with a mixture of awe and anxiety. I finally read Lisa Halliday’s “Asymmetry,” because of Parul’s glittering review, and sure enough, I was blown away by its intelligence. [ Read Times Critics’ Top Books of 2018 ] PARUL SEHGAL I don’t think I’m ever going to get over Ottessa Moshfegh’s “My Year of Rest and Relaxation,” about a young woman in the ’90s who medicates herself into a yearlong hibernation — Oblomov resurrected during the Clinton administration. Dwight’s review really got to the heart of what is so original about this book: its “misanthropic aplomb” and those serrated sentences. Moshfegh is the novelist for me right now; there’s such freedom and puckishness in her prose, and grandmaster technical wizardry, too. Nick Drnaso’s graphic novel “Sabrina,” shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize, is another book that still haunts me. It’s about the murder of a young woman, internet paranoiacs and the American addiction to fear. A superb, very depressing portrait of the present. What about books not published in 2018 that you read in the past 12 months? I imagine you’re all pretty constantly reading things from years past. Anything you would especially recommend? SZALAI When reviewing Ronen Bergman’s “Rise and Kill First,” I kept encountering the name of a C.I.A. operative, Robert Ames — which led me to Kai Bird’s “The Good Spy,” a biography that Dwight reviewed in 2014, when it was first published. I had never read Toni Morrison’s “The Bluest Eye,” and Jose Antonio Vargas’s mention of it in his memoir, “Dear America,” was a reminder to do so, as much as I knew it might crush me. I’ve been reading books about Weimar and Nazi Germany — the author of one of them, Christopher Browning, had a terrifying essay in The New York Review of Books in the fall, which led me to his book “Ordinary Men.” One fun one (because I need a fun one): “The Curious Lobster,” a delightful 1937 book by Richard Hatch recently reissued by NYRB, which I’m reading with my 9-year-old. [ Read: Janet Maslin’s favorite books of 2018 ] SEHGAL I’m always snacking on criticism, biographies and assorted forms of high-minded gossip wherever I can find them. This year I kept returning to Joe Orton’s diaries, Randall Jarrell’s reviews, Wayne Koestenbaum on opera, Margo Jefferson on everything. I thought a lot about Teju Cole’s photography criticism, collected in his book “Blind Spot,” and made a happy discovery in “Where She Danced,” a history of modern dance, by Elizabeth Kendall. I also started to fill in some embarrassing gaps in my reading and took a plunge into the novels of Elizabeth Bowen and Penelope Fitzgerald. My most valuable discovery was the work of Christina Sharpe, a scholar of breathtaking range whose most recent book is “In the Wake,” about the aftershocks of chattel slavery in the Americas. GARNER When I’m off the clock I tend to read letters, diaries, books of travel writing and criticism, cookbooks, that sort of thing. Jean Rhys’s and Katherine Mansfield’s letters were steady companions this year. I spent a lot of time, after watching the evening news, with Dale DeGroff’s classic bar guide, “The Craft of the Cocktail” (2002). There were two novels I did pick up and admire. One was James Hamilton-Paterson’s “Cooking with Fernet Branca” (2005), a bagatelle of a book, a sex romp with recipes, a weekend getaway for the mind. The other, better, one was Charles Willeford’s 1962 novel “Cockfighter.” Willeford is best known, when known at all, as a hard-boiled cult writer. But his observant books had unusual emotional registers, a sideways view of life and an indefinable comic air. This book, set in Florida and Georgia, is about a man for whom training fighting birds is an abiding passion. To admire this colorful novel is not to wish a return of that blood sport. The film of “Cockfighter,” released in 1974 and starring the amazing Warren Oates, is a keeper, too. Who are some of your favorite writers that emerged (on your radar) this year? Or writers who took a step forward in their work (in ambition or craft) that you considered significant? SEHGAL It was a year of revelations for me — mainly old stuff, freshly translated. I finally dug into the work of the Brazilian writer Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis. His best work is in his novels, but the short stories, collected this year and translated into English for the first time, allow you a different kind of pleasure. You can trace the distinct periods in his style until that gorgeous moment when his voice arrives, like a thunderclap. The Danish writer Inger Christensen was another surprise. Anne Carson compares her to Hesiod, and even in the new book, a slender essay collection called “The Condition of Secrecy,” you get a sense of her dazzling, polymathic intelligence. GARNER Tommy Orange’s first novel, “There There,” had muscle and focus. But this was a sweeping year — I’d suggest it’s a sweeping decade — for women writers, fearless and omnidirectional talents such as Sheila Heti, Rachel Kushner and Ottessa Moshfegh, each of whom had a new novel this year. The question of what these writers, and a handful of others, will do next is perhaps the best one American literature has now to ask. SZALAI I hadn’t read the journalism of Lauren Hilgers until I reviewed her debut book, “Patriot Number One,” and now I’m primed to read anything she writes. Same goes for Louis Hyman, whose “Temp” took a familiar subject — the gig economy — and showed how the world of precarious jobs was anything but inevitable. Months later, I still think about Allie Rowbottom’s feminist family memoir, “Jell-O Girls,” another outstanding debut. Did anyone in particular disappoint you? GARNER Jamie Quatro and Uzodinma Iweala each wrote second books that felt like letdowns after their first, stronger, ones. Barbara Kingsolver and Michael Ondaatje seemed to be writing on autopilot — very high sorts of autopilot, perhaps, but autopilot still. Jonathan Lethem is among the most gifted novelists alive, and it has killed me to have to review his last two novels, including this year’s “The Feral Detective,” without enthusiasm. I wanted “Let’s Go (So We Can Get Back),” the memoir from Jeff Tweedy, of the band Wilco, to be great, but it’s slack and talky and less than the sum of its parts. Lionel Trilling’s morose letters were published this year. As a friend of mine put it, he may have been America’s best critic but he’s its worst letter writer. The final volume of Karl Ove Knausgaard’s “My Struggle” series was so oddly off that it was as if, to borrow a lyric from one of Wilco’s best-known songs, he was trying to break our hearts. SZALAI I admired Gilbert King’s “Devil in the Grove” (2012) so much that I expected a lot from his follow-up, “Beneath a Ruthless Sun,” which ended up being too convoluted and digressive to deliver. Patricia O’Toole’s “The Moralist,” her biography of Woodrow Wilson, was penetrating on Wilson’s winding, halting entry into World War I, but her handling of his racist legacy — his segregation of the civil service being just one example — felt cursory. SEHGAL Like Jen, I was intrigued by the premises of certain nonfiction books and let down by the execution. One notable heartbreak was “Two Sisters,” by Asne Seierstad, about two Norwegian sisters who joined ISIS as fighters in Syria in 2013. It’s a strangely partial portrait and dictated largely by the sisters’ father, a wildly unreliable character — an odd decision to say the least, especially from Seierstad, a veteran journalist and a writer I much admire. What’s the book on each of your lists of 10 favorites that most surprised you, either in terms of how much you enjoyed it or why you enjoyed it? GARNER Sigrid Nunez’s novel “The Friend” was, for me, this year’s great happy surprise. I’d never really read her before — in fact, I’m embarrassed to say, she’d hardly been on my radar at all. The best feeling you can have as a reader is to devour a terrific book and then flip to the back flap and realize that, hey, this person has six more just waiting for me. SZALAI I never thought I’d rip through a 700-page book about Israel’s clandestine assassination program, but Bergman’s “Rise and Kill First” is a long book that doesn’t feel that way. The storytelling in Merve Emre’s “The Personality Brokers” is so exquisite and enthralling that I momentarily forgot how much I loathe personality tests. SEHGAL “Advice for Future Corpses,” a treatise on the biological process of death and how to care for the dying by Sallie Tisdale, a longtime palliative care nurse, had me riveted. It illuminates that one experience that remains, for most of our lives, entirely theoretical (as she says), the one event we cannot practice or truly prepare for. Jen, as the critic who focuses exclusively on nonfiction for The Times, did you see any particular trends of note? Any change in the ways that books dealt with the Trump administration in its second year? SZALAI The first year of the Trump administration seemed to be the “holy moly” moment, and in 2018 the feelings of inevitability seemed to kick in. A number of new books tried to place what is happening in the United States in a larger context, whether historical or international. I did notice an uptick in volumes by conservative critics of Trump: Rick Wilson, David Frum, Max Boot. And of course, the White House insiders kept churning out their tell-alls. I’ve just heard of another one coming out in early 2019, by a former Trump adviser named Cliff Sims, that “aims to strike some middle ground”; the genre has apparently exhausted itself to the point where sounding reasonable and maybe a little boring is treated like an innovation in the form. Dwight and Parul, have you noticed any trends in the world of fiction that either started or intensified this year? GARNER Well, we’re starting to see Trump-era fiction. Gary Shteyngart and Jonathan Lethem, in their new novels, to name just two examples, sent pilgrims out into an America that seemed vastly colder and more despotic. In both cases the results were mixed. The reckoning, in this country’s literature, is going to take some time. Who will make sense of the dissembling new forces unpinning so many of the mores of American life? Who will fully convey the bewilderment and loss so many feel, and remind us exactly what’s been compromised? It’s a tall order. We need a new Emerson as well as a new Hawthorne, in whatever race or gender they happen to arrive. I wish I were a bit more optimistic. Most of the Trump references in American fiction thus far read like tendentious tweets. But it’s so early. SEHGAL I’m with Dwight. If early efforts are any indication, I’m leery about how this political moment will be metabolized by fiction writers. (The poets are another story: Terrance Hayes’s latest collection, which riffs on Trump, is spectacular.) I also noticed that Western writers are grappling with the refugee crisis and the West’s complicity and response. To name a few: Jenny Erpenbeck (“Go, Went, Gone,” from late 2017), Lisa Halliday (“Asymmetry”) and Donal Ryan (“From a Low and Quiet Sea”). They’re all trying to figure out how to approach what Erpenbeck calls “the central moral question of our time.” To suss out the next trend, I say keep watching Rachel Cusk. From her 1997 memoir, “A Life’s Work,” so radically honest about the ambivalence of motherhood at the time, to her Outline trilogy, which finished up this year and laid waste to so many of fiction’s pieties and conventions, she consistently pushes the form forward. Dwight, you read Knausgaard’s “My Struggle” books as they came out, and reviewed several of them for The Times. Now that they’re done being translated into English, will you miss their regular appearance? GARNER No. I deeply admired — and deeply enjoyed — several books in the series, especially Volume Two. And Knausgaard clearly has an enormous gift. One condescends to him at one’s peril. But at this point I find myself in agreement with George Eliot, who said, “I have the conviction that excessive literary production is a social offense.”",The New York Times
2018,Times Critics’ Top Books of 2018,"The Times’s staff critics give their choices of the best fiction and nonfiction works of the year. If we had to use a single word to describe the past year in books, it might be eclectic. Novels were told from the perspective of a woman imprisoned for murder, a woman who suddenly inherits a Great Dane and a woman having an affair with a writer who strongly resembles Philip Roth. We also got an esteemed literary biographer turning her lens on herself, a sprawling, fresh look at New York’s postwar art world and cleareyed advice about how to die. As in 2017, some of the year’s best nonfiction addressed global tumult — but a bit more subtly, in several cases, by casting an eye back to distant but still-resonant history, like the decades of deferral and denial that led to the Civil War. Below, The New York Times’s three daily book critics — Dwight Garner, Parul Sehgal and Jennifer Szalai — share their thoughts about their favorites among the books they reviewed this year, each list alphabetical by author. A note on methodology: The critics limit themselves in making these lists, each selecting only from those books they reviewed for The Times. For more of their thoughts about the year, including books they may not have reviewed themselves but still enjoyed, you can read their related roundtable discussion. — John Williams, Daily Books Editor and Staff Writer The books that most stung my interest this year — six novels, two books of short stories, a memoir and a collection of criticism — are very different in terms of syntax and sentiment. But each implicates the reader deeply. Each delivers the sense of an especially sentient human being seeking to explain something that matters. Each proposes to teach us all over again how to think, to feel, to see. ‘EVENING IN PARADISE: MORE STORIES’ By Lucia Berlin (Farrar, Straus & Giroux). Berlin (1936-2004) was a writer of tender, chaotic and careworn short stories, and her rediscovery this decade has been a pleasure to witness. This collection follows “A Manual for Cleaning Women” (2015), and it solidifies her position as a writer who deserves to be discussed alongside such contemporary short story masters as Raymond Carver and Grace Paley. These stories are set in Chile and Texas and Manhattan and Oakland, places Berlin knew well, and they feature women who learn to think early about what to take and what to leave in life. (Read the review.) ‘KUDOS’ By Rachel Cusk (Farrar, Straus & Giroux). This small, flexible, strikingly intelligent novel is the third and concluding volume in Cusk’s Outline trilogy. Once again we’re inside the mind of Faye, a footloose British writer, who is divorced and the mother of two sons. Not a lot happens in “Kudos,” beyond a trip to a literary festival in what seems to be southern Italy, but the reader is held rapt by Cusk’s cool scrutiny of the world, by the attention she pays to topics like parenthood, travel and the idiosyncrasies of human interaction. (Read the review.) [ Read the critics discussing more about the year in books. ] ‘MOTHERHOOD’ By Sheila Heti (Henry Holt & Company). Heti’s earthy and philosophical and essential new novel is about a woman in her late 30s, a writer, who pushes back against the notion that she needs to have offspring to possess a full life. “Having children is nice,” she says. “What a victory to be not-nice.” Heti’s prose is hard, direct, aphoristic, wired for sound. Her narrator makes a banquet out of her objections to bourgeois verities. Brutal questions emerge: What if you decline motherhood in favor of your art and your art turns out to be mediocre? (Read the review.) ‘THE LARGESSE OF THE SEA MAIDEN: STORIES’ By Denis Johnson (Random House). This posthumously published book of short stories is the long-awaited follow-up to Johnson’s “Jesus’ Son” (1992), perhaps the most influential and beloved volume of American short stories of the past three decades. We catch up with Johnson’s no-hopers and grievous angels; they’re a few decades older and, for the most part, little wiser. One can say about this book what one narrator says about a collection of poems he loves: “They were the real thing, line after line of the real thing.” (Read the review.) ‘THE MARS ROOM’ By Rachel Kushner (Scribner). The title of Kushner’s grainy and persuasive novel refers to a notorious strip club in San Francisco. Romy, the young narrator, worked there before being sent to prison for life for killing the man who stalked her. Kushner’s portrait of Romy’s anarchic, near-orphaned childhood in San Francisco is a great, subversive portrait of the city. This is a brooding book, one that dwells on Dostoyevskian notions of innocence and evil. It moves like a muscle car, oozing down the side roads of your mind. (Read the review.) ‘SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE: ESSAYS, CRITICISM, AND COMMENTARY’ By Lorrie Moore (Alfred A. Knopf). This volume of personal essays, book and television reviews and political observations, most of them written for The New York Review of Books, floods your veins with pleasure. As a critic, Moore has an intimate and approachable voice. She doesn’t mistake solemnity for seriousness and, in nearly every paragraph, seems to be utterly enjoying herself. Her pieces have what Anthony Lane said every review should have, an “authentic reek of the concession stand.” (Read the review.) ‘MY YEAR OF REST AND RELAXATION’ By Ottessa Moshfegh (Penguin Press). Moshfegh is a young American writer of Croatian and Iranian descent who writes with misanthropic aplomb. The unnamed heroine of her third novel is a kind of brand ambassador for ennui. Like Oblomov in the Russian novel, she wants to spend most of her time sleeping. She begins to wonder: Why climb out of bed at all? If she’s on downers, this black comedy is on uppers. It’s a remorseless little machine. Though this novel is set 20 years ago, it feels current. The thought of sleeping through this particular moment in the world’s history has its appeal. (Read the review.) ‘THE FRIEND’ By Sigrid Nunez (Riverhead Books). Nunez’s dry, allusive and charming new novel has the makings of a broad comedy. It’s about what happens when a woman who lives in a tiny Manhattan apartment inherits, after the suicide of a former mentor and lover, his harlequin Great Dane. The novel’s tone, however, is frequently mournful and resonant. Nunez has an interesting mind, and she shakes the dust from every topic — grief, writing, academia, sexual politics — she picks up. (Read the review.) ‘THERE THERE’ By Tommy Orange (Alfred A. Knopf). Orange’s first novel is set in Oakland, Calif., and takes its mocking title from Gertrude Stein’s observation about the city, which is that’s there’s no there there. Its topic is urban Indians, young men and women who “know the sound of the freeway better than we do rivers.” Orange is a muscular storyteller. He deals out the stories of his 12 characters, many of them related, as their lives move toward an event called the Big Oakland Powwow, from which some of them will not return. (Read the review.) ‘A LIFE OF MY OWN’ By Claire Tomalin (Penguin Press). Tomalin, the esteemed English biographer of Samuel Pepys, Jane Austen, Charles Dickens and others, writes briskly and sensitively here of her own life. She attended Cambridge a year ahead of Sylvia Plath and she spent many years in swinging, sexist London as the editor of well-regarded book review sections. Her first husband, the journalist Nicholas Tomalin, cheated on her relentlessly before dying young while reporting in Israel. One of their children was born with spina bifida, a defect of the spinal chord. This book’s tone is never maudlin. There’s great appeal in watching this indomitable woman continue to chase the next draft of herself. (Read the review.) Nicholson Baker once said that every novel asks the same question: Is life worth living? The books I loved most this year — a heretical, often form-shattering bunch — take it one step further. They are why we live: to encounter questioning, mayhem, wisdom and wit — to read books such as these. ‘NINETY-NINE GLIMPSES OF PRINCESS MARGARET’ By Craig Brown (Farrar, Straus & Giroux.) Brown ignores the starchy obligations of biography and adopts a form of his own to tell the story of beautiful, bad-tempered, scandal-prone Princess Margaret, one of the 20th century’s great malcontents. He swoops at his subject from all angles, in a Cubist portrait of a lady — one chapter enumerates her most famous rebukes. But the book’s real artistry is in how the focus enlarges, from Margaret’s misbehavior to those who gawked at her, pens poised over their diaries. History isn’t written by the victors, Brown reminds us, it’s written by the writers, and this study becomes a scathing group portrait of a generation of carnivorous royal watchers. (Read the review.) ‘THE IMPOSTOR: A TRUE STORY’ By Javier Cercas, translated by Frank Wynne (Alfred A. Knopf). For three decades, Enric Marco, a Catalan mechanic, was a prominent public face of Spanish survivors of the Holocaust, until his story was revealed to be a hoax in 2005. Cercas, a novelist, becomes Marco’s (somewhat reluctant) Boswell in this work of nonfiction as he tries to understand why the man lied and why he was believed, and to investigate his own queasy feelings of kinship. It is thrilling to be in the room with the two of them once their cat-and-mouse game commences. (Read the review.) ‘YOUR DUCK IS MY DUCK: STORIES’ By Deborah Eisenberg (Ecco/HarperCollins Publishers). Eisenberg is a writer of legendary exactitude, and slowness. This is her first new collection since 2006, and well worth the wait — so instantly absorbing that it feels like an abduction. These are stories of painful awakenings and refusals of innocence, emerging out of the ashes of the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, despoliation and environmental plunder. The sentences are full of syntactic fireworks, breakneck swerves and very black humor. “I’m hurtling through time, strapped to an explosive device, my life,” the narrator of the title story tells her therapist. “Plus, it’s beginning to look like a photo finish — me first, or the world.” (Read the review.) ‘ASYMMETRY’ By Lisa Halliday (Simon & Schuster). Halliday’s first novel is two in one: a May-December romance featuring a character who bears a terrifically unabashed resemblance to Philip Roth and a slowly unspooling tragedy about an Iraqi-American detained at Heathrow Airport. A third section hints at the link between these two stories that never explicitly intersect. The deep pleasure for the reader is to trace resonances, how themes chime and rhyme as well as Halliday’s underlying, beautifully articulated arguments about fiction’s possibilities and obligations. It’s the kind of book that makes you a better reader, a more active and subtle noticer. It hones your senses. (Read the review.) ‘AMERICAN SONNETS FOR MY PAST AND FUTURE ASSASSIN’ By Terrance Hayes (Penguin Poets). In these 70 sonnets, written after the election of 2016, Hayes set himself the challenge of writing political poems in the guise of love poems. Each one is distinct: Some are sermons, some are swoons. They are acrid with tear gas, and they unravel with desire. Hayes revisits lifelong obsessions — the cage of masculinity, the gulf between fathers and sons — and plays with different registers, returning to lamentation, to annihilating grief for “all the black people I’m tired of losing,” as one narrator says. “All the dead from parts of Florida, Ferguson, / Brooklyn, Charleston, Cleveland, Chicago, / Baltimore.” (Read the review.) ‘BELONGING: A GERMAN RECKONS WITH HISTORY AND HOME’ By Nora Krug (Scribner). Krug slashes through a fog of shame, determined oblivion and misdirection to unearth her family’s role in the Holocaust as well as the stubborn silences in German life. Her visual memoir takes the form of an overstuffed scrapbook, jammed with letters, photographs and passionate paeans to household goods of her childhood — soap, a brand of bandage, a rubber hot water bottle — that speak to those unappeasable desires to wash away stains, mend scars, make whole. The wisdom of this book is that it eschews such palliatives. What Krug pursues is a better quality of guilt, a way of confronting the past without paralysis. (Read the review.) ‘THE COLLECTED STORIES OF MACHADO DE ASSIS’ By Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis, translated by Margaret Jull Costa and Robin Patterson (Liveright). For the first time, the short stories of this 19th-century Brazilian master have been collected and translated into English, allowing the reader to trace the arc of Machado’s career, from the straightforward early love stories to the postmodern later works. Certain preoccupations persist: alluring widows, naïve young men, a fondness for coincidence. Above all looms the figure of the bibliomane. “This is my family,” one says, pointing to his bookshelf. Like his characters, Machado was a creature of literature; ink ran in his veins. It is breathtaking to see the development of his style as well as his deep engagement with storytelling all over the world. (Read the review.) ‘THE TANGLED TREE: A RADICAL NEW HISTORY OF LIFE’ By David Quammen (Simon & Schuster). Quammen’s latest is the biography of a groundbreaking idea — and its many midwives, chief among them Carl Woese, “the most important biologist of the 20th century you’ve never heard of.” Our greatest living chronicler of the natural world, Quammen makes elegant work of complicated science, describing the discovery of horizontal gene transfer and its challenge to our conception of stately Darwinian inheritance with vivacious descriptions on every page. The sentences are spring-loaded and each section ends with a light cliffhanger. Quammen has the gift of Daedalus; he gets you out of the maze. (Read the review.) ‘ESSENTIAL ESSAYS: CULTURE, POLITICS, AND THE ART OF POETRY’ By Adrienne Rich, edited and with an introduction by Sandra M. Gilbert (W.W. Norton and Company). This collection of Rich’s influential criticism reveals how her private reckonings with motherhood, sexuality, Jewishness and tokenism blossomed into her public stances and poetry. We see how frequently, and powerfully, she wrote from her divisions, the areas of her life where she felt vulnerable, conflicted and ashamed. For Rich, a thinking life, a political commitment, did not mean achieving perfect awareness but embarking on “a long turbulence.” It is a peerless pleasure to join her in this work, to be enveloped by her capacious heart and mind. (Read the review.) ‘ADVICE FOR FUTURE CORPSES (AND THOSE WHO LOVE THEM): A PRACTICAL PERSPECTIVE ON DEATH AND DYING’ By Sallie Tisdale (Touchstone). This brilliantly deceptive book is, putatively, a guide to what happens to the body as it dies and directly after. Tisdale, a longtime palliative care nurse, offers advice on every stage of the process: whether to die in the hospital or at home, how to handle morphine’s side effects, how to breathe when it becomes difficult. But in its loving, fierce specificity, this book on how to die is also a blessedly saccharine-free guide for how to live. (Read the review.) I tried to discern an overriding theme that connected these books, and I couldn’t — which just goes to show how various and expansive nonfiction can be, even if it sometimes seemed as if a single figure was bent on making it hard to pay attention to anything else. There’s a significant historical contingent on this list: Whatever is happening in the country at the moment has roots that extend far beyond the election of 2016, and three of the books are specifically about the turmoil and ruptures of the 19th century. I was also drawn to writers who took what we assumed about something or someone and deepened our understanding to the point of disturbing it; I was grateful to be shown how little I know, and how much more there is to learn. ‘RISE AND KILL FIRST: THE SECRET HISTORY OF ISRAEL’S TARGETED ASSASSINATIONS’ By Ronen Bergman, translated by Ronnie Hope (Random House). Blending history and investigative reporting, Bergman has written a judicious book about an incendiary subject: secret assassinations committed by Israel’s intelligence services. There is plenty here about tradecraft and risky missions gone awry, but Bergman never loses sight of the ethical questions that arise when a state insists it needs to kill in order to survive. (Read the review.) ‘FREDERICK DOUGLASS: PROPHET OF FREEDOM’ By David W. Blight (Simon & Schuster). The first major biography of Douglass in nearly three decades, Blight’s comprehensive volume delves into the Douglass we didn’t know, including his trajectory from fugitive slave and abolitionist outsider to political insider, through the Civil War and beyond. Blight isn’t looking to overturn our understanding of Douglass, but to complicate it — a measure by which this ambitious and empathetic biography resoundingly succeeds. (Read the review.) ‘THE WAR BEFORE THE WAR: FUGITIVE SLAVES AND THE STRUGGLE FOR AMERICA’S SOUL FROM THE REVOLUTION TO THE CIVIL WAR’ By Andrew Delbanco (Penguin Press). Delbanco traces how the compromises of the Constitution, along with the long history of compromise in the century that followed, tried to paper over the violent reality of chattel slavery. But the slaves who ran away were persistent reminders of the truth. Delbanco’s riveting and unsettling book shows how questions that preoccupied Americans in the 18th and 19th centuries continue to resonate in our own. (Read the review.) ‘THE PERSONALITY BROKERS: THE STRANGE HISTORY OF MYERS-BRIGGS AND THE BIRTH OF PERSONALITY TESTING’ By Merve Emre (Doubleday). On the face of it, this is supposed to be a history of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator; it turns out to be something much stranger — an inventive and beguiling biography of the idiosyncratic mother-daughter pair who developed the indicator using their own, decidedly unscientific, interpretations of human behavior. If there’s a theme in this book, woven throughout and never belabored, it’s that the self is more slippery than we allow. (Read the review.) ‘NINTH STREET WOMEN: LEE KRASNER, ELAINE DE KOONING, GRACE HARTIGAN, JOAN MITCHELL, AND HELEN FRANKENTHALER: FIVE PAINTERS AND THE MOVEMENT THAT CHANGED MODERN ART’ By Mary Gabriel (Little, Brown and Company). The story of New York’s postwar art world has been told many times over, but by wresting the perspective from the boozy, macho brawlers who tended to fixate on themselves and one another, Gabriel has found a way to newly illuminate the milieu and upend its clichés. Her book is supremely gratifying, generous and lush but also tough and precise — in other words, as complicated and capacious as the lives it depicts. (Read the review.) ‘AMITY AND PROSPERITY: ONE FAMILY AND THE FRACTURING OF AMERICA’ By Eliza Griswold (Farrar, Straus & Giroux). Over the course of seven years, Griswold paid close attention to a community in southwestern Pennsylvania to convey its confounding experience with fracking, which included environmental degradation, mounting health problems and the kind of accumulating frustrations that eroded trust in government bit by bit. Some families suffered while others thrived; what Griswold depicts is a community, like the earth, cracked open. (Read the review.) ‘PATRIOT NUMBER ONE: AMERICAN DREAMS IN CHINATOWN’ By Lauren Hilgers (Crown). Writing about a Chinese activist and immigrant named Zhuang Liehong, Hilgers offers a penetrating profile of a man and much more besides: an indelible portrait of his wife and their marriage; a canny depiction of Flushing, Queens; a lucid anatomy of Chinese politics and America’s immigration system. The resulting narrative is rich and absorbing — as evocative and engrossing as a novel. (Read the review.) ‘INSEPARABLE: THE ORIGINAL SIAMESE TWINS AND THEIR RENDEZVOUS WITH AMERICAN HISTORY’ By Yunte Huang (Liveright). After years of showcased servitude, the original “Siamese twins” Chang and Eng Bunker settled down in small-town North Carolina and adopted the lives of 19th-century Southern gentry — identifying with the white oppressor class, in other words, fathering at least 21 children between them, owning slaves and sending their sons to fight for the Confederacy. Huang is attuned to the ironies of their story in his incisive and riveting account. (Read the review.) ‘HEAVY: AN AMERICAN MEMOIR’ By Kiese Laymon (Scribner). In this generous, searching memoir, Laymon reckons with more than one kind of heaviness — his physical weight along with the burden of the past. You can see Laymon working through his ambivalence within the space of a sentence; he is relentlessly self-aware, exploring all the forces that can stop even the most buoyant hopes from ever leaving the ground. (Read the review.) ‘CRASHED: HOW A DECADE OF FINANCIAL CRISES CHANGED THE WORLD’ By Adam Tooze (Viking). There have been a number of books written about the 2008 financial crisis, but few more elegant and astute than this one. Tooze shows how the upheaval radiated outward, shaping not only the new economic order but also the political free-for-all that scrambled traditional allegiances, both here and abroad.

2018,"Timothy C. May, Early Advocate of Internet Privacy, Dies at 66","Timothy C. May, a physicist, polemicist and cantankerous advocate of internet privacy who helped start a movement aimed at protecting the privacy of individuals online, died on Dec. 13 at his home in Corralitos, Calif. He was 66. The Santa Cruz County Sheriff-Coroner’s office confirmed his death but said that the cause had not yet been determined. As the rabble-rousing leader of a group called the Cypherpunks, Mr. May, in his writings, foreshadowed and influenced many of the concerns about privacy and government control that have come to dominate the internet age. In the one-page Crypto Anarchist Manifesto, which he wrote in 1988, Mr. May said, “Just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government interference in economic transactions.” Much of Mr. May’s writing, incorporating elements of advanced math, libertarian politics and even science fiction, was circulated by the Cypherpunks, a group he co-founded with John Gilmore and Eric Hughes in 1992. It inspired later online movements like WikiLeaks and cryptocurrency technologies like Bitcoin. In recent years, Mr. May’s legacy had been clouded by his frequent and unapologetically offensive statements in online forums. In 2003 he wrote that he would welcome a nuclear strike on Washington because it would kill “a million criminal politicians and two million inner-city welfare mutants.” His friends said that his troublesome views were an outgrowth of the style that had made him so influential. “He would try to get people’s attention by saying things in a deliberately confrontational way,” said Mr. Gilmore, who later co-founded the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit digital rights group. Once he got someone’s attention, Mr. May was interested in having an honest conversation, Mr. Gilmore said. “He actually cared about the truth and about coming to understand things,” he said. Timothy Christopher May was born on Dec. 21, 1951, in Bethesda, Md. His father, Thomas, was in the Navy, and the family moved frequently, to California, Virginia and France. His mother, Hazel (Heden) May, was a homemaker. Mr. May’s sister, Kathleen Fox, said his unquenchable intellectual curiosity was always combined with a defiant streak. After being accepted into Mensa, the high I.Q. society, and attending its meetings, Mr. May told her that the members were a “bunch of dummies” and that they weren’t worth his time. Mr. May studied physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. On graduating he took a job at Intel, the world’s largest maker of computer chips, which had been founded a few years earlier. Only several years into the job, after the company’s chips had been found to be malfunctioning, Mr. May discovered the source of the problem through a process involving radioactive alpha particles. His discovery earned him his own laboratory and an award from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. But calculating that his Intel stock options could sustain him through retirement, he resigned at 34. Mr. May set out to write a science fiction novel inspired by the evolving science of cryptography and the writings of libertarians like Ayn Rand and Murray Rothbard. When he struggled to bring off the novel, he turned to writing on early online forums run by groups like the Extropians and his own Cypherpunks. As the Cypherpunks’ most frequent contributor, and at the group’s in-person meetings in the Bay Area, Mr. May advocated using cryptography to spread government secrets, as WikiLeaks later did, and to evade surveillance of individuals, which he believed would become more pervasive with the spread of computers. These ideas brought the Cypherpunks into conflict with the government, which wanted to limit the spread of cryptography. But people who successfully fought to integrate cryptography into the internet in its early days, to protect the privacy of individuals, hailed Mr. May’s writing as an inspiration. “He was ahead of the game and understood what was going to be happening and what these obscure technologies were going to bring about,” said Steven Levy, who wrote about Mr. May extensively in the 1990s for Wired magazine and in the book “Crypto” (2001). In addition to Ms. Fox, Mr. May is survived by his brother, Michael. Mr. May kept a careful distance from the real world, leading a reclusive life. He often wrote about arming himself and waiting for government agents to show up. After the Cypherpunks faded in the early 2000s, he began expressing racist sentiments to other online groups. Despite alienating many of his old allies, some of his ideas have recently come into vogue again with the rise of WikiLeaks and Bitcoin and the growing concerns about government surveillance. In an interview in October with the website CoinDesk, Mr. May accused social media companies of helping to “build the machinery of the Dossier Society,” in which private citizens’ personal information can be monitored and sold. He was also critical of the get-rich-quick mentality of the cryptocurrency industry. “I cannot give a ringing endorsement to where we are,” he told CoinDesk, “or generate a puff-piece about the great things already done.”",The New York Times
2018,Tinder and Bumble Are Hungry for Your Love,"The big online dating rebrand means the apps want you to fall in love with them now. Tinder and Bumble are desperate to convince you that you’re not desperate. Dating, they promise, is fun, so fun, that when one date ends badly, it’s a barely disguised blessing: You get to stay on the apps and keep on dating! Both companies are pushing this message with recent advertising efforts. Tinder has a new publication, Swipe Life, specializing in personal essays that reinforce the idea that dating misadventures are cool, or at least exciting, invigorating and youthful. (Swipe Life says downloading Tinder is a milestone in human life akin to buying your first beer and losing your virginity.) Bumble is selling itself as a means to personal betterment and greater sophistication. It is profiling good-looking, high-achieving New Yorkers on articles on its blog, the Beehive, and on bus stops and billboards around New York City. The dating-slash-friendship-slash-networking app is hoping to sell users on various types of upward mobility. The right romantic partner is surely on the app, but making other connections could serve you just as well. Other dating apps are also getting into the content business. Grindr has its own site, Into, on which it publishes original reporting, story aggregation and commentary; Hinge, as part of an advertising campaign last year, published short-form fiction on walls and billboards. It’s as if the apps have realized we’ve become disenchanted with their ways, and now they’re making an effort to treat us right. They want to gain our trust, so we’ll settle down with them for the long haul. After all, it’s been more than half a decade since they were invented, and if you’ve been single in the last five years, chances are you’ve used one. In its annual survey of 5,000 Americans, Match Group, the dating conglomerate that owns Tinder and OkCupid, found that singles met first dates on the internet more than through any other venue, and that 62 percent of millennials surveyed had used a dating app. Dating via phone app was once novel and, consequently, exciting. Now, it’s just dating. Tinder is the top dating app in the United States and worldwide, according to App Annie, the mobile data and analytics provider, and it tends to skew young. More than 50 percent of Tinder’s users are ages 18 to 25, the company said. Elie Seidman, Tinder’s chief executive and the former head of OKCupid, said that the company wants to brand itself as the leader of early-adult dating. “We actually embrace the fact that our members are in that dating-as-a-leisure activity phase of life,” Mr. Seidman said. He added that, with the new editorial content, Tinder hoped to offer users a positive outlook on that landscape. Tinder relationships often don’t go anywhere at all — and that’s fine! When Swipe Life began this fall, its articles sang of the exciting spontaneity of singledom. For example: “I Moved to L.A. for a Tinder Relationship That Lasted Two Weeks, But I Don’t Regret It — Here’s Why.” [Relationships and advice. Beauty and health. Stories picked for you. Sign up for Of the Moment.] The author, Belinda Cai, wrote that she visited Los Angeles in the summer of 2017, met a guy through the app, hung out with him twice, and then stayed in touch by phone. They bonded over their childhoods and “leftist ideologies.” Soon, she had moved from Ohio to live with him in California, but quickly found his apartment too messy, his “affinity for drinking” too gross and his “large hair-shedding dog” too destructive. As for their shared ideology? In the end, she wrote, he turned out to be “a total brocialist.” Still, she praised Tinder for spurring her cross-country move, even though the relationship was a bust. “Little did I know, when I used the app last summer, I wasn’t swiping for love or anything crazy like that — I was swiping for change,” she wrote. “GET ON TINDER,” reads the large, hyperlinked button at the end of the piece. Many other essays published this fall ended when the writer became single once again, and, consequently, ready for more Tindering. In another article, a woman who dated her neighbor until she realized he had a drinking problem wrote, reflectively: “My time with my neighbor may have been fairly brief, but during those months, I think we actually gave each other exactly what the other one truly needed.” If Tinder has taken a page from the confessional style of sites like Thought Catalog or xoJane, Bumble’s strategy seems inspired by the Forbes’s annual 30 Under 30 lists. Its “Find Them on Bumble” campaign collects the 112 “most inspiring New Yorkers,” according to the company, and subtly links their success to Bumble’s services. (In addition to being the second-most popular dating app in the United States according to App Annie, Bumble connects people to new friends through Bumble BFF and with professional contacts through Bumble Bizz.) In interviews, some of the campaign’s participants said that they had only joined the app as a condition of appearing on billboards and bus stops. That is to say, you could not “find them on Bumble” until shortly before Bumble said you could. “A bunch of my friends work for Bumble,” said Noah Neiman, a 34-year-old co-founder of the boxing gym Rumble, whose face graces many a bus ad. (His mom has sent him a steady stream of photos of the billboards and posters featuring him in New York, even though she lives in Pittsburgh.) Mr. Neiman is single, but when asked about whether he uses dating apps, he was explicit: “No,” he said. “No, no, no, no.” “It’s the devil’s playground,” he said. “I try to avoid all that temptation.” Todd Wiseman, another New Yorker featured in the Bumble campaign and the founder of the video production studio Hayden 5, said that he did use Bumble to find romantic prospects before he was chosen to embody the brand. If he could choose, though, he said: “I would prefer to meet someone out in real life.” Still, the campaign is supposed to show that the app can be used to create all kinds of connections, romantic and otherwise, which explains why the “Find Them on Bumble” list includes so many people who are already partnered up. Maybe you cannot woo Alyssa Mastromonaco, the White House deputy chief of staff for operations under President Barack Obama, because she has been married since 2013. But perhaps she would be willing to network? The ballerina Isabella Boylston, who is also in the campaign and also married, said that she was on Bumble’s BFF platform, though she politely declined to answer a question about whether she uses the app regularly. On dating apps in general, she said, “I feel like I was already in a relationship when those kind of became mainstream.” She added: “Otherwise I totally would have been on there, for sure.” Alex Williamson, Bumble’s head of brand, said that the search to find the New York Bumble representatives was extensive. “For years we’ve been talking about an opportunity to showcase our users and their stories,” she said. “While we love our product, our product in some ways is really our people.” The move to publish stories about romance is smart. It’s a subject people like to read about. (See: the success of our very own Modern Love column!) More generally, branded content is big business — kind of like editorial magazines used to be. Swipe Life, the Beehive and Into represent a small fraction of editorial content now being funded by companies. Snapchat sponsors an online publication, Real Life Magazine. The mattress company Casper started a digital site, Van Winkle’s, and last fall, pivoted to print, with a magazine called Woolly. Dollar Shave Club has Mel Magazine, Equinox has Furthermore and Airbnb has Airbnbmag. Brands don’t always clearly disclose their exclusive sponsorship of their publications’ editorial content. Into, for instance, says nothing about Grindr in its URL, on its home page or even in its “About” section. It’s only when you click on an “Advertise” button that you are taken to a site explicitly associated with Grindr. And these sites can certainly bring negative attention to their benefactors. In late November, Into reported on a Facebook post written by Grindr’s president, Scott Chen, that suggested he was opposed to gay marriage. Mr. Chen said in a comment on the site that the report was “unbalanced and misleading,” and that he should have been asked to weigh in. More recently, an Into article that called a new music video by Ariana Grande “virulently anti-queer” and “transmisogynstic” was torn apart on Twitter; many users suggested the article was poorly argued and offensive in its own right. Into added an editor’s note and removed the author’s name, saying that she had received death threats and would be barred from writing for the time being. (The author, who seemingly deleted her Twitter account, could not be reached for comment.) Into later published a takedown of the original piece, calling it “cringe-inducing.” With digital media companies like Mic continuing to lay off journalists en masse, Tinder, Grindr and other brands offer opportunities for young writers to make some money. Stephanie D’Agostini, a freelancer who has written for Swipe Life, said that she did not see Tinder’s website as any different from writing for sites like Refinery29. And over the past few months, Swipe Life in particular has become more nuanced. One essay, “My Year-Long Love With an Undocumented Immigrant,” was messy, possibly exploitative and occasionally earnest. The piece did not end with the “Get on Tinder” button. It was a more subtle advertisement for the qualities with which Tinder hopes to be identified: personal growth, empathy and close connection that can feel difficult to find online. Swipe Life received only 4,000 unique views on desktop in October, its first month, according to comScore. But mobile views, which comScore could not provide, are likely higher, and Tinder’s senior director of content, Kelsey Blodget, said that the company had been “pleasantly surprised” by the response to the site. “This is definitely ancillary to the app,” she said. “The app is our core business. But this is something that we hope can accompany our users on their dating journey.” Ms. Williamson said that Bumble’s campaign has been a success. Though she could not provide specific numbers, she said that the app had seen a “significant uptick” in users since the campaign started in October, and that the company would be choosing cohorts of spokespeople in other large markets. The campaign, she said, was “a celebration of what we’ve been able to build” — even if that isn’t lasting romance. “We really are trying to connect people to meaningful relationships,” Ms. Williamson said. “Whatever shape and form that looks like for you.” An earlier version of this article misstated the source of a comment from Scott Chen, Grindr's president.

2018,Tiny Love Stories: ‘His Friends Begged Me to Slap Him.’,"Modern love Modern Love in miniature, featuring five reader-submitted stories of 100 words or fewer. I said to my 12-year-old son, “You know how men and women date and marry, like I did with Dad before we split up?” He nodded. “Well,” I said, “I’m dating someone but not a man; I’m dating a woman.” He said, “Are you happy?” “Yes,” I said, “Very happy.” “Cool,” he said, “then I’m happy.” A few years later he walked me down the aisle to my soon-to-be wife. — Carrie Platner Mom, my ex-nemesis, allowed me just one glass of wine with the high-protein, low-fiber dinners she would cook me. My defenses down, I was losing my hair and the old hostility. “I’d take your place if I could,” she said through tears one night as she tucked me in bed. My mother couldn’t bear to see me suffering and afraid, even though I wasn’t the daughter she expected me to be. And I couldn’t fight my mother and cancer at the same time. So we stopped fighting each other and fought my cancer together. — Page Leggett I was working as a bartender and waitress at BBR (“Burgers, Beer and Rock 'n' Roll”). He was watching a Duke basketball game with his friends. When I came over, his friends begged me to slap him. Apparently, he had lost a bet, a slap bet. I asked my boss if I could slap this cute customer. My boss said yes. So I slapped him hard on his left cheek, and it must have been an amazing slap because here we are madly in love four years later. — Laura Pomales Living in Bangkok, I suffer from a common affliction in urban metropolises: Among millions of people, I’m lonely. The fact that I am a shy foreigner makes new relationships difficult to cultivate. So I often fulfill my need for human intimacy through one of Bangkok’s most widely available and affordable activities: massages. A one-hour massage per week easily turns into two hours, then three. Four is a record set during one especially solitary stretch. For those hours, my body — contorted by confident, unyielding hands — returns to a childlike state; contained, safe and embraced. — Alastair McCready Chopped celery and squared potatoes waiting in the fridge. On the counter, a jug of water and a slow-cooker filled with dried peas. On the lid, a tiny note from my husband, the professional chef, to me, who burns water. “At noonish: 1. Add water 2. Add veggies 3. Stir 4. Plug in 5. Forget.” His sweetly crooked handwriting. His unconditional faith in me. Between steps 4 and 5, it hit me. Married love is seldom about the grand gesture. Sometimes it simply shows up as a recipe from your partner, helping you make a tasty pot of soup. — Meagan Fratiello See more Tiny Love Stories at nytimes.com/modernlove.
