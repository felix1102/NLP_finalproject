2019,Who’s at Fault? Read the Fine Print to Make Sure You’re Not at Risk,"Wealth Matters If the old printer at his golf club had not been replaced, Ray Mantle probably would not have realized that he and his friends had been signing a liability waiver that could expose them to expensive litigation and damages. Mr. Mantle, a retired New York lawyer whose specialty was intellectual property, said he had noticed something on the back of the receipt for a golf cart rental at his club, Queen’s Harbour Yacht and Country Club in Jacksonville, Fla., that alarmed him. Appearing clearly in black ink on white paper, thanks to the new printer, was an agreement that exempted ClubCorp, which owns the club, from any liability incurred while any person — the renter, a family member or even a third party — was using the cart. These types of waivers, often written in small print with legal verbiage, have become a part of modern life. They typically exempt a business or a person from blame or liability should something go wrong; instead, the onus is on the person who signs the waiver. But Mr. Mantle thought this one went too far, because it tried to absolve the club’s owner from basic responsibility. So he complained to the manager, only to find out that he had overlooked the agreement for years, when it was printed in gray ink on yellow paper. Mr. Mantle, 81, began a campaign against the waiver, enlisting fellow members to challenge its use with Queen’s Harbour and ClubCorp. His effort goes beyond one gated golf community in North Florida. It raises issues for anyone who has taken a child to a trampoline park, driven around a go-kart track or rented sporting equipment: How enforceable are these ubiquitous waivers, what rights does a signer give up, and are individuals unwittingly taking on risk that a business should assume? States have a lot of say over waivers of liability. Lee Wickert, a lawyer in the Austin, Tex., office of Matthiesen, Wickert & Lehrer, compiled a list of how each state interprets them. He found that only Louisiana, Montana and Virginia ban them. California interprets them strictly, while in Alabama, pretty much anything goes. Florida, he said, often sides with the business over the individual; in Wisconsin, it’s the opposite. At the heart of any of these waivers are two points: whether the language is clear and what bargaining powers the person being asked to sign the waiver has. “A lot of times, people aren’t even aware of the language,” Mr. Wickert said. “Oftentimes, it’s a hindsight question: The court says, ‘If he did read it, would he have understood it?’” In Florida, the state looks at whether the service or area covered by the waiver is essential to the public, like a park. If it is, the waiver is not valid. A golf course does not fall under the public service designation. But how the ClubCorp waiver would be enforced is not clear. Mr. Mantle said he and his fellow members were concerned that if an accident occurred on the golf course, they could be sued while the waiver’s legality was debated in court. “It’s likely unenforceable, but before it got to that point, the person would be sued and have to hire a lawyer,” he said. “And there’s always some uncertainty about whether you’d win.” The costs to someone who had signed that waiver could be staggering, depleting savings and other assets like a house. Vince Catalli, another member of Queen’s Harbour and a friend of Mr. Mantle’s, has helped lead the charge against ClubCorp. “The issue isn’t any golfer being responsible for his own negligence,” Mr. Catalli said. “The issue is ClubCorp saying we need to be responsible for their negligence.” Neither Kimberly King, senior associate counsel at ClubCorp, nor the company’s spokeswoman, Patty Jerde, would discuss the matter by phone. In an email, Ms. Jerde defended the policy, equating the risk that golfers take to those assumed by a skier. “Similar to other hosts of recreational sites (e.g., ski resorts), we use an assumption of risk policy so that our members and guests can understand their own personal responsibility,” she wrote. “We believe we’ve struck a fair balance between offering a great recreational experience and the associated risks assumed with the enjoyment of our facilities.” In an email to Mr. Catalli, Ms. King said the company would not change its language and compared its waiver to ones she had signed for bike rides, summer camp for her children and bounce houses. But when using entertainment equipment, like a trampoline or a bounce house, parents and children are required to acknowledge lengthy agreements before being allowed to participate. It’s clear that dozens of children bouncing on a trampoline carries risk of injury. But even those agreements do not always hold up in instances of negligence by the company, lawyers said. Or consider an ice-skating rink, where a waiver would be required. If a skater gets hurt, the skater has waived liability against the owner of the rink. If a skater hurts someone else, the skater is still liable. “If you injure someone else, that liability is now part of your personal liability coverage,” said Scott Teller, executive vice president at Chubb, the insurance company, adding that a lawsuit could be financially devastating. “It only takes one single liability event like that to impact your financial well-being.” Lawyers questioned whether putting a waiver of liability on the back of a golf cart slip was even valid, let alone aboveboard. The waivers that hold up best in court are written with bold type highlighting the risks to a person, who then has to agree to them by signing, Mr. Wickert said. “Warnings on the back of tickets aren’t so strong,” he said. But this can be a hazy area, because Queen’s Harbour is also open to the public. At a private club, such exculpatory language does not exist — and most likely would not be tolerated by members, said Tom Walker, vice president at RPS Bollinger Sports & Leisure Insurance. “If you’re a member, you don’t have anything contractually that you’d sign off on,” he said. “Nor would your guests be involved with that.” A private club might try to mitigate risk with private contractors who work there, however. Yet there are instances when being on a private course is not protection from liability. To protect yourself, insurers stress the need for excess liability coverage, also known as umbrella policies. Traditionally, these policies pick up coverage where automobile or homeowner policies leave off. Ross Buchmueller, president and chief executive of Pure Insurance, said his company had settled a claim a few years ago after a client’s golf club slipped from his hands during a swing on a course in Miami and struck a cyclist on an abutting bike route. The cyclist, of course, was not required to sign a waiver for a bike ride, Mr. Buchmueller said. “He went on a path open to the public — maybe it had signs warning about golfers — but either way, the person got hurt,” he said. His company paid a claim in excess of $100,000 because the golfer had an umbrella policy. Mr. Mantle said ClubCorp’s waiver had not deterred him from golfing. But he and his golfing buddies make sure to cross it out and write that they do not accept it. “So far, the people manning the cash registers let me do it,” he said. “My own preference is to take out those terms that release me from liability and indemnifies the club from liability. But as a lawyer, I’ve modified the terms, and they’ve accepted it.”",The New York Times
2019,Who’s on Trial in the College Basketball Scandal? Not the Big Names,"On College Basketball Before Jerry Tarkanian built a college basketball powerhouse in Las Vegas, he was the coach at Long Beach State in the early 1970s and had two tormentors: John Wooden and his dynastic U.C.L.A. teams, and the N.C.A.A. What irked Tarkanian for years, though, was the way the N.C.A.A. pursued him doggedly at every stop in his career yet seemed to have little interest in digging into all the favors a notorious booster did for U.C.L.A. players in the ’60s and ’70s. “The N.C.A.A. is so mad at U.C.L.A.,” Tarkanian would quip, “they’re going to put Cal State Northridge on probation.” The wheels of college basketball justice seem to turn no differently these days. The latest example will be unfolding over the next couple weeks in a federal courtroom in Lower Manhattan, where two low-level operators, a would-be agent, Christian Dawkins, and a shoe company consultant, Merl Code Jr., will stand trial for bribery. Jury selection began Monday. Dawkins and Code have already been sentenced to six months in prison after they were convicted last year of fraud for their part — along with the Adidas executive James Gatto — in a scheme that funneled money to recruits and their families in exchange for pledges to play at Adidas-sponsored colleges like Kansas, Louisville and North Carolina State. The case is part of a broader federal investigation, built on F.B.I. wiretaps, that sent shivers down the spines of college basketball coaches two years ago when Joon H. Kim, then the acting United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, boasted that prosecutors planned to expose “the dark underbelly of college basketball.” So far, though, the ones being punished are mostly minor players. Assistant coaches at Auburn, Southern California, Louisville, Arizona, Oklahoma State, Texas Christian and Creighton have been fired. Several are looking at jail time. Dawkins, Code and Gatto have been convicted. And a financial adviser and another Adidas consultant have pleaded guilty. But no top Adidas executives and only one head coach — Rick Pitino, who was fired by Louisville for an accumulation of delinquent behavior — have lost their jobs. Far from having a chilling effect on college basketball, the scandal has devolved into an upside-down case in which the victims, at least in the eyes of the court, have been the universities and a group of elite coaches whom the prosecution has shielded, rather than exposed. The latest example came quietly on Friday when Edgardo Ramos, the United States District Court judge who will preside over the bribery trial, granted a prosecution motion that will allow two head coaches, Sean Miller of Arizona and Will Wade of Louisiana State, whose conversations with Dawkins were wiretapped, to avoid taking the witness stand. In asking Ramos to set aside the government’s motion, Steve Haney, a lawyer for Dawkins, said that the evidence “establishes very clearly that Sean Miller is paying players at Arizona,” and that there is “systematic cheating” taking place at L.S.U. and Arizona. Eli Mark, an assistant United States attorney, argued that putting Miller and Wade on the witness stand “opens the door to other extraneous issues.” Ramos said he would revisit the issue if the evidence presented during the trial compelled him to do so. But the ruling was a blow to Haney, himself a former college basketball player, who promised last month at Dawkins’s sentencing “to pull back the covers” on college basketball corruption and put a long list of coaches on the witness stand in this trial. “As many as I can get into the courtroom,” he said. As Haney stood outside the courthouse on Friday, he maintained that he still has a strong case. But he was baffled by the prosecutors’ decision to go after ambitious but small-time operators like Dawkins and not head coaches or executives, saying that the evidence — which prosecutors have shared — was there to charge them. “I can’t answer why the government charged who they did,” Haney said. “But I wouldn’t say they exposed the underbelly of college basketball with who they charged and who they didn’t charge.” Paula Canny, who represented Greg Anderson, the former personal trainer for Barry Bonds, in the Balco drug case, said that typically the government follows the path of least resistance in these types of cases. Anderson spent three months in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy and money laundering. He did additional time for refusing to testify in an unsuccessful perjury case against Bonds, who was originally targeted only as a Balco grand-jury witness. “So much of it is statistic driven and all people care about is getting a conviction,” Canny said. “It’s easier to get a conviction against some guy who doesn’t have a ton of money, a ton of resources and a ton of power than against the powers that be who know this stuff is going on and tacitly allow it to continue.” The same applies in the court of the N.C.A.A., which now uses court testimony to aid its investigations. In the wake of the indictments, it formed a college basketball commission headed by the former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and the N.C.A.A.’s president, Mark Emmert, promised decisive action. “This is not a time for half-measures or incremental change,” Emmert declared when the commission was formed in 2017. But 18 months later, it is hard to see what has changed. Two Auburn players, whose family members were accused of receiving money, were suspended last season, and a Kansas player was suspended this season. No head coaches other than Pitino have been removed, and no colleges have been penalized. But last week, the N.C.A.A. did come down on Cal Poly San Luis Obispo for violating rules, placing it on two years’ probation and demanding it vacate the university’s only N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament berth. Its crime? Giving athletes too much money — in one case, $5 over the limit — for books.",The New York Times
2019,Who’s the Daddy? Neither Twin Would Say. But They Both Will Pay.,"RIO DE JANEIRO — The judge was stumped. He had ordered a pair of identical twins to take DNA tests in a paternity case in the central Brazilian state of Goiás. Both came back positive. Neither man would say who fathered the girl at issue. Her mother had turned to the courts seeking financial support for the child, who was born after a casual fling. The woman said she could not say for sure which of the two men she had slept with. So Judge Filipe Luis Peruca opted to punish both twins. In a ruling made public on Monday, he chided the men for acting in “bad faith” and ordered that each pay child support for the girl, who is now 9. The mother, whose name is redacted in court documents, initially sought financial help from just one of the twins, whose identities were also not disclosed. When a DNA test came back positive, that man denied being the child’s father. The court then ordered that his twin brother undergo a test. When that test also came back positive, neither man would acknowledge being the father. Judge Peruca, who is based in Cachoeira Alta, a small municipality in an area where cattle farms are the dominant industry, wrote in his decision that the men’s conduct was in keeping with a long pattern of deceit. “It’s evident that the defendants, from adolescence, took advantage — and continue to take advantage! — of the fact that they are identical twins,” he wrote in the ruling. “It became clear that they used each other’s name to attract as many women as possible and to hide instances of betrayal in their relationships.” The judge ordered that the names of both men be added to the child’s birth certificate. He also ordered each man to pay the woman 30 percent of a minimum wage in Brazil, and they must collectively cover 50 percent of the child’s school and medical expenses.",The New York Times
2019,Who’s the Jeb of the 2020 Race?,"On Politics With Lisa Lerer Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Matt Flegenheimer, your temporary host. Lisa Lerer is on vacation, beach-reading Mueller report footnotes. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] On paper, I’d hit the candidate jackpot. It was 2015 — many months before President Trump had won a single vote — and my campaign assignment couldn’t be beat: I would be covering the front-runner. The juggernaut. The one whose name they’d chant at the convention hall. Ladies and gentlemen, the 45th president of the United States … So, plans change. But a funny thing has been happening lately in conversations with people close to the 2020 race: Jeb Bush is on the brain again. Not because he’s running, a prospect with the approximate likelihood of a third term for Grover Cleveland. But because those who are running may have more in common with Mr. Bush than they’d care to admit. Across the Democratic primary field, candidates hoping to avoid his fate — high hopes, “low energy,” hard fall — are finding themselves in familiar political minefields, even if they’d rarely agree with Mr. Bush on policy. The most conspicuous parallel is Joe Biden, who is expected to enter the race this week as a Jeb-style early favorite, carrying high name identification, uncertain base-voter enthusiasm and heaps of baggage into a political moment that may have passed him by. But there are also less intuitive comparisons. Like Mr. Bush in his race, Elizabeth Warren is the clear leader on policy in her primary, churning out proposals but struggling to gain traction in early polls. She is also spending heavily on staff, as Mr. Bush did, outpacing any other campaign despite her middling fund-raising numbers. (Mr. Bush ultimately needed to slash salaries and headquarters staff.) When I noticed a T-shirt available on her website recently — “Warren Has a Plan For That,” it reads — I flashed immediately to one of Mr. Bush’s particularly ill-fated slogans: “Jeb Can Fix It.” Then again, maybe Beto O’Rourke is the cleaner analogy — another son of a politician who has faced skepticism for his privileged rise and was coaxed into the presidential contest not by any signature ideological cause but because, in Mr. O’Rourke’s words, he was “born to be in it.” (Of course, the silver spoon critique applies more credibly to Mr. Bush, who shares a surname with two presidents, than to the child of a former El Paso County commissioner.) For more moderate figures in the Democratic field, like John Hickenlooper or Amy Klobuchar, Mr. Bush’s inadvertently prescient warning about the political perils of centrism could also prove relevant. Before entering the 2016 race, Mr. Bush suggested that the eventual Republican nominee would need to avoid being pulled to the partisan extreme to remain palatable to a mass audience — to be willing, he said, “to lose the primary to win the general.” Mr. Bush aced the first step. Seeking a preliminary ruling on who suffers most from potentially elevated levels of Jeb-ness, we turned to Matt Gorman, a veteran Republican operative who worked on Mr. Bush’s campaign. He said he had identified Jeb-size red flags for two contenders in particular: Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren. “With Biden, you’re having to rehash a lot of issues that the party might have moved past,” Mr. Gorman said, comparing this weakness to Mr. Bush’s challenge as an elected official with a long record to defend (and, in Mr. Bush’s case, a brother’s to answer for, too). “With Warren and Jeb, both of them were presiding over big transformations of their party,” Mr. Gorman continued. “When Jeb came to power in 1998, he was a conservative revolutionary. Warren, in that same vein when she came in in ’12, was ushering in a wave of really liberal orthodoxy. All of a sudden, people drifted into her lane.” But Mr. Gorman noted one significant caveat this time: It is highly unlikely that any Democrat will torment his intraparty competitors as Mr. Trump did — taunting Mr. Bush’s family, belittling Marco Rubio, suggesting Ted Cruz was ineligible for the presidency because of his birthplace. “That does work in their favor,” Mr. Gorman said. “Bernie’s not going to say Elizabeth Warren was born in Canada.” [Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox.] ____________________ Drop us a line!

So it was with considerable pleasure that I stumbled on a new one Monday, courtesy of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. The Granite State Poll, which included 241 likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire, showed that Bernie Sanders has widened his lead over Joe Biden. In Monday’s poll, Mr. Sanders procured 30 percent of the vote, compared with 26 percent in a similar February poll; Mr. Biden, who has begun accepting financial donations for a 2020 presidential campaign, fell to 18 percent, compared with 22 percent in February. The survey, conducted between April 10 and April 18, also showed that interest in Pete Buttigieg continues to rise. Fifteen percent of voters said they would support him, up from 1 percent in the February poll. (Mr. Buttigieg pulled in the support of 9 percent of likely Iowa caucusgoers in a poll conducted by Monmouth University earlier this month.) The New Hampshire poll showed Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker next at 5, 4 and 3 percent, respectively, in what has separated into a second tier. Beto O’Rourke also got 3 percent, Amy Klobuchar 2 percent, and Kirsten Gillibrand 1 percent. One other interesting thing to note: The poll found that Democratic voters are showing a great deal more interest in this presidential primary than they did in the last cycle. About 55 percent of Democrats reported being “extremely interested” in the 2020 race, compared with only 34 percent who expressed those sentiments in May 2015.

2019,Why Are There Religious Exemptions for Vaccines?,"Big City This week the City of New York declared a public health emergency because of a measles outbreak that had been escalating since the fall in ultra-Orthodox communities in Brooklyn and finally reached the point of crisis. In December the Health Department had made an effort to contain the disease, ordering yeshivas and child care centers in affected neighborhoods to keep all unvaccinated children from going to school or day care. Then, in January, at least one yeshiva in Williamsburg ignored the mandate. This failure of compliance led to an eruption of dozens of new cases. Like well-off bohemians who might send their children to Waldorf schools, where an anti-vaccination culture is baked in the warm ovens of so many sprouted-wheat snacks, many among the ultra-Orthodox resist the incursions of modernity. A distrust of immunization had long ago taken hold in some sectors of the Hasidic community, but this year various religious neighborhoods in Brooklyn were hit with a propaganda campaign meant to breed even more skepticism and fear. As it happens, 2019 is turning out to be a record year for measles outbreaks, with 465 cases reported in 19 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A vast majority of these have occurred in Brooklyn and in counties in upstate New York and New Jersey with substantial ultra-Orthodox populations. Approximately 115 cases, though, have been discovered in Michigan and Washington, among the 17 states in the country where it is possible to seek a “personal belief” exemption from otherwise mandatory vaccines for school-aged children, meaning that immunization essentially violates your parenting philosophy as if it were Fortnite or a bag of Cool Ranch Doritos. Where there are no such vague clauses in vaccination law, there are typically exemptions available to those who claim that they oppose vaccination on religious grounds; 47 states have these, including New York. They are problematic for a number of reasons. First, there is virtually no canonical basis for vaccine avoidance among the world’s major religions, most of which came into being before Edward Jenner developed the first widely used vaccine, against smallpox, at the end of the 18th century. Rabbis since then have repeatedly stressed the importance of protecting children through vaccination. Regardless, religious waivers provide cover to those who resist vaccines simply because they chose to question established science. Last month, for example, when the Rockland County Health Department in upstate New York was sued by parents of unvaccinated children at a local Waldorf school who were barred from attending during a measles outbreak in the area — Rockland County is also home to a large ultra-Orthodox community — the district attorney, Thomas Humbach, pointed out these dubious religious objections. At the time he said that he expected several of the exemptions granted at the school to be challenged as insincere. A few years ago after a measles outbreak linked to Disneyland, California got rid of its belief exemptions, leaving no parent able to excuse a child from certain shots because of hippie misconceptions or arguments about religious necessity. In November a study looking at the effects of the legislation found immunization rates of children entering kindergarten in California to have reached a near all-time high. And yet despite that, there is not overwhelming political will to implement similar legislation elsewhere. Although there is a bill in the New York State Legislature right now that if passed would end religious exemptions for vaccines, it became clear what it was up against this week. As soon as Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the city would issue violations and possibly fines to individuals living in certain parts of Brooklyn who refused to vaccinate, Gov. Andrew Cuomo weighed in to say that he found the move “legally questionable.” Ultra-Orthodox communities provide a voting bloc just as reliable as evangelical Christians, who in some cases also question the wisdom of immunizing children. Last month, Rand Paul, the Republican senator from Kentucky, himself a physician, criticized mandatory vaccines as “not consistent with the American story.” And yet the Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled such mandates to be constitutional. Certainly an opposition to vaccines is quite consistent with the American story, however. In 1855, Massachusetts became the first state in the country to make smallpox vaccination mandatory for public schoolchildren. By the early 1890s, a pamphlet titled “Vaccination Is the Curse of Childhood” was circulating in Boston, advising parents to find doctors who would proclaim that their children were “unfit for vaccination.” Around the country, parents were faking vaccine scars or keeping their children from school or wiping vaccines from their arms as soon as they were administered. These parents, not unlike parents fighting vaccination efforts today, were responding to a time of dramatic change in industry and technology. They weren’t bound to God; they were scared of the revolution.",The New York Times
2019,Why Are There So Many Books About Dogs?,"Essay “What would the world be like without music or rivers or the green and tender grass?” the poet Mary Oliver asks in her book “Dog Songs.” “What would this world be like without dogs?” A world without dogs is impossible to imagine. Our relationship with them predates the written word, agriculture and civilization. They were our hunting buddies, bed warmers and, sometimes, if not much else was around, our dinner. As dogs crept into our homes, surfing kitchen counters and sleeping on the sofa, our focus was practical: managing the animal with which 60 million American households share space. (That’s about 13 million more households than the number cohabitating with the next most popular pet — cats.) Until surprisingly recently, most dog books were assiduously pragmatic: how to choose them, train them and care for them. But the new millennium is different. “Marley & Me,” the 2005 mega-best seller by John Grogan, marked a subtle but important shift in how we think about dogs. It begins as a hilarious account of dog ownership in the 1990s. How do you get a large, muscled carnivore to sit nicely at a restaurant, remain tranquil during thunderstorms and not poop on the beach? But by the end of the book, Grogan is almost entirely concerned with his Labrador Marley’s interior life — the way he thinks, feels and apprehends the world. “I dropped my forehead against his and sat there for a long time, as if I could telegraph a message through our two skulls, from my brain to his.” This somersault into Marley’s mental landscape involves what researchers call “theory of mind”: your thoughts, feelings and beliefs about the thoughts, feelings and beliefs of others. Theory of mind is at the root of some of our most profound experiences. Take love, for instance. It’s just an abstraction unless you are able to wonder, Does she love me too? What did he mean when he looked at me that way? Will she miss me when I’m gone? Since 2000, books exploring dog minds have proliferated at an astonishing rate. Currently more than 70,000 dog books are listed on Amazon, including dozens of novels, many of them best-selling tear-jerkers, such as “The Art of Racing in the Rain” (2008), by Garth Stein, narrated by Enzo, an unfailingly wise and loyal Lab mix, and “A Dog’s Purpose” (2010), by W. Bruce Cameron, a tale also told by a dog — one that undergoes repeated incarnations as it arrives in a human’s life and dispenses important lessons. The dog mind is also an increasingly prominent feature of literary fiction, from “The Door,” by the Hungarian writer Magda Szabo (published in English to acclaim in 2015), featuring, among other characters, a dog that is, as Claire Messud put it in her review for the Book Review, “as vivid and fully realized a character as any human, a truly great literary dog”; to “The Friend” (2018), by Sigrid Nunez, in which a woman develops a quasi-romantic relationship with a dead friend’s Great Dane. (Nunez’s book won last year’s National Book Award for fiction.) Now there’s even a thoughtful political book in the form of a human-canine mind-meld: “Don’t Label Me,” by Irshad Manji, a writer and activist, which unfolds as a conversation between the author and her dog, Lily, about divisive social issues like identity, diversity and religious politics. (“To do diversity honestly, we can’t be labeling all of diversity’s critics as bigots,” Manji tells her dog. “You disagree, Lil? You’re entitled to your opinion but you haven’t let me explain mine.”) The spate of dog mind-focused books raises the question: After at least 14,000 years of living with dogs, why are we only now getting around to considering what goes on inside their heads? There are many possible explanations, but one is that in the last two decades science has discovered more about dog cognition than in the previous two centuries combined. From 1900 to 1999, most cognitive researchers dismissed dogs as uninteresting because they believed domestication had led to a hopeless dependence on humans. In 1931, the naturalist Frances Pitt scoffed that dogs lacked intelligence because “the rigorous tests imposed by nature, including that of ability to get a living, have been eliminated by human protection.” In 1971, the veterinarian Michael Fox went so far as to call dogs “Canis over-familiaris,” arguing that domestication had resulted in “psychosomatic symptoms such as depression and anorexia nervosa, asthma, diarrhea, convulsions or paralysis of the hind limbs.” In the 1950s, cognitive experiments began to show the sophistication of animal intelligence. By the 1980s, a study found that dolphins could mimic computer sounds, then use these new sounds to label real-world objects. Pigeons could categorize objects from two-dimensional photographs. And, of course, our relatives the great apes were found to be so mentally dexterous that their skills bordered on humans’. But when it came to dogs, the loudest message was overwhelmingly static. There is almost nothing about dogs in the cognitive literature from the 1950s all the way to 2000. Then, suddenly, there was an explosion in the field of dog cognition, spanning the fields of psychology, anthropology and neuroscience. The psychologist Alexandra Horowitz’s “Inside of a Dog” (2009) was a landmark, providing crucial insights into how a dog experiences the world. Imagine being four feet closer to the ground, relying on smell at least as much as sight and picking up on every conscious or unconscious gesture of the person you love most. Horowitz manages to answer burning questions without being fanciful; from the point of view of a dog, she writes, “a rose is undistinguished from the rest of the plant matter surrounding it — unless it has been urinated upon by another dog.” Horowitz’s book was followed by Gregory Berns’s “How Dogs Love Us” (2013), about his remarkable experiments involving his terrier mix, in which he trained her and other dogs to lie perfectly still in an MRI machine. Several months, and many sausages, later, Berns had the world’s first brain scans of conscious dogs. He discovered that the reward centers in their brains responded to praise just as much as to food — and, more surprisingly, some dogs preferred praise. Berns also found that dogs have a dedicated area in their brains for recognizing human faces, a skill cats, for example, are generally less good at. John Pilley, a retired psychologist, turned the field of developmental psychology upside down with his book “Chaser” (2013), about his Border collie, who not only knew 1,000 words but learned them using a technique called fast mapping, something thought possible only by children. And the ethologist Frans de Waal, in his brand-new “Mama’s Last Hug: Animal Emotions and What They Tell Us About Ourselves,” argues that dogs have a well-developed sense of fairness and other moral values. When pairs of dogs at the Clever Dog Lab in Vienna were asked to lift a paw to a human experimenter without receiving a reward, they readily complied. But if one of the pair was rewarded with a piece of bread, the other dog lost interest in the game and refused to play. De Waal likens such behavior to that of young children, “when one of them gets a smaller pizza slice than his sibling (yelling ‘That’s not fair!’).” De Waal elaborated on the idea in a recent opinion piece for The Times, recounting how Bully, a dog belonging to the legendary animal behaviorist Konrad Lorenz, once bit Lorenz’s hand as Lorenz tried to break up a dogfight. “Even though Dr. Lorenz petted him right away,” de Waal wrote, “Bully suffered a complete nervous breakdown. For days, he was virtually paralyzed and ignored his food. … He had violated a natural taboo, which among ancestral canines could have had the worst imaginable consequences, such as expulsion from the pack.” The shift in how we see our dogs is not unprecedented. When it comes to the beings with whom we cohabitate, we have a history of changing our attitudes. The way we once regarded dogs — not the cleanest creatures but useful to have around — is the way we once regarded children. In early-18th-century Europe, children were born to work. Parents had large numbers of them not just because birth control was generally unavailable but because parents needed help, and understood that not all of their offspring were likely to survive infancy. Those that did were sent off to coal mines, factories and up chimneys — or to live with relatives in need of a servant. By the 19th century, more children survived to adulthood, and more were spared the work force. Parents began to regard their children not as potential labor but as emblems of purity and innocence to be protected and loved. As the 19th century was for human children, the 21st century is for the dog. Most dogs are no longer required to work long hours. Most are not required to do anything at all, except love us. And this they do very well.",The New York Times
2019,Why Are We Feeling So Bad When Life Is So Good? Two Books Want Us to Accentuate the Positive,"Nonfiction THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY How Reason and Moral Purpose Made the West Great By Ben Shapiro CLEAR AND PRESENT SAFETY The World Has Never Been Better and Why That Matters to Americans By Michael A. Cohen and Micah Zenko Why, exactly, are so many Americans so angry and unhappy? Almost any other country today, and any prior version of the United States, would give its eyeteeth to enjoy our manifold blessings. The country is prosperous and at peace; it faces rivals and nuisances but no major threat. The government acted decisively and capably to crush jihadist terrorism and avert a global depression. Innovation is galloping, crime is down, kids are behaving, and — the ultimate gift — Americans live almost a decade longer than as recently as 1960. President Obama was just plain right when he wrote, in 2016: “If you had to choose any time in the course of human history to be alive, you’d choose this one. Right here in America, right now.” Yet, right here in America, populist rage and illiberal backlash are seizing the day. Why? Two new books approach the question, one of them constructively, the other not so much. “The Right Side of History” looks to the politics of meaning; “Clear and Present Safety,” the politics of fear. Remember the politics of meaning? That was the theme of a speech given by Hillary Clinton in April 1993, when she was the first lady. “All of us face a crisis of meaning,” she said. “We need a new definition of civil society which answers the unanswerable questions posed by both the market forces and the governmental ones.” Conservatives (and some liberals) made merciless sport of that speech. No one in those end-of-history days was in the mood to listen. Well, they are listening now. Competition, consumerism and globalization worked out much better for some people than others, and the others, who saw their incomes stagnate, their dignified livelihoods evaporate and their communities wither, decided not to go quietly into that good night. In response, some of the best minds on the right are rethinking Reaganism and grappling with the need to humanize neoliberalism. Into this conversation steps Ben Shapiro with “The Right Side of History.” A conservative writer and speaker whose previous books include “Bullies: How the Left’s Culture of Fear and Intimidation Silences Americans” and “Brainwashed: How Universities Indoctrinate America’s Youth,” Shapiro begins by saying that we live “in the best world that has ever existed.” Yet Americans are losing faith in their democracy and institutions. What changed? In a few introductory paragraphs, he dismisses economics, racial tensions and tribalism as inadequate answers. Instead, “we’ve spent the last two centuries carving ourselves off from the roots of our civilization.” Beginning with the Jewish Bible and ancient Greece, he argues that Western civilization succeeded because it balanced the anchoring moral foundations of its Judeo-Christian heritage with the revolutionary dynamism of Enlightenment liberalism. In the past couple of centuries, however, secularism has gone all-in on individualism and materialism. “Material human progress in the absence of spiritual fulfillment isn’t enough,” he writes. “People need meaning.” Mrs. Clinton, call your office. Shapiro’s spiritual challenge to secularism is not new. In fact, it is venerable. As the liberal tradition’s most astute contemporary defender, Peter Berkowitz, often points out, the charge that liberal individualism is self-destructively materialistic is itself an important strand of the liberal tradition. Today and in the recent past, its many facets have been explored and debated by some of the right’s leading minds: David Brooks, Arthur C. Brooks, Patrick J. Deneen, Yuval Levin, Alasdair MacIntyre, Richard John Neuhaus, Michael Novak and the three most recent popes, to name just a few. Shapiro’s argument claims a distinguished pedigree. Why, then, did I find his book so dispiriting? Partly because, instead of contending with great ideas, it deploys them as if they were toy soldiers or characters in a video game. The head spins as he trots past thinkers from Plato to Steven Pinker, frequently rendering tendentious judgments along the way. In one typical four-page passage, we carom past Marx, Clausewitz, Fichte and Hegel. Most of the name-checked play either the role of tradition-upholding good guys or relativistic, secular bad guys. Hume leads briskly to Darwin, then Nietzsche, then eugenics and fascism and existentialism and postmodernism and intersectionality, and here we are, kowtowing to the “knowing falsehood” of transgenderism. Although I am sympathetic with elements of the author’s case, his galloping reductionism left me enervated and wishing his short book were even shorter. But one section is too short. If Western civilization hangs in the balance, how do we save it? In a concluding chapter of only eight pages, Shapiro urges that children be taught that life has purpose, that they have agency, that our civilization is unique and that we are all brothers and sisters. In this way, with “boldness” and “sacrifice,” parents will “make warriors of our own children,” training them as “defenders of the only civilization worth fighting for.” Pondering Shapiro’s call for fresh recruits in a never-ending culture war, I found myself wondering what sort of book he might have written had he sought out and contended with the real-world puzzles and contradictions and trade-offs that would complicate his story line, as David Brooks and Timothy P. Carney and Oren Cass and James and Deborah Fallows and George Packer and J. D. Vance, among others, have done. May we hope that someday Shapiro will leaven his combativeness with curiosity? “Clear and Present Safety” is less ambitious and more constructive. Michael A. Cohen and Micah Zenko, who are columnists for The Boston Globe and Foreign Policy magazine, respectively, write that “Americans live in a world that is safer and freer than ever before in human history — and it is not even close.” Yet “most Americans are simply unaware of the extraordinary and unprecedented political, economic and social progress that has taken place in virtually every corner of the globe over the past three decades.” The closest thing America has to a national ideology today may be neurotic safetyism, the doctrine that the country’s children and college students and homeland are fragile and besieged by danger. Leaving helicopter parenting and campus safe spaces to others, the authors focus on the exaggerated fear of foreign threats and terrorism. “The American public is being fed, by politicians and pundits alike, a steady diet of threat inflation that has made them deeply fearful of the world outside their borders,” they write. Fearmongering builds power for politicians and pundits, profits for media companies and defense contractors and publicity for social activists and reformers. The harms include swollen defense budgets, counterproductive military interventions, wasted resources (think: border wall) and demagoguery’s toll on democracy itself. This argument, too, is not new. In his book “Overblown: How Politicians and the Terrorism Industry Inflate National Security Threats, and Why We Believe Them,” John Mueller, of Ohio State University, has written indispensably about threat inflation, and so have others. But Cohen and Zenko march through the evidence commandingly and comprehensively; and their case has never been more apt and important than it is right now, when a professional fearmonger leads the country. Recall President Trump’s Inaugural Address, with its theme of “American carnage.” Or his first speech to a joint session of Congress, when he lied point-blank about immigrant terrorism. Or any of a thousand other examples. Next time you hear the words “existential threat” from a politician, hide the silver. The greater threat to American safety is demagogic safetyism, or, as another American president said in much harder times, fear itself. OpinionMicah Zenko OpinionMichael A. Cohen",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Why Can’t I Get the Wine I Want for Passover?,"I’ll have to make it myself. Ms. Feiring publishes The Feiring Line, the natural wine newsletter. Like many of her generation, my mother, Ethel, never outgrew Manischewitz. That liquefied grape jelly was our house wine, and she served it every week on the Sabbath and on every holiday. Even after I stopped observing Sabbath rules myself, and made my professional life in wine, my mother could never quite grasp my desperation to find something palatable for Passover. Each year, I’d plunk down way too much money, hopes high, expectations low, ferrying the rabbi-approved bottles over to Mom’s apartment in Long Beach. Somewhere around the second cup, Ethel would ask, “You know what this needs?” and mix some of her sweet Concord with the $35 kosher Burgundy I’d brought. I was brought up in a kosher and fairly observant household, and attended 12 years of religious school. I was raised to go to the women’s college at Yeshiva University, not Stony Brook, and I certainly wasn’t supposed become a wine writer. But I did both of those things. And almost 20 years ago, I dedicated myself to the cause of natural wine: organic viticulture with none of the more than 70 legal additives — things like yeast, bacteria, tannin, acid, anti-foaming agents and wood chips — that may be present in most wines, kosher or otherwise. The secular bottles I drink are mostly made from one ingredient: grapes. Natural wine is unpredictable. It boasts a huge variation in flavors. The winemaker’s goal is to translate the place the grapes come from into the glass, and each bottle carries an imprint of what happened the year it was made. These wines bear no resemblance to conventional or kosher wines that often follow a cookie-cutter path, full of additives to get them there. Those wines are not ones I want to sip at the holiday or any table. Not long ago, Pope Francis declared that only my kind of wine is fit for the Eucharist. Which leads to the fifth question of my Passover celebration: Why, on this night, am I unable to find any kosher natural wines? Well, I should say that there are two worthy options, both made in minute amounts: Harkham from Australia and Camuna in Berkeley, Calif. There should be more. Before World War II, before the boom in the use of additives, most wines were natural or natural enough. Jewish winemakers and vineyard owners produced kosher wine, most famously in Hungary, where winemaking families like the Zimmermanns flourished. The Holocaust destroyed that heritage. My Yiddish-speaking grandfather, who was born in Ukraine in the 19th century, did remember this natural wine tradition. He made wine in our basement. One of my earliest memories of Pop, who taught me to smell everything before I drank it, was his despairing over a batch of his wine that had turned to vinegar. When it worked though, it was delicious. Kosher isn’t about being blessed; it’s about being watched and being handled only by Sabbath observers from ferment to corkscrew — a rule that was an attempt to protect against wine being used for idolatry. There is one workaround: boiling. Such wines are labeled “mevushal” and a pagan (or even a lapsed yeshiva girl like me) can serve any kosher wine that has been boiled, flash-pasteurized or made from heated grapes, to anyone, even the very religious. While modern methods for this technique are far kinder, hot grapes do not make the best wine and prevent natural ferments. That means adding yeasts and nutrients. Anyone who cares about wine will opt for a cocktail instead at religious weddings. But at Passover, it’s wine you need, and at my mother’s table it needs to be kosher. That’s why last year I tried to make my own: traditional, authentic, kosher and natural. This was a deeply personal project. That is, I understood that not that many other people are in the market for natural kosher wine, yet. After all, how can you know what you’re missing if it doesn’t exist? “No one cares and no one knows what they want because they don’t have the exposure,” David Raccah, who writes the blog Kosher Wine Musings and drinks only kosher, told me. It was also an expensive and logistically difficult endeavor. Kosher certification can cost up to $10,000 a year. I set out to make my wine in the country of Georgia, since I have written about winemaking there and I knew I could get affordable grapes and work space. I had a religious friend of a friend lined up to handle the wine for me and take my instruction. All I had to do was figure out how to pay for the kosher certification and deal with the bureaucracy. It wasn’t easy to reach the rabbi in Tbilisi. He was in constant demand, always rushing out to Kutaisi for a bris or to Bagdati for a wedding. Finally, I got him over Skype. After a long treatise on the religious laws and why I, a now-secular Jewish natural wine lover, would never be able to make my wine, we were disconnected. I called back. Friends in Tbilisi tried to reach him. The harvest of 2018 came and went. His dismissiveness just made me want to do it even more. Making wine is risky. You need the right soil blessed with the right climate. You need talent. And without additives, you need knowledge and a little luck. I have a plan in place and another rabbi lined up for this year. I’m determined to make something that Ethel and her friends can enjoy. Do we ever outgrow our desire for a parent’s understanding? Even if there was another decade left, my mother will never quite understand or accept my rejection of religious life. But if she understands why I devoted decades of my life to writing about this magical, enduring symbol of life, culture and humanity, that would suit me even better. But to do that, she needs to be able to drink it.

2019,Why Did New York’s Most Selective Public High School Admit Only 7 Black Students?,"transcript transcript Listen and subscribe to our podcast from your mobile device: Via Apple Podcasts | Via RadioPublic | Via Stitcher Nearly 900 students have been offered admission to one of New York City’s most elite public high schools. Only seven of those students are black. [For an exclusive look at how the biggest stories on “The Daily” podcast come together, subscribe to our newsletter. Read the latest edition here.] On today’s episode: Eliza Shapiro, who covers New York City education for The New York Times. Background reading: Only a tiny number of black students were offered admission this year to New York City’s specialized high schools, despite Mayor Bill de Blasio’s vow to diversify them. “It wasn’t shock that I felt, it was the same wave of disappointment I feel every time I look at the demographics of this school.” Black and Hispanic students at Stuyvesant High School told our colleague how they felt about the admissions statistics. New York City is far more racially diverse than it was 50 years ago. But its public schools are among the most segregated in the nation. Tune in, and tell us what you think.

2019,Opinion | Why Did Nonbelievers Grieve for Notre-Dame?,"Religion goes on, whether or not people honor its traditions. Mr. Caldwell is the author of “Reflections on the Revolution in Europe: Immigration, Islam, and the West.” Since the Cathedral of Notre-Dame caught fire at the start of Holy Week, certain Parisians and their well-wishers have been buffeted by emotions they are unused to. They have found themselves passionately involved with the fate of a church. Monday evening, as the flames still raged, the Rev. Jean-Marc Fournier, the priest who is chaplain to the Paris fire department, rushed into the cathedral and rescued the crown of thorns said to have been worn by Jesus at the crucifixion. He and his colleagues recovered a tunic that belonged to Louis IX, the sainted crusader who brought the crown back from the Holy Land. Soon Father Fournier was being called a hero by institutions not intimately tied to Catholic belief, such as the radio network Europe 1 and BuzzFeed. Meanwhile, young people congregated on the banks of the Seine, some weeping. Certain of them sang and prayed; the progressive-leaning German daily Die Tageszeitung referred to them as pilgrims. Others appeared to be tourists and bystanders, seemingly surprised by the intensity of their own feelings. It brought to mind Philip Larkin’s poem “Church Going,” which evokes people “gravitating” by instinct to a disused church after religious doctrine has died out. “Tears were flowing down every cheek in France,” wrote the politician Philippe de Villiers, without much exaggeration, “even the most manly, and even the most secular.” One could be forgiven for asking: Why? For centuries French people revered their cathedrals, priests and relics. But they haven’t always: After the French Revolution, Notre-Dame was used as a warehouse. And they haven’t lately: Just 6 percent go to Mass, down from 35 percent half a century ago. Is there a latent Catholicism in France that we failed to see? Or are these only expressions of inchoate religious impulses? Certainly people have such impulses. The Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci, who raged against Muslim immigration to Europe at the turn of the century, believed she did so as a proud atheist. Yet oddly her most passionate complaint was that camping migrants had “profaned” the area in front of the Duomo, the cathedral of her native Florence, and had “profaned” the Baptistery across the street as well. Certainly, too, the continuing relevance of Catholicism to French life has been underestimated. On Monday, President Emmanuel Macron stood before the still-burning cathedral, with fire trucks shooting jets of water against the night sky behind him. Before he consoled Parisians or French citizens, he said, “Tonight my thoughts, obviously, before anything else, are with Catholics, the Catholics of France and those across the world, especially during this Holy Week.” These Catholics, once thought a spent force in French politics, have flexed their political muscle lately, notably in their unexpectedly large protests in 2012 and 2013 against the legalization of gay marriage. But there is scant evidence that French people have been returning to Catholicism. The pollster Jérôme Fourquet argues in his book “L’archipel français” (“The French Archipelago”), published last month, that in matters of religion the country is undergoing an “anthropological shift.” As in the United States, the size of the still-religious generation born after World War II long disguised the decline. Today, as that generation ages and dies, a demographic trapdoor opens under the religious population. There are fewer than half as many French parish priests today as in 1992. Since the 1970s, Mr. Fourquet notes, the percentage of those who wish to be buried when they die, as the church prefers, has halved (from 53 to 27), while the percentage who wish to be cremated has more than doubled. Marie, the given name of 20 percent of newborn girls at the turn of the 20th century and of almost 10 percent when today’s 80-year-olds were born, is today practically extinct among young people. Perhaps these French ex-Catholics, while sadly cut loose from their cultural and religious moorings, have gained access to a compensating sophistication? Au contraire. The alternative to Christianity, Mr. Fourquet shows in his book, has not been lucidity; it has been gaga conspiracy-theorizing. A third of French people 18 to 24 years old believe that airplane contrails have been seeded with hazardous chemicals and that the United States military can provoke storms, versus only 7 or 8 percent of those over 65 who believe such things. The decline of religion does not seem to have grounded people in something more true. That is partly why the fire at Notre-Dame shook so many to the core. Objects and traditions bound up with religious belief lend a feeling of sense and stability. For believers they are a reinforcement. For nonbelievers they are a substitute. Notre-Dame is perhaps the greatest such object in Europe. It is a consoling relic, as surely as the crown of thorns that Father Fournier rescued, and this is so for believers and nonbelievers alike. The cathedrals, for all their sacred origins, call to mind a worldly folk saying: The first half of your life, you work for your name; the second half of your life, your name works for you. Over centuries France constructed its monuments. Now monuments construct France. What would it be without them? The bitter truth is that these old things are what is most impressive and special about France, partly because they have been “consecrated” by age but also because they embody realities that many people regret being cut off from. The fire at Notre-Dame is harrowing in a way that feels religious because it is religious: It forces us to understand France as those who created it understood it. The people weeping on the banks of the Seine must have sensed this, even if they could not put into words exactly what they were weeping over.

2019,Why Did We Fight the Iraq War?,"Nonfiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. LEAP OF FAITH Hubris, Negligence, and America’s Greatest Foreign Policy Tragedy By Michael J. Mazarr The operative word in the title of “Leap of Faith: Hubris, Negligence, and America’s Greatest Foreign Policy Tragedy” is the last one: tragedy. Drawing on extensive interviews with unnamed “senior officials” as well as recently declassified documents, Michael J. Mazarr attributes the United States invasion of Iraq in 2003 to good intentions gone awry. Here is an example of “America’s worthy global ambitions” that went “terribly wrong.” Yet the evidence Mazarr himself assembles refutes that conclusion. Chalking up the debacle of Iraq to “the messianic tradition in American foreign policy,” as he does, simply won’t wash. It’s akin to writing off a vehicular homicide because the driver happens to be a known alcoholic. The Iraq war was not a tragedy. It was more like a crime, compounded by the stupefying incompetence of those who embarked upon a patently illegal preventive war out of a sense of panic induced by the events of 9/11. An impulse to lash out overwhelmed any inclination to deliberate, with decisions made in a “hothouse atmosphere of fear and vulnerability.” Those to whom President George W. Bush turned for advice had become essentially unhinged. Iraq presented an inviting opportunity to vent their wrath. The handful of officials who shaped policy after 9/11, writes Mazarr, a political scientist currently with RAND, were “not evil or pernicious human beings.” Instead, Mazarr credits them with acting in response to a “moralistic sense of doing the right thing.” Viewed from that perspective, “the Iraq war decision was grounded in sacred values,” even if the evil and pernicious consequences of that decision continue to mount. So Mazarr bats away what he calls “erroneous mythologies” attributing the war to a neoconservative conspiracy or describing it as a plot to protect Israel or seize Arab oil. He finds these explanations unworthy. The invasion of Iraq, he insists, stemmed from “America’s essential sense of itself” as “fundamentally messianic or missionary in character.” As an account of the war’s origins, “Leap of Faith” offers few genuine revelations. It clarifies, confirms and fills in details. So, Mazarr tells us, within 24 hours of 9/11, even before Bush had unveiled the phrase “global war on terrorism,” a decision to overthrow Saddam “had been essentially sealed in cognitive amber.” All that remained was to work out the details while conjuring up a moral rationale that would conceal the absence of a strategic one. The dearth of hard evidence connecting Saddam Hussein to Al Qaeda or confirming the existence of an Iraqi program for developing weapons of mass destruction was beside the point. The administration declared Saddam a threat; nothing more was required. Mazarr affirms that an actual decision for war was never really made but merely assumed. “There was no single meeting,” he writes, “no formal options paper, no significant debate about the consequences.” None were required. Recently, critics have lambasted President Trump for making decisions to pull out troops from Afghanistan and Syria without properly consulting the national security establishment. There’s been no process, the charge goes. During the months leading up to the invasion of Iraq, in contrast, there was process galore, an endless stream of studies, briefings and planning sessions. It’s just that none of it mattered. Bush and his chief lieutenants were dead set on a course of action and nothing was going to prevent them from plunging ahead. Process was a charade. Mazarr describes the result as “policy implementation on autopilot,” with doubters and dissenters frozen out or simply ignored. At echelons below the top level, he writes, “loyalty-enforcing groupthink” abounded. Military officers given to asking annoying questions “were particularly muzzled.” With the exception of a single four-star general who went off script by suggesting publicly that occupying Iraq might pose a stiff challenge, members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff learned to keep their mouths shut. Making matters worse was the dysfunction that prevailed at the top level. President Bush, Mazarr says, “believed in belief itself,” a tendency that obviated the need to challenge assumptions or solicit second opinions. Vice President Dick Cheney, meanwhile, created his own foreign policy shop, which pursued its own agenda. Secretary of State Colin Powell lagged two steps behind his colleagues, never quite grasping that he had been marginalized. “To demonstrate his superiority, to dominate, to overawe,” Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld blustered, accrued authority and protected his turf. Yet when it came to making tough decisions, he ducked and deferred. Rumsfeld’s deputy Paul Wolfowitz, another important figure, was “moved more by grand ideas than by the bothersome trivia of execution.” Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, was herself given to what some of her associates called “magical thinking,” and never gained the respect of Cheney or Rumsfeld. All in all, according to Mazarr, a “truly astonishing degree of wishful thinking” permeated the upper echelons of government. It was like the court of Czar Nicholas II in 1917. So while United States military commanders focused on the problem of getting to Baghdad, the question of what was to happen next became an orphan, ignored and unwanted. Rumsfeld in particular nursed the fantasy that the United States could “be liberator and hegemon at the same time” — freeing Iraqis from oppression, and then quickly converting Iraq itself into a compliant ally that would do Washington’s bidding, all with minimal muss and fuss. As a result, the disorder triggered by Saddam’s overthrow and the combined civil war and insurgency that ensued caught the war’s architects completely by surprise. For the next several years, American soldiers and Iraqi civilians were to pay a heavy price for what can only be described as malpractice on a Trumpian scale. To explain all of this in terms of a misplaced messianic impulse — the self-described indispensable nation having a bad run of luck — may play well in Washington, where serious introspection is rarely welcome. Yet, ultimately, such an explanation amounts to little more than a dodge. After all, altruism rarely if ever provides an adequate explanation for the actions of a great power. Exempting the United States from that proposition, as Mazarr does, entails its own spectacular leap of faith. The United States invaded Iraq not in response to a “vigorous missionary impulse,” but to avoid reckoning with this fact: Decades of wrongheaded policies in the Middle East had culminated on 9/11 in a cataclysmic episode of blowback. National security policies conceived from the 1940s through the 1990s, reinforced after the Cold War by false assumptions of military supremacy, had produced the inverse of security. In the formulation of those policies, America’s missionary obligations had figured as the faintest afterthought, if at all. Sadly, Mazarr’s well-intentioned book is likely to provide yet another excuse to postpone reckoning with that failure. OpinionSinan Antoon OpinionLawrence Wilkerson",The New York Times
2019,Why Do 4-Year-Olds Love Talking About Death?,"Easter may bring up dark questions from your preschooler. Here’s how to answer them. [Click here to get NYT Parenting in your inbox once a week.] When our older daughter was 4, it seemed like she was asking us about death constantly. These questions were apropos of nothing; we hadn’t had a death in the family or lost a pet. What was jarring was her matter-of-fact tone. We’d be sitting at dinner and she’d ask a barrage of questions in a completely neutral voice: “When are you going to die? Is Grandma going to die first because she’s old?” And on and on. I tried to calmly match her tone and answer her honestly, but sometimes you just want to eat your salad without contemplating your own mortality. At the time, I was slightly worried that there was something wrong with her — at best she was a proto-goth who would be really into the Cure as a teenager; and at worst, her questions meant she had some troubling anxiety that was emerging through a fixation on death. But when I started talking to other parents, I learned that their preschoolers were also asking tons of questions about death at awkward moments. A lot of parenting questions boil down to: Is this a thing, or is something wrong? So I decided to start an occasional series explaining why certain things seem to happen to your kid (or to your body or your relationships) as your child grows. For this edition, I asked three psychologists, two of whom have done research on children and their understanding of death, about why preschoolers ask a lot of questions about death, and how to best answer them. If you have a question for a future “Is this a thing?” newsletter, email me here. Why do kids start asking about death in preschool? Preschool is the age of “why” in general, said Dr. Lauren Knickerbocker, Ph.D., a child psychologist at N.Y.U. Langone’s Child Study Center. And what adults sometimes don’t realize, because we’re inured to it, is that our kids are surrounded by death all the time: Cartoon characters die, the leaves on the trees die, an ant they smushed at the playground is dead. Because they’re already so curious about the world, they see our reactions to their questions about death — our faces may blanch — and they pick up on that and want to dig deeper. What do they understand about death at 4? There are four subconcepts of death that psychologists have identified, explained Dr. Sally Beville Hunter, Ph.D., a clinical assistant professor at University of Tennessee, Knoxville: nonfunctionality (your body doesn’t work anymore), universality (all living things die), irreversibility (once you die, you can’t come back to life) and inevitability (you can’t avoid death). Though children pick up these concepts at different ages, depending on their cognitive abilities and their life experiences, at 4, the subconcept they tend to understand first is nonfunctionality, Beville Hunter said. Because it’s straightforward, many preschoolers can understand that when you’re dead, your arms and legs don’t move anymore, and your heart stops beating. “We’re all gonna die” is something that’s a bit harder for a 4-year-old (or let’s be honest, a 37-year-old) to fully internalize. But according to Beville Hunter, many kids will understand all four subconcepts somewhere in the 7-10 age range. How do I answer their many, many questions about death? Do not use euphemisms. Children in the 3-6 age range have very concrete thinking, said Dr. Dunya Poltorak, a pediatric medical psychologist in private practice in Birmingham, Mich. If you say something like, “Grandpa passed away” instead of “died,” it may confuse your child. She may think, “Did they go away somewhere? Are they on a trip? Did they pass over the border into Canada? It can just potentially risk greater confusion and lack of understanding,” said Poltorak. So use the term “died,” even if it feels harsh. Try to respond simply and clearly. Don’t brush off their questions even if they make you uncomfortable, said Poltorak. And you don’t need to get into too much detail with kids this age, said Beville Hunter. So for example, if your child asks you, “When are you going to die?” You can say, “I try to take very good care of myself and to be careful and plan to live a very long time until I’m quite old,” Poltorak suggested. If kids have follow-up questions, they will ask. If your kids are endlessly curious about death in a nonanxious way, you can take them on a tour of a cemetery, Beville Hunter suggested. It’s something she did with her own children. “We went around and read the names on the gravestones, we did etchings, we looked at the numbers and talked about the age they were when they died,” Beville Hunter said. It opens up a space for your kids to get answers to many of their pressing questions. If a kid is anxious about death, “I would assure them of safety, health and everything within your family dynamic, then I would try to redirect from there,” said Poltorak. Try classic distraction after addressing their questions clearly — let’s go paint! Or, why don’t we read a book? If a kid is really ruminating and you’re concerned because his anxiety is affecting his quality of life, talk to your pediatrician. Your child’s doctor may recommend a pediatric psychologist. “It’s always good to intervene young when children have anxiety,” Poltorak said. When you have a death in the family, Knickerbocker and Poltorak both recommend that grieving children memorialize loved ones with art projects. They emphasized the concreteness of preschoolers’ thinking, so having something to work on like a scrapbook of memories of that person is helpful. If your religious beliefs include an afterlife or resurrection like in the Easter narrative, again, try to address any questions straightforwardly. You don’t need to overexplain or answer questions that weren’t asked, said Beville Hunter. Poltorak, who is Catholic, said she talks to her children about heaven and tries to keep it light. Her father, who was very close to her children, died recently. He used to bring candy over to their house all the time, so Poltorak tells them, “Grandpa is probably up in heaven giving Jesus cavities.” P.S.

A fascinating op-ed from the Times last year takes on kids and lying. Just as it’s normal for your 4-year-old to talk about death, it’s also perfectly normal for your preschooler to lie, and it may be a (completely infuriating) sign of intelligence. Fatherly has an excellent roundup of kids’ TV shows that help explain death and dying to your small ones. My personal fave is the classic Mr. Rogers episode “Death of a Goldfish.” Maria Russo, the Times children’s book editor, recommends “The Flat Rabbit,” which she called “a quietly profound” picture book that deals with the death of a stranger straight-on.

2019,Opinion | Why Do We All Have to Be Beautiful?,"The message of inclusivity is meant to be helpful, but it can actually do harm. Ms. Nolan is a writer. London — There is a giant mirror in my hometown in Ireland. It covers one side of a building that you must walk past to get from my mother’s house to the town center. When I was a teenager, I learned to take a different route. The mirror was always sparkling clean, a burst of reflection in the middle of a dull street. It showed me, abruptly, how others saw me. With other, smaller mirrors, like those in my bedroom or the camera on my phone, I could prepare myself and decide my approach. But with the mirror on the street I saw myself as I was, plodding down the little hill without grace or charm. All at once I could see the truth so plainly. No matter how long I had spent applying makeup or adjusting my outfit or psyching myself up to go out, I was not beautiful. When I was younger, I wanted to be beautiful so badly that I could taste it, and it tasted like blood. It was a hard, painful desire. I didn’t want to be cute, or pretty. I didn’t want to be more attractive to men. I didn’t want to be sexier. I wanted only to be beautiful, and the fact that I was not beautiful hurt more, not less, for the fact that I so nearly was. What I wanted was to be undeniable, to be all clean lines, to not be debatable. I wanted to be like a drawing of a beautiful woman you might do in a game of Pictionary. I think now that I idolized beauty so much because I was often embarrassed and ashamed as a teenager and beauty seemed the opposite of embarrassment to me. To be beautiful was to have power over others. It was much more difficult to make a beautiful girl seem foolish than it was an average-looking one, I thought. Eventually I grew up, and my preoccupation, seemingly, faded. Much worse things than not being beautiful happened to me. I spent the first month of this year back home in Waterford, living with my parents because I was too broke to return to real life. I was depressed and anxious about the fact that my life keeps stalling, this time as a result of a late rent check. I was ashamed that I was relying on my parents’ food (and too much of their wine) at the age of 28. It was the longest stint I’d been back home in years — and yet what hurt me with the most acuity was the returning overwhelming awareness of my physical shortcomings, the mirror’s sharp reminder. The embarrassment I felt as a teenager about not fitting some ideal of beauty never went away. It simply hid out back there in Ireland, waiting to remind me that whatever else I am, I’ll never be that. Now, for the first time, I’m trying to understand that I don’t have to be. I’d tried to love myself as I got older, tried to look with clear eyes at my physical flaws and not just accept but admire them. I tried to believe that, actually, I was beautiful, because everyone was, not just the chosen few. I tried forcing myself to concede this, through a fake smile and gritted teeth. I’ve said it aloud, as advised by body-confidence self-help gurus, while looking at myself naked. It’s always felt absurd. What if I tried something that has always been too frightening to think about? What if I tried accepting that I will never be beautiful, and that I do not need to be? Challenging social norms about who can be beautiful is vital work, and of course it is true that representations of beauty in the media are pathetically white, thin, able-bodied and hetero, and of course this should change. But somewhere along the way, the message of inclusivity went from “every kind of person can be beautiful” to “every person is beautiful.” I’m increasingly convinced that this message isn’t only less radical than we might like to believe, but also actively harmful. Wouldn’t it be freeing to admit that most people are not beautiful? What if we stopped prioritizing pleasing aesthetics above so much else? I wonder what it would be like to grow up in a world where being beautiful is not seen as a necessity, but instead a nice thing some people are born with and some people aren’t, like a talent for swimming, or playing the piano. It has seemed to take up so much of my life, being desperate to not only be acceptable to look at, but also beautiful, exceptional, enchanting. What might I have experienced if I had not been trying to claw my way toward beauty? What things might I have thought, feelings might I have felt, if that space were freed up inside of myself? What would it have been like to pass that mirror in my hometown, and to see myself — on the way to the library, or a party with friends, or a walk in the park — and simply feel glad that I was able to do those things, that I have a body that allows me to? What would it have been like not to look at it at all? Everyone is beautiful, we’re told. But why should we have to be? Megan Nolan (@mmegannnolan) is a writer of essays, fiction and criticism.

2019,Why Does Exercise Guard Against Cancer? Inflammation May Play a Role,"Well One of the most important benefits of exercise is in how it reduces our risk of developing a number of types of cancer — especially colorectal cancer, which according to some estimates is the malignancy most influenced by physical activity. But how workouts guard against colon cancer remains largely unknown. Physical activity speeds the movement of waste through the intestines, as anyone who has had to hunt for a bathroom during a workout knows. But this does not seem to fully account for the protective effects of exercise. Instead, a small study published in February in The Journal of Physiology suggests we should also look to changes in our bloodstream after exercise. The new study began with scientists at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, and other institutions recruiting 20 men who had survived colon cancer. (Women were excluded because menstruation might have affected results.) The scientists asked 10 of the men to start working out strenuously three times a week: pedaling a stationary bicycle hard for four minutes, resting for three, and repeating that sequence three more times. They trained for a month and then, a few days after completing the program, rested quietly while researchers drew blood. The other 10 men completed the same 4 x 4 interval session, but only once. The researchers drew their blood before, immediately following and an additional two hours after that lone workout. The scientists then carefully added a tiny amount of fluid from the men’s blood to petri dishes containing human colon-cancer tumor cells often used to study cancer growth. At several points during the subsequent 72 hours, the researchers counted the numbers of cells in each dish. They soon saw substantial differences. In the dishes containing fluid taken from the men immediately after a single workout, the scientists counted far fewer cancer cells than in those awash in fluid drawn two hours after exercise. There was no similar decline in the dishes from the men who had trained for a month. In effect, something about the blood drawn immediately after the workout was slowing the growth of cancer cells. The researchers think they may have identified that something in subsequent analyses of the men’s blood. They found a large increase in molecules involved in inflammation immediately after exercise. Inflammation can slow cell growth and reproduction. So a transitory increase in inflammatory markers after exercise might be helping to jam the proliferation of tumor cells, says Tina Skinner, a physiologist who was the senior author of the study. The implications of these results are both cheering and cautionary. The changes in exercisers’ blood were potent but “transient,” Skinner says. So activities would have to be repeated to provide any continuing protection, and it remains unclear how intense or prolonged that exercise ideally would need to be, or if the effects extend equally to fighting other types of cancer. But even so, Skinner says, “We would recommend that exercise be embedded as part of standard practice for people living with and beyond cancer.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Why Does Trump Want to Debase the Fed?,"The tax cut fizzled; send in the clowns! Opinion Columnist As far as I know, the Federal Reserve — the world’s most important economic policy institution — doesn’t have an anthem. But if it were to adopt one now, the choice would be obvious: “Send In the Clowns.” You see, the Fed’s governing board currently has two vacancies, and Donald Trump has proposed filling those vacancies with ludicrous hacks. If he succeeds, one of our few remaining havens of serious, nonpartisan policymaking will be on its way toward becoming as corrupt and dysfunctional as the rest of the Trump administration. Stephen Moore and Herman Cain are, of course, completely unqualified — I say “of course” because their lack of qualifications is, paradoxically, a key qualification not just for Trump but for the G.O.P. in general. There are plenty of genuine monetary experts with conservative political leanings, some of them quite partisan. But modern Republicans have shown consistent disdain for such experts, perhaps because of a sense that anyone with real expertise or an independent reputation might occasionally be tempted to take a stand on principle. [For an even deeper look at what’s on Paul Krugman’s mind, sign up for his weekly newsletter.] There’s no risk that either Moore or Cain will ever take such a stand. In fact, what seems to have recommended both men to Trump was their evident willingness to completely reverse their policy views when politically expedient. Both were hard-money men during the Obama years, demanding higher interest rates despite very high unemployment. Both have now taken to berating the Fed for failing to print more money in the face of low unemployment — because that’s what Trump wants. That said, there’s a difference between the two men. I wrote about Moore a couple of weeks ago, noting that he has long been a prominent fixture in the conservative movement; he is, basically, a classic right-wing hack who tries (incompetently) to impersonate an economic expert. Cain, on the other hand, is a spam king whose business model involves making his email list available to direct marketers. Put it this way: In recent years Moore has been out there predicting magical results from tax cuts, putting out fake economic numbers, and giving speeches to FreedomFest. At the same time, Cain has been offering a platform for peddlers of get-rich schemes and cures for erectile dysfunction. So it says something about what Trump wants that he apparently sees the two men as equally valuable allies. What does Trump want? His attempted beclowning of the Fed follows, I’d argue, from the fact that his one major legislative success, the 2017 tax cut — which he predicted would be “rocket fuel” for the economy — has turned out to be a big fizzle, economically and, especially, politically. It’s true that U.S. economic growth got a bump for two quarters last year, and Trumpists are still pretending to believe that we’ll have great growth for a decade. But at this point last year’s growth is looking like a brief and rapidly fading sugar high. Meanwhile, the tax cut remains unpopular, partly because few people perceived personal benefits, partly because voters appear to be less concerned about paying too much than with the sense that the rich — the prime beneficiaries of the Trump cut — are paying too little. Some leaders might see such disappointments as reasons to make a course correction. But this is Trump: When the going gets tough, he blames someone else. Everything would have been great, he insists, if the Fed hadn’t thwarted his plans. There’s a good argument to be made that the Fed misjudged the economy’s strength, that it raised interest rates too fast and that the economy would be doing somewhat better if it hadn’t. In fact, it’s an argument I agree with. But that’s not what Trump is saying. He wants the Fed to act as if we were still in a deep depression; he wants it both to cut rates and to resume the emergency policies it pursued — and he denounced — when we had more than twice as much unemployment as we do today. This would, he insists, turn the economy into the “rocket ship” he originally promised. You don’t have to be a gold bug or even an inflation hawk to see these demands as deeply irresponsible. Indeed, they sound a lot like the “macroeconomic populism” that has repeatedly led to economic disaster in Latin America, with Venezuela the latest example. Running the printing presses to fight a depression, as the Fed did after the financial crisis, is prudent and sensible; running them because you refuse to accept the reality that your policies aren’t delivering an economic miracle is different, and always ends badly. Now, even putting both Moore and Cain on the Fed board probably wouldn’t be enough to push America over the monetary edge. And so far, markets don’t seem worried about the potential for runaway inflation. But maybe investors should be worried, at least a bit, by the spectacle of a president who would rather appoint hacks and debase the Fed’s integrity than admit that his policies aren’t working as promised. U.S. policymaking is looking ever more like that of a corrupt third-world regime. And that is bound, sooner or later, to have consequences.

2019,Why Don’t Americans Hold the Military Accountable for its Many Failures?,"at war Each year since the late 1990s, public surveys have found that Americans have a high confidence in the country’s armed forces, often higher than for any other American institution. This public confidence largely endured even as American plans in Afghanistan and Iraq repeatedly failed, and as thousands of men and women in uniform died and tens of thousands more were wounded in wars that did not achieve what the military and its leaders set out to do. For many people who served in these recent wars, living within the services’ stifling bureaucracies or laboring in operations or circumstances that eroded their confidence in the Pentagon and the brass, these results can feel both familiar and odd. How do the services seemingly get a pass? Is public support reflexive, a species of approval as automatic as some of the thank-you-for-your-service gestures that are a feature of life as a service member or veteran? The disconnect between public support and military performance extends beyond the failures in the wars. It’s a feature as well in how the military handles issues away from the battlefields, including, as presented this week in At War, in cases of sexual harassment and public health. On April 3, Patricia Kime wrote about the dangers of lead exposure in military service and the multiyear odyssey of Stephen Hopkins, a Special Forces veteran who suffered “crippling nausea, constant dizziness, a skyrocketing heart rate” and later “migraine symptoms, abnormal thirst and muddled thinking.” His symptoms began in 2005. Hopkins received a proper diagnosis — chronic lead exposure — in 2012, and only after he collapsed and his parents drove him to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. The military, Kime’s reporting found, has resisted wider monitoring of its members for exposure, and has not followed earlier warnings. That soldiers are exposed to lead while on the job isn’t news for the Army. A 1996 study by the Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine noted that soldiers on bases were at risk for exposure to ‘unhealthy levels of lead’ from firing ranges, battery repair, lead paint and building demolition. The center recommended fully implementing ‘existing Army policies, programs and procedures for lead-exposure reduction’ and including lead ‘as a priority pollutant in … pollution prevention programs.’ Yet Hopkins and others say they never received explicit warnings of potential lead exposure or guidance on proper range hygiene. On April 4, At War published an essay by Cristine Pedersen, a former Marine Corps cryptologist who followed her father into the service. Pedersen was raised in a Marine ethos, a climate of almost religious devotion to the corps. She completed her demanding training and volunteered for deployment, only to have her good-faith service betrayed. Pedersen was subjected to misogyny and repeated sexual harassment, and to small-unit leaders who often did not act upon her complaints. For much of her service, she withheld the sordid details from her father, worried that he too might play down her suffering or be inclined not to believe her. “My father and many Marines I served with,” Pedersen wrote, “failed to grasp both the extent of the abuses and their costs. In the summer of 2015 I let my enlistment expire, and I started college three weeks later. I felt exhausted by my career and angry that my father still felt so loyal to an institution that had repeatedly dehumanized me.” How to square this kind of deep loyalty to the armed forces and high public support with a long record of failures? Pedersen proposed an answer that aligns with the mission of At War. “You can simultaneously love an institution and recognize how it is failing. The truest form of commitment is perhaps to bring these failures to light.” Russia’s Military Mission Creep Advances to a New Front: Africa: In an influence campaign that is worrying the Pentagon, Russia’s weapons sales, military training programs and security agreements are growing across Africa. Freed From ISIS, Syrians Struggle to Rebuild Raqqa: The Syrian city was liberated from the Islamic State more than a year and a half ago, but rebuilding is slow and hope is fading. The Secret Death Toll of America’s Drones: President Trump is making it harder to know how many civilians the government kills by remote control. U.S. Troops Leaving Syria, but Some May Stay Longer Than Expected: Hundreds of the 2,000 American troops in Syria are leaving, but new plans will pause the withdrawal before reaching the 400-troop level President Trump approved. In Rare Speech to Congress, NATO Leader Says Allies Must Deter Moscow: While NATO celebrates turning 70, a squabble between Washington and Ankara over fighter jets and missile systems threatens to spoil the party. ‘In Afghanistan, We Laugh Differently’: For a handful of teenage girls, robotics offered a reprieve from their violent, patriarchal country.

2019,Why Don’t Women Get Comebacks Like Tiger Woods?,"His story is a reminder of whose transgressions can be set apart from their redemption stories. Ms. Crouse is an editor with Op-Docs who writes frequently about sports. Last Sunday, when Tiger Woods won the Masters after his long drought, it was more than just one of the most incredible comebacks in history. It showed America’s eagerness to embrace a man who persevered through years of setbacks, especially self-inflicted ones, regardless of whatever selective amnesia that requires. America does love a comeback: Achievement in sports somehow makes us more willing to compartmentalize, to forgive transgressions, to make a complicated man more deserving of public redemption. And Woods, at age 43, needed a lot of redeeming. His fall from grace started in 2009 when his wife caught him cheating with multiple women and continued through 2017 when he pleaded guilty to reckless driving. As he plotted his comeback, Woods has emerged as a unique figure — both President Barack Obama and President Trump applauded him. Mr. Trump will even award him a medal. This ability to charm so many different Americans has almost certainly aided his return to grace, while also alienating a large swath of society that sees him as inauthentic. Why aren’t there more redemption stories like this among women? It’s not just because women aren’t given second chances. It’s because they are rarely able to reach those heights in the first place. Many high-achieving people, regardless of gender, have an Icarus complex. The extreme qualities and the obsessive pursuit of success that drive their ascents can lead to their downfall. The discipline and pressure can lead to addictions, the opposite of control. Obviously we saw that in Woods; following his descent grew excruciating. But it fit the narrative. Woods understood this. Entering rehab in 2010 after accusations of infidelity, sex addiction and substance abuse, he said: “I felt that I had worked hard my entire life and deserved to enjoy all the temptations around me. I felt I was entitled.” In men, excessive qualities can be forgiven, even admired — when it works out at least. His trajectory is a reminder of who pays forever for their mistakes and whose transgressions can be set aside. Part of the problem is that so few women even reach the athletic heights of Woods, let alone stay there. Yes, we have the extraordinary Serena Williams. But can you name another female athlete on the financial and cultural level as Tiger Woods, LeBron James, Tom Brady and their peers? Of the few iconic women, sponsors and fans, to a certain degree, want them to be perfect — or at least quiet. Women’s moral behavior deeply influences our perception of their professional achievements. Consider how swiftly the Olympic runner and nine-time N.C.A.A. champion Suzy Favor Hamilton was vilified after she was caught working as an escort while coping with mental illness. Nike immediately severed ties, as did many other groups associated with her. The athletic achievements on her Wikipedia page became subsumed by stories of prostitution. “It was as if I must have murdered someone,” Favor Hamilton said recently. “Never a degree of ‘Well, perhaps something must be very much wrong.’” For Hamilton, the attraction to vice fulfilled the same thing many elite athletes get from the rush of victory in sport. “It was the buzz I felt as an athlete,” she said. “I have a history of taking things to extremes.” Most champions do. Oksana Baiul won an Olympic gold medal in figure skating for her native Ukraine in 1994, and moved to Connecticut with millions of dollars, after having slept alone in an ice rink as an impoverished orphan. A few years later, she had been charged with a D.U.I. and gone through rehab for alcohol abuse. “She appears serious about trying to turn her life around and returning to respectability,” The Times reported in 1998, noting the 17 pounds she’d lost since the previous winter, “when she was drinking and overweight and barely able to land any jump.” Spoiler: She didn’t return to competitive skating. Two great female athletes did have major comebacks. But the “setbacks” were totally different. Monica Seles was victimized by a maniacal fan who stabbed her on the court. And Serena Williams is in the midst of comeback — after having a baby. Like Woods, each of these women had physical setbacks. But neither of them made mistakes. Except Williams has surpassed her male peers and demonstrated the flip side of the extreme, confident and righteous qualities necessary to achieve success — she dared to get angry, and show it, when she opposed what she considered an unfair call at the United States Open last September. The public immediately chastised her. There was silence, and then a lot of Instagram posts about motherhood and her daughter. No women have the leeway to behave like Woods and get away with it; a black woman certainly does not. Just imagine the reaction if Serena Williams was caught cheating on her husband, Alexis Ohanian, with numerous men. There are also practical ingredients of a comeback: It requires support, both popular and financial. Nike never abandoned Woods; analysts said his win generated worth more than $22 million in exposure for the company. Women literally cannot afford to make the messy mistakes we see in the long arc of a lot of a storied male athletes’ careers, and they rarely get the payoffs. “I’m no Tiger Woods,” Hamilton told me. “There is so much money at stake with someone like him. So a company like Nike will do anything to protect him and his image.” She still had a relationship with Nike when reports of her escort work prompted the company to drop her. Now, she said, “I’m on an island trying to protect myself.” Society rarely allows women to nurture those bold qualities that drive standout success. Instead, to get ahead, women either learn to stifle those instincts, or get punished for them. This muffles the traits that might lead to failure and inevitably also the qualities that lead to success. To be sure, some men are being held accountable for their bad behavior these days. And Woods faced widespread public scorn after his philandering and reckless driving. But that evaporated last weekend when he was widely celebrated, after having been encouraged to pursue his comeback. Shouldn’t everyone be able to recover from a fall from grace? Or at the very least, shouldn’t we allow both men and women to get high enough to fall? Lindsay Crouse is a senior staff editor for Op-Docs and an athlete.

2019,Why Gabby Giffords Is Starting a Gun Control Group for Gun Owners,"“We’ve found that many gun owners are frustrated that the gun lobby claims to be speaking for them,” Ms. Giffords said in an interview about the advocacy group she formed in Minnesota. On Thursday, two days before the 20th anniversary of the mass shooting at Columbine High School, former Representative Gabrielle Giffords went to Minnesota to announce the creation of a gun safety advocacy group. The group’s agenda is predictable: It will lobby for universal background checks and an extreme risk protection law, which would allow the temporary confiscation of guns from people believed to pose an imminent threat to themselves or others. Its composition is not: The members are all gun owners. The group, Minnesota Gun Owners for Safety, is the second of its kind from Ms. Giffords’s namesake organization, which she founded after the shooting that almost killed her. (The first, in Colorado, started in January.) Ms. Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly, who is running for Senate in Arizona, own guns themselves and argue that gun ownership can coexist with significantly stricter gun laws. [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.] In an interview, conducted by email and lightly edited for length, Ms. Giffords discussed the new group and reflected on what has, and hasn’t, changed in the eight years since she was shot. Q. Gun owners have always been involved in the gun violence prevention movement in some capacity. What’s the benefit of creating formal groups specifically for them? A. When you speak up, others listen. For too long, a few very loud voices drowned out any sensible conversation on this issue. Meanwhile, gun violence increased. From my experiences in public service, I learned firsthand that change doesn’t happen until people start to demand it. Lawmakers pay attention when folks are organized around a goal. In many ways, these groups echo back to when we first launched our organization. As gun owners from a state like Arizona, we felt like our viewpoint was missing from the larger debate about gun violence. We wanted to change that by lifting up more people like us. What are you hoping to achieve with these groups? We’ve found that many gun owners are frustrated that the gun lobby claims to be speaking for them. So one important goal for us is to provide more gun owners the opportunity to share their ideas and experiences, and take action. Over time, I think you’ll start to see it bridge divides between people who might not always talk to each other. We don’t want conversations to stop on this issue. We want them to start. That will help break up the power of the gun lobby, too. The gun lobby can’t hide behind money and extremist rhetoric when gun owners are coming together to push for responsible ownership, laws that save lives and a deeper appreciation for what it means to own and use firearms. There is a big disconnect between the specific policies you’re pushing for, which are popular, and the “take your guns away” agenda that some opponents think you’re pushing for. People have been trying to bridge that gap for years, but it hasn’t gone away. What do you need to do differently? That’s what makes Minnesota Gun Owners for Safety, and groups like it, so important. I can’t think of a better way to fix that disconnect than to show how in reality, people that love to hunt or have firearms at home for protection are also in favor of improving the background check system. Or keeping guns out of the hands of domestic abusers. More and more people are responding to gun violence as a personal issue. They don’t want to see their neighbors or their family or friends get shot. People are pushing back against the false notion that any action to pass laws results in less freedom. In fact, it can bring us more. You and your husband are gun owners yourselves, yet you’re often cast as an enemy of the Second Amendment who just wants to take guns away. For years, the gun lobby motivated supporters through fear and falsehoods. But when you travel the country and actually meet people where they are at, it becomes obvious that those lies don’t work. Most people want their families and communities to be safe. What they fear most is what the country has become: a place where everyone is afraid that no place is safe. A park, a concert, a classroom, a church, an office — they could all be the site of another shooting. They don’t want this to be America’s reality any longer. Look at what’s happening to the N.R.A. Its popularity is down, its leadership is fighting and it lost many of its champions in the 2018 election. What happened? The N.R.A. shifted from an organization that actually tried to represent gun owners to a special interest group concerned with extreme politics and industry profits. When you cast the enemy as everyone who thinks differently than you, there won’t be many friends left to support you. What approaches have you found most effective in reaching common ground with gun owners who are suspicious of your motives? We listen. We respect the views of others. We start conversations that often end up with us agreeing on more than we think we will at the beginning. We explain our views — we use facts. But we’ll never back down from fighting for what we believe is right. Sensible gun laws are not controversial to hunters, or parents, or a collector, or a police officer. It’s possible to have strong gun laws while also respecting the rights of responsible gun owners. You’re as familiar as anybody, I imagine, with the false narratives that developed after the background check and assault weapons bill failed in Congress in 2013: the “nothing changed after Sandy Hook” narrative, and then the fatalistic “if Sandy Hook didn’t cause an epiphany on guns, nothing ever will” narrative. Do you run into those often? What do you say? Yes. I tell people to remember that change is a marathon, not a sprint — and that it’s happening. It’s easy to forget how young the modern gun safety movement is. Mark and I started our organization just six years ago, after the horrific school shooting in Newtown. Since our organization began, nearly 300 gun safety laws have passed at the state level. Look at the new generation of activists who rose up after Parkland. They pointed out the failures of politicians to keep them safe, and we turned the 2018 election into a rallying cry for gun safety. The House of Representatives became the first majority in a generation to pass major gun reform laws. It’s one of the signature issues of the new Congress, is being talked about by every Democrat running for president, and will be an important way to draw contrast with President Trump’s priorities and vision of the future. It’s not easy, but step by step we are making progress. I can imagine your work is both physically and mentally draining, especially because the movement is so slow. Do you ever get discouraged? What I took for granted before my shooting now requires hours upon hours of hard work. Speaking is difficult. Not everyone realizes it. My right arm and right leg are still mostly paralyzed. But I try to focus on the things I can do, and I draw strength from my work. Eight years later, I’m a tougher person. More patient and more resilient, too. I have to be. But who I am has not changed. Of course I get discouraged, but I do my best to remain optimistic.",The New York Times
2019,Why Gas Prices Are Spiking,"California Today Good morning. (Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.) Gas is never cheap in California. But if you’ve filled up your tank in recent days, you may have found yourself wincing more than usual. That’s because, for the first time since July 2015, the average price for a gallon of gas in the Golden State pushed past $4, Dan McTeague, a senior petroleum analyst with the site GasBuddy, told me on Monday afternoon. “That’s a psychological benchmark for a lot of people,” he said. “It’s been a long time coming.” So what’s causing the price spike? You may already know that the primary reason gas tends to be more expensive in California is the state’s stringent gasoline standards, which require a cleaner fuel blend that only a few refineries outside the state can produce. So when work is stopped at any of the 10 major refineries within California, it can make a significant dent in the supply of gas, which causes prices to rise. And that, Mr. McTeague said, is exactly what’s been happening. According to a report by the Oil Price Information Service, six of those 10 major refineries have had work disruptions — like a fire at a Phillips 66 refinery in Carson on March 15 — or planned maintenance that has taken them offline. Mr. McTeague said that those, coupled with a problem at an Air Products hydrogen plant, added up to an abnormal run. “You might have one, you might have two,” he said of unplanned disruptions. “You don’t have five or six.” Plus, he said, the timing is just bad: Refineries are switching to summer gas blend production, which can take facilities temporarily offline. We’re heading toward some big travel weekends. Will things get better? Mr. McTeague said prices were down over the last couple of days. But he cautioned that “there’s still momentum in the price” and that information lags by about a week. He predicted the average price per gallon would “crest” at about $4.15 soon, before dropping back to the $3.80 range. But Mr. McTeague noted that big driving weekends — Easter and Memorial Day — are coming up. And drivers may be taking to the roads while supplies are still diminished. Either way, he said, “I think we’re looking at a volatile summer.” On Monday, the winners and finalists for the 2019 Pulitzer Prizes were announced. The awards honor the year’s best journalism, fiction, poetry and music. California was home to many of this year’s honorees. Here’s some of their work: • The Los Angeles Times won a Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting. In an explosive series of stories, the journalists Harriet Ryan, Matt Hamilton and Paul Pringle revealed that U.S.C. had allowed a campus gynecologist to continue practicing after he had been repeatedly accused of sexual misconduct by students. The investigation had wide-ranging impacts and roiled the university. [The Los Angeles Times] • The staff of The Chico Enterprise-Record, in collaboration with the Bay Area News Group, was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for breaking news reporting. The newspaper covered the Camp Fire, the state’s deadliest blaze, on the ground in Paradise, a community that was nearly wiped off the map. [The Enterprise-Record] • And John Locher, Noah Berger and Ringo Chiu, who are Associated Press photojournalists, were named finalists for the Pulitzer Prize for breaking news photography. They were recognized for their haunting images of the wildfires that tore across the state last year. [The Associated Press] • Darrin Bell, a Los Angeles native, won in editorial cartooning for beautiful and daring editorial cartoons that took on issues affecting disenfranchised communities.[The Pulitzer Prizes] • Ellen Reid’s work of opera-theater, “p r i s m,” won this year’s Pulitzer Prize for music. The piece premiered at L.A. Opera’s Off Grand and explores life after trauma. [The Pulitzer Prizes] (We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers. We appreciate your reading Times stories, but we’d also encourage you to support local news if you can.) • The day after Representative Eric Swalwell announced he was running for president, he insisted that “we don’t have time for vanity things.” But there’s no doubt he’s a long-shot candidate. So why run? There’s not much downside. [The New York Times] • So far in the sprawling college admissions fraud case, students haven’t been prosecuted. But that could change. A lawyer involved in the case said that some of the children of parents who have been charged got so-called target letters, which notify them that they may be the subject of a criminal probe. In another development in the case, Lori Loughlin pleaded not guilty. [The New York Times] • There are 15 men named John in the House of Representatives. And yet, two women named Katie — Representatives Katie Porter and Katie Hill, both freshmen from Southern California — are the ones who keep getting confused for each other. “It’s constant,” Ms. Porter said. [The Los Angeles Times] • How would Palm Springs join Los Angeles and the San Joaquin Valley in having some of the worst air in the nation? “To paraphrase Bob Dylan, the answer is blowing in the wind.” [The Desert Sun] • Can a universal basic income actually work? Stockton is testing it out — but even that process is fraught and difficult. Still, if it goes well, the city could become a model. [The Los Angeles Times] • After a disastrous season for the Lakers, Luke Walton took a job as head coach of the Sacramento Kings. Now, the team is hoping his relationship with Vlade Divac, the general manager, will be fruitful. [The Sacramento Bee] • A columnist asks if sideshows, or illegal street shows where drivers burn the rubber off the tires of high-performance cars by doing doughnuts and figure-eights, can go the way of Nascar. Which is to say: Should the East Bay tradition be made legal and hosted in safe, designated venues? [KQED] Stephen Curry may be supernaturally good at basketball. But he is a normal mortal in at least one regard and that is this: The dude really, really loves popcorn. It’s not a particularly healthy pregame snack, and no one looks cool while they’re eating it — not even Curry, as the fantastic photos and video in this piece by my colleague Marc Stein attest. Still, Curry’s devotion is real and, apparently, widely known enough to inspire staff members at arenas across the nation to prepare for his arrival. Curry even went as far as to rank all 29 of their popcorn offerings using a five-category matrix. Which arena came out on top? American Airlines Center, home of the Dallas Mavericks, where the popcorn scored a perfect 5 in freshness, saltiness, butter and presentation. It earned only a 4 in crunchiness, though.

2019,Why Grooms Are Hanging Up the Traditional Tuxedo,"Many are walking down the aisle in bolder colors and more creative styles. The black tuxedo, invented in the late 1800s, was once the only option for grooms and groomsmen. But in recent years, bolder colors, creative styles and fashionable suits have replaced the staid look. “Renting or wearing a tux is no longer as captivating to men,” said Ernie Ulysses, a tailor who is an owner of Alexander Nash, a bespoke men’s clothing store in Manhattan. “Today’s groom is wearing a different kind of suit,” he said, “and putting more effort, individuality and personality into untraditional looks coming from their ties, jacket linings and winks in the collars.” Here are some of the latest wedding attire trends from six experts in men’s fashion. For grooms, “five years ago we were selling 70 percent tuxedos and 30 percent suits,” said Colin Hunter, the chief executive and co-founder of Alton Lane, a bespoke men’s wear company. “Now we sell 70 percent suits — in rich blues, light grays and sharkskin — and 30 percent tuxedos.” These suits have clean lines, a tapered look, and are created in a fabric that’s a four-season wool. “Men are also doing more British side tabs instead of belt loops,” Mr. Hunter said. Many grooms are also personalizing the stitching around the last buttonholes on their sleeves. “These are now being done in a different color stitch that incorporates the color of the wedding,” he said. “Maybe it’s the champagne color of her dress or the color red from their flowers.” “Color, which was once relegated to accessories — bow ties, pocket squares, and socks — has moved into the entire suit,” said Brice Pattison, the fashion director for the Black Tux, a premium online suit and tuxedo rental company. “That’s become a huge trend, as men are dressing in a more playful and fun way.” This year’s popular colors? “We’re now seeing a rose shade that’s slightly desaturated, an emerald green, and a rich plum, jewel tone,” Mr. Pattison said. He noted, too, that unification between the groom and his groomsmen is no longer considered. “Five years ago the groomsmen wore what the groom did, everything was tied together,” he said. “Maybe there was a discriminating flower, but that was really it. Grooms now wear classic, yet expressive shades of blue, along with traditional black tie designs, while groomsmen are wearing a slightly different color that plays off of what the groom is fashioning.” Another big trend has been in fit. “Tuxes, along with other formal wear, were often loose and slightly boxy,” said Mr. Ulysses of Alexander Nash. “Today suits are tapered, tailored and fit closer to the body.” Mr. Ulysses attributes this change to the growth of fitness, health and wellness. “Men are taking better care of their bodies and they want to show off their nice silhouette,” he said. “There was a time when men wore heavy, shoulder padded, three-quarter suits. The pant leg was baggy with a 10-and-a-half-inch width at the bottom. Now that’s six and a half inches. And the many buttons a tux jacket had, which symbolized importance, have been replaced with only one or two on a colored suit.” Bruce Pask, the men’s fashion director for Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, says experimentation and personal choice have become important to many grooms. “A big change has been formal evening jackets that allow for originality, unlike the tux,” he said. “We’re seeing velvet, silk jacquard and vivid patterns.” Wedding locales are also dictating groom’s fashion choices, and designers like Armani, Tom Ford, Ralph Lauren and Kiton are taking note. “What you’re wearing is a reference to your surroundings,” Mr. Pask said. “Today it’s O.K. to wear a khaki suit with no shoes or a white dinner jacket to a beach wedding.” Wedding attire has taken a cue from casual Fridays. “Men have gotten more comfortable embracing specialty clothing,” said Justin Berkowitz, the men’s fashion director at Bloomingdale’s. “Linen or cotton are go-tos because of their soft constructions. We’re seeing unlined or half-lined jackets with softer shoulders because it’s less-restricted and it’s conforming to your shape as opposed to making you a different shape.” He added that constrictive garments are no longer appealing, either. “We’re seeing a return of the single pleat paired with a shorter leg so you see a little ankle in the summer and sock in the winter.” More grooms are looking for versatility in the suits they wear. “Men want to break apart their suit and add variations,” said Durand Guion, a vice president for Macy’s Fashion Office. A groom, he said, “might not wear it with the same shirt and tie, but add the jacket to jeans and a T-shirt. That’s a whole different thinking.” Mr. Guion also noted the newfound popularity of the white suit. “We now make sure we have it all year round as men wear it in warm locations or to destinations.” Same-sex marriages are also bringing out more personality, and a snub to the traditional tux. “Seeing two guys in the same tux seems forced,” Mr. Guion said. “They want their own look. Colors and fabrics show more personality and help define who they are.” Continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on Facebook (Styles and Modern Love), Twitter (Styles, Fashion and Weddings) and Instagram.",The New York Times
2019,Why Has Australia Fallen Out of Love With Immigration?,"SYDNEY, Australia — Five days after 50 Muslims in New Zealand were killed in an attack attributed to an Australian white supremacist, Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, unveiled a plan he said would address a fundamental challenge to the nation. But it was not a proposal to combat hate groups and Islamophobia. It was a cut to immigration. The government’s plan, which had been in the works for months, is a potential turning point for a nation that has been shaped by newcomers since its days as a British penal colony and that has presented itself in recent years as a model of how immigration, properly managed, can strengthen a country. Now, amid a global backlash against immigration that has upended politics in the United States, Britain and much of Europe, even Australia is reversing course, turning away from a policy of welcoming skilled foreigners that helped fuel decades of economic growth — and transformed a nation once closed to nonwhite immigrants into a multicultural society. Mr. Morrison presented the move as a reaction to crowding in the nation’s largest cities, which has led to congested commutes and costlier housing. “This plan is about protecting the quality of life of Australians right across our country,” he said. Such concerns are widespread as views in the country have turned sharply against population growth over the past year. There is worry, though, that these “quality-of-life” complaints have been amplified by — or perhaps have masked — a deeper ambivalence about a new wave of non-European immigration, especially from Muslim countries, along with Africa and Asia. There’s no denying the rapid pace of change, nor its benefits. Australia’s population has grown by nearly 40 percent, from 18 million to 25 million, since the 1990s, and economists argue that the nation’s record-breaking 27 years without a recession would have been impossible if not for surging immigration. Most of the 4.7 million foreigners who have arrived since 1980 have been skilled migrants, especially since 2004, when an average of more than 350,000 students and skilled workers arrived each year, according to government figures. According to the 2016 census, more than one in four Australians were born overseas, compared to 13.7 percent of the population in the United States and 14 percent in Britain. And six out of the top 10 source countries are now in Asia, with immigrants from China (509,558 people) and India (455,385) leading the way. Many Australians say it is time for these trends to end. In one recent poll, more than two-thirds said their country no longer needed more people. As recently as 2010, a majority of Australians disagreed with that statement. Mr. Morrison and his Liberal Party — which has often used anti-immigrant sentiment to stir its conservative base — clearly believe that immigration will be a winning issue for them in the national election on May 18. The government has slowed visa approvals, and plans to cut annual immigration by 30,000 people, to 160,000 a year, a reduction greater than any since the early 1980s, according to archival data. Mr. Morrison also plans to shift work visas to steer newcomers outside the big cities, requiring recipients to live in those regions for three years before they can secure permanent residency. The opposition Labor Party, meanwhile, has mostly sought to avoid the issue, mindful of how it has empowered conservatives in Britain and the United States, where President Trump recently declared that the country is now “full.” Experts examining polling data and census figures have found that Australian frustration over immigration is focused around general themes: the pace of population growth (1.6 percent nationwide last year, compared to 0.7 percent for the United States) and perceptions around who wins and loses because of it. With a landmass as big as the continental United States and one-tenth the population, Australia is one of the world’s most sparsely populated countries. It is also among the most urbanized, and it nurses a culture of high expectations; even many city dwellers expect a backyard. But Nicholas Biddle, an economist at the Australian National University who oversaw a major poll on immigration late last year, found that people living in the places most strained by population growth are not the ones most likely to demand curbs on immigration. When Mr. Biddle mapped, using census data, the characteristics of those who were opposed to population growth and immigration, for example, he found that none of the areas in the top 20 percent of opposition to population growth and immigration were in Sydney or Melbourne. Instead, based on the nationwide polling, the place where residents were least likely to be opposed to population growth was Surry Hills, an inner suburb of Sydney where housing prices have skyrocketed and traffic can be suffocating. During one recent evening rush hour at Central Station, hundreds of people lined up to pile onto trains as announcements implored customers to spread out along the platform. But even some of the most frustrated commuters called not for fewer people, but for improved infrastructure, microcities outside Sydney’s center or changes in workplace culture that might limit rush-hour commuting. “I wouldn’t want to return to the Australia of the 1930s and ’40s,” said Michael Monaghan, who was holding a briefcase while waiting for a train. “It’s just a matter of managing it.” A far different sentiment can be heard about two hours north of Sydney, on the Central Coast, home to a cluster of somewhat rural suburbs and fishing towns in the top tier of opposition to growth and immigration. Some residents of the area justify their opposition by asking whether Australia has enough water to support a larger population, an element of the country’s immigration debate since the 1980s, before desalination plants became more common. But there are also people like Stephen Ryan, 69, a retired power station worker who was not shy about arguing that Australia was better off when its immigrants were mostly from England. “The Arab people, they don’t want to do anything,” he said. “They just want to go on the dole. That’s just the way I see it.” It is the kind of attitude that, according to many immigrants in Australia, still shapes the discussion around population growth in a country that barred nonwhite immigrants until 1971. The rise of right-wing politicians like Fraser Anning, a senator who blamed Muslim immigration for the New Zealand attacks, and Pauline Hanson, who once wore a burqa in Parliament to protest Islam, has pushed racism into mainstream public discussion. “In the last few years, we have seen politicians state that people had a right to be bigots,” said Tim Soutphommasane, a former race commissioner in Australia and a professor at the University of Sydney. “There’s been a creeping normalization of far-right political ideas.” On a local level, two competing visions of Australia are essentially fighting for votes: the Australia longing for a nostalgic past, and the Australia trying to figure out the next phase of integration for a more globalized nation. Young political candidates like Kadira Pethiyagoda are at the forefront of potential change. Mr. Pethiyagoda, 39, who immigrated from Sri Lanka and served as an Australian diplomat, is running for the Labor Party in Melbourne. “Services are being cut, wages haven’t gone up, the cost of living is increasing. People are being squeezed,” he said. “Politicians are pointing to all these problems, trying to pretend the cause of this is only immigration.” As he campaigned by knocking on doors, some who answered said they, too, wanted more livable cities — with a focus on how to help everyone, newcomers included. “It just makes me feel confident that maybe somebody who understands the challenges that migrant families face can actually accurately represent our views and actions,” said Yvonne Maringa, 35, an English immigrant of Zimbabwean descent. “I think there’s a limited understanding still of migrant communities and their needs.”",The New York Times
2019,Why Having a Gun in New Jersey Could Soon Cost 20 Times as Much,"Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey wants to put the state at the forefront of a movement to raise fees on gun permits in order to expand efforts to tackle gun violence and reduce the flow of illegal firearms. Though New Jersey has strict gun control laws, its firearms fees have not changed since the mid-1960s, making it a bargain for gun owners. A firearm identification card costs $5, while a permit to own a firearm is $2. A permit to carry a gun costs $20. New York City, which also has stringent gun laws, charges $340 to apply for a permit to own and carry a gun. Mr. Murphy, a Democrat, has proposed fees that would be among the highest in the country. An identification card would cost $100, an owner’s permit would be $50 and a carry permit $400. Though he is prohibited by state law from directing the new revenue toward specific programs, Mr. Murphy said it would go toward anti-violence initiatives. “There’s no war on responsible gun owners,” Mr. Murphy said in an interview. “We can support the efforts of the attorney general, state troopers, county and local law enforcement, to do the stuff we need to do: track crime, track gun violence, combat trafficking of illegal guns. “I was in Jersey City,” he said. “It’s at least $10 to get a dog license in Jersey City. It’s still $2 to get a permit to purchase a firearm in New Jersey.” But gun owners’ groups say the governor is trying to use financial pressure to curtail their lawful rights. Even Mr. Murphy’s Democratic allies who control the State Legislature have expressed concern about approving what are essentially new taxes. At least 12 states, including New York, Connecticut and Washington, have moved to increase fees and taxes on guns and ammunition since the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012, according to a study by Southern Illinois University. Though higher fees might discourage some people from buying firearms, gun control advocates and researchers said they were not certain that higher fees alone would reduce violence. “Most crime guns in the Northeast are thought to come from the ‘iron pipeline’ from the South, and then they’re sold on the street,” said Daniel L. Feldman, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, referring to guns that are bought in states with looser restrictions and then sold illegally in states with tighter ones. But gun control groups do support the idea of raising the cost of owning a firearm to pay for programs that would make it harder to use guns to commit crime. “We think it’s a smart way to legislate,” said Jonas Oransky, the legal director at Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group founded by Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor. “We support strong data-driven intervention programs,’’ he added, “and think that it makes sense to fund them by raising revenue from gun purchasers.” But groups that represent gun owners are pushing back. “This is clear bullying of law-abiding gun owners in the state,” said Cody McLaughlin, spokesman for the New Jersey Outdoor Alliance, a pro-hunting group. “You’re talking about sportsmen that are already paying hundreds of dollars a year in license fees.” Though national polling has found support for tighter gun laws, the only movement at the federal level in recent years has been a ban on bump stocks adopted last year. The National Rifle Association has made a concerted effort to block a Congressional measure to strengthen the ability of law enforcement to bar people with restraining orders or those convicted of a violent act against a spouse from buying or owning a gun. As a result, states like New Jersey have been making their own laws, including limiting magazine capacities and banning ammunition capable of penetrating body armor. Besides raising fees on gun ownership, Mr. Murphy is also seeking an ammunition excise tax of 10 percent and a firearms excise tax of 2.5 percent. His proposals are part of the state budget, which the Legislature must pass by June 30. In some states, attempts to raise gun fees have met with fierce opposition. John Hickenlooper, the former governor of Colorado and a Democratic candidate for president, signed a bill in 2013 that charged gun buyers a fee to pay for a background check as part of a package of gun control laws following the Aurora movie theater shooting. In Colorado, a swing state with a large hunting community, Mr. Hickenlooper and fellow Democrats in the state legislature faced a backlash, culminating in a recall election of the State Senate president. “The single greatest way that we were able to reduce smoking was raising the cost of cigarettes,” Mr. Hickenlooper said. “That turns out to be more effective than many other ways. But I’m not sure that’s the right way to make policy. We’re better served to be able to demonstrate to people that carrying a handgun doesn’t make you more safe.” Even in deeply blue New Jersey, Mr. Murphy faces resistance. Democratic legislative leaders are tepid on the governor’s proposal, with some making the case that the state’s residents already pay more than enough in taxes and fees. “I think we’ve done a lot of gun reform in this state. We are the most progressive state in the nation when it comes to gun reform,” said Stephen M. Sweeney, the Senate president. “Just to check a box to say you did something, I’m not sure that’s necessary. I don’t think it’s going to raise a lot of money.” The projected annual revenue from the new fees and taxes is about $9 million, according to the State Treasury Department — a fraction of the $38 billion budget. A leading gun rights group in the state has threatened to sue Mr. Murphy if his proposal becomes law, and the state’s hunting community is also lobbying against the proposal. “It’s going to affect gun shops tremendously,” said Lisa Caso, who owns Caso’s Gun-A-Rama in Jersey City. “It’s going to deter a lot of people from buying permits. In our business, you have people coming in who barely have money to buy the most modestly priced guns, which are around $300.” Ms. Caso said some of her customers have told her that people are stocking up on permits now, worried about the possibility of higher fees. “I think what Murphy would want to happen,” she said, “is for every gun shop in the state of New Jersey to just close.” An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the given name of the New Jersey governor. He is Philip D. Murphy, not Phillip.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Why I Am Stockpiling Insulin in My Fridge,"I’ve been living with diabetes since I was 9 years old. I used to dream of a cure, but now I just want to make sure people can get the drugs they need. Ms. Kreizman is a writer who has Type 1 diabetes. My parents and I used to high-five one another when we learned that the child of someone very rich had been found to have Type 1 diabetes. We weren’t being mean, just desperate. I was given my diabetes diagnosis in 1987, when I was 9, and the years immediately following were spent fantasizing about a cure. A cure would solve all my problems, the physical, mental and financial strains of having a chronic illness. A cure would require fund-raising for charities that would then be able to sponsor life-changing research. Put more simply, a cure would require money — lots of it. So, like monsters, my family and I rooted for offspring of the wealthy to join the broken-pancreas club, so that diabetes would become their pet cause and their fancy friends would get involved. The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation’s charity auction would make a killing. When I was a kid, I was certain there would be an end point to my disease, a day I could check off on my calendar when I’d be free. By the year 2000, I was sure that my pancreas, which had stopped producing insulin, would suddenly restart thanks to modern technology. I was particular. I hoped the cure would not require surgery — injectable was preferred, but something in pill form would be even better. As if I’d have any say in the matter. There have been some improvements in the management of my diabetes in the past 30 years. I used to have to put a hanging drop of blood on a strip and then wait three minutes for my bulky glucometer to give me a reading. Now all I need to test my blood sugar is a small pin prick of blood, and in five seconds I have an answer. Different types of insulin work more steadily and are faster acting, allowing more flexibility around mealtimes. Insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors are providing stability and greater freedom for many. There’s still no cure, but I’m actually glad that most researchers don’t talk solely about a cure. Diabetes is no longer centered around it — living well with diabetes is better than wishing to throw money at it and make it go away. What I didn’t expect, what I still can’t fathom, is that insulin prices would skyrocket so much. The price of my insulin nearly doubled from 2012 to 2016, with average costs per patient rising to nearly $6,000 a year. I definitely never thought that in 2019 there would be people who would die from lack of access. Many insulin-dependent people with diabetes in America, right now, even people with health insurance, are having financial trouble meeting their most basic need. I recently read about a nurse named Meaghan Carter, whose family said that she died when she lost her insurance in 2018, after she had lived with diabetes for more than 18 years. In 2017, a man from Houston died after his GoFundMe for insulin came up $50 short. GoFundMe yielded more than 8,000 results when I searched for “insulin.” If my childhood impressions of the future were more sci-fi than realistic, then I never imagined the current state of diabetes management would be dystopic, with so many patients in our rich nation rationing their doses, trying to make little glass vials of life blood last as long as possible while drug companies make a hefty profit. Diabetics like me need insulin to process the sugar in our blood in order to live. With too little insulin to manage the food we eat, our blood sugars climb. I’ve struggled for years to describe what it feels like to have high blood sugar: All my energy is sapped away. I’m thirsty and sluggish, and my calves tend to cramp. It feels like a panic attack. I can never separate what high feels like from what anxious feels like because both feelings tend to develop together in a self-perpetuating ball, along with guilt. I feel guilty, whether the high is my “fault” or not (did I eat cake?), because I’m supposed to be in control of my disease, damn it. When I’m high, I inject insulin into my belly as quickly as possible and hope to find a nice place to rest while the insulin works its magic. That need for insulin takes center stage in my subconscious and many of my stress nightmares: My blood sugar is high but I can’t find my insulin in my purse, my version of showing up naked to class for a test I didn’t study for. I test my blood sugar and I get a result in the thousands (normal for me is around 100) and I try to fathom the ways in which my body will betray me. I’m a prisoner trapped on a plane without my insulin, feeling sicker and sicker, and I have to rely on Nicolas Cage to beat up some bad guys and find spare insulin to bring me. O.K., that’s not a nightmare, that’s the plot of the movie “Con Air,” but I certainly had a panic attack while seeing it with my parents as a teenager. Since I was a kid I’ve felt unfortunate to have diabetes, but now I have to consider myself lucky because my insulin, on my husband’s health insurance plan, comes at a somewhat reasonable price. In 2018, I paid $740 for my prescriptions; the plan covered $14,411. Eli Lilly’s recent announcement that it will offer a generic version of the fast-acting insulin Humalog at half of the list price is too little, too late. I’m done imagining cures. I just want basic human dignity for all diabetes sufferers. No one should die from lack of insulin, a patent for which was granted nearly a century ago for $3. For now, I will vote for politicians who would regulate drug companies, but I will still keep all of my expired insulin stockpiled in my fridge just in case. I’m certainly not brave enough to throw it out right now. Maris Kreizman is the author of the book “Slaughterhouse 90210.” The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2019,"Opinion | Why I Hate Moving, for the 23rd Time","My usual method of packing involves reflecting on past moves and reliving the stress of each one. Ms. Dumas is a humorist and writer. MUNICH — After six years in Germany, we are headed back home to California, and everyone asks me if I am using the Marie Kondo method to help me pack. I am actually using the lesser-known Firoozeh Dumas method, which involves spending half of each day remembering past moves, a lifetime total of 22 on three continents, and then reliving the stress of each one. My most stressful move memories do not actively involve a move per se. In the late 1970s, my family and I were living in California temporarily while my father consulted for an American company building an oil refinery in Iran. After the Iranian revolution in 1979, I realized that everything we had left in Abadan “for when we go back” was ours no more, thanks to the Ayatollah Method: “It sparks joy for us to separate you from your belongings.” In my family, we never complained; how can we complain about stuff when people lost loved ones? However, as an imperfect human being, I do sometimes look at my two Ikea fake Persian rugs, which spark no joy whatsoever, and long for the houseful of beautiful Persian rugs that we did not bring with us to America. It is also at times like this that I remember my brother Farshid’s battery-operated toy robot from Japan, the one that magically shuffled across the floor, moving its arms up and down, while making screechy sounds that I assumed were futuristic. I spent a good deal of my childhood scheming of ways to steal this robot but then spent many more years afterward wishing I had actually stolen it and brought it with me to America so that I could give it to my brother, allowing him to hang on to a sweet piece of his childhood. Chances are, he would have given it to one of his nieces or nephews by now, but that would have been his choice. The key word is “choice.” When we moved to Munich, I assumed we would stay for one to two years, so I rented a storage unit in California for all the things that I would not need in Germany but wanted to keep. The contents of my storage unit would make for one huge dud episode of “Storage Wars.” Aside from children’s artwork, photo albums and books, highlights include the oversize suitcases we brought to America when I was 7 years old. We flew Pan Am; my dad wore a three-piece suit and my mother wore a flowered dress, pantyhose and heels. Our suitcases, Louis Vuitton luggage they were not, but those powder blue Samsonites with the matching makeup case were, by 1972 Abadan standards, fancy. When I look at them now, they remind me of how secure I felt despite the unknown journey. I knew that my father had the answer to every question I ever asked about America and even answers to questions I didn’t ask. He was always dispensing advice, wisdom he had gleaned thanks to his Fulbright scholarship to Texas A&M in 1952: Always buy the biggest car possible. Chevrolets are the best cars on the planet. No one ever regretted becoming educated. Jell-O, regardless of color, is the single most delicious dessert. Never buy a house when you can rent hassle-free. A girl without an education is always at the mercy of others. Putting ice in tea is very wrong. Those dusty suitcases now remind me that my dad was the best ally a girl could ever have, but one who gave some really bad advice. As we pack our belongings here, I am keeping very little. Most of our furniture is being donated. I’m bringing a few vases made in the 1970s in West Germany, which I consider the height of the German pottery movement. No one likes my vases, including my husband, but I love them and look forward to boring my friends in America with their history. (You have never heard of Bodo Mans? You will after you visit me.) The beer steins are coming, too, although I have never served beer in them. How do Germans drink that much beer? I assume Germans look at Big Gulps and ask the same thing about Americans and soda. Our youngest, now a teenager, was 7 when we moved to Germany, the same age I was when we came to America. She arrived here not speaking a word of German and now speaks it like a native. She has been my reluctant translator, just as I was for my mother. She laughs at my American accent; I used to imitate my mother’s thick Persian accent. Like me, my daughter feels that she belongs to two countries. But our parallel lives end there. She has no anxiety about moving; she doesn’t fear that while she is gone, one of her countries will change completely, basically disappearing but for her memories. I recently found a duplicate of my brother’s robot on eBay for $2,000. Even if I could afford it, I wouldn’t buy it. It’s not the same one that he played with, the one that I took to my kindergarten class for show-and-tell and pretended was mine. After staring at it on my computer screen for the first time in almost 50 years, I realized that it’s not really the robot that I wish I had kept, but the sense of innocence and security that we felt in our home in Abadan, Iran, a place that we thought would always be there, waiting for us, just as we had left it. That permanence is something that we couldn’t pack back then, and something that I cannot pack now. And yet somehow, I still try.

2019,Opinion | Why I Knit,"letter A reader shares the satisfaction of the craft and of making gifts for grandchildren. To the Editor: Margaret Renkl (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, April 1) mentions her “abandonment of the domestic arts.” But I’m 82, and I’ve been knitting hats, scarves and afghans as gifts for family and friends since I was in my 20s. For the last several years, I’ve been knitting for my four grandchildren and now for my fifth, to be born this June. When outgrown, these hardy sweaters and hats have been passed down from one to the other over the years. I knit when I watch television and, in doing so, feel less like a boob tube idiot. I knit with yarn from stores that offer beautiful material from all over the world. I knit because, at my age, I still feel useful and creative, and there’s nothing wrong with that!

2019,Why Is the Mayor Talking About Running for President?,"New York Today [Want to get New York Today by email? Here's the sign-up.] It’s Monday. A 41-pound cat in Manhattan is looking for a home, according to NBC New York. Weather: Call it a spring sauna — the temperature will rise to the mid-70s in the afternoon, with rain and possibly thunderstorms providing the steam. The rest of the week will see temperatures mostly in the 50s, with rain probable on Tuesday and Friday. Alternate-side parking: In effect until April 18 (Holy Thursday). He traveled to early voting states. He held an expensive fund-raiser in Boston. He met activists in Las Vegas. Mayor de Blasio looks like he’s running for president. No, seriously. Even though a recent poll said most city voters are against the idea, Mr. de Blasio, who must leave office at the end of 2021 because of term limits, seems intent on joining the Democrats’ crowded field of White House contenders. [Read more about Mayor de Blasio’s presidential preparations.] To understand this better, I spoke to The Times’s J. David Goodman, who has covered City Hall and now writes about the influence of money in politics. Our conversation was lightly edited for clarity and brevity. What are the signs that Mayor de Blasio is serious about running? He’s traveling and he’s fund-raising. He’s traveled before, but there is a very explicit targeting of early primary states in his cross-country travel these days. You look at that and say that’s the kind of thing you would do. You have to get there. You need to get surrogates and win those local activists over so they don’t go with the other candidates. And you need to meet the money that isn’t available in New York City. If people are going to write you a big check, generally they want to meet with you in person. Does running for president enable Mr. de Blasio to do something that he couldn’t do otherwise? In the 2016 race, he tried to have an influence on the presidential conversation without being a candidate. It didn’t quite work. He may think that the way to do that this time is to actually be in the race. You saw that last time around with Bernie Sanders. He had far more influence as a candidate than you imagine he would have had if he tried to just have a political action committee and support some candidates in 2016. Maybe that’s what Mr. de Blasio is doing. Running for president also helps stave off the effects of being a lame duck. He has to leave City Hall at the end of 2021. Already you’ve had people talking about the next mayor’s race, and it makes the mayor seem a little less powerful. What exactly is the influence the mayor wants to have? What does his fingerprint on 2020 look like? That’s a good question. He’s focused on affordable housing, universal prekindergarten and early education. He’s also talked about universal health care. The trouble for him is that a lot of his ideas have been taken up, and people go further now. What would be the de Blasio signature issue to move the Democratic Party in a way that it’s not already moving? I think he has to answer that question. I think his argument now is, liberalism works, and I did it in a big city and I’ll do it for the rest of the country. And he can make that argument in a way that a senator can’t as effectively, someone who hasn’t been an executive. But that’s not how presidential campaigns are won. They’re won on ideas and inspiration. The mayor has ideas. I’m not sure he’s always inspiring. Where do you think he would announce? I don’t have a good answer for that. What do you think? Maybe in front of his home in Park Slope? Seventy-five percent of New Yorkers don’t want him to run, according to a Quinnipiac poll. What if people booed him at his announcement? Which could happen. It’s New York. Maybe he could announce on a subway train. That might cause him some headaches. I heard the governor controls the subways. That noise?

The people, from adults to young children, are listening for the sound of frogs, like the common green frog, the bullfrog and the gray tree frog. The green frog makes “a twanging noise” like a “rubber band snapping,” said Dorothy Reilly, a spokeswoman for the Greenbelt Conservancy, which runs the event. The tree frog is loud and shrill.

2019,Opinion | Why Israel Still Loves Netanyahu,"Yes, he has many faults. But on the issues that matter most, he’s a visionary leader. Contributing Opinion Writer JERUSALEM — There are more than a few reasons to dislike Benjamin Netanyahu. He can be smug and vindictive. He can be ruthless when going up against political enemies. He is likely to be indicted on corruption charges related to three separate cases, which, if they are accurate, indicate that he is greedy, vain and manipulative. And yet last night, this dislikable prime minister appears to have won his fifth — yes, fifth! — term in office. If he forms a government in the coming weeks, as he is expected to, Mr. Netanyahu will surpass Israel’s founder David Ben Gurion as the country’s longest serving prime minister. How is this possible? To be fair, this was a close race. The main opposition party, Blue and White, is expected to get as many seats in the Knesset as Mr. Netanyahu’s Likud party. The coalition that he forms will probably have little more than the minimum 61 seats behind it. Given Mr. Netanyahu’s unsavory qualities, many people were intent on defeating him. Just a few months ahead of the election, Blue and White, a new centrist alliance led by three decorated generals and a former security minister, came together with little purpose other than to present an alternative to Mr. Netanyahu, who has been in power since 2009. They campaigned fiercely — but civilly. At rallies, General Benny Gantz, the head of Blue and White, made it a habit to thank the prime minister for his service to the nation; this was a mirror image of Mr. Netanyahu’s and Likud’s name-calling and personal attacks. But civility and centrism weren’t enough to carry the day. Mr. Netanyahu may be cynical but he doesn’t rig elections. He wins fairly, often against great odds, including, this time, the coming indictments against him and an understandable fatigue with his decade-old leadership, not to mention various other inter- and intraparty squabbles. But he seems to have succeeded again this time for the same reason he has dominated Israeli politics for most of the past 25 years: because when it comes to Israel’s national security, he is a leader with strategy and vision. And that is what many voters want. In the mid-1990s, during his first term as prime minister, Mr. Netanyahu rejected the assumptions underlying the peace process with the Palestinians. At the time this was considered daringly right wing. Today, it is considered common sense in Israel, including by Mr. Netanyahu’s political rivals. Likewise, Mr. Netanyahu was one of the first politicians to recognize Iran as the main threat to Israel’s survival, and fought fiercely in international forums to get the world’s attention to this problem. Today, this view is also widely appreciated across the Israeli political spectrum. The list goes on: In 2005, he warned that withdrawing Israeli troops from Gaza would end in disaster — and it did. He successfully resisted eight years of the Obama administration’s pressure to offer concessions to the Palestinians. He quickly forged an alliance with President Trump that has already proved to be of great benefit to Israel. In two years, Mr. Trump has moved the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, withdrawn from the nuclear agreement with Iran, recognized Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and on Monday, designated Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as a terrorist organization. Blue and White tried to make this election a referendum on Mr. Netanyahu. Its campaign focused largely on the prime minister’s personal failings, the corruption accusations against him, and exhaustion with his leadership. But in Israel, security trumps all other issues. (A poll ahead of the election found voters rated security as their No. 1 concern.) Blue and White thought that by placing former Israel Defense Forces chiefs of staff at the top of the party list, it could counter Mr. Netanyahu’s image and experience as a defender of Israel, diplomatically and militarily. But the public still showed that it trusts the incumbent more. Has Mr. Netanyahu ever been wrong when it comes to security? The truth is, many Israelis will find it hard to think of an example. And this goes not just for voters for the Likud party, or even the right-wing parties that are expected to join Likud in the next government, but even for Blue and White, which largely echoed Mr. Netanyahu’s positions on important foreign policy and national security questions. Those Israelis who do want Mr. Netanyahu gone — and yes, there are many — want him gone because of his personality, his coarsening of Israeli political discourse, his pettiness and, maybe, his corruption. Those Israelis who want Mr. Netanyahu to stay — and the election makes clear that there are many — want him to stay despite those same characteristics. They can forgive the prime minister for often being a small man, because they appreciate him as a great leader. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2019,Why It Matters That Trump and Michael Cohen Had a Falling Out,"Fixer. The title wasn’t a formal one, but Michael D. Cohen wholeheartedly embraced the role as a lawyer at the Trump Organization. It amounted to serving as chief problem solver for Donald J. Trump, offering Mr. Cohen an unusually up-close view of his boss’s personal and professional lives. Although Mr. Cohen was not a central part of the Trump family business, he was often at Mr. Trump’s side in the decade before he became president, including helping him sort out difficulties leading up to the 2016 election. Most famously, he helped arrange hush money payments to two women — including the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels — who claimed to have had affairs with Mr. Trump. His unflinching loyalty to his boss often went unreciprocated. And it was this imbalance that left the two men on perilous ground last April, after the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided Mr. Cohen’s home, office and hotel room. The searches were part of an inquiry, in the office of the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, that grew out of Robert S. Mueller III’s examination of Russian election meddling. Mr. Cohen would ultimately plead guilty to multiple crimes, and is scheduled to begin serving a three-year prison term on May 6. After months of indecision, he turned on Mr. Trump last summer and has since spoken to the Southern District prosecutors about the Trump family business and more, as well as providing information to the office of the special counsel, Mr. Mueller. A review by The New York Times of confidential emails, text messages and other communications suggests the men’s falling out may have been avoidable. Either way, its consequences have cast a shadow on the Trump presidency. Here are five reasons the undoing of their relationship matters. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan effectively characterized Mr. Trump as an unindicted co-conspirator in the hush money payments, which violated campaign finance laws because they were made to influence the outcome of the election. At his plea hearing, Mr. Cohen said he had made the payments at Mr. Trump’s direction, which was consistent with other evidence prosecutors had gathered. Under current Justice Department policy, a president cannot be charged with a crime. But when a president is no longer in office, prosecutors are free to bring charges — a possibility cited in the Mueller report released on Thursday. Mr. Cohen did not enter into a formal cooperation agreement with the Southern District prosecutors, but voluntarily met with them about his knowledge of Mr. Trump’s family, business and inner circle. If the prosecutors determine that he provided them with useful information, it is possible his three-year sentence could be reduced, under federal sentencing rules. As such, Mr. Trump and others have dismissed his cooperation as a desperate play for leniency. So far his information has helped several investigations, including one examining aspects of Mr. Trump’s inaugural festivities. Since turning on his former boss, Mr. Cohen has become one of Mr. Trump’s fiercest critics, offering fodder for the president’s detractors. Mr. Cohen laid into the president in testimony before Congress in late February, exposing what he described as the dark underside of the president’s business and political life. “He is a racist. He is a con man. And he is a cheat,” Mr. Cohen testified. During the hearing, Trump defenders repeatedly questioned the veracity of Mr. Cohen’s statements, especially because he had pleaded guilty last year to lying to Congress during an earlier appearance about Mr. Trump’s dealings in Moscow. But Mr. Cohen said he was coming clean. “I have fixed things, but I am no longer your ‘fixer,’ Mr. Trump,” Mr. Cohen said. Mr. Cohen’s testimony has also provided something of a road map for congressional investigators looking into Mr. Trump’s finances. Last week, the House Committee on Oversight and Reform subpoenaed records from Mazars USA, an accounting firm that had for many years prepared Mr. Trump’s taxes. The committee chairman, Elijah Cummings of Maryland, a Democrat, said he was seeking the records because of Mr. Cohen’s testimony that Mr. Trump had overstated his assets before he was elected. Mr. Cohen had provided the panel with copies of financial statements that indicated Mr. Trump’s net worth skyrocketed to $8.66 billion in 2013 from $4.55 billion the previous year as a result of a line item identified as “brand value.” But the committee’s ranking Republican, Jim Jordan of Ohio, said no valid legislative purpose was served by the subpoena, suggesting it was meant to embarrass the president. The status of several criminal investigations that grew out of Mr. Cohen’s interviews with federal prosecutors remains unclear. But as recently as February, a judge disclosed that the hush money inquiry focused on Trump Organization officials remained open. In New York, several inquiries undertaken by state authorities in response to Mr. Cohen’s congressional testimony are still active. They include one by the attorney general into Mr. Trump’s real estate projects, and another by state regulators into his insurance practices. And as Mr. Cohen’s May 6 surrender date nears, his lawyers appear to be making a last-ditch effort to keep him out of prison. They wrote earlier this month to Democratic members of Congress, asking them to endorse a campaign to reduce his sentence or postpone his surrender. But the effort does not appear to have borne fruit. Mr. Cohen’s three-year prison term is the longest yet from any case that grew out of the special counsel’s inquiry, after that of Paul J. Manafort, who was sentenced to over seven years in prison. Nonetheless, the redacted version of the Mueller report indicates that federal authorities were debriefing Mr. Cohen as recently as last month. The full range of topics discussed is not known. But footnotes point to an F.B.I. document, dated March 19, based on an interview with Mr. Cohen. The document is cited in connection with statements he made about his conversations with the president after the F.B.I. raid and about a Trump Tower project in Russia, as well as discussions with the president’s lawyer about a possible pardon.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Why It’s So Easy for a Bounty Hunter to Find You,"Wireless companies sell your location data. Federal regulators should stop them. Mr. Starks is a member of the Federal Communications Commission. When you signed up for cellphone service, I bet you didn’t expect that your exact location could be sold to anyone for a few hundred dollars. The truth is, your wireless carrier tracks you everywhere you go, whether you like it or not. When used appropriately, this tracking shouldn’t be a problem: location information allows emergency services to find you when you need them most. But wireless carriers have been selling our data in ways that allows it to be resold for potentially dangerous purposes. For instance, stalkers and abusive domestic partners have used location data to track, threaten and attack victims. This industrywide practice facilitates “pay to track” schemes that appear to violate the law and Federal Communications Commission rules. Companies are collecting and profiting from our private data in hidden ways that leave us vulnerable. As you carry your phone, your wireless carrier records its location so calls and texts can reach you. And you can't opt out of sharing location data with your carrier, as you can with a mobile application. Your carrier needs this data to deliver service. But, according to recent news reports, this real-time phone location data has long been available to entities beyond your wireless carrier, for a price. In one alarming example, reported by Vice, a bounty hunter was able to pay to track a user’s location on a map accurate to within a few feet. In another case, a sheriff in Missouri used location data provided by carriers to inappropriately track a judge. In other words, an ability that seems to come right out of a spy movie is now apparently available to just about anybody with your phone number and some cash. The pay-to-track industry has grown in the shadows, outside of the public eye and away from the watch of regulators. Dozens of companies use smartphone locations to help advertisers and even hedge funds. They say it’s anonymous, but the data shows how personal it is. Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, first raised the alarm last year, sending a letter to the F.C.C. on May 8 demanding an investigation into abuses by the pay-to-track industry. The Times reported on the issue the same week. Senator Wyden also demanded answers from the major wireless carriers. After that, the top wireless companies said that bounty hunters and others would no longer have access to their customers’ locations. But months later the reports continue. Other recent articles suggest that highly accurate GPS location information from our phones — which, according to F.C.C. rules, should be used to send help to 911 callers — is still available on a location-data black market. Since then, wireless companies have said they’ll stop selling our location information completely — eventually. The misuse of this data is downright dangerous. The harms fall disproportionately upon people of color. According to the Pew Research Center, people of color rely more heavily on smartphones for internet access, so they create more of this data, which makes them more vulnerable to tracking. Researchers also know that location data can be used to target them with misinformation or voter suppression tactics. It can also lead to assumptions about a person’s race or income level, assumptions that can feed into discriminatory automated decision making. What is the government doing to protect us? Congress passed laws years ago protecting this kind of information and entrusted the F.C.C. with the responsibility of enforcing them. It is unquestionably the F.C.C.’s job to protect consumers and address risks to public safety. Our location information isn’t supposed to be used without our knowledge and consent and no chain of handoffs or contracts can eliminate the wireless company’s obligations. This is particularly true for the misuse and disclosure of GPS-based 911 location data — which is squarely against F.C.C. rules. The F.C.C. says it is investigating. But nearly a year after the news first broke, the commission has yet to issue an enforcement action or fine those responsible. This passage of time is significant, as the agency usually has only one year to bring action to hold any wrongdoers accountable before the statute of limitations runs out. Some may argue that the F.C.C.’s authority to take action against wireless carriers for this activity has gotten weaker in recent years, with the repeal of consumer-focused privacy and net neutrality rules during the current administration. But I believe that the commission still has ample authority to address these egregious pay-to-track practices. Federal action is long overdue. As a Democratic commissioner at the Republican-led agency, I can call for action, but the chairman sets the agenda, including deciding whether and how quickly to respond to pay-to-track schemes. The agency’s inaction despite these increasingly troubling reports speaks volumes and leaves our duty to the public unfulfilled. The F.C.C. must use its authority to protect consumers and promote public safety, and act swiftly and decisively to stop illegal and dangerous pay-to-track practices once and for all.

2019,Opinion | Why It’s So Hard to Learn French in Middle Age,"I knew I’d never sound like a native. But shouldn’t I be much better than this? Contributing Opinion Writer PARIS — When Notre-Dame burst into flames, I turned on the French TV news and realized that I had little vocabulary for either fires or churches. Whole sentences about collapsing spires were unintelligible to me. This happens a lot. When I moved to Paris in my early 30s and started learning French practically from scratch, I knew I’d never sound like a native. But I envisioned a hero’s journey in which I struggled for a few years, then emerged fluent, or at least pretty good. Fifteen years later, I’ve made strides, but they’re not heroic. I’ve merely gone from bad to not bad. I can usually follow the news, handle transactional conversations and muddle through any situation. Interviewing people is fine, because I’m mostly listening. If required, I can read French books. Yet my French is still riddled with gaps and mistakes. When I try to tell a story in French, I sense that the listener wants to flee. Things I’ve done recently to avoid writing formal letters — a staple of French administrative life — include not reporting a slow leak in my bathroom and not filing for possible medical malpractice. [Never be uninteresting. Read the most thought-provoking, funny, delightful and raw stories from The New York Times Opinion section. Sign up for our Sunday Best newsletter.] Shouldn’t I be much better by now? Why is language learning so difficult? Hoping for an expert opinion — and perhaps some expert solace — I phoned Joshua Hartshorne, the director of the Language Learning Laboratory at Boston College. The sorry state of my French doesn’t surprise him. In a paper last year on which he was a co-author, based on an English grammar test taken by some 670,000 people, he found that — even for children — learning a language takes much longer than I’d thought. Children need seven or eight years of intensive immersion to speak like a native. These years must start by about age 10, to fit them all in by age 17 or 18, when there’s a sharp drop in the rate of learning. (He’s not sure whether this drop is caused by changes in the brain or in circumstances). And native speakers keep perfecting their grammar into their 20s. They reach a level called “asymptote,” when they’re not getting noticeably better, by around age 30, the study found. (But vocabulary peaks at about age 60, according to a study in Psychological Science. That’s probably because native speakers have had time to accumulate lots of words, and they haven’t started forgetting them.) What does this mean for someone who started learning French in her 30s? Dr. Hartshorne says my language-learning ability had sharply declined by then and was getting worse each year. In his study, nonnative English speakers who had been immersed in English in their late 20s made only slightly fewer grammatical mistakes than native speakers in preschool. And though I live in France, I’m not immersed enough. I use French for work, but I speak lots of English too, including with my kids and husband. I don’t have an “école horizontale” — a romantic partner with whom I speak only French. I’ve tried to compensate by periodically taking French courses. And most mornings, I circle unknown words in Le Monde, then transfer them to sticky notes above my desk. But I recently discovered three notes reminding me that “ras-le-bol” means “fed up.” “Nothing seems to work as well as just speaking the language all the time,” Dr. Hartshorne said. You can learn basic grammar and vocabulary at any age. That explains my “good enough” French. But there’s also an enormous amount of low-frequency words and syntax that even native speakers might encounter only once a year. Knowing any one of these “occasional” words or phrasings isn’t essential. But in every context — a book, an article or conversation — there will probably be several. They’re part of what gives native speech its richness. In other words, no matter how many sentences I memorize or words I circle, there will always be more. “You can get pretty good pretty quickly, but getting really, really good takes forever,” Dr. Hartshorne explained. And your peak level might not last. I used to interview people in Portuguese; now the language merely sounds familiar. Most of what remains from three years of Japanese is a haiku I learned for extra credit in high school. Confidence matters too. It doesn’t help that with French, I’m studying a language that’s considered such a treasure that it’s presided over by a group known as “the immortals.” Dr. Hartshorne also points out that native speakers have exceptional precision. Even someone with 99 percent grammatical accuracy sounds foreign. He guesses that I have about 90 percent accuracy, which shouldn’t feel like failure. “Imagine if you decided you were going to pick up golf in your 30s, and you got to the point where you could keep up in a game with professional players. You’d think that’s actually really good. But for some reason, just being able to keep up in language feels not as impressive.” At least my struggle probably has health benefits. A study published in the journal Neurology found that being bilingual delays the onset of dementia by four and a half years. Another study found that bilinguals were better able to recover cognitively from a stroke. And I revel in small triumphs, like discovering that a woolen ball on a sweater is a “bouloche” (I learned this recently from my dry cleaner) and that French Jews and Christians use the familiar “tu” when addressing God. There’s also the pleasure of realizing that a French hypochondriac is merely a “hypocondriaque.” Often I can improvise. When my kids brought home notices telling me to check their hair for “poux” (pronounced “poo”), I correctly deduced that it meant lice. But later, in a first-aid course, I was perplexed when the instructor told us to immediately check an unconscious person for “poux.” (He demonstrated this by leaning over the mannequin’s head). It took me a while to realize that he was telling us to check for “pouls” — a pulse, pronounced identically. I should probably accept that my French will never spark joy in anyone else. It’s part of accepting, at midlife, that I’m subject to the same rules as other people and that there are things I won’t do. But I still expect to get much better one day. It would be hard to live here if I didn’t. I recently read an article — in English — claiming that many French people find their own language difficult and are convinced that they speak it poorly. Perhaps feeling bad about my French is proof that I’ve gone native after all.

2019,Opinion | Why Learn Another Language? Here’s Why,"letters Readers stress the importance of language study. To the Editor: Re “Don’t Let Language Education Slip,” by Bénédicte de Montlaur (Op-Ed, March 27): Speaking and understanding another language, or several, opens doors to worlds beyond and also deep within oneself. Knowing only a single language is not only a cultural limitation, but even more, a lack of access to other ways of thought and perception. The variety of our world cannot be sampled in a single neighborhood or country. Reality is strangled in such a vacuum. The fruits of multilingualism have enabled this kid from Brooklyn to live and work in a dozen countries. I wonder how foreign literary classics, art, philosophy and politics can be appreciated through a single lens, much less understanding the lives of those with whom one shares no common means of communication. But then what does it matter if one prefers a life surrounded by a wall? Art RosenbergCresskill, N.J. To the Editor: The lack of emphasis placed on languages is a challenge that must be addressed at every level of education and in the American culture at large. While the world stage rewards, even demands, the creation of global citizens who are culturally and linguistically fluent, the resources we allocate to language acquisition do not reflect this necessity. With an anti-immigration thread embedded in our political discourse, it is even more critical to emphasize language acquisition for American students and indeed for all Americans. Jenn KudererGoodview, Minn. To the Editor: As a high school student studying French, I can clearly see the benefits that it provides me both personally and academically. Learning another language allows me to communicate with people around the world and learn about other cultures in a less cursory and more genuine manner. For example, through learning French, I have made close friends I might not have been able to communicate with otherwise. In addition, numerous studies have shown the cognitive benefits of learning a language, like better perception and decision-making skills. The United States should prioritize the teaching of multiple languages in schools, as it encourages Americans to be more engaged global citizens and promotes the growth of essential skills like empathy and decision-making. Fiona McMahonSan Jose, Calif. To the Editor: As a former professor of French and Italian, I agree with Bénédicte de Montlaur’s observations about the importance of language learning. The cancellation of language programs is a direct result of the decades of cuts in public universities. While university leaders may want to develop well-informed citizens of the world, their balance sheets force them to seek funding from private sources or tuition increases. The free-market approach to program design creates a benefit to removing burdensome degree requirements, like a foreign language requirement. At the same time, students who might want to major in a language must consider whether that choice will allow them to pay back the student loans that a public education now requires. The defunding of our colleges has created a race to the bottom with little space for long-term societal goals. Richard KeatleyTucker, Ga.",The New York Times
2019,Why Music Festivals Need More Beyoncés,"in her words These events are still male-dominated, even though women are dominating music. You’re reading In Her Words, where women rule the headlines. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox. Let me know what you think at dearmaya@nytimes.com. “There’s not much that can be done about the past, but we can rewrite our future.” — Shirley Manson, lead singer of the band Garbage, on creating gender balance on stage at music festivals Like many, I spent two hours last week watching Beyoncé burn past all logical boundaries of musical performance in her new Netflix documentary, “Homecoming,” about her elaborate 2018 Coachella set. It was an epic show — so much so that fans nicknamed the whole event Beychella — but a rare one. She was the first black woman to headline Coachella in its 20-year history. Beyoncé is just one of several female artists — Ariana Grande, Cardi B, Kacey Musgraves, Halsey, Billie Eilish — dominating the music scene these days with No. 1 albums and songs, raking in awards and breaking records while they’re at it. But as we enter music festival season, you’d never know it. Female artists are usually starkly absent from headlining spots and are often a fraction of overall lineups. This month at Coachella, women made up 35 percent of acts, the same as last year, according to Book More Women, a group that manipulates posters of major festivals to show how few women were playing. Further, according to Nielsen, festivalgoers are majority female. Once upon a time (the 1990s), a salve to male-dominated music festivals was Lilith Fair, a woman-centric tour founded in part by the singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan. (It was the top-grossing festival in 1997, bringing in $16 million in North America.) McLachlan, reminiscing about what prompted her to start the event, told Glamour in 2017 that while looking at the festival scene, she thought: “Wow, they’re just full of men. And yet there’s all this amazing music being made by women right now. So why is that not being represented?” Last year, as a rallying cry against festivals where reports of assaults and rapes were widespread, the Statement Festival in Sweden billed itself as the world’s first music festival exclusively for women, transgender and nonbinary people — a “safe space” festival, if you will. But separating female acts from mainstream events is not the answer, some say. And demand for gender balance has been building. Starting last year, more than 100 festivals have agreed to aim for 50/50 gender parity by 2022 as part of an initiative called Keychange, introduced to address gender inequality at festivals. Here’s a look at how gender disparities played out on stage in 2018. ______ 19 percent That’s how many female acts made up the average lineup in 19 festivals, according to an analysis by Pitchfork. That’s an increase from 14 percent in 2017. The percentage of groups with at least one female or nonbinary member, held relatively steady at 11 percent. ______ 38 female artists That’s how many were on the bill for Lollapalooza out of 183 total acts, none of them headliners. ______ 7 women or women-led groups That’s how many were listed among 40 artists in the first 10 rows of Bonnaroo’s poster. ______ 3 festivals That’s how many reached gender parity last year, according to Pitchfork’s analysis.

2019,Why Scandinavian Banks’ Clean Reputations Are Threatened by Dirty Money,"FRANKFURT — Scandinavia has long had a reputation as one of the most progressive regions in the world, known for generous parental leaves, bicycle superhighways and Abba. So it has been a shock to see Scandinavian banks mired in a growing money laundering scandal, accused of helping Russian oligarchs, corrupt politicians and organized crime lords send hundreds of billions of ill-gotten dollars to offshore tax havens. Danske Bank, the largest bank in Denmark, was caught first for suspicious activities at its subsidiary in Estonia and, in the past couple weeks, the scandal has spread to Swedbank and its subsidiaries in the Baltics. Swedbank’s chairman, Lars Idermark, resigned Friday, saying that the media storm surrounding the money laundering allegations was a distraction from his day job as chief executive of a forest products company. Mr. Idermark’s exit came less than a week after the bank fired its chief executive, Birgitte Bonnesen, who had previously supervised Swedbank’s operations in the Baltic countries. The revelations are stunning for what had been respected institutions. How did the Swedes and Danes get sucked into underworld relationships? Why are American investigators — federal and New York State — poring over their accounts? And how does this all harken back to the fall of Communism two decades ago? Here are the answers to those and other questions. Danske Bank has admitted that its Estonian subsidiary helped thousands of customers, most of whom were not residents of Estonia, to launder tens of billions of euros from 2007 to 2015. Over the years, Danske Bank managers ignored or played down warnings about suspicious transactions by Estonian regulators, the Russian central bank, partner banks and its own internal auditors. The Estonian operation processed transactions worth 200 billion euros, or $225 billion, involving foreigners and generated profits far out of proportion to its size. The Danish bank regulator took little action and its money laundering unit was woefully understaffed. Danske Bank did not acknowledge the problems until 2017, after Danish media reported on them. The full scale of the wrongdoing did not become publicly known until September 2018, when Danske Bank released an investigation conducted by an outside law firm. The bank admitted that it had “clearly failed to live up to its responsibility” and the chief executive, Thomas Borgen, resigned under pressure. The allegations against Swedbank, which also involve its operations in the Baltics, have come to light in recent months after reports by Swedish public television. But the New York Department of Financial Services had been looking into possible money laundering at Swedbank for at least a year. In February, the department sent Swedbank’s New York subsidiary a letter with extensive questions about transactions involving Russian businesspeople and officials, offshore companies and banks in Ukraine, Cyprus and other countries that have been considered money laundering hubs. The action by the New York regulator is part of a larger inquiry stemming from the activities of Mossack Fonseca, the law firm whose efforts to help the superrich avoid taxes were exposed by the so-called Panama Papers, a trove of bank documents leaked to investigative journalists. The report by Swedish television suggested that Swedbank had also been a conduit for payments by the deposed Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych to his erstwhile adviser, Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman who has been convicted of tax evasion and bank fraud. A spokesman for the Department of Financial Services would not comment on the connection to Mr. Manafort, but the regulator’s letter to Swedbank in February requested information about transactions involving Mr. Yanukovych. Swedish prosecutors say that the country’s statute of limitations prevented them from pursuing money laundering charges against Swedbank since the suspected activity ended in 2014. But they are conducting a related investigation. Unnamed Swedbank employees are suspected of tipping off a select group of large investors that a scandal was about to break, a possible violation of insider trading laws. Last week, officials from the Swedish Economic Crime Authority raided Swedbank headquarters in Stockholm and seized documents as part of that investigation. Sweden’s financial industry regulator, known as Finansinspektionen, is also investigating, as are the Estonian authorities. Swedbank declined to comment. The Justice Department and other American officials have long done the heavy lifting when it comes to money laundering enforcement in Europe. That is because local authorities have often not been up to the task. Almost all big international banks, including Danske Bank and Swedbank, have subsidiaries in the United States that they use to process transactions in dollars. That gives federal and state investigators a legal foundation to travel far outside their borders. The Americans have done so aggressively. European lenders like ING Group in the Netherlands, Deutsche Bank in Germany or BNP Paribas in France have paid $16 billion in fines for money laundering infractions or sanction violations since 2012, according to a study published this past week by Moody’s Investors Service. More than three-quarters of that sum was imposed by the Justice Department or other American authorities, Moody’s said. The dominance of American investigators reflects the conflicted state of European enforcement. Responsibility rests primarily with national regulators, which often lack the resources and training to tackle money launderers or are unwilling to police big, politically connected lenders. Or they are prone to corruption themselves. “The banks and supervisory authorities have been very complacent,” said Nicolas Véron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a think tank in Brussels, who follows banking issues. “The system has failed.” The collapse of the Soviet bloc almost three decades ago opened up Eastern Europe to Western European banks. It was virgin territory — with millions of customers who previously had little or no access to credit — and the Western European banks carved up business along geographical and historical lines. The Scandinavian banks took the Baltics, while Austrian banks worked in Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and other places that had once been ruled by the Hapsburg dynasty. At the same time, Russia evolved into a crony capitalist economy, breeding oligarchs and officials who wanted to move money to havens outside the country. A logical place for them to go was Estonia, which has a large Russian-speaking population. Tallinn, the capital, is less than six hours by car from St. Petersburg. Danske Bank became a major force in Estonia in 2007 by acquiring the Finnish bank Sampo, which had a large foothold in the country. Sampo’s Estonian subsidiary was already a destination for foreign money. More than one quarter of its deposits in Estonia belonged to nonresidents, and the proportion continued to grow after Danske took over. But Danske’s oversight of the Estonian subsidiary was weak. Many of the transactions by foreign clients were obviously fishy, the bank’s own investigation found. Some customers were known criminals, or the money came from banks notorious for money laundering. Large numbers of customers had the same address or phone number, an indication they could be fronts. Some clients would transfer money to Estonia, then immediately transfer it again, often to an offshore account. That was a sign that lenders were being used to obscure the money’s origin. Further complicating matters, Danske allowed its Estonian operation to maintain a separate information technology system. Many documents were written in Estonian or Russian, making it difficult for compliance officers in Denmark to know what was going on. Now, operations that once seemed like lucrative outposts on the frontiers of capitalism have turned into liabilities for the Scandinavian banks. Danske pulled out of the Baltics earlier this year. Swedbank has said it remains committed to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.",The New York Times
2019,Why Soft Power Is in Style in Qatar,"Hundreds of influential faces in global politics, art, fashion and design descended on this tiny desert kingdom last week. DOHA, Qatar — Victoria Beckham came from London. Diane von Furstenberg and Alexander Wang from New York. Pierpaolo Piccioli of Valentino flew in from Rome, while Olivier Rousteing of Balmain and Giambattista Valli came from Paris. So did Carla Bruni, with her husband, former President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, firmly in tow. They were part of a pantheon of the biggest names in fashion that descended upon Doha last week, to mix with Qatari dignitaries and socialites and act as judges for the inaugural Fashion Trust Arabia prize. Twenty-four hours earlier, the same group — alongside the artist Jeff Koons and the soccer manager José Mourinho, as well as celebrities including Johnny Depp and Sonam Kapoor — had attended a star-spangled opening event for the new National Museum of Qatar, featuring Bedouin dancers, musicians, singers and flag-wielding horseback riders. Few, if any, of the boldface names at these gatherings had ever been to Doha before. Their en masse arrival, however, on the invitation of the ruling Al-Thani family, was an unmistakable demonstration of the unlikely influence of Qatar, a tiny Gulf state where vast natural gas resources were discovered almost 60 years ago, helping to make it the most wealthy country per capita in the world. It was also the latest move in a cultural and architectural arms race raging in the Gulf. Rival nations that stem from the same Bedouin roots, share the same religion and eat the same food compete to establish distinctive national identities and status amid political volatility, colliding cultures and intense economic upheaval. “Qatar is a very small but hugely wealthy state surrounded by countries that have long sought to minimize its potential to ascend as a major player in both the Arab region but also the greater world at large,” said Giorgio Cafiero, the chief executive of Gulf State Analytics, a Washington-based consultancy. “Qatar’s investments — especially in luxury, sports and the arts — aren’t just about prestige and profits,” Mr. Cafiero said. “They are also about hearts and minds, and anchored in forging deep alliances that give outside players a greater stake in the continuation of Qatar as an independent state.” The importance of shoring up soft power as part of a broader national security strategy has grown in importance for Qatar lately, as it faces the most serious external threat in its four-decade history. Since June 2017, a land and sea blockade led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and including Bahrain and Egypt, has cut the kingdom off from its neighbors. Overnight, planes and cargo ships were diverted, all diplomatic links were cut, and Qatar’s sole land border, a 40-mile stretch of desert with Saudi Arabia, was closed. Even camels were not spared the politics: 12,000 Qatari animals were forcibly repatriated. Riyadh and Abu Dhabi accused Qatar of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood, alongside other allegations, like assisting some popular Islamist movements that rose with the Arab Spring. So far, however, their demands — from noninterference in neighboring states to closing the al-Jazeera media network — have fallen upon deaf ears. Instead, Qatar has painted the dispute as a drive by bullying neighbors to crush its maverick, open-door foreign policy. “Isolation has, it seems, acted as a catalyst to Qatar’s long-term vision for itself,” said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a fellow for the Middle East at the Baker Institute at Rice University. Rather than being called to heel, the state scrambled to adapt to its new status quo. It has invested in its military, strengthened its alliance with Washington, shifted imports and shipping routes through countries like Turkey and Iran, and doubled down on its economic ties to global powers. Few expect the blockade to end any time soon, and so diplomatic tensions remain uncomfortably high. Consequently, as Qatar prepares to host the FIFA World Cup in 2022, it has furthered efforts to bolster its standing overseas, the better to guarantee its long-term survival. That said, spending unfathomable amounts of money beyond its own borders is a strategy the Qataris first embraced almost two decades ago. In a bid to diversify away from a carbon-based economy, Qatar has taken stakes in a wide variety of things, including the French soccer team Paris St. Germain and London’s Heathrow Airport, along with global finance, health care, technology and auto companies. It has made major donations to universities, including Georgetown and Carnegie Mellon, building sister campuses across Doha, and developed a London property portfolio larger than that of Queen Elizabeth II of Britain, according to a report in The Telegraph. The jewel in that portfolio is the Shard, the tallest building in western Europe. And that is just the beginning. In the art world, the buying power of the Qataris has — until recently — been essentially unmatched. It has been led by Sheikha Al Mayassa Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, the chair of Qatar Museums and sister of the emir, who holds an annual acquisitions budget estimated at $1 billion per year for blue-chip works. In fashion, Mayhoola for Investments (its name means “unknown” in Arabic), a secretive state-backed conglomerate linked to Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser Al-Missned, a global style icon and mother of the emir, owns several luxury brands, including Valentino and Balmain. Unsurprisingly, both brands emerged as major sponsors of the F.T.A. prize, which was founded by Sheikha Mozah; its co-chairs are Sheikha Al Mayassa and Tania Fares, a Lebanese philanthropist and British Vogue contributing editor who founded the Fashion Trust in Britain. Elsewhere, a string of sizable luxury investments has also been built up by the Qatar Investment Authority, the country’s sovereign wealth fund, from holdings in groups like LVMH to ownership of the upmarket British department store Harrods and luxury hotels like Claridge’s in London. Such Qatari-owned trophy assets have been hard hit by the ripple effect of the blockade, however, with wealthy Saudi and Emirati patrons opting to shop or stay elsewhere. Social media users in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — possibly orchestrated by their governments — frequently encourage others to boycott companies with links to Qatar. An unofficial blacklist of places in London, where many Middle Eastern visitors spend the summer months to escape the heat back home, was widely circulated online last year. It has not escaped the luxury industry that it may be a pawn in a geopolitical battle. “The severing of ties between Qatar and its neighbors is something many in the luxury industry have been paying close attention to,” said Alexander Bolen, the chief executive of the American fashion house Oscar de la Renta, which has a concession in Harrods and is sizing up expanding its retail footprint in the Gulf. “The Middle East is home to a significant proportion of extremely valuable clients, who spend at home but also extensively abroad,” Mr. Bolen said. “It is not in our interests to alienate anyone.” Many countries would have buckled under the type of restrictions imposed on Qatar by its larger and more powerful neighbors, but Qatar has refused to capitulate, albeit by spending heavily and dipping deeply into its $340 billion reserve funds to establish new trading partners, build up domestic industries and, in some cases, create new ones. Nevertheless, the kingdom’s fledgling tourism industry has taken a hit, leaving hotel rooms empty and a glut of retail space in malls. At the same time, consumer prices have gone up, cutting into the budgets of the foreign workers who make up 88 percent of the country’s population of 2.4 million people. Not that this has stopped Western brands from opening stores in Doha. Earlier this year, for example, Ralph & Russo, a couture house based in London, opened its biggest boutique in the world at the Lagoona Mall in Doha. Measuring more than 3,000 square feet, it is decorated in silver, alabaster, light beige and rose gold with a colossal mirrored Murano glass chandelier as a centerpiece. “Sheikha Mozah discovered us, was hugely supportive of the business, and since then our relationship with our Qatari clientele has just been phenomenal,” said Michael Russo, the chief executive of Ralph & Russo. “They are a small but extremely valuable customer base for us, so it made total sense to ensure that we could offer them collections on their home turf.” Mario Ortelli, a managing partner of the luxury consultancy Ortelli & Co., said that Qatar remained a niche but important market for luxury companies, with residents who have significant disposable income and a preference for European brands. “The biggest impact of the embargo has been that rather than spending abroad, more and more of those Qataris are opting to spend at home, partly for reasons of practicality and partly through patriotism,” he said. “Even if things stay slower in the short-term, the expectation is that things will definitely pick up significantly ahead of major high-profile events such as the World Cup.” Observers such as Mr. Cafiero of Gulf State Analytics and Dr. Coates Ulrichsen of the Baker Institute say it is the blockading countries, rather than Qatar, that have found themselves on the back foot in recent months. While Qatar is hardly immune to international criticism, which has largely focused on evidence of exploitation of its migrant workers and government support for the Muslim Brotherhood, Saudi Arabia was publicly condemned across the West after the killing last fall of the dissident Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist who was ambushed and dismembered by Saudi agents in Istanbul. The murder has tarnished Saudi Arabia’s reputation in Washington, and in much of the Western world, with a dark shadow cast over previously heralded plans for economic and social reform in the country, championed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler. At the same time, Dubai’s economy is teetering on the brink of another downturn thanks to a shaky real estate market, its reputation as a sun-and-shopping haven dampened by sluggish travel demand in the region. The disappearance of Qatari wallets hasn’t helped. “The biggest loser from the blockade is not Qatar, it is Dubai, where Qataris both spent a lot of money recreationally and used the city as a logistics hub. Now all that money is gone,” Mr. Cafiero said. “While the blockade initially hit the Qatari economy hard and officials had to spend billions of dollars restructuring trade routes, they appear to have done so in a relatively short period of time. It may have a very small population, but Qatar continues to hold very big ambitions.” At the F.T.A. ceremony on March 28, there was little talk of the blockade — at least not publicly. Instead, the focus was on the winners. Each would receive industry mentorship, up to $200,000 in funding for their brands and be stocked internationally by Matchesfashion.com, a luxury e-commerce platform. Two Lebanese women’s wear designers, Salim Azzam and Roni Helou, were jointly awarded the inaugural ready-to-wear prize; Krikor Jabotian, also from Lebanon, scooped up the evening wear accolade. Other awards went to the Egyptian bag brand Sabry Marouf, the Moroccan footwear label Zyne and the Lebanese jewelry brand Mukhi Sisters. Hints that the game of influence transcended fashion and good intentions to verge on political calculation kept coming through. Of the 25 finalists whittled down from an initial 250 applicants, none came from Saudi Arabia, which hosted its inaugural fashion week in Riyadh last year. A handful, however, came from Dubai and Egypt, with their participation warmly welcomed by Sheikha Al Mayassa during an interview in her office at the National Museum ahead of the event. Later, from a lectern on the stage, she reiterated her hopes for the start of an emerging fashion industry in the Middle East that could transcend regional borders but be rooted in Qatar. “Like other branches of the arts, fashion enables us to dream and express ourselves,” she said. “This prize will now anchor fashion as a major creative field in Qatar and across the Arab world.” She acknowledged, as well, the complicated situation that was the backdrop for the festivities. “At the time this prize was conceived, political realities were different than they are today,” she said. “As a nation, we have remained open to applications from all countries. It is unfortunate that in this day and age, some individuals can hinder the course of progress and prosperity for millions of people without being held accountable for their whimsical and detrimental actions. We, on the other hand, have chosen not to follow suit.”",The New York Times

2019,Why This Week Is Big for Housing Fixes,"California Today Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Late last year, I spoke with State Senator Scott Wiener about his Senate Bill 50, a second pass at a controversial fix for the state’s housing affordability crisis. This week, that bill — along with others that take aim at various tension points in the housing debate — will face some early but important tests. My colleague Conor Dougherty, who has written extensively about housing in California, explained what’s at stake: Pretty much anytime a group of experts is asked to prescribe a solution to California’s affordable housing crisis, the consensus view that comes out is that the state needs one set of policies that make it easier to build more and taller housing and another set that protects already-affordable housing and tenants in units that already exist. This week, bills that broadly address both sides of that equation — and could drastically change what California cities look like and how local landlords operate — are headed to crucial committee hearings that will go a long way toward determining how ambitious the current State Legislature will be on housing. On Wednesday, S.B. 50, which was introduced by Senator Scott Wiener, a Democrat from San Francisco, will have its second committee hearing. S.B. 50, which is a rehashed version of Mr. Wiener’s controversial S.B. 827 bill from last year, would essentially force cities to allow denser apartment buildings near transit stops and job centers. The next day, several pro-tenant bills are headed to the State Assembly’s housing committee. One of the bills, A.B. 36, would allow cities to bring more units under rent control, while another, A.B. 1482, would impose a statewide rent cap. Were A.B. 1482 to get out of committee and ultimately pass, California would follow Oregon as the second state to pass statewide rent control. Of course, there’s a long way to go until the legislative session ends in September, and these housing bills — along with the dozens of others that would, among other things, create homeless shelters, subsidized legal aid, streamline housing approvals and create a rental registry — can always be killed and amended at various points along the way. The friction between the competing views on how to solve the housing crisis was thrust onto doorsteps this week when the prominent backer of a recent rent control initiative sent out a series of political mailers that said S.B. 50 would accelerate gentrification, and, evoking 1960s urban renewal programs and the author James Baldwin, likened the bill to “Negro removal.” The mailers were widely condemned by African-American leaders including London Breed, the mayor of San Francisco. Housing is atop the list of California’s biggest problems, and the year began with bold bills to try to fix it.

2019,Trump Wants to Block Deutsche Bank From Sharing His Financial Records,"Over two decades, Deutsche Bank lent Donald J. Trump billions of dollars, even as his tarnished financial record put him off limits for most of Wall Street. “You are a great friend,” Mr. Trump wrote to his Deutsche Bank contact in 1998. “We have a great relationship,” he said in 2013. “They are totally happy with me,” he declared three years later. Now, Deutsche Bank is putting the president on the defensive. Lawyers for the bank have spent months cooperating with investigators from two Democratic-controlled congressional committees, which issued what one lawmaker called a “friendly subpoena” to the bank in mid-April. The bank could end up sharing decades of his personal and corporate financial records. That prospect prompted Mr. Trump to file a lawsuit in federal court in Manhattan on Monday in an attempt to block Deutsche Bank and another financial company, Capital One, from sharing documents. Mr. Trump’s lawyers said the subpoenas had no legitimate purpose and were an attempt to pry into his finances for political gain. The heads of the two committees that issued the subpoena, Representatives Maxine Waters and Adam B. Schiff, called the suit “meritless” and an attempt to obstruct congressional oversight. The rich trove of records held by Deutsche Bank includes internal corporate documents, descriptions of the value of Mr. Trump’s assets, and portions of his personal and business tax returns. The subpoena, issued April 15, casts a wide net for documents related to Mr. Trump’s businesses and other entities, including family trusts. If the bank handed over even parts of Mr. Trump’s returns, it would be a dramatic end run around the president, who broke with decades of precedent by refusing to release them during the 2016 campaign. Mr. Trump’s lawsuit puts the financially ailing Deutsche Bank in an awkward situation. The German lender’s share price has fallen substantially over the past decade, and politicians and regulators in Germany are pushing for it to make radical changes to reduce its riskiness and improve profitability. Last week, Deutsche Bank’s future became even murkier after it abandoned talks to merge with another large German lender, Commerzbank. Mr. Trump has broadly sought to keep his finances private during his presidency. He told The New York Times in 2017 that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, would cross a line by examining his family’s finances beyond any relationship with Russia. In a sign of Mr. Trump’s sensitivity to the cache of documents held by Deutsche Bank, he erupted in anger later that year in response to news reports that Mr. Mueller had subpoenaed his records from the bank. The reports turned out to be inaccurate. Since Democrats took control of the House of Representatives in January, Deutsche Bank officials have been working closely with investigators from the chamber’s Financial Services and Intelligence Committees to identify information that might assist their investigations into the president, according to people familiar with the discussions. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions. Bank officials have told The Times that they were eager to provide the materials to Congress. In part, they said additional transparency might help squelch speculation that Deutsche Bank had served as a conduit for Russian money to get to Mr. Trump. Despite that willingness to cooperate the bank appeared ready to leave the legal battle to House Democrats and let the courts decide what it must do. “We remain committed to providing appropriate information to all authorized investigations and will abide by a court order regarding such investigations,” a Deutsche Bank spokeswoman, Kerrie McHugh, said in a statement. Deutsche Bank has been cooperative with Congress in recent months. Lawyers for the bank worked with congressional staff members to narrow the scope of the subpoena to make it easier for the bank to quickly produce the requested materials, according to the people. That assistance was apparently what led Mr. Schiff, the Intelligence Committee’s chairman, to praise their cooperation and to describe the demand for materials as a “friendly subpoena.” The subpoena demanded Deutsche Bank hand over materials related to the Trump family’s companies — including “parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, branches, divisions, partnerships, properties, groups, special purpose entities, joint ventures, predecessors, successors or any other entity in which they have or had a controlling interest.” It also sought information about any accounts held by Mr. Trump and his immediate family, including materials that were provided to the bank when those accounts were opened. The bank has detailed financial materials on some of Mr. Trump’s children and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a senior White House adviser. The deadline to comply with the subpoena was May 6. Deutsche Bank executives and congressional investigators, led by a pair of former Manhattan federal prosecutors, expected that Mr. Trump would mount a legal challenge to block the bank from complying with the subpoena, according to the people. But bank officials have nonetheless compiled reams of materials to hand over. Included in those documents are multiple pages from each of Mr. Trump’s annual federal tax returns, which the bank received before lending him hundreds of millions of dollars for the Doral golf resort in Florida and the Old Post Office hotel project in Washington, according to current and former bank employees. Despite the amiable history between Mr. Trump and Deutsche Bank, the lawsuit is not the first court fight between them. In fall 2008, Mr. Trump defaulted on a loan from Deutsche Bank, then sued it, claiming it had caused the financial crisis and engaged in predatory lending against him. Deutsche Bank responded by suing Mr. Trump, demanding that he immediately repay the portion of the loan, $40 million, that he had personally guaranteed. The litigation lasted into 2010. After the suit was settled, Deutsche Bank resumed lending to Mr. Trump, dispensing more than $300 million to him over the next several years.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Why Trump Won’t Stop Talking About Ilhan Omar,"The president is following a Republican playbook that is now nearly two decades old. Opinion Columnist It’s still common to hear analysts speak of the “Trumpification” of the Republican Party — the extent to which it has adopted the attitude and ethos of the sitting president. But this phrasing assumes discontinuity between past and present, as if there weren’t antecedents to Donald Trump in the recent Republican past. The actual relationship between Trump and the Republican Party is more psychological. Trump is the Republican id personified, driven to express the impulses and desires of conservative politics in their basest form. That dynamic has been on clear display for the past few days, as the president of the United States leads a campaign of racist demagoguery against Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, a Somali-American Democrat and one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress. The pretext for this attack was Omar’s remarks last month at a fund-raiser for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. Omar talked about several issues but her major theme was prejudice against Muslim Americans. “Here’s the truth,” she said. “For far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen. Frankly, I’m tired of it. And every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it. CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.” CAIR was actually founded in 1994, but Omar’s point is clear: A small group of Muslims committed the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, but many Americans blamed Islam itself. Muslims quickly became targets of fear, disdain and demagogic political rhetoric. A 2004 report from the American Civil Liberties Union showed widespread attacks on the civil rights of Muslims in the United States, including harassment and racial profiling by federal law enforcement. The way Representative Omar’s address made its way to President Trump is emblematic of how inflammatory ideas and rhetoric are transmitted from individual lawmakers and conservative media to the national stage. Omar spoke in public — Fox News even streamed it for its audience. But it wasn’t a controversy until it reached the ears of Representative Dan Crenshaw of Texas, a Republican who took the snippet on 9/11 and framed it as something disrespectful. “First Member of Congress to ever describe terrorists who killed thousands of Americans on 9/11 as ‘some people who did something,’” Crenshaw said on Twitter. “Unbelievable.” With that, the wider world of conservative media pounced. “You have to wonder if she’s an American first,” declared Brian Kilmeade, one of the hosts of “Fox & Friends” on Fox News. The Rupert Murdoch-owned New York Post took it a step further with a Thursday front page showing a photo from 9/11 — the moment the second plane crashed into the World Trade Center — with the headline, “Here’s Your Something.” On Friday, Trump stepped into the fray with a video. Footage from the Sept. 11 attacks is edited together with Omar saying “Some people did something” to create the impression of dismissive contempt for the dead. Trump captioned the video “WE WILL NEVER FORGET!” He later retweeted an account that called Omar a “sick monster.” The president continued his attacks on Monday, attempting to disparage House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in the process. “Before Nancy, who has lost all control of Congress and is getting nothing done, decides to defend her leader, Rep. Omar, she should look at the anti-Semitic, anti-Israel and ungrateful U.S. HATE statements Omar has made,” he said on Twitter. “She is out of control, except for her control of Nancy!” Crenshaw may have sparked these attacks, but the president’s intervention has escalated the situation to something potentially dangerous, which is why — after a slow start — Democrats have begun to condemn the president’s actions, defending Omar by name. “Ilhan Omar is a leader with strength and courage. She won’t back down to Trump’s racism and hate, and neither will we,” said Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. “The disgusting and dangerous attacks against her must end.” Likewise, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts accused Trump of “inciting violence against a sitting Congresswoman — and an entire group of Americans based on their religion.” That, of course, is the idea. Trump believes he benefits from the passions and anger stirred by racist demagoguery. It is easy to tie these attacks to Trump’s history of anti-Muslim rhetoric. But anti-Muslim prejudice was common in Republican politics before he stepped on the political stage with his “birther” charges against President Barack Obama. It was an important force among Republican voters — in one 2004 poll, for example, about 40 percent of self-identified Republicans said that Muslim Americans should be required to register with the government and 41 percent said that Muslim-American civic groups should be infiltrated by the government. Well before Obama was a household name and Trump a political figure, a 2006 Gallup poll found wide anti-Muslim prejudice “with Republicans ascribing more negative political and religious qualities to Muslims, and being more opposed to having Muslims as neighbors than are Democrats and independents.” It was an important force in conservative media. Conservative radio and television hosts frequently conflated all Muslims with the actions of extremists. In one 2006 segment on his radio show, Glenn Beck warned that if “good Muslims” aren’t “the first ones in the recruitment office lining up to shoot the bad Muslims in the head,” then “human beings” might be forced into “putting up razor wire and putting you on one side of it.” And it found traffic with Republican politicians. After Keith Ellison became the first Muslim elected to Congress in 2006, Representative Virgil Goode of Virginia wrote a letter to voters in his district stating his fear that “in the next century we will have many more Muslims in the United States if we do not adopt the strict immigration policies that I believe are necessary to preserve the values and beliefs traditional to the United States of America and to prevent our resources from being swamped.” Anti-Muslim prejudice surfaced throughout the 2008 presidential campaign. Donald Trump has simply brought this rhetoric to the bully pulpit of the American presidency. He has taken everything coursing through the last 20 years of Republican politics and made it explicit. It now has an official seal of approval. And if Omar is a target, it has little to do with what she said and everything to do with who she is: A black Muslim woman — and an immigrant — whose very person disrupts the exclusionary ideal of a white Christian America. The difference between the pre-Trump era and the present, in other words, isn’t the substance of belief but its expression — and the force of the venom, contempt and hatred behind it.

2019,Opinion | Why We Need ‘Game of Thrones’,"The epic fantasy series is more than just escape. It is a way of imagining our way to the future. Ms. Newitz is a science journalist and novelist. “Game of Thrones” returns on Sunday, and with it, the inevitable onslaught of “winter is finally here” memes and a sudden obsession with dragons, knights and internecine feudal politics. But the show isn't just warmed-over fantasy tropes. Its conflicts have become part of our public discourse, and Westeros, its fictional kingdom, has become an allegory for America. This isn’t the first time a medieval fantasy has served this purpose. “Lord of the Rings” grew out of J.R.R. Tolkien’s traumatic experiences as a soldier in World War I. It achieved widespread popularity in the United States during the 1960s and ’70s, when hippies joked about electing the wise wizard Gandalf as president and wore “Frodo Lives!” buttons, an emblem of their solidarity with the idyllic, communal life of the Shire. After the Sept. 11 attacks, the massive multiplayer game “World of Warcraft” dominated the global gaming market. Its story of war between the orc-led Horde and human-led Alliance was set in an immersive, intricately detailed medieval fantasy world. J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter novels, in which the young heroes battle an evil wizard who perverts democracy, climbed the best-seller lists during the same period. Magic rules all of these realms, reducing complex social and political conflicts to battles over spells and ensorcellment. Whenever there’s trouble in the land, it seems, our narrative appetites lead us backward in time, offering escape in tales of a world before modern statehood and techno-capitalism. But escapism isn’t just a flight from reality. Ursula Le Guin, the celebrated fantasy author, once asked, “If a soldier is imprisoned by the enemy, don’t we consider it his duty to escape?” She was writing about Tolkien, arguing that escapism in all its forms is a survival strategy, a way to think ourselves out of traps. In Ms. Le Guin’s Earthsea novels, wizards craft magic out of words, trying to prevent a creeping global sickness by, in essence, telling the right story. If we think of fantasy as a way to escape from a dark fate, “Game of Thrones” is a skeleton key. In that case, what is the prison? And why does the path always seem to lead through the Middle Ages? One possible answer is that “Game of Thrones” is not actually about the past at all. It fits within a long tradition of books suggesting that our planet’s distant future might look a lot like the distant past. This idea goes back generations. In Edgar Rice Burroughs’s pulpy 1912 novella “A Princess of Mars,” a medieval Martian civilization is all that remains of a previously hyper-advanced, technologically sophisticated world. Jack Vance’s wildly popular 1950s series “Dying Earth” imagined an earth so old that its sun is fading, the moon is gone and magic rules. More recently, David Mitchell’s “Cloud Atlas” and N.K. Jemisin’s “Broken Earth” trilogy hint that the far future might look very much like ancient history. Both authors describe worlds in which people have returned to Neolithic or medieval ways of life, largely because their civilizations have made catastrophic political and environmental mistakes. It isn’t easy to imagine our distant future without fiction. We have computer models to forecast what centuries of climate change might do to the earth, and some vague notions of how this might transform our social and economic systems. But when the crisis at hand is about elections and economic recessions, it’s hard to make decisions that take that faraway world into account. Perhaps “Game of Thrones” functions as a cultural reset button, inviting us to imagine how we might redo nationhood and industrialism if we had the chance. What if we could enter the modern era again, and do it right this time? Maybe this time, enlightened despots won’t grind up the peasants in an endless war. That’s why pseudo-historical stories are, oddly, the keys to thinking about what comes next for planet earth. Will our fortified border walls be all that remains after climate disaster? Or will we finally put aside political rivalries to save ourselves? We can explore our options while acknowledging the likelihood that we’ll make mistakes. “Game of Thrones” feels relevant now, not simply because it allows us to speculate about which terrible real-life leader most resembles the sadistic King Joffrey, or see how climate change can blight the land with supernatural force. Like other medieval tales, “Game of Thrones” is not a precise allegory. Instead, it slakes our thirst for narratives that remind us that humanity will have a distant future, in whatever form it takes. We are building it right now. In the near future, as we face the increasing likelihood of catastrophe, we need to unleash our imagination. We will need it to find the escape route.

2019,"Why Whales and Dolphins Join the Navy, in Russia and the U.S.","At War Fishermen off the northeastern coast of Norway may have spotted the first evidence of a renewed Russian program to use marine mammals for military operations, according to widespread media reports on Tuesday. Last week, local fisherman noticed a beluga whale near their boat that seemed to want their attention. As they got closer, they saw a harness strapped to the beluga, outfitted with mounts for GoPro-type cameras. Further inspection revealed “St. Petersburg equipment” embossed on the harness clips. Norwegian scientists told reporters that they believed the mammal was trained by the Russian Navy. Russian authorities haven’t commented on the speculation, but it’s unlikely the whale was wearing the harness to record his own home videos. [For more stories about the experiences and costs of war, sign up for the weekly At War newsletter.] The use of animals for military operations isn’t all that unusual. During the Cold War, the Soviet navy trained dolphins for military use, but the program was discontinued sometime after 1991. The United States Navy has studied marine mammals, including beluga whales, since the 1960s and has trained them to carry out a variety of tasks, like performing recovery operations and finding underwater mines. The Times reporter John Ismay served as a Navy explosive ordnance disposal officer and explains the kinds of things dolphins, whales and sea lions are trained to do. Yes, as strange as it may sound, the Navy uses dolphins for a variety of missions. The Naval Information Warfare Center, Pacific, trains Atlantic bottlenose dolphins on a base in Point Loma, Calif., while the Navy’s explosive ordnance disposal community uses the mammals for many of its operations. During the summer of 1998, before my senior year at the Naval Academy, I was temporarily assigned to an explosive ordnance disposal unit at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado that had several marine mammal detachments. One looked for trained enemy divers, another looked for naval mines floating in the water column and another searched for mines lying on the seafloor. Another detachment trained sea lions to help recover expensive items like inert torpedoes off the seafloor so that the Navy could reuse them. Two big reasons. One, their bio-sonar is better than any mechanical sonar ever made. Dolphins produce sonar waves from their foreheads, and they can quickly locate things that humans cannot. Second, they can repeatedly dive deeper than human divers, reaching underwater depths that we could otherwise reach only using robots. The dolphins “see” enemy frogmen by sensing sound waves bouncing off the hard calcium deposits in human bones, and can sense mines buried by mud and silt on the seafloor by sensing the air void inside the mine’s casing. The dolphins live in netted pens suspended from floating docks near the entrance to San Diego Bay. They are fed a tailored diet of herring and mackerel among several kinds of fish daily. Through positive reinforcement with food and affection, each dolphin is trained to identify specific types of target — such as people, moored mines or bottom mines. When it is time to work, a sailor communicates with the dolphin through a combination of whistles and hand signals. The dolphin then kicks its way up and out of the water, sliding onto a wetted mat laid on the dock. Sailors carry the dolphin to a small motorboat that is cut down to the waterline on one side, which allows the handlers to drive to the search area and slide the mammal gently into the water. They then use a device called a transducer that radiates certain sound tones into the water to signal to the dolphin that it is time to search. Once the dolphin has found its target — either human or a mine — it is brought back into the boat, which then swiftly exits the area so that sailors can take over the mission. For enemy frogmen, that can mean tossing concussion grenades into the water. For mines, bomb disposal divers or remotely operated vehicles go into the water to neutralize or destroy them. No. That’s a common misunderstanding. You can find rumors all over the internet to the contrary about dolphins being strapped with nuclear warheads for suicide missions, but that has never happened. Their mission is simply to find and mark things, and then exit the area as quickly as possible; there are no weaponized dolphins. As someone who swam around moored warships as a “target” for the Navy’s dolphins, I can tell you that they are amazingly fast. Enemy swimmers often will not know they’ve been marked until grenades start exploding around them underwater and the dolphins are long gone. Absolutely. That summer we loaded the dolphins onto a padded stretcher-like apparatus with cutouts for their pectoral fins. We lowered them into small water-filled tubs, and drove to Naval Air Station North Island nearby. There, we rolled the wheeled tubs onto a C-5 Galaxy cargo plane and flew them to Hickam Air Force Base in Oahu. Sailors and veterinarians tended to the dolphins during the entire flight — continually spraying the exposed tops of their bodies with water so that their skin would not dry out. From there, it was a short drive to the amphibious ship Juneau, where the pools were already inflated and filled with seawater. By the time we finished work, every place to eat on base had long since closed and we were exhausted. No one had eaten anything since leaving San Diego because the rule was that the dolphins were always fed first. That night I learned a leadership lesson I have never forgotten, though. The commander of the explosive ordnance disposal training unit at Barbers Point was a prior enlisted officer, and he knew that when we were done for the night that we would most likely be tired and starving. He rolled up around midnight in an old fastback Mustang with bags of chips and a case of beer. He could have directed one of his subordinates to take care of us, but he showed up and did it himself. For the most part, yes. One time, though, a male dolphin named Jake got a little aggressive with me and punched me underwater with his snout hard enough to tear an oblique muscle in my abdomen. After he hit me, Jake “bowed” out of the water (jumping clear of the water and splashing down) all the way back to his pickup boat. I was told it’s a sign of a very happy dolphin. A couple of weeks later, when I went to sick call on the Juneau to get some Motrin for the pain, the Navy doctor did not believe me when I said I was injured by a dolphin and he threatened to write me up. I told him if he didn’t believe me, he should go down to the ship’s well-deck and see the large inflatable pools there — each one had a dolphin in it.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Why You Can No Longer Get Lost in the Crowd,"Once, it was easy to be obscure. Technology has ended that. Dr. Hartzog is a professor of law and computer science. Dr. Selinger is a professor of philosophy. We are constantly exposed in public. Yet most of our actions will fade into obscurity. Do you, for example, remember the faces of strangers who stood in line with you the last time you bought medicine at a drugstore? Probably not. Thanks to limited memory and norms against staring, they probably don’t remember yours either. This is what it means to be obscure. And our failure to collectively value this idea shows where we’ve gone wrong in the debates over data and surveillance. Lawmakers and industry leaders are missing the big picture. They are stuck on traditional concepts like “transparency,” “consent” and “secrecy,” which leads to proposals that reinforce broken mechanisms like consenting to unreadable terms of service. They are operating under the dangerous illusion that there’s a clear distinction between what’s public and what’s private. Most people probably intuitively know that their most deeply held secrets are private while the things about them that are commonly known or widely broadcast are not. But what about information about our everyday actions that is shared with some but not all? Obscurity bridges this privacy gap with the idea that the parts of our lives that are hard or unlikely to be found or understood are relatively safe. It is a combination of the privacy you have in public and the privacy you have in groups. Obscurity is a barrier that can shield you from government, corporate and social snoops. And until lawmakers, corporate leaders and citizens embrace obscurity and move to protect it, your freedom and opportunities to flourish will be in jeopardy. The concept was first meaningfully articulated in a landmark 1989 Supreme Court decision, Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, which recognized a privacy interest in the “practical obscurity” of information that was technically available to the public but could be found only by spending an unrealistic amount of time and effort. After the concept was introduced, most lawmakers, judges and the tech industry promptly forgot about it. This has dulled the potential of obscurity as a rallying point for change and leaves society struggling to protect something in dire need of defining and defending. Understanding obscurity means paying attention to how space, time and people’s cognitive limitations make it difficult for others to surveil us or find out things about us. Consider space. The further away people are, the harder it is to see with the naked eye who they are and where they’re going. Usually, we are visible only to those nearby. But cellphone location data can reveal that same highly personal information to anyone with means and motivation. We should be disturbed that apps often collect location data simply because they can and that T-Mobile, Sprint and AT&T reportedly have illegally sold customers’ 911 location data to third parties. And we should be pleased that the Supreme Court ruled last year in Carpenter vs. United States that, under the Fourth Amendment, cellphone records can’t be seized without a warrant. Consider time. Memories fade as time passes. But the internet has impeccable recall. That’s why we should applaud the senators who have proposed a bipartisan update to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act that would give parents and children an “eraser button” to remove a child’s data from platforms like Google and Facebook. It’s also why we should be skeptical of Mark Zuckerberg’s announcement that Facebook will become a more “privacy-focused platform” that emphasizes features like ephemeral, expiring information. Truly ephemeral communications are certainly obscure, but it’s unclear what information Facebook will scrub on the front end (for users) and the back end (from the company). The company’s history suggests we shouldn’t let our guard down. Obscurity is also a better way to understand Europe’s “right to be forgotten” law, which can’t make anyone forget anything, but can make the remnants of your awkward youth harder to find online. Finally, consider cognitive limitations. Facial recognition technology poses an immense danger to society because it can be used to overcome biological constraints on how many individuals anyone can recognize in real time. If its use continues to grow and the right regulations aren’t instituted, we might lose the ability to go out in public without being recognized by the police, our neighbors and corporations. Creating strong regulations for the technology is going to be an uphill battle, especially because it’s already become widespread, being deployed at airports to make boarding easier and adopted by schools to increase safety. It is even being used at summer camps so parents can automatically receive photos in which their children appear. Threats to our obscurity are growing because technology is making our personal information easy and cheap to aggregate, archive and interpret — with substantial growth in predictive analytics, too. To see what we mean, just look yourself up on the website MyLife and marvel at how much information has been cobbled together from different moments in your life for anyone to see at the click of a button. Even speaking in hushed tones to a friend at a crowded cafe might not be enough to protect your obscurity if cameras are someday equipped with lip-reading artificial intelligence software. Obscurity is vital to our well-being for several reasons. It gives us breathing room to go about our daily routines with little fear of being judged, sent unwanted ads, gossiped about or needlessly shamed. [As technology advances, will it continue to blur the lines between public and private? Sign up for Charlie Warzel’s limited-run newsletter to explore what’s at stake and what you can do about it.] Obscurity makes meaningful and intimate relationships possible, ones that offer solidarity, loyalty and love. It allows us to choose with whom we want to share different kinds of information. It protects us from having everyone know the different roles we play in the different parts of our lives. We need to be able to play one role with our co-workers while revealing other parts of ourselves with friends and family. Indeed, obscurity is one reason we feel safe bonding with others over our shared vulnerabilities, our mutual hopes, dreams and fears. Obscurity enables us to develop and grow as individuals. It provides us collectively with spaces to explore new and controversial possibilities, to transgress taboos and ignore arbitrary rules. You might have thought you could skip church without anyone knowing, but churches are being marketed facial recognition systems that will make sure your absences are duly noted. It won’t stop there. Obscurity protects us from being pressured to be conventional. This buffer from a ubiquitous permanent record is especially important for the exploratory phase of youth. To develop as humans, people must be free to try things they might later regret. This is how we become better people. Without obscurity, we wouldn’t have the freedom to take risks, fail and dust ourselves off. We’d be stymied by the fear of being deemed failures by a system that never forgets. Finally, obscurity is crucial to democracy. Obscurity fosters civic participation and gives us the confidence to attend political protests and engage in political speech online without worrying about ending up on a government watch list. It’s why the American Civil Liberties Union worries about the government monitoring social media. Things can be private even if others can see them. And there is so much of our lives that industry and governments have yet to find. But in our status-obsessed culture, it can be hard to appreciate that the opposite of obscurity isn’t fame, but chillingly oppressive fear.

2019,Opinion | Why You Love Mayor Pete,"Buttigieg detaches progressive policy from the culture war. Opinion Columnist Pete Buttigieg has some kind of magic right now. His campaign bio, “Shortest Way Home,” was the 25th-best-selling book on Amazon when I checked on Monday. That put him just a few dozen places behind Michelle Obama, and thousands or tens of thousands of places ahead of Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and the other candidates who have campaign books out now. In a recent Iowa poll he surged to third place. His campaign just announced that it’s raised an impressive $7 million since January. And I can’t tell you how many Democrats in places as diverse as Nebraska, Indiana, New York and Washington have come up to me over the last few weeks raving about the guy. I met a superfan in Frederick, Md., who says that every few hours she calls the campaign to give another $10. This is the biggest star-is-born moment since Lady Gaga started singing “Shallow.” Why are people so in love with the mayor of South Bend, Ind., who almost nobody had heard of until he did a CNN town hall on March 10? It’s important to remember that when Democrats vote next year, they’ll not only be choosing a policy alternative to Donald Trump, they’ll also be making a statement about what kind of country they want America to be. The Trump era has been all about dissolving moral norms and waging vicious attacks. This has been an era of culture war, class warfare and identity politics. It’s been an era in which call-out culture, reality TV melodrama and tribal grandstanding have overshadowed policymaking and the challenges of actually governing. The Buttigieg surge suggests that there are a lot of Democrats who want to say goodbye to all that. They don’t want to fight fire and divisiveness with more fire and divisiveness. They don’t want to fight white identity politics with another kind of identity politics. They are sick of the moral melodrama altogether. They just want a person who is more about governing than virtue-signaling, more about friendliness and basic decency than media circus and rhetorical war. Buttigieg’s secret is that he transcends many of the tensions that run through our society in a way that makes people on all sides feel comfortable. First, he is young and represents the rising generation, but he is also an older person’s idea of what a young person should be. He’d be the first millennial president, but Buttigieg doesn’t fit any of the stereotypes that have been affixed to America’s young people. Young people are supposed to be woke social justice warriors who are disgusted by their elders. Buttigieg is the model young man who made his way impressing his elders — Harvard, Rhodes scholar, McKinsey, the Navy. Young hipsters are supposed to flock to coastal places like Brooklyn and Portland; after college, Buttigieg returned to Indiana. Young people are supposed to be anti-institutional, but Buttigieg is very institutional — his life has been defined by his service to organizations, not his rebellion against them. Second, he is gay and personifies the progress made by the L.G.B.T.Q. movement, but he doesn't do so in a way that feels threatening or transgressive to social conservatives. He has conservative family values; it’s just that his spouse is a husband, not a wife. He speaks comfortably about his faith and says that when he goes to church he prefers a conservative liturgy to anything experimental. Third, he is a localist and a Washington outsider, but he carries no populist resentment and can easily speak the language of the coastal elite. Buttigieg has spent his political career in Indiana, where pols are expected to go to county fairs and eat the catfish fillet and cheesecake on a stick. He wasn’t alive when the Studebaker plant shut down in South Bend, but he has the trauma of Midwestern deindustrialization in his bones. He lives in a house near his mother where the mortgage comes to about $450 a month. On the other hand, he was friends with Mark Zuckerberg at Harvard, earned a first at Oxford and thrived as a corporate consultant. Finally, he’s a progressive on policy issues, but he doesn’t sound like an angry revolutionary. Buttigieg’s policy positions are not all that different from the more identifiable leftist candidates. But he eschews grand ideological conflict. “The whole point of politics is everyday life,” he said in his CNN town hall. His book is mostly about how as mayor he faced problems like snow removal and fixing potholes. His big achievements were renaming city streets, repairing the sewer system and tearing down derelict buildings. He says he’ll do whatever works. I’ve only met Buttigieg once, when we were seated at the same table at a dinner in Detroit a few months ago. He was smart, modest and self-effacing, and I can’t square that impression with his assumption that at 37 he’s qualified to be president of the United States. But maybe that’s Buttigieg — he squares a lot of circles. He deftly detaches progressive policy positions from the culture war. He offers change without Sturm und Drang.

2019,Why Your Doctor’s White Coat Can Be a Threat to Your Health,"The New Health Care A defining symbol of a profession may also be teeming with harmful bacteria and not washed as often as patients might hope. A recent study of patients at 10 academic hospitals in the United States found that just over half care about what their doctors wear, most of them preferring the traditional white coat. Some doctors prefer the white coat, too, viewing it as a defining symbol of the profession. What many might not realize, though, is that health care workers’ attire — including that seemingly “clean” white coat that many prefer — can harbor dangerous bacteria and pathogens. A systematic review of studies found that white coats are frequently contaminated with strains of harmful and sometimes drug-resistant bacteria associated with hospital-acquired infections. As many as 16 percent of white coats tested positive for MRSA, and up to 42 percent for the bacterial class Gram-negative rods. Both types of bacteria can cause serious problems, including skin and bloodstream infections, sepsis and pneumonia. It isn’t just white coats that can be problematic. The review also found that stethoscopes, phones and tablets can be contaminated with harmful bacteria. One study of orthopedic surgeons showed a 45 percent match between the species of bacteria found on their ties and in the wounds of patients they had treated. Nurses’ uniforms have also been found to be contaminated. Among possible remedies, antimicrobial textiles can help reduce the presence of certain kinds of bacteria, according to a randomized study. Daily laundering of health care workers’ attire can help somewhat, though studies show that bacteria can contaminate them within hours. Several studies of American physicians found that a majority go more than a week before washing white coats. Seventeen percent go more than a month. Several London-focused studies had similar findings pertaining both to coats and ties. A randomized trial published last year tested whether wearing short- or- long-sleeved white coats made a difference in the transmission of pathogens. Consistent with previous work, the study found short sleeves led to lower rates of transmission of viral D.N.A. It may be easier to keep hands and wrists clean when they’re not in contact with sleeves, which themselves can easily brush against other contaminated objects. For this reason, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America suggests clinicians consider an approach of “bare below the elbows.” With the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer — often more effective and convenient than soap and water — it’s far easier to keep hands clean than clothing. But the placement of alcohol-based hand sanitizer for health workers isn’t as convenient as it could be, reducing its use. The reason? In the early 2000s, fire marshals began requiring hospitals to remove or relocate dispensers because hand sanitizers contain at least 60 percent alcohol, making them flammable. Fire codes now limit where they can be placed — a minimum distance from electrical outlets, for example — or how much can be kept on site. Hand sanitizers are most often used in hallways, though greater use closer to patients (like immediately before or after touching a patient) could be more effective. One creative team of researchers studied what would happen if dispensers were hung over patients’ beds on a trapeze-bar apparatus. This put the sanitizer in obvious, plain view as clinicians tended to patients. The result? Over 50 percent more hand sanitizer was used. Although there have been fires in hospitals traced to alcohol-based hand sanitizer, they are rare. Across nearly 800 American health care facilities that used alcohol-based hand sanitizer, one study found, no fires had occurred. The World Health Organization puts the fire risk of hand sanitizers as “very low.” An article in The New York Times 10 years ago said the American Medical Association, concerned about bacteria transmission, was studying a proposal “that doctors hang up their lab coats — for good.” Maybe one reason the idea hasn’t taken hold in the past decade is reflected in a doctor’s comment in the article that “the coat is part of what defines me, and I couldn’t function without it.” It’s a powerful symbol. But maybe tradition doesn’t have to be abandoned, just modified. Combining bare-below-the-elbows white attire, more frequently washed, and with more conveniently placed hand sanitizers — including wearable sanitizer dispensers — could help reduce the spread of harmful bacteria. Until these ideas or others are fully rolled out, one thing we can all do right now is ask our doctors about hand sanitizing before they make physical contact with us (including handshakes). A little reminder could go a long way.",The New York Times

2019,Why a Drug Company in N.Y. Was Charged Over Opioids,"[Want to get New York Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.] It’s Wednesday. Get the popcorn. The Tribeca Film Festival is up and running through May 5. Here’s the film schedule. Weather: Dry, sunny and breezy, with a high around 70. Alternate-side parking: In effect through today, then suspended through Saturday. For the first time, a distributor of oxycodone and other painkillers has been charged criminally for its role in America’s opioid crisis. The distributor, Rochester Drug Cooperative, is based in upstate New York, and its former chief executive, Laurence Doud III, turned himself in to the federal authorities in Manhattan yesterday. Prosecutors applied the same kind of felony drug-trafficking charges against the company, Mr. Doud and another former executive as they have brought against street dealers in New York. The United States attorney’s office in Manhattan accused Rochester Drug Cooperative of conspiring to distribute drugs and defraud the federal government. The company sold 143 million oxycodone pills in New York State between 2010 and 2018, the state says. Translation: The company is essentially accused of sending suspiciously large numbers of prescription pills to doctors and pharmacists, and preventing regulators who work to stop improper drug trading from interceding. [Read about the giants at the heart of the opioid crisis.] Mr. Doud is charged with conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, conspiracy to defraud the United States and failing to file reports on suspicious orders. One of Mr. Doud’s lawyers said his client was being “framed.” But the government reached a deal with the company: It will delay prosecuting Rochester Drug Cooperative as long as it pays a $20 million fine, complies with the controlled substances law and submits to five years of supervision by an independent monitor. As part of the deal, the company admitted in court papers that it violated narcotics laws by shipping opioids to pharmacies, knowing that the highly addictive medication was being sold and used illicitly. New Yorkers are probably more familiar with another name in the opioid supply chain: Sackler. The Sackler family, which owns the drug maker Purdue Pharma and has lavished money on the Guggenheim Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and other city institutions, is facing legal action in Manhattan as well. The state filed a civil suit last month against eight family members, accusing them of personally contributing to the opioid epidemic by aggressively pushing to expand the market for their drug OxyContin after the company had admitted that it had misrepresented the drug’s potential for abuse. Last year, we told you that a statue of Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman to serve in the House of Representatives, was coming to Prospect Park in Brooklyn in 2020. Now we know its creators: Amanda Williams and Olalekan Jeyifous, who won the inaugural commission for She Built NYC, an initiative that is addressing the gender gap in the city’s public art and monuments, nearly all of which are devoted to men. Called “Our Destiny, Our Democracy,” the statue will feature the former congresswoman’s portrait fused with the silhouette of the United States Capitol. [Read more about the monument and its artists.] “I really feel like her arms are present,” Ms. Williams said of the design, “and her energy is present, and she is giving love to this community.” — Ana Fota Karina Vetrano’s killer, sentenced to life in prison, maintains, “I didn’t do this.” Right to free speech?

The Times’s Corey Kilgannon reports: While there has been criticism of Mayor de Blasio for focusing more on a possible presidential candidacy than on city matters, remember that the city also has many unofficial mayors — regular people who become such fixtures in their neighborhoods that it is hard to imagine life without them. Morningside Heights in Manhattan always had Bobby Fibel, who spent his life walking the same stretch of Broadway near Columbia University, greeting neighbors and stopping to chat in businesses like Tom’s Restaurant, the diner made famous by “Seinfeld,” and the now-shuttered West End bar, where Jack Kerouac and other Beat poets once drank. Mr. Fibel died this month at age 75, after suffering a stroke. At a memorial service on Monday, dozens of neighbors packed a small room in a Hell’s Kitchen funeral home where his photo rested on a simple coffin. The memorial for Mr. Fibel, who had no immediate surviving family, had been set up by a social service agency. With no organizer or speaker present, neighbors simply began standing up and relating their own Bobby stories, many of them through tears. Mr. Fibel never finished grammar school. He ran errands for store owners as a boy and never held a regular job. He helped turn his stretch of Broadway into a small town and “brought the community together,” Officer Kathleen Clifford of the Police Department’s 26th Precinct said. A recent stroke landed him in a rehab center, where he seemed to suffer withdrawal from the social sustenance of his Broadway buddies. So neighbors pitched in to pay his rent but were unsuccessful in persuading his health guardian agency to move him back to his rent-regulated, five-bedroom apartment overlooking the Columbia campus and Broadway. “He got so depressed about not being in the community that he stopped eating,” a neighbor, Stephanie Rugoff, said.

I eased through the turn just as it changed. Then, blue lights, the quick burp of a siren. Oh, no. I pulled over and rolled down my window. “The light was red,” the police officer said. “Um …,” I replied. “Where you headed?” I spoke fast, completely stream of consciousness. “I’m on my way to Boston,” I said. “But when I packed my tuxedo this morning, I noticed that the pants were missing. I have to stop just down the block and rent a pair, so that at my son’s wedding tomorrow I won’t be the only person not wearing pants.” I didn’t admit that I had had plenty of time to discover the problem. My son had been engaged for more than a year. The officer was quiet, but it definitely looked like he hadn’t heard that one before. He pulled a pamphlet from his pocket and handed it to me, something to do with safe driving. “Enjoy the wedding,” he said. — Donovan Moore New York Today is published weekdays around 6 a.m. Sign up here to get it by email.

2019,Why a Fisher-Price Sleeper Linked to Infant Deaths Hasn’t Been Recalled,"After Fisher-Price’s Rock ’n Play sleeper was linked to multiple infant deaths, the company and a government regulator issued a joint warning to consumers about the product on Friday, stopping short of a recall. But on Tuesday, the American Academy of Pediatrics called on Fisher-Price to withdraw the Rock ’n Play immediately. The group’s president, Dr. Kyle Yasuda, said in a statement that the sleeper, which rocks babies to sleep in a cloth-covered cradle, was “deadly” because it could cause asphyxiation. Fisher-Price, which stood by the safety of the Rock ’n Play and said a recall was not necessary, can keep selling the product. Here’s why. In issuing the safety alert, the consumer commission said it was aware of 10 deaths since 2015 of children 3 months or older linked to the Rock ’n Play. Each of the children had rolled from their backs to their stomachs or sides while in the sleeper without being secured in the product’s harness restraint. [Update: Fisher-Price recalls Rock ‘n Play sleeper linked to infant deaths.] The warning recommended that consumers not use the Rock ’n Play with children older than 3 months or those who can roll over, according to the federal regulator, the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Chuck Scothon, Fisher-Price’s general manager, said in a statement on Wednesday that the Rock ’n Play “meets all applicable safety standards.” “It is essential that the product warnings and instructions are always followed,” he said. But the warning that was issued “did not go far enough to ensure safety and protect infants,” the pediatricians’ group said. Citing reporting by Consumer Reports, the group said the sleeper had been linked to 32 infant deaths from 2011 to 2018, including some involving children under 3 months. The commission said Wednesday that it was investigating other deaths connected the Rock ‘n Play, and that a recall was possible in the future. “C.P.S.C. has requirements it must follow for any decisions concerning recalls,” said Patty Davis, an agency spokeswoman. “If the evidence shows the need for a recall, we will take that step.” Before seeking any recall, the commission must conclude there is a “substantial product hazard.” To make such a finding, it considers factors like whether the risk of injury is obvious to consumers, the severity of that risk and how many people are exposed to the product. Most recalls are voluntary and prompted either by companies contacting the commission with concerns about a product or agreeing to stop selling a product after being approached by regulators. Issuing a recall is a collaborative process. The commission works with companies to decide a recall’s parameters, including the number of affected units and whether consumers should get refunds. In rare cases, the commission can seek a mandatory recall by suing companies that refuse to agree to a voluntary recall, threatening to lay out its case publicly in legal filings. Other federal agencies have their own recall policies. Last month, the Food and Drug Administration said it had found asbestos in cosmetics sold by Claire’s, a retailer focused on products for teenagers. The agency, which said Claire’s had refused to recall the products, urged consumers not to use them. The company later said it had stopped selling the cosmetics at issue and similar items “out of an abundance of caution.” The commission has recently been leaning more heavily on warnings than on recalls, according to Pamela Gilbert, the agency’s executive director from 1995 to 2001. In March, the commission’s website listed 20 recalls for products including an electric bicycle, a riding saddle and a sauté pan. In March 2018, there were 29 such listings. Ms. Gilbert said the shift away from recalls was a “very dangerous trend.” “Consumers react to product recalls with more urgency and more care and attention than they do for warnings,” she said. “When deaths are involved, especially for babies and children, warnings are really not the appropriate remedy.” Joseph Martyak, a spokesman for the safety commission, said that a warning or a safety alert could precede a voluntary recall. He added that the number of safety alerts issued by the agency “is much less than the number of voluntary recalls we achieve every year.” The Washington Post reported this month that a leadership change at the commission under President Trump had allowed Britax, a British manufacturer of child care products, to avoid a recall of its popular BOB stroller, which the regulator had linked to hundreds of accidents. Britax said in a statement last week that it did not agree to a recall of certain strollers because “they are not defective and are safe when used as instructed.” The Rock ’n Play has faced scrutiny outside of the United States. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission warned parents to keep the product away from children, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. In Canada, the Rock ‘n Play is classified as a “soother” rather than as a “sleeper.” Canadian regulations do not allow the product to be used for unattended sleep, according to Fisher-Price. Ms. Gilbert, who is now a consumer safety lawyer, said that parents in the United States should be better informed about the product’s risks. “This is a discretionary product — if consumers knew that their babies could die, they wouldn’t buy it,” she said. “The penalty for a caregiver failing to use a restraint should not be the baby’s death.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Why the Cool Kids Are Playing Dungeons & Dragons,"Fighting the dragon queen Tiamat is a much more satisfying way to spend time with my friends than social media ever was. Ms. Newitz is a science journalist and novelist. I started playing Dungeons & Dragons right around the time I completely gave up on Facebook. It was a little less than a year ago, as the first stories broke about the Cambridge Analytica scandal. I was sick of the social media idea of friendship, defined as likes or shares or “X knows the same 50 people you know.” So when my friend Kate suggested we start a game of Dungeons & Dragons, I thought, “Yes, I’m going to get together with people face-to-face, without any hearting or retweeting, and we’re going to eat chips and fight those damn cultists who are trying to resurrect the evil, five-headed dragon queen Tiamat.” Until then, I had played a little D&D as an adult, but I hadn’t joined a group that met regularly. But I am basically the target demographic for “Stranger Things.” Like the characters on that show, I played D&D in the 1980s with a group of geeky guys every day at lunch throughout the sixth grade, slaying vegepygmies in a crashed spaceship and meeting the great demon Lolth in her sticky transdimensional web. Kate became our dungeon master, the narrator of our adventure, who sets the scene using maps, dice, flowery language and silly accents. We were joined by seven other friends around my dining room table, eager to take on the roles of fighting monk, rogue, sorcerer, warlock, paladin, bard and cleric. As soon as Kate told us to fill out our character sheets, I remembered the feeling of sheer awesomeness that had drawn me to the game when I was 11. I was about to become an Aarakocra cleric, a bird person with a divine connection to nature who could call down lightning, raise winds, grow plants from the barren earth and heal the dying with a touch. But D&D isn’t only about inventing a more badass version of myself, with wings and magic powers instead of sneakers and a laptop. I was also drawn to the idea of building a social group whose baseline assumption was that we’d see one another regularly. There’s a sense of purpose to the gathering. Using a few maps spread on the table, we chart our course, explaining to Kate and one another what we want to do next. And when Kate leaves us on a cliffhanger, there’s no “Hey, I’ll text you later and maybe we can meet up.” Of course we’ll meet up again. The point of the game isn’t to win; it’s to go adventuring together. Wizards of the Coast, the parent company of Dungeons & Dragons, reported that 8.6 million people played the game in 2017, its biggest year of sales in two decades. That mark was eclipsed in 2018, when D&D sales reportedly grew 30 percent. All of those D&D consumers are snapping up the Fifth Edition, a new rule set released in 2014 that emphasizes a flexible approach to combat and decision-making. New players don’t need to learn as many arcane rules to get started, and sales of D&D starter kits skyrocketed. Adding to the newfound popularity are thousands of D&D games broadcast on YouTube and the live-stream service Twitch. “Critical Role,” a popular livestream and podcast, features actors playing the game. This surge of interest is no doubt also inspired by shows like “Stranger Things” and the D&D-esque world of “Game of Thrones.” We want to escape into fantasy worlds where we know who the bad guys are and our spells to banish evil actually work. In this way, D&D is similar to online games like World of Warcraft, where people take on imaginary identities, form a guild and shout at one another using headsets while fighting orcs. What makes D & D different is that we can never forget about the human beings behind the avatars. When a member of my group makes a bad choice, I can’t look into his face and shout insults the way I would if we were playing online. He’s a person, and my friend, even if he also inexplicably decided to open an obviously booby-trapped trunk, get a faceful of poison and use up my last remaining healing spell. [As technology advances, will it continue to blur the lines between public and private? Sign up for Charlie Warzel’s limited-run newsletter to explore what’s at stake and what you can do about it.] But online, my friend would be just another dude with leathery blue skin, not someone whose face might crumple in sadness if I’m a jerk. There’s a toxic distance created by online gaming and social networks that allows us to pretend we’re not socializing with friends. Our empathy gets switched off. That may be one reason gamer arguments over fake countries and nonexistent knights can morph all too easily into hate-based social movements in the real world. Plus, even when things get heated during our D&D game — and they do — none of us can win by getting 10,000 of our “friends” to harass the person we disagree with. There are, of course, genuine friendships forged in online game worlds and on social media, and I don’t mean to dismiss those. But after months of playing D&D with my friends, I’m socializing on Twitter and other social media less than I did before. I don’t click to see hundreds of half-lives flash before me in an instant. Instead, I look forward to an evening with a handful of people. What drove me away from Facebook wasn’t just the fake friending. It was that fake friendship could be weaponized, used by a hostile government or group to manipulate us. When we fantasize together, in person, we always know that the bot army isn’t real. We know that an insult can hurt. But online, we wear masks over masks. I still love the internet, but I’d rather have a real friendship with a half-elf bard than a thousand faceless followers.

2019,Why the N.R.A. Opposes New Domestic Abuse Legislation,"WASHINGTON — The National Rifle Association, the nation’s largest gun lobby, has settled on its next target on Capitol Hill: blocking Congress from reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, a 1994 law that assists victims of domestic and sexual violence. The House is set to vote on the legislation this week; the law expired in February. But the bill includes a new provision — aimed at curbing sexual violence by expanding law enforcement’s ability to strip domestic abusers of their guns — that the N.R.A. does not like. The measure closes the so-called boyfriend loophole by barring those convicted of abusing, assaulting or stalking a dating partner or those subject to a court restraining order from buying or owning firearms. Under current federal law, those convicted of domestic abuse can lose their guns if they are — or were formerly — married to their victim, live with their victim, have a child with their victim or are a parent or guardian of their victim. The proposed provision would extend those who can be convicted of domestic abuse to include stalkers and current or former boyfriends or dating partners. Jennifer Baker, a spokeswoman for the N.R.A., said that for “many of those ‘offenses’ — and I’m using air quotes here — the behavior that would qualify as a stalking offense is often not violent or threatening; it involves no personal contact whatsoever.” She argues that the new provision is “too broad and ripe for abuse.” “Like if you were sending harassing messages to somebody on Facebook, to somebody you never met or somebody you dated five years ago,” she said, adding, “How it’s written right now, you could be convicted for a misdemeanor stalking offense for a tweet that causes someone emotional distress and then you would be prohibited from owning a firearm.” Others find the N.R.A.’s argument far-fetched. “A single tweet or Facebook message, without significant other conduct, would ordinarily not be enough” to result in a conviction for stalking, said David Keck, director of the National Resource Center on Domestic Violence and Firearms, which provides guidance to law enforcement and governments on implementing firearms prohibitions, but takes no position on the new domestic violence act provision. And times have changed for the gun lobby. A wave of freshman Democrats in Congress were elected on a promise to enact new gun restrictions, and they proudly campaigned against the N.R.A. “The No. 1 way that women are being killed with guns is by their beloveds, their boyfriends, their significant others,” said one of those freshman Democrats, Representative Lucy McBath of Georgia. “I am not paying attention to the rhetoric of the N.R.A. because I can’t be distracted. What’s most important is putting forth good legislation to save as many lives as we can.” Ms. McBath’s son, Jordan Davis, was shot to death in 2012. Roughly half of all female homicide victims are killed by what experts call “intimate partners” — meaning current or former spouses or dating partners — according to a 2017 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And about half of intimate partner homicides involved dating relationships, according to Mr. Keck. The “boyfriend loophole” provision is “a refocus on should we be just looking at domestic partners or should we be looking more broadly at intimate partners?” he said. Studies also show that domestic abusers with guns inflict a disproportionate amount of violence on their partners, and that the victims are overwhelmingly female. Abused women are five times more likely to be killed by their abuser if the abuser owns a firearm, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a gun safety group. Roughly three-quarters of all intimate partner murder victims were also victims of stalking by their partners, according to the National Center for Victims of Crime. “The share of homicides committed by dating partners has been increasing for three decades,” said Shannon Watts, who founded Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, a group that supports tighter gun laws, in response to the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012. “Women are now as likely to be killed by dating partners as by spouses with guns.” The reauthorization bill has one Republican co-sponsor, Representative Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania. Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, is urging Congress to extend the expired law for the rest of the year to continue funding services to survivors at current levels. Ms. Baker, of the N.R.A., accused Democrats of “playing politics” with the bill by inserting the so-called boyfriend provision as a “poison pill” so that Democrats can portray Republicans who vote against it as anti-woman. The N.R.A. has decided to “score” the vote on the Violence Against Women Act, meaning it will keep track and publish how lawmakers vote in an effort to either reward or defeat them in the next election. While the move is not likely to keep the bill from passing the House, it does make it more likely that the “boyfriend loophole” provision will be stripped from the act when the measure arrives in the Senate. “Anybody who votes for this should take the outrage of the N.R.A. and wear it proudly,” said Representative Debbie Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, who drafted the provision as a separate bill and fought for it to be included in the Violence Against Women Act. Ms. Dingell — whose husband, John D. Dingell Jr., who died this year, served on the N.R.A.’s board of directors — has spoken powerfully of her experiences as a child, cowering in the closet in fear of her father, who struggled with mental illness and had a gun. “I am not someone who wants to take people’s guns away,” she said. “I have lived with a man that was an N.R.A. board member and with a man that shouldn’t have had a gun. And I want to stand up for both sides.” The move to oppose the act comes as the N.R.A.’s power is increasingly being challenged on Capitol Hill and in statehouses around the country by gun control activists, including many students who have taken up the charge after the massacre last year at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Twenty-six states and the District of Columbia passed 67 new gun safety laws in 2018, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. On Capitol Hill, the House in February passed legislation expanding background checks to cover nearly all gun purchases — the first significant gun safety measure in 25 years. Even in the Republican-controlled Senate, Senator Lindsey Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, convened a hearing last week on “red flag laws” or extreme risk protection orders that allow family members and law enforcement officers to obtain court restraining orders to remove firearms from people who have been identified as a risk to themselves or others. So far, 14 states and the District of Columbia have laws allowing extreme risk protection orders. Mr. Graham said he is working on legislation to create incentives for states to enact such bills. Ms. Baker said the N.R.A. agrees with the idea in theory but has not supported any of the state laws because of “serious due process concerns.” The idea has gained traction in some unlikely places — including the White House, where President Trump embraced it when Vice President Mike Pence raised it during a meeting with lawmakers after the school massacre in Parkland. “Or Mike, take the firearms first and then go to court,” Mr. Trump told Mr. Pence, adding, “because a lot of times, by the time you go to court, it takes so long to go to court to get the due process procedures. I like taking the guns early.”",The New York Times

2019,Why ‘Find Your Passion’ Is Such Terrible Advice,"Prepare for a hard truth: We’re pretty bad at most things when we first try them. Welcome to the Smarter Living newsletter! Every Monday, we email readers with tips and advice for living a better, more fulfilling life. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. Are you passionate about your work? Fulfilled in every aspect of your career? If yes, congratulations! You’ve done what we all strive for but rarely achieve. As for the rest of us, there’s hope: Part of why we haven’t found our passion yet is that we tend to give up quickly on new things. The reason? Prepare for a hard truth: We’re pretty bad at most things when we first try them. People “often assume that their own interest or passion just needs to be ‘found’ or revealed. Once revealed, it will be in a fully formed state,” said Paul A. O’Keefe, an assistant professor of psychology at Yale-NUS College in Singapore. Nonsense, of course, he said. “By that logic, pursuing one’s passion should come with boundless motivation and should be relatively easy,” he said. Dr. O’Keefe was part of a team that published a study in 2018 that examined how two different “implicit theories of interest” impacted how people approach new potential passions. One, the fixed theory, says that our interests are relatively fixed and unchanging, while the other, the growth theory, suggests our interests are developed over time and not necessarily innate to our personality. In other words: Do we truly find our passions, or develop them over time? (You can probably guess where this is going.) The researchers found that people who hold a fixed theory had less interest in things outside of their current interests, were less likely to anticipate difficulties when pursuing new interests, and lost interest in new things much quicker than people who hold a growth theory. In essence, people with a growth mind-set of interest tend to believe that interests and passions are capable of developing with enough time, effort and investment. “This comes down to the expectations people have when pursuing a passion,” Dr. O’Keefe said. “Someone with a fixed mind-set of interest might begin their pursuit with lots of enthusiasm, but it might diminish once things get too challenging or tedious.” Passion alone won’t carry you through in the face of difficulty, he said, when overcoming those challenges actually counts. Sunny Verma, founder of the tutoring service TutorBright, said that if “desire drives your actions, which in turn, align with your belief, that’s when great things start to happen.” He added: “If we are not naturally good at something, it becomes really easy to give ourselves a label of, ‘I am just not good at whatever I am trying to do.’ Then we carry this mind-set of learned helplessness with us to adulthood, and if we don’t succeed on our first or second try, we think it’s better to quit.” As a result, we tend to internalize this intense fear of being terrible at something and failing, making it difficult to enjoy the difficulties and struggles, which are necessary and healthy parts of any process for growth and success. What’s missing, according to Mr. Verma, is an emphasis on positive psychology techniques, like affirmations and encouragement. [Like what you’re reading?

They struggle to find strength in their legs and not trip every few steps, but parents cheer them on instead of focusing on the failures. While we’re not all lumbering toddlers, the point is that many of us rarely feel that positivity and encouragement around our endeavors later in life. One important step to change our approach to potentially new passions is to redefine failure as the catalyst to change and improvement, rather than as a final destination. When you look to successful people you admire, study them not only for their victories and achievements, but also for how they overcame failures and changed as a result of them. (Click here for more advice about learning from your failures.) And when you’re pursuing new passions, remember that the process itself and the steps you need to take are just as important as your end goal. Temper your expectations and build failure in to your plan, then learn to recognize and celebrate small milestones along the way. Still, knowing when to call it quits matters, too. If you’re struggling with the question of whether to give up or persevere, Dr. O’Keefe suggests asking yourself: Am I enjoying this? Do I care about becoming good? Are these skills useful to me? When you understand that the process “is the nature of developing interests and passions, it likely won’t invalidate your feeling that the activity is your passion,” Dr. O’Keefe said.

But these items can help elevate the quality of your images without weighing you down. This week I’ve invited Kara Cutruzzula, who writes a newsletter about work, life and productivity, to give us a little motivation to reach for a really (really) big goal. I didn’t win a Pulitzer Prize last week. But technically I could have. A less-known fact about the Pulitzers is that anyone can submit their work for consideration. Fill out an application, pay $75 and mail off your entry — congratulations, you’re in contention. (This also means that anyone can claim to be “Pulitzer-nominated.” But don’t be one of those people.) I generally need a deadline to finish anything, and I wanted a motivational boost to revise my play “Old Hollywood,” which is about a forgotten 90-something actress and a Seamless delivery guy. But the Pulitzer? The idea was absurd. Yet a tiny voice kept whispering: Why not? The deadline to submit is Dec. 31. Once I decided to enter, I became obsessed with climbing this impossible mountain. I told everyone about my Pulitzer plan. Some cheered me on, and others courteously smiled while the thought bubble above their head said, delusional. I even changed my iPhone background to a Pulitzer medal. But then I got to work. And the more time I spent on my play, the more I remembered how much I love writing. The end was fast and furious. After typing “End of Play” at noon on New Year’s Eve, I found the only open printing place in Brooklyn, made six copies of my script, then mailed them to the Pulitzer office. To qualify, plays must have a production within the year, so I subscribed to a broad definition of that term and produced a one-night-only performance in the Apartment Theater (a.k.a., my living room), enlisting my talented actor brother and friends. A dozen friends-turned-audience members came over, and we drank Champagne and watched my play — which, hours before, was a pile of pages — come to life. Was every word perfect? No. But by simply trying, I ended the year with more than I had before. I recommitted to creating, which was the goal all along. Some dreams take careful planning. But others, I learned, need to be so scary they force you into action. I urge you to reach for your own Pulitzer. Because somebody has to win. Why not you?",The New York Times
2019,Widespread Testing Begins on Malaria Vaccine That Is Only Partly Effective,"Global health Despite the vaccine’s drawbacks, the W.H.O. endorsed testing on 360,000 children, in an effort to lower death rates in Africa. With malaria deaths rebounding worldwide, a pilot program testing a new and fiercely debated malaria vaccine began on Tuesday in Malawi. Dr. Katherine O’Brien, the World Health Organization’s director of immunization, called the rollout “a historic moment in the fight against malaria,” and said the testing will soon expand to malarious regions of Ghana and Kenya. But the vaccine, known as RTS,S, or Mosquirix, has been in development by GSK, the former GlaxoSmithKline, for more than 30 years, and it has serious drawbacks that have led some experts to argue that it does not work well enough to spend millions of dollars pursuing. Malaria kills about 450,000 people a year, most of them young African children. Over the last 15 years, the death rate has been reduced by more than half through extensive, donor-funded efforts to hand out free mosquito nets, spray homes with insecticide and treat people with a new generation of medicines. But deaths have increased again as money has run short, populations have grown, resistance to some new drugs has emerged and mosquitoes have expanded their ranges. Finding new weapons is crucial, experts agree, but making a malaria vaccine has proved challenging in the extreme. Surviving the disease does not provide lasting immunity. People who suffer numerous bouts in childhood become able to tolerate new infections, but if they leave the area for even a few years, their immunity wanes and a later infection can kill them. The new vaccine has many weaknesses. It is inconvenient: A child must receive four injections before age 2, sometimes at intervals that do not match the routine vaccine schedules for most other diseases. And it is only partly effective. Testing in more than 10,000 African children from 2009 to 2014 showed that, even after four doses, the vaccine prevented only about 40 percent of detectable malaria infections. The vaccine reduced the occurrence of severe malaria by about 30 percent, and the occurrence of severe anemia — a complication that often kills children — by about 60 percent. It did not protect well against parasite strains that were poor genetic matches, raising a concern that, over time, parasites could evolve resistance to the vaccine as they have to drugs. Moreover, it is unclear how long even those relatively low levels of protection last; previous trials followed vaccinated children for four years. Experts also worry that parents whose children are vaccinated will become less vigilant about using mosquito nets, and less likely to seek medical care when their children develop fevers. In 2015, Doctors Without Borders said it would not join any pilot projects such as those announced this week, arguing that its money and time would be better spent on proven malaria-fighting measures. Nonetheless, the W.H.O.’s vaccine advisory group recommended that testing be expanded to 360,000 children to see how well the vaccine works in real-world situations, as part of routine immunization programs run by African health ministries, rather than within the careful confines of clinical trials. The health organization’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts will assess the results of each high-transmission season for at least three years, watching to see in particular whether parents bring in their children for all four doses and whether any rare but threatening side effects appear. During earlier trials, some children developed high fevers and seizures soon after being immunized, but they recovered. A few children later developed life-threatening meningitis, but it was not clear that the vaccine was to blame. The most important outcome will be overall survival rates, Dr. O’Brien said. If those rates increase substantially among vaccinated children, the W.H.O. may recommend rolling out the vaccine in more locations. Very few children died in the 2009-2014 clinical trials, because they could be diagnosed and treated quickly, and hospital care with blood transfusions for severe anemia was readily available. The current rollout will cost about $50 million. It is being paid for by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; Unitaid, and the countries involved. The W.H.O. and Path, a nonprofit group in Seattle that has collaborated with GSK on the vaccine since 2001, will contribute expertise. Glaxo will donate 10 million doses of vaccine. Early next year, a clinical trial of another malaria vaccine, PfSPZ, is scheduled to begin on Bioko Island, just off the western coast of central Africa. That vaccine, made by Sanaria, a biotech company in Rockville, Md., uses whole malaria parasites that are irradiated and then removed from the mosquitoes’ salivary glands. This vaccine, too, has limitations. It must be delivered by intravenous injection, must be stored in liquid nitrogen and requires very high doses of parasites. Its efficacy rate has fluctuated significantly during its development. Early testing on a handful of volunteers suggested it could be 100 percent effective. But later tests showed overall efficacy rates of 55 percent, in 2016, and of 64 percent, in 2017, when used on small numbers of subjects who were “challenged” by intentional bites from infected mosquitoes. In a 2017 trial in about 100 adults in Mali, the efficacy rate was 29 percent. The new trial, initially in about 2,000 people, will be paid for by the government of Equatorial Guinea and three oil companies whose employees work in high-malaria areas.",The New York Times
2019,"Opinion | Widows, Juggling Their Grief and Finances","letters Readers stress the importance of planning ahead. To the Editor: Re “You’re a Widow. Now What Do You Do?” (Sunday Business, April 14): Last year was a disastrous one for me and three of my friends. Those three lost their husbands suddenly, without a plan in place. I, on the other hand, knew of my husband’s imminent demise. We were fortunate (hard to put it that way) that we were able to plan. When my husband died, I knew what and where our assets were and who should help me with forms and filings. We had prepared for a funeral and burial, and I knew where to locate important papers — insurance, deeds and bank statements. Preparation spared me so many of the difficulties that were described in the article and that my friends experienced. My advice would be to have the hard conversations before the inevitable, write down the information and hope for longevity. Among my fellow recent widows, I was the “lucky” one. Ellen G.K. RubinScarsdale, N.Y. To the Editor: Five years after my husband’s death, I’m still dealing with paperwork that turns up from time to time, requiring me to sign or send or pay something. To those who may have to go through the double whammy of losing the love of your life and dealing with hundreds of documents and requests, please don’t be as blithe as I was. Demand that your spouse share all the financial secrets, obligations and details. It won’t spare you the grief, but it may allow you more time to grieve.

2019,Wikipedia Isn’t Officially a Social Network. But the Harassment Can Get Ugly.,"In Wikipedia’s 18 years of existence, it has become a fixture in our lives: It ascends to the top of Google’s search results and provides answers to the questions we ask Alexa and Siri. For Wikipedia’s editing community, the website is even more. It is a kind of social network where users debate the minutiae of history and modern life, climb the editorial hierarchy and even meet friends and romantic partners. It is also a place where editors can experience relentless harassment. In 2016, Pax Ahimsa Gethen, a trans male Wikipedian, was persistently hit with personal attacks over several months. Mx. Gethen, 49, who uses the pronouns “they” and “them,” said the anonymous harasser posted that they were “insufferable” and “unloved,” that they belonged in an internment camp and that they should kill themself. Mx. Gethen said the user also publicly posted their deadname, the name they used before transitioning. “It was devastating to me because of the personal nature of it,” Mx. Gethen said. Unlike social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, Wikipedia relies largely on unpaid volunteers to handle reports of harassment. In response to complaints about pervasive harassment, the Wikimedia Foundation, the San Francisco-based nonprofit that operates Wikipedia and supports its community of volunteers, has promised new strategies to curb abuse. In recent months, the foundation has rolled out a more sophisticated blocking tool that it hopes can better control the harassment plaguing some users. Sydney Poore, a community health strategist with the foundation, said that when the free encyclopedia was established in 2001, it initially attracted lots of editors who were “tech-oriented” men. That led to a culture that was not always accepting of outside opinions, said Ms. Poore, who has edited Wikipedia for 13 years. “We’re making strong efforts to reverse that,” she said, “but it doesn’t happen overnight.” A few informed clicks on any Wikipedia article can reveal the lengthy discussions that shape a published narrative. According to interviews with Wikipedians around the world, those digital back rooms are where harassment often begins. A spirited debate over a detail in an article can spiral into one user spewing personal attacks against another. “If you out yourself as a feminist or L.G.B.T., you will tend to be more targeted,” said Natacha Rault, a Wikipedia editor who lives in Geneva and founded a project that aims to reduce the gender gap on the website. On French-language Wikipedia, where Ms. Rault does much of her editing, discussions about gender can often lead to vitriol. Ms. Rault said there were six months of heated debate about whether to label the article on Britain’s leader, Theresa May, with the feminine version of “prime minister” (première ministre), rather than the masculine one (premier ministre). Another controversy has been simmering over the article “femme,” the French word for woman, Ms. Rault said. At issue is whether the first paragraph should refer to gender in addition to biological sex, and whether transgender women should be included in the definition of woman. This debate devolved into an “edit war,” a heated back-and-forth in which Wikipedians continuously edit an article to overwrite the other side’s changes and reflect the language they want. “Sometimes it can be so aggressive that you give up and run away from the article,” she said. The Wikimedia Foundation says it is seriously concerned about the idea that cisgender women and transgender editors could be repelled from Wikipedia by online abuse. On its website, the foundation lists pervasive harassment as a barrier to gender equity. Sometimes, the harassment is explicitly sexual: According to anonymous interviews described by the foundation, users have had pornography posted on their personal Wikipedia userpages and emailed to them. Camelia Boban, an editor on Italian-language Wikipedia, said another user once publicly used language to suggest she was a prostitute. Studies on Wikipedia’s contributor base from several years ago estimated that fewer than 20 percent of editors were women. This research backed up an existing awareness in the Wikipedia community that female editors were seriously underrepresented, galvanizing activists who set out to recruit more women to write and edit articles. Groups like Art+Feminism were established to increase the representation of women and nonbinary individuals on Wikipedia. Its organizers held sessions in which experienced editors taught aspiring ones the ways of Wikipedia, explaining how to navigate a website where editors sometimes appear to be communicating in code. Wikipedians also began to discuss the “content gender gap,” which includes an imbalance in the gender distribution of biographies on the site. The latest analysis, released this month, said about 18 percent of 1.6 million biographies on the English-language Wikipedia were of women. That is up from about 15 percent in 2014, partially because of activists trying to move the needle. Claudia Lo, a foundation researcher on a team that is building anti-harassment tools, said there was a pattern of harassment on Wikipedia stemming from debates over L.G.B.T. issues. When a celebrity comes out as transgender — notably, Chelsea Manning in 2013 and Caitlyn Jenner in 2015 — Wikipedians have extensively debated whether the individual’s self-declared pronouns should be used. Articles about transgender or nonbinary individuals are often subject to vandals who revert their pronouns back to their gender assigned at birth. But Wikipedia’s guidelines make clear that editors should use the gender that the subject of the article most recently stated in a dependable source. In countries where it is more dangerous for L.G.B.T. individuals to be open about their identities, harassment on Wikipedia can be particularly virulent. Once, an administrator on a Wikipedia page blocked an editor simply because that person’s username suggested that the editor could be gay, said Rachel Wexelbaum, a Wikipedian who works to improve L.G.B.T. content on the website. Eventually, she said, Wikimedia’s Trust and Safety Team got involved, and the administrator was blocked for those actions. In some spaces, the environment for L.G.B.T. users has improved. Amir Sarabadani, a 25-year-old Iranian software developer with Wikimedia Foundation’s chapter in Germany, said that in his 12 years of editing Persian-language Wikipedia, users were often hostile while editing articles related to homosexuality. About six years ago, Mr. Sarabadani started talking openly about being gay in conversations with other Wikipedians. He said other editors often accused him of having a “homosexual agenda,” and anonymous users posted lewd images of male genitals on his userpage. But Mr. Sarabadani, who left Tehran for Berlin two years ago, said he thought his work as an administrator on Persian-language Wikipedia had made the community of editors there less tolerant of abuse. “It was easy to say things and get away with that,” he said. “Now if someone says something homophobic, they’ll get blocked for several months.” On English-language Wikipedia, one of roughly 300 languages with its own site, users are asked to report conflicts with one another on online notice boards, where they are expected to post links to abuse so an administrator can decide whether to take action. That method problematically forces complaints into the public sphere, said Ms. Lo, the foundation researcher. “If you’re being harassed,” Ms. Lo said, “the last thing you want to do is tell your harasser that you’re about to tell on them.” In some cases, situations are dealt with by Wikimedia Foundation staff members or via private emails with volunteer administrators, she said. If a volunteer administrator finds the allegations of abuse credible, the user can be barred from editing anywhere on the site. Administrators for some Wikipedias, such as the English-language site, can also declare a “topic ban,” a socially enforced tool in which other editors are responsible for making sure the guilty user is not involved in editing articles that mention prohibited subjects. Violating a topic ban can result in a sitewide ban. The new tool, which the foundation calls “partial blocks,” allows administrators to restrict users from editing particular pages on which they have proved to be a problem. Those developing the tool hope it will be used more liberally to block editors from specific topics without entirely barring users who are productive in other areas of the site. “The idea is to provide volunteer administrators with a more targeted, more nuanced ability to respond to conflicts,” Ms. Lo said. Partial blocks are active on five Wikipedias, including those in Italian and Arabic, and foundation staff members expect it to be introduced to English-language Wikipedia this year. The foundation is also in the early stages of a private reporting system where users could report harassment, Ms. Lo said. But there are limits to how effective institutional change can be in curbing harassment on Wikipedia. In the case of Mx. Gethen, their harasser kept posting from different IP addresses, making it difficult for a blocking tool to be effective. Although the abuser no longer haunts their internet presence, Mx. Gethen said the sometimes hostile culture on Wikipedia had reduced their editing on the site. “I’m not getting paid for this,” they said. “Why should I volunteer my time to be abused?”",The New York Times
2019,Will Augusta National’s New Event for Women Upstage L.P.G.A. Stars?,"On Golf RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. — Albane Valenzuela could have been teeing it up Wednesday in the inaugural Augusta National Women’s Amateur, where the contestants who survive the cut will play the final 18 holes on the fabled course where men will compete at the Masters next week. Valenzuela, a junior at Stanford and the fifth-ranked women’s amateur in the world, seriously entertained the invitation from the board of governors of the Augusta National Golf Club until she received what she considered a better offer for this week: her third start in the ANA Inspiration, the women’s first major of the year. “Getting to tee off and play the same course as the world No. 1,” she said Tuesday, referring to South Korea’s Sung Hyun Park, “I think that’s the best experience you can get.” Augusta National officials have trumpeted their amateur invitational as a grand stage for women’s golf. That overlooks the major originally known as the Dinah Shore, which has captivated young golfers since 1972. The tournament has cultivated indelible traditions like the winner’s leap into Poppie’s Pond and consistently provided significant exposure for top amateurs like Valenzuela, who used her 2016 debut here as a springboard to the Rio Olympics. Augusta National didn’t admit its first female members until 2012. And while it has since opened its course to boys and girls through the Drive, Chip and Putt contest and to amateur women, these inclusive gestures have ignored — and however unintentionally, undermined — the L.P.G.A., one of the longest-running women’s professional sports organizations. The Drive, Chip and Putt contest, held the Sunday before the Masters, has siphoned television and other media coverage from the final round of the ANA Inspiration. And with the advent of the Augusta National Women’s Amateur, the spotlight on the best women’s players in the world has become more diffuse. “I think it comes from a very positive place in Augusta — they want to do the right thing,” Valenzuela said. “It’s probably not my place to say, but it would have been great if both could have worked together to make them happen in different weeks, because you don’t want to get the spotlight off the L.P.G.A.” The ANA Inspiration matters because the magnetic moments that attracted Valenzuela to the sport as a child didn’t involve Augusta National, which for most of its history has been so far out of the women’s orbit that it might as well have been on Mars. “Ever since I’ve been a little girl I’ve seen all the girls jump in the pond,” Valenzuela said, adding, “This is the women’s Masters.” On Wednesday, Jennifer Kupcho, a Wake Forest senior and the top-ranked women’s amateur, struck the opening drive of the new event at the Champions Retreat resort in Evans, Ga., the site of the first two rounds. Only the final round will be played at Augusta National. Across the country Wednesday, Valenzuela grooved her swing on the Mission Hills practice range. Stacy Lewis, the 2011 ANA Inspiration champion, said she planned to extend a warm welcome to Valenzuela and the four other amateurs in the field: Patty Tavatanakit, Frida Kinhult, Rachel Heck and Xin Kou, who is also known as Cindy. “I’m really proud of them,” said Lewis, the former women’s world No. 1 who recently returned to competition after the birth in October of her first child, a daughter. “If you want to play professional golf, you need to play in majors, and you need to see where your game stacks up and have that experience of playing in front of those big crowds.” Valenzuela has advanced to the weekend in each of her previous starts in this event. If she misses the cut this week, she will not be idle over the weekend. Her consolation prize will be joining her Stanford teammates on Sunday at the Silverado Showdown, a collegiate women’s event in Napa. Stanford is ranked fourth in the Women’s Golf Coaches Association poll and is jockeying with other top teams for seeding positions at next month’s N.C.A.A. championship. Another Stanford star, Andrea Lee, chose to play in Georgia this week. Anne Walker, Valenzuela’s coach at Stanford, said in a telephone interview that she welcomed Augusta National’s move into the women’s game, describing it as “another great opportunity that’s opened up.” But in its exuberance to grow the game, Augusta National big-footed more than the L.P.G.A. schedule. “There’s very little discussion about the timing of it as it relates to college golf,” Walker said. She pointed out that Texas, which is ranked second behind the University of Southern California, competed in the Bruzzy Challenge this week in Texas without three of its top players: Emilee Hoffman, Agathe Laisne and Kaitlyn Papp, who are in Augusta. The Longhorns finished tied for seventh, their lowest finish of the season by three places. Walker ultimately described the scheduling conflicts as “a great problem to have.” But they are a problem, nonetheless. When the Augusta National chairman, Fred Ridley, announced the new event last year, he said: “We think that to have one week where the future greats of the game and the current greats of the women’s game are all competing on a big stage is, it’s just very exciting.” Referring to L.P.G.A. Commissioner Mike Whan, who was not consulted before the Augusta tournament was scheduled, Ridley added, “I think he also understands that in time it’s going to be a win for the L.P.G.A.” Lewis said she would love to see the Augusta event played at a different time of year. Referring to the amateurs, she added, “Maybe they could get a full tournament on Augusta National. Get a couple practice rounds and a three-round tournament there.” Or better yet, the Augusta National members could find a way to welcome the 8-year-old girls and the 18-year-old amateurs after they have grown into the best women players on the planet. It’s a win-win for golf any time the best women mix with the best men, as Brittany Lincicome, a two-time ANA Inspiration champion, recently was reminded. Lincicome spent two days last month at the PGA Tour’s flagship event in Florida, and she was shocked when players like Sergio Garcia and Rory McIlroy saw her behind the rope lines and came bounding over to ask if she would pose for selfies with them. Lincicome, 33, has been slow to recognize that her start last year in a PGA Tour event in Kentucky trumped either of her victorious finishes here. “I had no idea they knew who I was,” she said. If the L.P.G.A. has to move the date of its first major to accommodate Augusta National, here’s one idea how Augusta National members could make the change palatable. They could extend an invitation to the women’s reigning major winners to compete alongside the men in the Masters’ par-3 contest. That would be more meaningful start than a flashy 18-hole finish to an amateur event.",The New York Times
2019,Will Martin Parr’s Photos Change the World? He Doesn’t Think So,"lens In documenting his homeland, the British photographer captures its contradictions and ambiguities with a sense of humor. Martin Parr is something of a cottage industry in Britain. The photographer’s name, likeness and work have adorned M&M’s, leather jackets, soccer scarves and Bombay Sapphire gin, among other things. He currently has solo exhibitions in Bogotá, Manchester and London and has published more than 100 books. He was also the president of Magnum Photos from 2013-17. Yet for all his success, according to “Only Human,” the new monograph by Phaidon Press that accompanies his show at the National Portrait Gallery in London, Mr. Parr almost wasn’t elected to Magnum in the first place. When he first tried to gain full membership to Magnum, in 1994, his path was nearly blocked thanks to the blunt criticism of photojournalist Philip Jones Griffiths. In a letter opposing Mr. Parr from joining, Mr. Griffiths wrote, “Let me state that I have great respect for him as the dedicated enemy of everything I believe in and, I trust, what Magnum still believes in.” Known for using humor in his photography, Mr. Parr enjoyed skewering his fellow Brits. His willingness to see photography as entertainment set his work apart from the prior era’s serious, concerned photojournalism. His reliance on ambiguity, emblematic of Post-Modernism, was new to his predecessors and rubbed some the wrong way. “The tradition of Magnum that he upheld,” Mr. Parr said, referring to Mr. Griffiths, “was the humanistic approach of photojournalism, whose job it is to change the world.” Mr. Pharr continued, “My job is to observe it and do my own personal interpretation, which is indeed open-ended.” “Only Human” features 19 years’ worth of Mr. Parr’s work, though most of the photographs were taken during the last decade. His vision of 21st Century Britain includes images dealing with the influx of immigrants into England and the rise of the nationalist backlash that led to Brexit. “My relationship with Britain is very therapeutic,” he said. “I have great affection for the country. I’m very annoyed by the bigotry that was exposed through the Brexit process. These contradictions and ambiguities are something to try to indicate, illustrate and resonate with in the photographs.” For “Autoportrait,” he spent years allowing his formal portrait to be taken by local photographers around the world, done in their personal styles. Whether doing judo with a Photoshopped image of Vladimir Putin, standing in a simulated field of flowers in Dubai, or wearing a beret in front of the Eiffel Tower, he always kept a straight face. “That’s how you make things funny,” he said. “By deadpan. Looking serious. If you’re laughing in a photo, it’s never going to be a funny photo.” The London exhibition also includes portraits of more familiar faces: Designers Paul Smith and Vivienne Westwood, model Cara Delevingne and Chinese artist Ai Weiwei. But most of his subjects are ordinary British folk going about their lives — a Sikh man carrying a Union Jack bag, a pigeon racer holding one of his prize birds, party revelers, bog snorkelers, fishmongers and a kinetic troupe of Bhangra dancers in Scotland. It provided a challenge, given Mr. Parr’s humility, to get him to talk too much about his success, and he clearly preferred discussing the Martin Parr Foundation, the community photographic center he created in Bristol, in the west of England. He’s happy to help others on the way up, specifically commending an exhibition of photographs shot in Wales by French photographer Clémentine Schneidermann. “Because I’ve earned the position of being a tastemaker, I try to use that position responsibly and try to promote people I think are very good,” he said. “And give them a little push up the ladder.” Over the long conversation, Mr. Parr deflected many attempts at praise for his accomplishments (including when he mentioned that Lee Friedlander has more than 100 books as well), but in light of his current success, he was willing to be philosophical for a moment in the end. “I told myself that people take my work seriously, and I’m paid to do my hobby,” he said. “It’s a wonderful privilege, and I’m grateful to have these opportunities to get the work out. I’m quite humbled by it all.” Follow @nytimesphoto and @jblauphoto on Twitter. You can also find us on Facebook and Instagram.",The New York Times
2019,Will Naomi Osaka Pick Japanese Citizenship or American? Her Deadline to Choose Is Looming,"TOKYO — If anyone can stir Japanese national pride at the moment, it is Naomi Osaka. The world’s No. 1-ranked player in women’s tennis, Ms. Osaka is among the biggest stars in Japan, splashed across television programs and advertisements for Nissan cars and Citizen watches. As a mixed-race person, she has also helped prompt a discussion about how Japanese see their country. But a looming deadline — Ms. Osaka’s 22nd birthday in October — has raised the question of whether she can continue to represent Japan on the international tennis circuit, where she has given the country bragging rights on the world sports stage. Ms. Osaka, whose mother is Japanese and father is Haitian-American, has citizenship in both Japan and the United States. Under Japanese law, dual citizens must choose between the two nationalities by the time they turn 22. That legal clause has left fans and commentators trying to guess whether Ms. Osaka will pick citizenship in Japan, the country of her birth, or the United States, where she has lived since she was a young child. The choice facing Ms. Osaka comes as Japan is under pressure to loosen its entrenched insularity. Japan has long prized racial purity, seeing a largely homogeneous population as crucial to social cohesion. But with the country’s population declining and employers increasingly desperate for workers, its legislature passed a law in December to admit more guest workers, starting this month. Ms. Osaka’s case, along with the new influx of foreigners, could exert new pressure on the government to begin to bring Japanese citizenship laws in line with those in the roughly three-quarters of countries, including the United States, that allow dual citizenship. For now, though, Ms. Osaka has a decision to make. When asked by reporters which nationality she intended to choose, she responded with trademark feistiness. “I’m pretty sure it’s obvious,” she said at a news conference following the China Open in October. “I’m playing for Japan. Not to be disrespectful or anything, but I don’t really get where the conclusion that it’s a hard choice for me or anything comes from.” Still, it might be hard to imagine Ms. Osaka giving up her American citizenship to keep playing under the Japanese flag. And in reality, she may not have to. Legal experts say the Japanese government rarely enforces the law requiring citizens to choose between nationalities. The Justice Ministry estimates that about 890,000 Japanese citizens may also hold foreign passports, and the government has never revoked Japanese citizenship from anyone who, like Ms. Osaka, was granted citizenship at birth. (Japanese citizens who voluntarily naturalize in another country automatically lose their Japanese citizenship.) But some analysts warn that because of Ms. Osaka’s celebrity, it would be difficult for the government to quietly give her a pass on dual citizenship. “I think for the government it is a problem if she openly carries on having two passports,” said Sachiko Horiguchi, associate professor of anthropology at Temple University’s Tokyo campus. “Because that means the public would know that the law isn’t really enforced. I don’t think the government wants to admit that or the public to know that.” Three years ago, when Renho Murata, whose father is from Taiwan, ran as the first woman to lead the opposition Democratic Party, right-wing critics attacked her because she had not formally relinquished her Taiwanese citizenship. Partly in response to the frenzy over Ms. Murata, Kimi Onoda, a member of Parliament from the governing Liberal Democratic Party who was born in the United States to an American father and a Japanese mother, formally renounced her American citizenship. Ms. Osaka’s multicultural background has challenged Japan’s notions of national identity, and she has become the most prominent mixed-race and mixed-nationality figure in a country where only one in 50 children born each year has a foreign parent. Though she is not fluent in Japanese, she has captivated the country with her whimsical remarks to the news media, as well as her humility in victory. Her parents decided when she was young that she and her sister, who also played, would represent Japan, partly because the American tennis federation showed them little attention. Anticipating Ms. Osaka’s citizenship choice, Michio Ushioda, a former columnist for The Mainichi Shimbun, a daily newspaper, and a professor at Teikyo University in Tokyo, said on Twitter that Japan would fall into a national funk if she elected American citizenship over Japanese. “The disappointment of the Japanese at that time would be great,” Mr. Ushioda wrote in a tweet that only select followers could view, even suggesting that Japan’s current administration would collapse if Ms. Osaka competed for the United States in the Olympics. Under International Olympic Committee rules, competitors must be nationals of the countries they represent. Similarly, under International Tennis Federation rules, Ms. Osaka could not play for Japan if she gave up her Japanese citizenship. Legal experts say Japanese law provides a loophole through which dual citizens can effectively retain both nationalities. The law requires only that a Japanese citizen “endeavor to renounce” foreign nationality, a phrase that can provide just enough wiggle room for citizens to hold on to an extra passport. “Many people misunderstand the law and feel threatened that they have to choose a nationality,” said Yasuhiro Okuda, a law professor at Chuo University. Until 1985, Japan granted citizenship only to children whose fathers were Japanese. When it changed the law — a move it made under pressure from international critics who said the rules discriminated against women — the government added the clause stipulating that children with dual citizenship would have to choose between their passports by the time they turned 22. Analysts say Japan’s law makes little sense in a modern world filled with multicultural citizens like Ms. Osaka. “It goes against Japan’s efforts to recruit and retain global talent,” said Erin Chung, a professor of East Asian politics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. “If you basically maintain the spirit of the current nationality act, that will be a huge deterrent for athletes and other members of what’s called the global talent pool to stay in Japan.” For older generations, opening Japan to a pool of newly naturalized citizens could generate a considerable political backlash. But younger Japanese are growing more accustomed to living and working with international neighbors and colleagues. “Young people in their 20s now are much more familiar with foreigners or so-called ‘hafu,’” said Satoko Takeda, a visiting researcher at Osaka University of Economics and Law, using the Japanese term, from the English word “half,” to describe those of mixed-race descent like Ms. Osaka. “They are different from previous generations. I think there is hope.”",The New York Times
2019,Will Selfies Save the Flower District?,"Trendy hotels and boutiques have cropped up recently, resulting in higher rents, but also more foot traffic. Historically, one block of West 28th Street has been dominated by plant and flower wholesalers. But that could be changing.CreditCreditAli Kate Cherkis for The New York Times New York’s flower district, more than 100 years old and a home mostly to wholesalers, used to thrive like a jungle along Sixth Avenue. Now it is concentrated in just one block of West 28th Street. Long said to be on its way out because of a changing industry and continually rising rents in Chelsea, its surrounding neighborhood, the district could be saved, at least symbolically, from the very thing threatening its existence: gentrification. In between the shops offering garden accessories and roses or ferns in bulk, several trendy hotels have recently opened on the block. Instead of pushing out the local shops, they are relying on the uniqueness of the flower district to lure visitors. 34Th ST. MANHATTAN Chelsea JRose Wholesale Flowers Hotel Hayden Moxy Chelsea/ Fleur Room 30Th ST. Caribbean Cuts 28th Street Flower District AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS Hotel Henri MADISON SQUARE PARK 23RD ST. By The New York Times The Moxy Chelsea opened on West 28th Street in February. The property is covered in flowers. In the lobby is the first retail shop of a well-known floral design company, Putnam & Putnam, which has its workshop across the street. Vertical gardens are on the second floor. The hotel’s crown jewel is the Fleur Room, a lounge and nightclub on the 35th floor. Cocktails are dressed with blossoms (some are even lodged inside ice cubes). Couches are covered with a floral velvet. Vases of flowers are placed strategically between tables. “It is all inspired by Dutch floral paintings from the 17th century,” said Angelo Bianchi, who operates the Fleur Room alongside Tao Group. Part of his attraction to the project was that it was on this particular street. “I moved to the city when I was 17, and the first time I discovered this block I felt it was a magical oasis, one of the coolest blocks in the city because you just don’t expect all these flowers of different colors here,” he said. “Being on this block is essential to our identity.” On weekends young people line up for the Fleur Room. And lines are not something to which this neighborhood is accustomed. Historically, the sidewalks of West 28th Street have been more cluttered with potted plants than people, with the exception being early in the morning, when florists, event planners caterers and other trade professionals visit. But now, throughout the day, tourists and New Yorkers alike are visiting. And lingering. The vegetation, it turns out, is proving to be popular backdrop for photography and general loafing. “The flower district has become more of a fun neighborhood,” said Tom Weisse, who owns Caribbean Cuts, which has been on the block for more than 30 years and specializes in tropical flowers and foliage. “People come in wanting to take pictures,” he continued. “Some people have even asked to rent my space out.” Troy Baksh, the owner of JRose Wholesale Flowers, which has been on West 28th Street for seven years, said people are also looking for Instagram moments inside of his shop. “It’s forcing me to do a better job cleaning my floors and walls,” he said. “You never know who will see those photos.” Whether this interest in the neighborhood will be lucrative for the flower shops is up for debate. But interest means attention, at least. And some people on the block are capitalizing on it. Lewis Miller, a florist and event planner based in the district, has started a “Flower Flash” where he sets up elaborate displays in trash cans, subway stations and other random sites all over the city. “Surprising these jaded creatures who live in this urban jungle with a surge of flowers when they least expect it is a total joy for me and hopefully for them too,” said Mr. Miller, who has over 120,000 followers on Instagram. Others businesses in or around West 28th Street are also cropping up, making the neighborhood more of a destination for those outside the flower trade. Two years ago, a hotel on the block since 2009 rebranded as the Hotel Hayden and opened a buzzy rooftop bar, Mykonos Blue. In January Emeril Lagasse helped open a restaurant in Hotel Henri, four blocks away. A Peloton studio and a Cha Cha Matcha are also close by. “The area was very deserted,” said Audrey Stipanovich, who owns Pastoral, a flower shop on the Lower East Side, of the flower district, where she still conducts business at least once a week. “There wasn’t even a place to get coffee to go.” She now has breakfast at the Chelsea Moxy, where she bumps into other florists. “It’s quickly become a local spot, a place we can hang,” she said. She even spent the night at the hotel once, when she needed to be at the market early the next day. The growth has inspired shop owners already in the district, like Mr. Baksh, to create a more inviting environment for clients. In the next two months he’s opening a space in his store for customers to get bagels and coffee. “I want to show them how much we appreciate them,” he said. Still, there are downsides to the rapid development, the main one being parking. “The parking garage where our clients used to park has been torn down,” Mr. Baksh said. “Now they have to park on the street. It’s a nuisance for them.” Mr. Weiss said having lots of random people browsing in his shop is not helpful for professional florists who come there to focus. “A lot of my customers need to come in here and get out,” he said. “I can feel their frustration. It isn’t as easy for them.” Then there is the unfortunate fact of renting in a hot neighborhood. “Is the flower district dying right now?” Mr. Baksh said. “No, but rent is going up, and eventually flower shops won’t be able to afford it. It’s going to cause a slow death.” In the short term, Mr. Baksh hopes that the new businesses continue to honor the neighborhood’s history and identity. “At least the Chelsea Moxy has Putnam,” he said of its mini store. “At least they are keeping the flower market surviving.”",The New York Times
2019,Will Serena Williams and Rafael Nadal Be Ready for the Clay-Court Season?,"On Tennis The main clay-court season is officially underway, and this time around it is particularly unclear how the dust might settle. If Rafael Nadal is truly healthy after aggravating a right knee injury three weeks ago — he has been training at home to prepare for the Monte Carlo Open — he remains the man to beat on the game’s grittiest surface. No one else has won 11 French Open singles titles, and the rational assumption is that no one else ever will. But the women’s game is in a wondrous state of flux, with 14 different champions in the season’s first 14 tournaments. And none of them was named Serena Williams, Maria Sharapova or Simona Halep. “It’s by far the most wide-open field as far as I can remember,” Chris Evert, the former No. 1 and a seven-time French Open champion, said in an interview Tuesday. “No one seems to have obvious momentum above the other. It’s not only the closeness in talent and skills. Attitudes, emotions and fitness and injuries enter into it as well. I have no clue.” Serena Williams has not won a title since returning to the tour in March 2018 after giving birth to her daughter. She has played only three tournaments this season and has not finished any of them feeling healthy. She twisted an ankle while on the brink of victory in an Australian Open quarterfinal against Karolina Pliskova and lost a 5-1 third-set lead, unable to convert on four match points. In Indian Wells, Calif., Williams retired in the third round against Garbiñe Muguruza, citing a viral illness. In Miami, she withdrew after winning her opening match, citing a left knee injury. Williams is 37, and her knees have long been a concern, restricting her training through the years. She does not plan to compete again until the Italian Open in Rome in mid-May, shortly before the French Open. That will leave her short of matches against an increasingly deep and confident field, which is full of young, exciting talents with all-court games who have grown up dealing with big pace. Williams’s quest for a record-tying 24th Grand Slam singles title, which once looked like only a matter of time, is now a more complicated matter. But discounting Williams is rarely a winning proposition. She has managed to play some sparkling tennis in 2019, striking the ball very cleanly in some of the early rounds in Australia and again in her victory over Victoria Azarenka in Indian Wells. “A healthy Serena is a dangerous Serena; she hasn’t been healthy all year,” Evert said. “She still has an edge in power and experience.” Williams also has the most impressive career record on clay of any active player: 170-34. Her career winning percentage of 83.3 puts her ahead of Sharapova, who is at 81.5 percent with plenty of doubt swirling about her form and her tennis future at age 31. Happy off the court but vulnerable on it, she has not competed since January because of injuries and has not reached a tour final since winning the Tianjin Open in October 2017. Halep has the best clay-court numbers over the last few seasons and leads the WTA Tour’s clay-court power rankings, which give more weight to recent results. But even as she again closes in on being No. 1, Halep, 27, has hardly been dominant. Oui, she won last year’s French Open, her first Grand Slam singles title. But she has not won another clay-court title since Madrid in May 2017 and has not won a tournament on any surface since the Rogers Cup in Canada in August. Without Darren Cahill as her coach this season, Halep has not looked like the same resolute and selectively aggressive force, although her run to the semifinals of the Miami Open last week was encouraging. The biggest prizes in 2019 have gone to younger women, all under age 23. Naomi Osaka, 21, won the year’s first Grand Slam title at the Australian Open and remains No. 1 by a whisker. Belinda Bencic, 22, won the Premier 5 event in Dubai. Most surprisingly, Bianca Andreescu, 18, won the Premier Mandatory event in Indian Wells, and then Ashleigh Barty, 22, confirmed her steady rise by winning in Miami. Andreescu and Barty have the skills to thrive on clay — their strong topspin forehands, quick feet and ability to hit sliced backhands, well-disguised drop shots and heavy first and second serves. But the big-hitting Osaka has a losing record on clay (9-11) and likes to call herself “a hardcourt player.” She also has lost momentum since her surprising split with her coach, Sascha Bajin, after the Australian Open. She has hired Venus Williams’s former hitting partner, Jermaine Jenkins, a college star with a reassuring courtside demeanor. But for now, Osaka is only 3-3 since winning in Melbourne, with losses to Kristina Mladenovic in Dubai, to Bencic in Indian Wells and to the changeup artist Hsieh Su-wei in Miami. Novak Djokovic, the men’s No. 1, also has the wind in his face after losing early in Indian Wells and Miami. But he has won three Grand Slam singles titles in a row, and it is difficult to disregard the memory of Djokovic having his way from the baseline against Nadal in the Australian Open final. Nadal, 32, continues to battle his body. A recurrence of tendinitis in his right knee caused him to withdraw before his semifinal against Roger Federer in Indian Wells. At this stage, he knows too well the price of pushing through pain, although pain has been a constant. How much longer can he do it? “Who knows? Perhaps two or three years more,” Toni Nadal, his uncle and former coach, said at a recent appearance in Majorca. “What I say is that Rafael is not a person who plays tennis. He is an injured person who plays tennis, and that is very difficult.” Nadal is back training hard in Majorca on a surface that is more forgiving to his joints than hardcourts. He is on schedule to defend his title in Monte Carlo this month. Djokovic and No. 5 Dominic Thiem, Nadal’s two most obvious rivals for the biggest men’s clay-court titles, are expected to challenge him there. So is third-ranked Alexander Zverev, who has a fine clay-court record and the talent to win multiple majors but has been slumping. Federer, back on a roll at age 37 after winning in Miami and intent on returning to clay after a three-year break, plans to come back in Madrid in early May after training in Switzerland. “I still think Rafa is in a great place on clay,” said David Macpherson, the coach of John Isner, the top-ranked American, who may miss much of the clay-court season with a stress fracture in his foot. “The only one who has shown the ability to break up Rafa’s game at times is Novak, with his ability to smother that topspin forehand early with his pure two-handed backhand and negate Rafa’s strengths on clay. So that’s always a fascinating matchup.” But based on all the plot twists and ankle twists in 2019 so far, there are no guarantees that it will be the decisive matchup. Time to watch the dust try to settle.",The New York Times
2019,Will Wall Street Lose Faith in the Fed?,"The Federal Reserve gave Wall Street just about everything it wanted, helping to make the first three months of 2019 a great time to be in stocks and bonds. Yet Fed policy may be partly responsible for problems in the markets, too, raising the prospect of a reversal later this year. For the quarter, the average domestic stock fund tracked by Morningstar gained 13.5 percent, led by specialists in technology, energy and consumer issues. Bond funds were up 3.8 percent, and international stocks rose 11.1 percent, with funds that focus on China and other emerging markets doing best. But some market strategists worry that the Fed has been trying too hard to please investors. “Central banks feel pressure to act when they should do nothing,” said Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management. “That’s a terrible message: ‘Don’t worry because we’ll be there for you.’” The Fed abruptly signaled, just as 2019 began, that it was shifting to an easier monetary policy when there were unmistakable signs that economic growth was flagging. The Fed’s benign message sent stocks to the best January in more than 30 years after the worst December in nearly a century. But when the central bank reiterated its relaxed posture last month, promising not to raise interest rates this year, the reaction in the stock market was less enthusiastic, and bond yields sank, a sign of concern about economic prospects. Traders who keep faith with the Fed may feel vindicated by its decision to move in a dovish direction and no doubt will continue to support share prices. But the Fed has come under pressure from President Trump to be more dovish still. And some investment advisers detect a whiff of desperation in the Fed’s efforts to keep the economic recovery and bull market going into their second decade. They question how long either can continue before a painful reckoning. Highlights of mutual fund performance in the first quarter.

Core CGM Focus By The New York Times | Source: Morningstar “They screwed up badly by making us worry they’re out of bullets,” said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group. “You don’t say you’re going to guarantee no rate hikes until 2020. What are they so scared about all of a sudden?” The short answer: a recession. By one important measure, the economy is doing nicely; the unemployment rate was 3.8 percent in March, close to a 50-year low. But that tends to be a lagging indicator, as employers are reluctant to let workers go until they have no choice. Much other data, related to factors as diverse as housing, borrowing, consumer confidence and manufacturing, hints that the decade-long economic expansion may be in jeopardy. The stock market was happy to put its faith in the Fed’s renewed commitment to buoy the economy through most of the first quarter; even after losing a bit of ground in the final week or so, the S&P 500 rose 13.1 percent. But bond traders seem unconvinced. The yield on 10-year Treasury issues sank from about 3.2 percent in October to 2.44 percent on March 22, less than the 2.45 percent rate on three-month Treasury bills. That condition, an inverted yield curve, didn’t last long. The 10-year rate on Thursday was 2.5 percent; the three-month rate, 2.36 percent. But the brief inversion suggested that investors were anticipating slow growth for a long time, dovish Fed or not. Although the extent of the Fed’s ability to influence the markets is open to debate — the changes it makes to the interest rates it sets tend to follow changes in market rates — Komal Sri-Kumar, president of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies, said the Fed could support the stock market if other factors, such as valuations, cooperated. “If it’s very overvalued and the Fed cuts rates to help, it’s not going to prevent a correction,” he said. Mr. Sri-Kumar expects the Fed to reduce interest rates in June and September. Valuations are reasonable enough, in his opinion, that “the Fed has a chance” of propping up stocks, but if it continues to cut after that or begin a new round of asset purchases, even with stocks doing well, it may prove counterproductive. “The Fed is going to help the stock market for some time, but by the end of 2019, it will run out of options,” he said. “If valuations are much higher than today and the Fed says it’s going to keep the rally going, then people will say, ‘The Fed probably knows something about the economy, so I’ll sell.’” What everyone seems to believe about the economy is that it’s on less stable footing than last year. The Baltic Dry Index, which measures the cost of carrying bulk goods by ship, plunged more than 30 percent in nine months, to a three-year low. Defaults on loans to American farmers recently hit a nine-year high, and a record number of car loans are 90 days past due. The economic picture abroad is worrisome, too. Growth in China has subsided as frosty trade relations with the United States linger. As uncertainties remained over exactly how Britain would detach itself from the European Union, the Bank of England last month reported reductions in growth in construction and retail sales, and a decline in manufacturing output. German industrial orders just recorded their biggest year-on-year drop since 2009, raising recession fears there. The slowing growth is filtering through to corporate earnings. The companies in the S&P 500 are estimated to have made 4.1 percent less in the first quarter than in the first quarter of 2018, according to FactSet Research. The firm foresees a modest pickup for the full year to 3.6 percent growth. For many market professionals, it’s a question of when, not if, the economic and earnings backdrops become too feeble and stocks suffer another fall. Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citi Research, says the clock is ticking. “If the Fed’s not going to raise rates tomorrow, that’s fine,” he said, “but there’s a sense that this is the end of the cycle.” The Fed’s about-face “was a very powerful buy signal” and a “major reset of expectations,” Mr. Levkovich said, but manufacturing has looked weak for several months, based on orders for durable goods, surveys of purchasing managers and German exports to China. Another concern is surveys indicating more rigorous standards on commercial and industrial loans, which “tightened up sharply in the fourth quarter,” he said. Changes in lending standards tend to be felt in the economy about nine months later, he noted, so “late in the third quarter or in the fourth, we’re likely to see some softening up of economic data and earnings.” Mr. Levkovich expects the S&P 500 to end the year at 2,850, near where it is now, and it could reach 2,950 before easing. Until then, economically sensitive areas that weakened as growth slowed, such as energy, semiconductors and capital goods, could outperform, he said, and if you’re looking for something safer as a hedge, try big pharmaceutical companies. Ian Mortimer, co-manager of the Guinness Atkinson Global Innovators fund, also likes semiconductors, one of several technology niches that he expects to grow even in an iffy economy, including payments and e-commerce. These tech segments can capitalize on the expansion of data centers and the development of artificial intelligence and the internet of things, or the use of internet connections to enhance the use of everyday, real-world objects. “These secular-growth themes continue to grow regardless of what the market is doing,” he said. By contrast, “older industries are feeling pressures.” Mr. Paolini at Pictet called the first-quarter rally “an overreaction to an overreaction” and warned that “the next big move is going to be down, not up.” But while he sees “lots of headwinds” preventing the market from rising in the short term, he added, “I don’t see a clear catalyst for a significant decline.” He finds more opportunities overseas. American defensive stocks may be expensive, for instance, but a higher proportion of British stocks are in defensive sectors, and they are much cheaper, he said. When signs of a recovery in global growth appear, he would put more money into Continental Europe, where economically sensitive stocks are reasonably priced, and Japan. Mr. Paulsen expressed concern about the yield curve, but he saw few other harbingers of recession. Household debt is well behaved, and the leading indicators index, a basket of economic measures that tend to move ahead of changes in economic growth, is at a record high. The sharp decline in bond yields and the correction last year have taken the backdrop for stocks “from hostile to hospitable,” he said. He also noted that sentiment is “so bearish and cautious,” which often occurs closer to bottoms in stocks than tops. He’s not bearish, but he is cautious. Whatever an investor’s neutral allocation to stocks would be, he recommends committing slightly more, particularly in foreign markets and in economically sensitive niches like energy, basic materials and industrials. As important a signal as the inverted yield curve may be, Mr. Paulsen suggested that it might be sending a false signal because it has occurred under the unorthodox practices and unique conditions engineered by the Fed after the financial crisis a decade ago. He wouldn’t bet much on the economic expansion or the bull market persisting, but he wouldn’t bet much against it, either. “I like the odds that we’re overestimating risks, but that’s not to say it’s not the start of 2008 again,” he said. “Everything about the Fed has been weird in this cycle. If this has the weirdest ending, it shouldn’t shock us, but that doesn’t necessarily mean a bear market. What if we had another five years of recovery? There are a lot of different weird ways this could go.”",The New York Times
2019,Will a Fee Make You Ditch Paper Bags? N.Y.C. Hopes So,"[Want to get New York Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.] It’s Tuesday. “This American Life” featured a family from Queens whose 12 adult children created an “impressive but extreme” way to divide their parents’ estate. Weather: A sunny day that could reach the mid-70s. Chance of rain tonight. Alternate-side parking: In effect through Wednesday, then suspended Thursday to Saturday. You’ve probably heard that New York State is banning single-use plastic bags next year. Governor Cuomo held a public ceremony yesterday, on Earth Day, to sign that legislation into law. What you may not have heard is that days earlier, New York’s City Council passed a bill approving a 5-cent fee on each paper carryout bag. Mayor de Blasio supports the fee, which is expected to take effect next March, on the same day the plastic bag ban begins. If it seems like the city is trying to get you to abandon single-use bags, you’re right. “We’ve developed a throwaway culture in which we use something once,” said Councilman Brad Lander, Democrat of Brooklyn and a sponsor of the paper bag fee. “There are some behaviors that we need to change that turn out not to be that hard to change.” Here’s what you need to know: Remind me, which plastic bags will be banned? Essentially, the plastic bags you get at grocery stores and bodegas. What about plastic bags for takeout food at restaurants? Those will not be banned. Neither will plastic bags purchased in bulk, like garbage bags. Why does the city want a fee on paper bags? To discourage you from using them. “Paper bags are a lot heavier than plastic bags,” Mr. Lander said. Transporting those heavier bags is more expensive and is less environmentally friendly than you might think, he added. Mr. Landler estimated that the city spends $12 million to $13 million a year putting plastic bags in landfills, and if everyone switched to paper bags, “that number would go up, because paper bags are so much heavier. We might spend $20 million more.” But aren’t paper bags an environmentally friendly alternative to plastic bags? To make paper bags, a lot of trees are cut down, and a lot of water and chemicals are used. That process, in aggregate, isn’t great for the environment. You want me to remember to bring reusable bags to the store? Many people do it — “from Washington, D.C., to California to Seattle to Ireland to Israel,” said Mr. Lander, rattling off places where reusable bags are encouraged through a mix of bans and fees on single-use bags. “We bring things with us every day,” Mr. Lander added. “We remember our wallets, and our keys, and our handbags or purses and cellphones.” And part of the fee will help pay for a program to provide free reusable bags. Which stores will be affected by the 5-cent fee? Many stores, like supermarkets and clothing shops. “Supermarkets are where the massive volume of single-use bags comes from,” Mr. Lander said. People who receive food stamps or other forms of government assistance will be exempt from the fee. Which stores will not be affected by the 5-cent fee? Restaurants. People want food delivered with as little spillage as possible. Who opposes the 5-cent fee? The president of the Food Industry Alliance of New York State said the legislation could result in higher costs for retailers, which would not receive any of the revenue. Councilman Robert F. Holden, Democrat of Queens, was one of nine lawmakers who voted against the legislation, saying the fee would hit customers’ wallets.

The leading drivers of homelessness in New York City are domestic violence and eviction, but just 7 percent of New Yorkers believe they are the causes pushing thousands of people into shelters, according to a survey recently commissioned by Win, a nonprofit provider of shelters for families. New Yorkers see single adults living on the streets as the face of homelessness, even as families with children make up the majority of the homeless population. Nearly a quarter of survey respondents pointed to mental illness as a cause of homelessness. The survey was conducted as some Staten Island residents mounted opposition against Win’s proposal to open a 200-bed shelter in the borough. — Nikita Stewart New York City prosecutors are building databases to track police officers who may have credibility problems as witnesses at trial.

Organizing one of Manhattan’s most recognizable street fairs, the Feast of San Gennaro in Little Italy, apparently isn’t as easy as it used to be. “There are no Italian vendors anymore,” said Mort Berkowitz, who runs that event and has been called one of New York City’s street fair kings. In 2014, to make sure there was enough Italian flavor, Mr. Berkowitz had a bakery make a 350-pound cannoli. Two years later there was an enormous cake. “It was six feet high, and it weighed close to 10,000 pounds,” he said. Mr. Berkowitz has been organizing street fairs since 1973 — longer than I’ve been alive. In that time, he has weathered plenty of storms. Not everyone is fond of the approximately 200 street fairs in the city each year, he said. People grumble about the traffic, the fees that organizers pocket and the lack of vendors’ originality. What’s a street fair organizer to do? “We’ve had tuba competitions and vocal competitions,” Mr. Berkowitz recalled. “I do a blueberry competition in Teaneck. I’ve done pizza competitions on Ninth Avenue.” But the biggest challenge facing street fairs? Rain, Mr. Berkowitz said. “I think the climate is changing,” he said. “There is more rain. Maybe not during the week, but on weekends.” New York City had 31 percent more precipitation last year than normal. Five of the city’s 10 wettest years have occurred since 2003. “Last spring, there was rain every single Saturday or Sunday between April and June, and people got clobbered,” Mr. Berkowitz said. But still, the show — or street fair — must go on. Mr. Berkowitz’s next street fair is on Sunday, “when you can learn to play tennis: Broadway from 96 to 106,” he said.

2019,Will a GoFundMe Squash San Francisco’s Plans for a Homeless Center?,"California Today Good morning. (Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get it by email.) It’s a grim conundrum plaguing communities throughout the state: Everyone agrees that homelessness is a problem and that shelters and service centers would help get people off the streets. But other residents say they don’t want such facilities to be built anywhere near them. A version of this problem has sprung up in San Francisco — and, because it’s San Francisco, it’s been heightened by the influence of tech money. My colleague Mike Isaac, who covers tech, wrote about the fight: It began as a disagreement between homeowners and the city. By late last week, that disagreement swelled into a full-fledged battle between groups of San Francisco residents over what to do with a center intended to provide shelter and resources for the homeless. The debate is centered around a plan by Mayor London Breed, who has proposed the city should erect a Navigation Center for the homeless on a stretch of vacant land near the city shoreline. The center, which would offer roughly 225 beds and other resources to the homeless, would be situated at Seawall Lot 330, a 2.3 acre parcel currently being used as a parking lot, sitting off the Embarcadero near the Bay Bridge. But a group of homeowners in nearby luxury apartments aren’t having it. Residents in the Rincon Hill and SOMA areas have banded together to oppose the Navigation Center, claiming that it would turn the area into a “dirty, dangerous” neighborhood. Members of the group have flooded into community hearings and meetings to voice concerns. To further the cause, the group started an online crowdfunding page under the name “Safe Embarcadero for All.” The group’s GoFundMe campaign has raised more than $80,000 to hire a lawyer to push back against the city. As news of the GoFundMe hit the internet in a San Francisco Chronicle article last week, other San Francisco residents took umbrage with the group’s goal. William Fitzgerald, a local community activist and supporter of building resource centers for San Francisco’s upward of 7,000 homeless citizens, decided to build his own GoFundMe. Mr. Fitzgerald’s competing campaign, “A Safer Embarcadero for All,” intended to raise funds to support the building of the Navigation Center in the area. Mr. Fitzgerald’s GoFundMe page went up on Thursday. By Friday, the group had raised tens of thousands of dollars, and was steadily gaining more supporters as word of the effort spread virally. Marc Benioff, the tech billionaire and founder of Salesforce, donated $10,000 to Mr. Fitzgerald’s campaign. The co-founders of Twilio matched Mr. Benioff with thousands of their own. Hours later, Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter, donated $25,000 of his own money to the project. The issue is far from settled, as both groups continue to jockey for support both for and against the project. But at least one of them has pulled ahead: By Monday afternoon, the “Safer” campaign had managed to raise $145,000, outraising the opposing campaign by $60,000 in roughly a third of time.

2019,Opinion | Will the Census Count All of America?,"If the Supreme Court allows a citizenship question in the 2020 count, it could profoundly affect the nation’s representative democracy. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. The Constitution calls for an “actual Enumeration” of each state’s population every 10 years, and since 1790, Congress has enacted legislation to fulfill that mandate. The decennial count, managed at the United States Census Bureau, aims to fulfill that constitutional requirement. Next week, in what promises to be the highest-profile case of this Supreme Court term, the court will consider whether the Trump administration complied with these dictates when it sought to add to the 2020 census a question about whether the respondent is a United States citizen. At the heart of the dispute lies the question: Who gets to be counted? Federal law protects the privacy of everyone who responds to the census. But that’s small comfort for immigrants and their families living in a climate of fear under President Trump. Bureau officials have for decades recognized that communities with significant immigrant populations are likely to be undercounted if there is a citizenship question on the census. The 2020 count is no exception. Three federal judges — in New York, California and Maryland — have held trials and ruled that Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, who oversees the Census bureau, violated the law when he ignored available data and ordered the agency to move ahead with the citizenship question. As those judges noted, the bureau’s own career scientists and statisticians were kept in the dark about Mr. Ross’s plans, which were devised in the early days of the Trump administration by the president’s former chief strategist Steve Bannon and by Kris Kobach, then the Kansas secretary of state and a notorious immigration hard-liner. United States District Judge Jesse Furman, who first struck down the citizenship question in January, said Mr. Ross ran afoul of “a veritable smorgasbord” of rules governed by the Administrative Procedure Act, a cornerstone of federal law that tells the government how to do its job. Judge Furman didn’t hold back. Mr. Ross “failed to consider several important aspects of the problem; alternately ignored, cherry-picked, or badly misconstrued the evidence in the record before him; acted irrationally both in light of that evidence and his own stated decisional criteria; and failed to justify significant departures from past policies and practices,” he wrote. Mr. Ross has defended the citizenship question by arguing that the Justice Department needs the information to better enforce the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Judge Furman rightfully called that rationale “pretextual” — the secretary searched for it after he had decided what he wanted. By the bureau’s own, nonpartisan analysis, adding a citizenship question to the “short form” that will go to every household in America in 2020 could result in an undercount of 6.5 million people — close to the entire population of Indiana or Tennessee. And the agency has told Mr. Ross that there are better alternatives to a citizenship question that wouldn’t pose significant “potential quality and cost disruptions” in administering the census, such as deriving citizenship data from the American Community Survey, a longer questionnaire sent out annually that already asks such a question. It’s against this backdrop that the Supreme Court will decide whether Mr. Ross followed the procedures set out in federal law. Technical though that inquiry may seem, the justices’ decision could have profound consequences. The census today helps determine key aspects of the nation’s representative democracy: how many seats in Congress will be apportioned among the states, and thus in the Electoral College; the distribution of billions of dollars in federal funds; and how state and congressional districts will be drawn in the next redistricting cycle. The data collected also goes to other uses that are vital to local communities and businesses. Two versions of the 2020 census form — one with the citizenship question and one without — are ready to be printed the moment the Supreme Court rules, most likely at the end of June. Whether the nation gets an accurate and fair count of its residents is now in the justices’ hands. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2019,Opinion | Will the Israeli ‘King’ Be Recrowned?,"Prolonging the Netanyahu era would undermine Israeli democracy and bury any last hope of a two-state peace. It's time for Benny Gantz. Opinion Columnist TEL AVIV — As if facing indictment on bribery and other charges were not a big enough problem for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, along comes a rugged, retired army chief called Benny Gantz, an Israeli hero straight out of Central Casting, to challenge the “King of Israel.” Gantz, in his gruff authenticity, gets under Netanyahu’s skin. A mensch-ousts-manipulator dethronement in Israeli elections on Tuesday can no longer be ruled out. It’s still a long shot, however. Netanyahu, seeking a fifth term after a total of 13 years in power, is fighting not only to extend his rule but also to stay out of jail. “He has to leverage political success into stopping the criminal process,” Dan Meridor, a former minister of intelligence and deputy prime minister in a Netanyahu government, told me. This tends to focus the mind. Netanyahu, who has the strong backing of President Trump, is at his shrewdest and most ruthless when backed into a corner. He has vowed to start annexing the West Bank, wherever an Israeli settler may be, in a last-minute gambit. The support for him that popularized that regal “melekh yisrael” epithet is fanatical, despite the accusations from the attorney general that the prime minister traded official favors for gifts and for flattering news coverage. “A blood libel,” Netanyahu calls the charges. To the last, he will summon every specter of the “Arab-loving left” in a bid to hang on. That he will stop at nothing is by now well known. I wish I could say this election was about something — the Palestinian conflict, the bottoming-out of the middle class, Iranian threats — other than Netanyahu. It’s not. This gives it an almost ritualistic quality: Israelis have gotten used to going through the ballot-box motions and then bowing to their “magician.” The prime minister’s instincts are as feral as Trump’s. His hold on the Israeli imagination is tenacious. The question is whether this grip can be broken in a country where the start-up economy is humming, the American Embassy is in Jerusalem, and military conflict has been contained. A lot of Israelis feel good, or good enough, about Netanyahu’s nation. Israel is a changed country. The land-for-peace left died. It broke as a political camp; the idea was orphaned. Separation supplanted peace as Israel's aspiration. Palestinians, for many Israelis, continue their eerie passage into abstraction, a process cynically encouraged by the Trump administration. A half-century on, it seems the White House is circling back to Golda Meir’s “There is no Palestinian people.” The one politician who put the peace issue front and center, the former foreign minister Tzipi Livni, dropped out — from the campaign and from politics altogether. “If you are left, you will lose,” Polly Bronstein, who heads a movement to empower the political center, told me. Yes, it’s that simple. Enter Gantz, 59, son of a Holocaust survivor, born and raised in an agricultural cooperative, paratrooper, chief of staff of the Israeli Defense Forces, with his candid blue-eyed gaze, his less-than-perfect English (“Let me up-front you,” “Ladies and Gentlemens”), his Sabra quintessence and his weary-yet-resolute air reminiscent of murdered Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. “Strength and moral power come together,” he told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or Aipac, to vigorous applause in Washington last month. “Moral” is not a word Netanyahu can utter with a straight face. Gantz, whose new Blue and White party borrows the colors of the Israeli flag, produced a black-and-white photograph of his mother, weighing 90 pounds, as she emerged from Bergen-Belsen. It may be too much to ask of Israel, in its harsh neighborhood, to be a “light unto nations.” But it must surely stand for something more ennobling than graft. Blue and White is the latest in a series of parties — Kadima (“Forward”), Yair Lapid’s Yesh Atid (“There is a future”) and Isaac Herzog’s Zionist Union — that have tried over the past decade to create a centrist alternative to Netanyahu, Likud and the prime minister’s increasingly rabid crew of rightists, ranging from the religious Messianic to the racist nationalist. They all failed. Although fragmented, the half-dozen right-wing parties including Likud still appear to have a more plausible path to a Knesset majority than any potential Gantz coalition. But it’s close and unpredictable, with many voters undecided and the question open of which small parties make the threshold for Knesset admission. The forebears of Blue and White could not convince an Israel drifting right on the back of Russian immigration and Palestinian violence of the security and viability of a post-Netanyahu Israel. Now three former generals — Gantz himself, Moshe Ya’alon and Gabi Ashkenazi — are screaming security, security and security. Lapid, the fourth party leader, brings a touch of razzmatazz. The presence of Ashkenazi, a Mizrahi Jew, is important because Jews of North African and Middle Eastern stock have always formed a Netanyahu stronghold. The prime minister has cleverly exploited their old resentments of the liberal left that dominated Israel in its early decades. I said the election was about Netanyahu. In fact, because of the prime minister’s attacks on democratic institutions and his legal troubles, it’s about more than one man’s fate. The vote is about the nature of Israeli democracy, perhaps its very existence. Gantz, in an interview this month with The Times of Israel, hammered on this point, saying “the trend is very, very, very dangerous” and that democracy “is at stake.” Netanyahu, applying a by-now-familiar illiberal playbook, one whose elements he helped forge and that has seen such success from Budapest to Washington, has attacked a free press. He has set out to undermine an independent judiciary and embraced a form of nationalism that, like Trump’s, sees enemies and traitors everywhere. The country’s basic law that was passed last year declared Israel the nation-state of the Jewish people alone, despite the fact that Arab citizens make up a fifth of the population. When Netanyahu says, as he did this year, that Israel is “the nation-state, not of all its citizens, but only of the Jewish people,” he eviscerates the core idea of democratic citizenship. No longer is everyone equal before the law. What then are the others, second-class shadows? From there, it is but a short step to making that monarchical sobriquet perfectly fitting. Netanyahu is not only facing bribery charges. He has also admitted that, in an extraordinary arrogation of powers, he authorized the sale of advanced German-made submarines to Egypt, without telling the National Security Council, without telling the head of Mossad or the defense minister, without telling the military chief of staff. He says he did tell the attorney general. The attorney general denies this. The reason? “State secrets,” says Netanyahu. Oh, please. The prime minister has also acknowledged that he made some $3 million on investments in a company that supplied the German shipyard that built the Egyptian submarines and warships for Israel. Still, he insists he did not “make a shekel” on the submarines and that the stock was sold before the deals were made. “The whole thing stinks,” Itamar Rabinovich, a former Israeli ambassador to Washington, told me. Gantz’s view, as expressed in The Times of Israel, was, “If it walks like a duck, if it quacks like a duck, maybe it’s a duck.” He added, “We are speaking about a corrupt man who is destroying the country.” The danger is evident: a conflation of Netanyahu’s legal and political battles that subverts the rule of law to save him. Already, his justice minister, Ayelet Shaked of the New Right party, has been lambasting the Supreme Court’s powers, portraying it as the liberal elite’s means to dilute the will of the people and accusing it of a “coup” against democracy. Everyone here is talking about a “French law.” This is what Israelis call the legislation that Netanyahu would try to pass, if he wins, that would grant the prime minister immunity from prosecution while in office. Get that done, eliminate the Supreme Court’s power to rule such a move unconstitutional, maybe engineer an eventual passage from the prime minister’s to the president’s office, and he’s home free. He really is king at last. Of course, the rightist parties Netanyahu would try to woo into doing this would exact a price, like that promised annexation of part of the West Bank, the death knell for a two-state peace. Trump’s recognition of Israel’s authority over the Golan Heights has encouraged the annexationists (and lawlessness in general). Next up, Area C, the 60 percent of the West Bank under exclusive Israeli control! It may not happen, but the drift under Netanyahu toward one state in all but name between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River, with millions of disenfranchised Palestinians, is relentless. “The status quo is an illusion,” Meridor told me. “It moves. You end up in one state that contains people who don’t vote, that is not Jewish in terms of numbers, and that is not democratic.” In this sense, too, another Netanyahu victory would undermine Israeli democracy. Between Israel and that fate stands Gantz. He’s no dove on Palestine, but I believe he would at least attempt to engage in serious negotiation with the Palestinians (who do, after all, exist), so closing Netanyahu’s decade-long kick-the-can chapter. He’s a political neophyte, but that Rabin air feels significant and he has identified something important: The word “moral” has to mean something for a country that gathered Jews bound during the millennial diaspora by a covenant of ethics and that rose from the ashes of the Nazi crematories. In “unity,” an oft-repeated word, Gantz has identified another important idea eroded for too long by the master of division who has increasingly split Israel into rival tribes. When you ask Israelis about their election, they often draw an analogy with soccer. “You play for 90 minutes,” they say with a half-amused, half-bitter shrug, “and then Germany wins!” Except, of course, that Germany has been losing a lot of late. Perhaps that’s a sign. It’s time. Gantz can take it from here. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2019,Opinion | Will the Supreme Court Protect Gay and Transgender Workers?,"The justices have agreed to decide if federal employment law covers discrimination against L.G.B.T. members of the work force. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it illegal for employers to discriminate on the basis of a person’s sex. On Monday, the Supreme Court agreed to address whether gay and transgender workers are covered by the landmark provision, in a trio of cases — two concluding that federal law protects such employees, and one resolving that it doesn’t. The cases open the door for the justices to settle the issue for the whole nation. The cases are expected to be decided by the summer of 2020 — that is, in the heat of the presidential campaign, when voters will be judging candidates in part on where they stand on gay and transgender rights. That will make this a political issue, to be sure, but there is significantly more at stake for individual workers. The Justice Department sowed confusion in 2017 when it went against the stated position of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the federal agency that oversees enforcement of Title VII, and argued before an appeals court that Congress never intended to extend protections to gay workers. That much may be true; the law as written makes no mention of sexual orientation or transgender status. Which could also explain a separate brief filed in October, in which the department told the Supreme Court that Title VII, as lawmakers wrote it, “does not apply to discrimination against an individual based on his or her gender identity.” With the passage of time, however, a number of courts, including the Supreme Court, have interpreted the prohibition against sex discrimination generously. Over the past 55 years, thanks to that forward-looking reading of the law, Title VII has addressed harms that Congress never foresaw, such as forbidding sexual harassment and gender stereotyping. Relying on some of those precedents — and the guidance of the E.E.O.C., which in recent years has extended the reach of Title VII to lesbian, gay and transgender employees — modern-day courts have also begun to reconsider their prior decisions on such rights in the workplace, expanding the reach of the law. As Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in a unanimous 1998 ruling in favor of a male worker who was subject to same-sex harassment, “statutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.” So Congress may not have the last word on this matter. What’s more, absent direct action from lawmakers, the Supreme Court would be wise to keep the current progress of the law in place — and not undermine its own prior cases that helped make the American workplace more welcoming and inclusive to all.

2019,Will ‘Game of Thrones’ Ever Really Be Over? Unlikely,"The phenomenally popular (and lucrative) HBO show could go the way of “Star Wars,” Harry Potter and Disney’s Marvelverse. CreditCreditPhoto illustration by Jeff Harris for The New York Times; Styling by Ed Gabriels When “Game of Thrones” finally wraps up on May 19, at least one of the story’s central figures would like the end to be the actual end. “Why [expletive] with it?” Emilia Clarke, the Dragon Queen herself, said recently. “It’s a phenomenon that no one ever saw coming, so I completely understand why anyone would be like, let’s make 1,500 more since that’s a recipe that works,” she added. “I just don’t think they should.” Pop culture trends and market pressures might ultimately work against her, however, and a prequel pilot is already in the works. So as HBO’s biggest ever hit prepares to begin its final season on April 14, a definitional question hangs over its future: Is “Game of Thrones” a series? Or is it a universe? Based on viewing, industry impact and global attention, “Thrones” is one of the biggest blockbusters in TV history. But as giant corporations buy one another and plan bottomless new streaming platforms in an ever more feverish battle for your eyeballs and entertainment dollars, blockbusters are not enough anymore. So while there are only six episodes remaining in the sprawling saga of Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, Tyrion and friends, we’ve likely only begun exploring Westeros. Consider “Star Wars.” Since Disney bought Lucasfilm in 2012 for $4 billion, it has strip-mined the franchise, conceiving multiple movie trilogies, stand-alone films and TV series, as well as an enormous presence in Disney’s theme parks. (Next up for the “Thrones” creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss: A series of “Star Wars” films.) Or Harry Potter (like “Game of Thrones,” part of the WarnerMedia empire), which after the eight films based on the books is now deep into the “Fantastic Beasts” prequel series, and also has tourist attractions all over the world. Or the mightiest pop culture universe of all: Disney’s Marvel, which later this month will close out the “Avengers” filament of the Marvelverse, with “Avengers: Endgame,” but in June extend the X-Men branch with “Dark Phoenix,” starring Sansa Stark herself, Sophie Turner. So wouldn’t the phenomenally popular (and lucrative) “Game of Thrones” be a prime candidate for a similar treatment? The case in favor includes nearly every detail surrounding the show. In February, AT&T received final clearance for its $85.4 billion merger with HBO’s corporate parent Time Warner, and will launch a WarnerMedia streaming platform to compete with coming services from Disney — which also just closed a $71.3 billion deal to buy 21st Century Fox — and Apple, along with the existing stalwarts Netflix, Amazon and Hulu. The streaming service will draw from Warner’s vast collection of films and shows from properties like Warner Bros. and Turner as well as HBO. HBO Now, the network’s current streaming app, is expected to stick around but HBO’s original series and other offerings will be incorporated into the WarnerMedia service, meaning “Game of Thrones” could appear alongside the likes of Harry Potter movies, “Wonder Woman” and “Friends.” John Stankey, the AT&T executive put in charge of WarnerMedia, has said HBO will get a bigger programming budget in order to ramp up production. “We want to increase our investment in premium content,” he said last summer on an earnings call. How much, if any, of that content will be “Thrones”-related is an open question. (AT&T declined to comment.) But the telecom presumably didn’t buy Time Warner just to let one of its most valuable pieces of intellectual property go dark. “Thrones” is also already based on a universe, the Song of Ice and Fire series created by George R.R. Martin, that is so dense with history and lore, it could fuel dozens of series and movies. “The universe is too rich not to try,” said Casey Bloys, HBO’s president of programming. “But on the other hand, I also don’t want to do it just to do it.” The prequel pilot, created by Martin and Jane Goldman, will go into production this summer. Set thousands of years before the events of “Game of Thrones,” it will explore the history of the White Walkers and the Stark family, and star Naomi Watts and Miranda Richardson, among others. It was one of multiple prequel concepts commissioned by HBO, which hasn’t ruled out moving forward with any of the others at some point. And starting next year, “Thrones” fans — like “Star Wars,” Potter and Marvel devotees — will be able to get their fix in the flesh. The Game of Thrones Studio Tour, a 110,000-square-foot tourist attraction, is slated to open in spring 2020 in Northern Ireland, where most of the show was produced. The project, inspired by Warner Bros.’s Harry Potter studio tour outside London, will transform the Linen Mill Studios in Banbridge, where parts of “Thrones” were shot, into an interactive exhibition of the show’s sets, costumes, props and weapons. “It’s going to be an immersive experience where fans will feel like they are inside their favorite sets from the show,” said Jeff Peters, HBO’s vice president for licensing and retail. Linen Mill Studios will be the first of as many as four former “Thrones” filming locations in Northern Ireland to be transformed into interactive fan experiences — other possibilities include the still-standing sets for King’s Landing, in Belfast, and Castle Black and the Wall, in a quarry outside the city. While there are not currently plans to create similar attractions in the United States, “it’s possible,” Peters said. “We get pitched all the time, and we’re open to a lot of different opportunities.” It’s worth noting that there are some potential obstacles to “Game of Thrones” becoming the next “Star Wars.” One is the firmly TV-MA tenor of the series — the risqué material precludes youngsters from fueling the franchise as actively as they do for others. (HBO argues that this will keep “Thrones” relevant even if it doesn’t add more series, as new generations discover the saga.) Another is HBO itself. The network became the crown jewel of television through its taste and commitment to quality (the occasional “Arli$$” notwithstanding). It’s known for walking away from numerous pilots that didn’t meet its standard, and will only turn the prequel into an actual series if it lives up to “Thrones,” Bloys said. “I want to honor the high bar that Dan and David set with the original show,” he said. As a result, it’s way too early to even start thinking of “Thrones” as a franchise, he added. “To me, franchise denotes multiple films or multiple TV shows living at the same time,” he said. “Not having even turned a camera on the prequel just yet, it’s premature to say at this point, to declare we’re going to have multiple series living at once.” AT&T, however, has shown no signs of being a hands-off or particularly patient owner. The former HBO chief executive Richard Plepler, as responsible as anyone for the network’s taste-making reputation, abruptly left the company two days after the Warner purchase received final clearance. There are already signs that AT&T plans to treat “Thrones” as one more synergistic cog in its corporate machine. Kristian Nairn, who played the fan favorite Hodor, was tapped to appear this week at an AT&T store in Boston, where customers could also enter a sweepstakes for a seat on a “Dragon Wagon” to the season premiere in New York. One faction that is not much interested in any new versions of “Game of Thrones”: the stars of “Game of Thrones.” None of the current “Thrones” actors are involved with the pilot or have had any role in its development. The prequel “came as a shock to all of us,” Clarke said. The general sentiment from Clarke and others about any future “Thrones” series amounts to basically, I wish them the best, I had the time of my life, but I’m out. (One exception: the ever cagey Varys. “Never say never,” said Conleth Hill, who plays him.) This isn’t terribly surprising, given the length and physical demands of “Game of Thrones” — and who knows which characters will survive the final season? But the ongoing loosening of TV formats would seem to open up plenty of opportunities, even for characters that get killed off. What “Thrones” fan wouldn’t want a mini-series or HBO movie depicting prehistory like, say, Robert’s Rebellion and the events that turned Jaime Lannister into the Kingslayer? Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who plays Jaime, hopes the prequel is “even more successful than ‘Game of Thrones,’” he said. But he’s not interested in ever returning to Westeros. “You could only set yourself up for disappointment,” he said. “It’s been an amazing 10 years, but 10 years is a fair amount of time.” Don’t count on a Sansa mini-series either. “I never want to be in a corset ever again,” Turner said. That said, there could be other opportunities for “Thrones” veterans if the show expands into the next great franchise. Its stars might be at the pinnacle of the pop culture universe now, as the final season draws near, but some have been around long enough to know how quickly such things can change. “The cast members that now are so confident about the future,” Coster-Waldau said. “Five years from now we will all be guides at the Game of Thrones Land.” Sopan Deb and John Koblin contributed reporting.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | William Barr Knows a Thing Or Two About Government ‘Spying’,"The attorney general said he is concerned about potentially unlawful surveillance of the Trump campaign. In 1992, he oversaw a program that may have done exactly that to other Americans. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. The attorney general of the United States has concerns about illegal government spying. At a Senate hearing on Wednesday, William Barr confirmed that he will look into whether the Trump campaign was subject to unlawful surveillance in the run-up to the 2016 election. The Justice Department’s inspector general, Michael Horowitz, is already investigating the matter, and Mr. Barr says the review is nearly done. But instead of letting his watchdog finish his work, Mr. Barr would rather look into the matter himself. “Yes, I think spying did occur,” Mr. Barr said early in the hearing, later amending the record to clarify that he was “not saying that improper surveillance occurred.” “I am saying that I am concerned about it and looking into it. That is all,” he added. Before day’s end, Fox News was amplifying the attorney general’s worries, which the president then shared on Twitter. Whatever comes of Mr. Barr’s review and the conspiracy theories that ensue, he would be wise to reflect on his own history with government surveillance that stretched the limits of the law. Just last month, Mr. Horowitz’s office concluded that the Justice Department and the Drug Enforcement Administration “failed to conduct a comprehensive legal analysis” when the two agencies undertook a secret surveillance program in the 1990s that swept up records of Americans’ phone calls — the kind of bulk collection that the National Security Agency later engaged in after 9/11. The D.E.A. program dates back to 1992, when Mr. Barr first led the Justice Department under President George H.W. Bush. Relying on so-called administrative subpoenas, the D.E.A. would go on fishing expeditions, vacuuming up metadata from billions of phone calls to more than 100 countries, according to a 2015 USA Today investigation. The inspector general’s office found it “troubling” that the government’s collection entailed a “uniquely expansive” reading of the law; under the program, officials would issue subpoenas for records without first determining that they were “relevant or material” to a specific investigation, as the law requires. The inspector general also suggested that the D.E.A. abused its authority because the records were then shared with other federal agencies that had nothing to do with drug enforcement. One thing the inspector general report makes clear: Mr. Barr was in charge as this program came into being and “provided approval” for its deployment without appropriate legal review. In the future, if Mr. Barr wants to move forward with a similar bulk-collection program, “the Department should conduct a rigorous, objective legal analysis, memorialized in writing, in advance of initiating such a program,” the report said. Words to ponder as the attorney general, now in his second tour leading the Justice Department, expresses concern over the reach of government surveillance.

2019,William Barr Says Mueller Report Will Be Public ‘Within a Week’,"• Attorney General William P. Barr said he will deliver the Mueller report to Congress and the public within a week, reiterating his earlier promise to release it by mid-April. • Testifying before the House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday, Mr. Barr said he would be transparent about redactions in the report. But he demurred when asked whether he has briefed the White House on it. • The Justice Department inspector general expects to finish an examination of aspects of the Russia investigation by May or June, Mr. Barr revealed. • Mr. Barr has tried to keep the appropriations hearing focused on the department’s proposed $29.2 billion budget, which includes money for 100 new immigration judges as President Trump hardens his stance on immigration along the southwestern border. Mr. Barr, hit immediately with questions about his handling of the Mueller report by Democrats, reiterated his vow to be as transparent as possible and said that he will turn over a redacted version of the report to Congress and the public within a week. Mr. Barr went over the categories of information he says he must black out — like information that is subject to grand-jury secrecy rules — and said that whatever he censors in the report, he will identify the reason. “This process is going along very well and my original timetable of being able to release this by mid-April stands,” he said. “And so I think that from my standpoint, within a week I will be in a position to release the report to the public.” Representative José E. Serrano, Democrat of New York and the head of the appropriations subcommittee that covers the Justice Department, pressed Mr. Barr to say whether the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, or his staff had played any role in drafting or reviewing two letters that Mr. Barr sent to Congress late last month about the report. Mr. Barr said that the special counsel had not participated in writing those letters, nor seen them in advance, though he gave Mr. Mueller the chance to see his letter summarizing the investigation’s main findings. “The letter of the 24th, Mr. Mueller’s team did not play a role in drafting that document, although we offered him the opportunity to review it before we sent it out and he declined that,” Mr. Barr said. “The letter on the 29th, I don’t believe that that was reviewed by Mr. Mueller or that they participated in drafting that letter.” Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York and chairwoman of the full Appropriations Committee, pressed Mr. Barr to say whether the White House has seen or been briefed on the contents of the Mueller report beyond what was in his letters about it to Congress. But Mr. Barr refused to answer. “I’ve said what I’m going to say about the report today,” he said. “I’ve issued three letters about it. I was willing to discuss the historic information of how the report came to me and my decision on Sunday,” March 24, when he wrote a four-page letter to Congress laying out the special counsel’s top-line findings. “But I’ve already laid out the process that is going forward to release these reports hopefully within a week,” he added. “I’m not going to say anything more about it until the report is out and everyone has a chance to look at it.” In the past, Justice Department officials have said that Mr. Barr had not shown the White House any part of the Mueller report or briefed Mr. Trump’s team about its contents. His demurral on Tuesday raised the possibility that the situation has shifted and the White House knows more than the public or Congress about what Mr. Mueller said. Democrats who lead the House Appropriations Committee were eager to press Mr. Barr on what one called “the elephant in the room”: his handling of the highly anticipated special counsel’s report. “The American people have been left with many unanswered questions; serious concerns about the process by which you formulated your letter; and uncertainty about when we can expect to see the full report,” Mr. Serrano said in his opening remarks. “I think it would strike a serious blow to our system and yes to our democracy if that report is not fully seen,” he added. Democrats have criticized Mr. Barr’s decision to share Mr. Mueller’s top-line findings in a four-page letter that quoted sparingly from the report itself and his declaration that Mr. Trump had not committed an obstruction-of-justice offense after Mr. Mueller declined to make a prosecutorial judgment. They renewed their complaints after The New York Times revealed last week that some of Mr. Mueller’s investigators have complained that Mr. Barr failed to fully represent their findings and that they were more damaging for the president than the attorney general indicated. On Tuesday, they had their first chance to level criticism in person. Ms. Lowey called Mr. Barr’s handling of the Mueller report “unacceptable” and questioned how quickly he summarized the findings in his March 24 letter. “Even for someone who has done this job before,” she said, referring to Mr. Barr’s first stint as attorney general in the 1990s, “I would argue it is more suspicious than impressive.” Batting back Democrats’ criticism, Mr. Barr insisted that he had accurately delivered the “bottom-line” conclusions of the special counsel’s investigation in his letter to Congress and warned that attempting to quickly summarize the report more fully would have exposed him to a minefield of potential criticism. Asked about The Times’s reporting on frustrations among some of Mr. Mueller’s investigators about the narrow scope of his letter laying out their findings, Mr. Barr appeared unswayed. “I was not interested in putting out summaries or trying to summarize,” Mr. Barr said, “because I think any summary, regardless of who prepares it, not only runs the risk of being under-inclusive or over-inclusive, but also would trigger a lot of discussion and analysis that really should await everything coming out at once.” Each page of the report was marked that it might contain secret grand jury material and could not be readily released anyway, he said. He also said he had asked the intelligence community to review the report for any information that might compromise their sources and methods of intelligence-gathering and would thus need to be redacted. But he did not address his decision to step in and make a judgment on whether Mr. Trump illegally obstructed justice after Mr. Mueller’s team conspicuously did not. Republicans tried to help Mr. Barr hammer home the report’s top-line findings. “The conclusions were simple: no collusion, no obstruction,” said Representative Tom Graves, Republican of Georgia, ignoring Mr. Mueller’s statement that the investigation did not “exonerate” Mr. Trump of obstruction and that it found no criminal conspiracy between any Trump associates and Russia’s election interference. Mr. Graves added, “Is there anything new you have seen that would change your conclusions?” Mr. Barr responded, “There is nothing to suggest to me” that the conclusions have changed. “The letter speaks for itself.” [Congress waits as Barr blacks out parts of the Mueller report.] One of the key reasons Mr. Barr has said he must black out portions of the Mueller report before showing it to Congress is a federal rule of criminal procedure that forbids Justice Department officials from disclosing grand-jury information to outsiders. On its face, that rule — known as 6(e) — makes no exception for Congress. There are exceptions to the rule, however, particularly if a judge issues an order permitting the material to be disclosed. That happened in 1974, when a judge overseeing the Watergate grand jury permitted the evidence it gathered to be sent to the House Judiciary Committee, which had opened an impeachment inquiry into President Nixon. But the executive branch in 1974 supported sending the evidence to Congress. Mr. Barr was asked whether his Justice Department would be willing to join a similar motion to allow Congress to see the grand-jury material that Mr. Mueller gathered. But Mr. Barr said he has no such intention. He said if House Judiciary Committee members want to see that material, they can ask the judge. “The chairman of the Judiciary Committee is free to go to court if he feels one of those exceptions is applicable,” Mr. Barr said, adding: “My intention is not to ask for it at this stage. I mean, if the chairman has a good explanation of why 6(e) does not apply and his need for the information, I’m willing to listen.” Under pressure to give Congress the entire text of the Mueller report, Mr. Barr repeatedly reminded his critics that he is operating under rules written by Clinton administration officials to prevent a repetition of the Whitewater-Monica Lewinsky scandal, where Ken Starr gave lawmakers a long report that contained detailed narrative description of the evidence, including lurid sexual details and extensive legal analysis of potential crimes by the president. Mr. Barr’s point seemed to be: If you have a problem with this process, blame the Clinton Democrats. “This whole mechanism for the special counsel, as I said, was established during the Clinton administration in the wake of Ken Starr’s report,” Mr. Barr said. “That’s why the current rule says the report should be kept confidential, because there was a lot of reaction against the publication of Ken Starr’s report and many of the people who are right now calling for release of this report were basically castigating Ken Starr and others for releasing the Starr report.” Mr. Starr, the independent counsel leading the Clinton investigation, was operating under a now-defunct law that gave him the authority to send a report directly to Congress. The Republican-controlled Congress promptly made the whole thing public. That experience helped persuade members of Congress of both parties that the independent counsel law should be permitted to lapse in 1999. But there was still a need for some kind of mechanism for prosecutors with a degree of independence to investigate potential high-level executive-branch wrongdoing. Under then-Attorney General Janet Reno, the Clinton administration issued the special counsel regulation that governed Mr. Mueller’s investigation. Among other things, it called for the special counsel to write a “confidential” report for the attorney general, who would then relay his own report to Congress saying the investigation was over. In short, those rules did not envision a lengthy report from Mr. Mueller going to Congress and being published for the public to read — in any form. “You will recognize that I’m operating under a regulation that was put together during the Clinton administration and does not provide for the publication of the report,” Mr. Barr said. “But I am relying on my own discretion to make as much public as I can.” Representative Matt Cartwright, Democrat of Pennsylvania, assailed Mr. Barr and the Justice Department for declining to defend the Affordable Care Act in federal court in Texas, where a judge recently struck down the sweeping health care law as unconstitutional. Mr. Cartwright accused Mr. Barr of putting the weight of the Justice Department behind a political effort to invalidate the law and warned that it could result in millions of people losing their health care coverage. Mr. Barr did not dispute that he had decided to no longer defend the law but told Mr. Cartwright that he had “nothing to worry about” if he thought that the department had taken “such an outrageous position” because the government was likely to lose the case in question. “Let the courts do their job,” Mr. Barr said. Republicans have challenged the law in various court cases since it was passed nine years ago. Late last year, a federal judge in Texas struck down the law on the grounds that its requirement that Americans buy health insurance was unconstitutional. The Justice Department had said last summer that it would no longer defend that mandate, and broadened its attack on the law last month, telling a federal appeals court that it believed the entire law should be invalidated. If the court accepts that argument, millions of people could lose health insurance. Mr. Barr declined to speculate about the impact of the Justice Department’s decision not to defend the law, though he acknowledged that it could end with no plan in place for those who depend on the law to maintain coverage. The exchange underscored Mr. Barr’s sweeping view of executive power and that the attorney general ultimately answers to the president. Though the Justice Department generally defends the law in any challenges to it, Mr. Barr indicated he was willing to make an exception in a case where the president asked for something different so long as it was legally defensible. Mr. Barr is requesting an additional $72.1 million for immigration enforcement — an amount that would fund 100 new immigration judges — at a time when Mr. Trump has hardened his stance against illegal immigration and asylum seekers. Over the past two days, he has purged top immigration and security leaders to accelerate that goal. While the additional judges will “provide some relief from a critical backlog in the immigration courts,” Mr. Barr said, he also said that an influx of cases “constrains our ability to manage the backlog of cases, and other reforms are necessary.” The Justice Department oversees the nation’s immigration judges, who are separate from the judicial branch. Mr. Barr also said that “attacking those transnational criminal organizations is a high priority” for the department and noted that the Justice Department is asking for more than $140 million in budget increases at the F.B.I., the Drug Enforcement Administration and elsewhere to address drug crimes. The Justice Department inspector general intends to complete by May or June his investigation into aspects of the Russia inquiry, including whether law enforcement officials abused their surveillance powers to spy on a Trump campaign aide, Mr. Barr said. The inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, has been examining how the F.B.I. and Justice Department obtained a secret warrant in October 2016 to wiretap Carter Page, a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser. Republicans have accused law enforcement officials of improperly obtaining the warrant because they relied in part on Democratic-funded opposition research compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer who was also an F.B.I. informant, in seeking permission from the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to surveil Mr. Page. As part of his investigation, Mr. Horowitz is also scrutinizing the F.B.I.’s relationship with Mr. Steele.

2019,William Barr Says Mueller Report Will Be Public ‘Within a Week’,"• Attorney General William P. Barr said he will deliver the Mueller report to Congress and the public within a week, reiterating his earlier promise to release it by mid-April. • Testifying before the House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday, Mr. Barr said he would be transparent about redactions in the report. But he demurred when asked whether he has briefed the White House on it. • The Justice Department inspector general expects to finish an examination of aspects of the Russia investigation by May or June, Mr. Barr revealed. • Mr. Barr has tried to keep the appropriations hearing focused on the department’s proposed $29.2 billion budget, which includes money for 100 new immigration judges as President Trump hardens his stance on immigration along the southwestern border. Mr. Barr, hit immediately with questions about his handling of the Mueller report by Democrats, reiterated his vow to be as transparent as possible and said that he will turn over a redacted version of the report to Congress and the public within a week. Mr. Barr went over the categories of information he says he must black out — like information that is subject to grand-jury secrecy rules — and said that whatever he censors in the report, he will identify the reason. “This process is going along very well and my original timetable of being able to release this by mid-April stands,” he said. “And so I think that from my standpoint, within a week I will be in a position to release the report to the public.” Representative José E. Serrano, Democrat of New York and the head of the appropriations subcommittee that covers the Justice Department, pressed Mr. Barr to say whether the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, or his staff had played any role in drafting or reviewing two letters that Mr. Barr sent to Congress late last month about the report. Mr. Barr said that the special counsel had not participated in writing those letters, nor seen them in advance, though he gave Mr. Mueller the chance to see his letter summarizing the investigation’s main findings. “The letter of the 24th, Mr. Mueller’s team did not play a role in drafting that document, although we offered him the opportunity to review it before we sent it out and he declined that,” Mr. Barr said. “The letter on the 29th, I don’t believe that that was reviewed by Mr. Mueller or that they participated in drafting that letter.” Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York and chairwoman of the full Appropriations Committee, pressed Mr. Barr to say whether the White House has seen or been briefed on the contents of the Mueller report beyond what was in his letters about it to Congress. But Mr. Barr refused to answer. “I’ve said what I’m going to say about the report today,” he said. “I’ve issued three letters about it. I was willing to discuss the historic information of how the report came to me and my decision on Sunday,” March 24, when he wrote a four-page letter to Congress laying out the special counsel’s top-line findings. “But I’ve already laid out the process that is going forward to release these reports hopefully within a week,” he added. “I’m not going to say anything more about it until the report is out and everyone has a chance to look at it.” In the past, Justice Department officials have said that Mr. Barr had not shown the White House any part of the Mueller report or briefed Mr. Trump’s team about its contents. His demurral on Tuesday raised the possibility that the situation has shifted and the White House knows more than the public or Congress about what Mr. Mueller said. Democrats who lead the House Appropriations Committee were eager to press Mr. Barr on what one called “the elephant in the room”: his handling of the highly anticipated special counsel’s report. “The American people have been left with many unanswered questions; serious concerns about the process by which you formulated your letter; and uncertainty about when we can expect to see the full report,” Mr. Serrano said in his opening remarks. “I think it would strike a serious blow to our system and yes to our democracy if that report is not fully seen,” he added. Democrats have criticized Mr. Barr’s decision to share Mr. Mueller’s top-line findings in a four-page letter that quoted sparingly from the report itself and his declaration that Mr. Trump had not committed an obstruction-of-justice offense after Mr. Mueller declined to make a prosecutorial judgment. They renewed their complaints after The New York Times revealed last week that some of Mr. Mueller’s investigators have complained that Mr. Barr failed to fully represent their findings and that they were more damaging for the president than the attorney general indicated. On Tuesday, they had their first chance to level criticism in person. Ms. Lowey called Mr. Barr’s handling of the Mueller report “unacceptable” and questioned how quickly he summarized the findings in his March 24 letter. “Even for someone who has done this job before,” she said, referring to Mr. Barr’s first stint as attorney general in the 1990s, “I would argue it is more suspicious than impressive.” Batting back Democrats’ criticism, Mr. Barr insisted that he had accurately delivered the “bottom-line” conclusions of the special counsel’s investigation in his letter to Congress and warned that attempting to quickly summarize the report more fully would have exposed him to a minefield of potential criticism. Asked about The Times’s reporting on frustrations among some of Mr. Mueller’s investigators about the narrow scope of his letter laying out their findings, Mr. Barr appeared unswayed. “I was not interested in putting out summaries or trying to summarize,” Mr. Barr said, “because I think any summary, regardless of who prepares it, not only runs the risk of being under-inclusive or over-inclusive, but also would trigger a lot of discussion and analysis that really should await everything coming out at once.” Each page of the report was marked that it might contain secret grand jury material and could not be readily released anyway, he said. He also said he had asked the intelligence community to review the report for any information that might compromise their sources and methods of intelligence-gathering and would thus need to be redacted. But he did not address his decision to step in and make a judgment on whether Mr. Trump illegally obstructed justice after Mr. Mueller’s team conspicuously did not. Republicans tried to help Mr. Barr hammer home the report’s top-line findings. “The conclusions were simple: no collusion, no obstruction,” said Representative Tom Graves, Republican of Georgia, ignoring Mr. Mueller’s statement that the investigation did not “exonerate” Mr. Trump of obstruction and that it found no criminal conspiracy between any Trump associates and Russia’s election interference. Mr. Graves added, “Is there anything new you have seen that would change your conclusions?” Mr. Barr responded, “There is nothing to suggest to me” that the conclusions have changed. “The letter speaks for itself.” [Congress waits as Barr blacks out parts of the Mueller report.] One of the key reasons Mr. Barr has said he must black out portions of the Mueller report before showing it to Congress is a federal rule of criminal procedure that forbids Justice Department officials from disclosing grand-jury information to outsiders. On its face, that rule — known as 6(e) — makes no exception for Congress. There are exceptions to the rule, however, particularly if a judge issues an order permitting the material to be disclosed. That happened in 1974, when a judge overseeing the Watergate grand jury permitted the evidence it gathered to be sent to the House Judiciary Committee, which had opened an impeachment inquiry into President Nixon. But the executive branch in 1974 supported sending the evidence to Congress. Mr. Barr was asked whether his Justice Department would be willing to join a similar motion to allow Congress to see the grand-jury material that Mr. Mueller gathered. But Mr. Barr said he has no such intention. He said if House Judiciary Committee members want to see that material, they can ask the judge. “The chairman of the Judiciary Committee is free to go to court if he feels one of those exceptions is applicable,” Mr. Barr said, adding: “My intention is not to ask for it at this stage. I mean, if the chairman has a good explanation of why 6(e) does not apply and his need for the information, I’m willing to listen.” Under pressure to give Congress the entire text of the Mueller report, Mr. Barr repeatedly reminded his critics that he is operating under rules written by Clinton administration officials to prevent a repetition of the Whitewater-Monica Lewinsky scandal, where Ken Starr gave lawmakers a long report that contained detailed narrative description of the evidence, including lurid sexual details and extensive legal analysis of potential crimes by the president. Mr. Barr’s point seemed to be: If you have a problem with this process, blame the Clinton Democrats. “This whole mechanism for the special counsel, as I said, was established during the Clinton administration in the wake of Ken Starr’s report,” Mr. Barr said. “That’s why the current rule says the report should be kept confidential, because there was a lot of reaction against the publication of Ken Starr’s report and many of the people who are right now calling for release of this report were basically castigating Ken Starr and others for releasing the Starr report.” Mr. Starr, the independent counsel leading the Clinton investigation, was operating under a now-defunct law that gave him the authority to send a report directly to Congress. The Republican-controlled Congress promptly made the whole thing public. That experience helped persuade members of Congress of both parties that the independent counsel law should be permitted to lapse in 1999. But there was still a need for some kind of mechanism for prosecutors with a degree of independence to investigate potential high-level executive-branch wrongdoing. Under then-Attorney General Janet Reno, the Clinton administration issued the special counsel regulation that governed Mr. Mueller’s investigation. Among other things, it called for the special counsel to write a “confidential” report for the attorney general, who would then relay his own report to Congress saying the investigation was over. In short, those rules did not envision a lengthy report from Mr. Mueller going to Congress and being published for the public to read — in any form. “You will recognize that I’m operating under a regulation that was put together during the Clinton administration and does not provide for the publication of the report,” Mr. Barr said. “But I am relying on my own discretion to make as much public as I can.” Representative Matt Cartwright, Democrat of Pennsylvania, assailed Mr. Barr and the Justice Department for declining to defend the Affordable Care Act in federal court in Texas, where a judge recently struck down the sweeping health care law as unconstitutional. Mr. Cartwright accused Mr. Barr of putting the weight of the Justice Department behind a political effort to invalidate the law and warned that it could result in millions of people losing their health care coverage. Mr. Barr did not dispute that he had decided to no longer defend the law but told Mr. Cartwright that he had “nothing to worry about” if he thought that the department had taken “such an outrageous position” because the government was likely to lose the case in question. “Let the courts do their job,” Mr. Barr said. Republicans have challenged the law in various court cases since it was passed nine years ago. Late last year, a federal judge in Texas struck down the law on the grounds that its requirement that Americans buy health insurance was unconstitutional. The Justice Department had said last summer that it would no longer defend that mandate, and broadened its attack on the law last month, telling a federal appeals court that it believed the entire law should be invalidated. If the court accepts that argument, millions of people could lose health insurance. Mr. Barr declined to speculate about the impact of the Justice Department’s decision not to defend the law, though he acknowledged that it could end with no plan in place for those who depend on the law to maintain coverage. The exchange underscored Mr. Barr’s sweeping view of executive power and that the attorney general ultimately answers to the president. Though the Justice Department generally defends the law in any challenges to it, Mr. Barr indicated he was willing to make an exception in a case where the president asked for something different so long as it was legally defensible. Mr. Barr is requesting an additional $72.1 million for immigration enforcement — an amount that would fund 100 new immigration judges — at a time when Mr. Trump has hardened his stance against illegal immigration and asylum seekers. Over the past two days, he has purged top immigration and security leaders to accelerate that goal. While the additional judges will “provide some relief from a critical backlog in the immigration courts,” Mr. Barr said, he also said that an influx of cases “constrains our ability to manage the backlog of cases, and other reforms are necessary.” The Justice Department oversees the nation’s immigration judges, who are separate from the judicial branch. Mr. Barr also said that “attacking those transnational criminal organizations is a high priority” for the department and noted that the Justice Department is asking for more than $140 million in budget increases at the F.B.I., the Drug Enforcement Administration and elsewhere to address drug crimes. The Justice Department inspector general intends to complete by May or June his investigation into aspects of the Russia inquiry, including whether law enforcement officials abused their surveillance powers to spy on a Trump campaign aide, Mr. Barr said. The inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, has been examining how the F.B.I. and Justice Department obtained a secret warrant in October 2016 to wiretap Carter Page, a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser. Republicans have accused law enforcement officials of improperly obtaining the warrant because they relied in part on Democratic-funded opposition research compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer who was also an F.B.I. informant, in seeking permission from the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to surveil Mr. Page. As part of his investigation, Mr. Horowitz is also scrutinizing the F.B.I.’s relationship with Mr. Steele. Mr. Barr also said he was studying the F.B.I.’s decision to begin investigating ties between Russia and Mr. Trump’s campaign during the 2016 election, Mr. Barr said. He said he was trying to get his “arms around all the aspects of the counterintelligence investigation.” An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a congresswoman on the House Appropriations Committee.

2019,"William Barr, North Korea, Pinterest: Your Thursday Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning, We’re covering the release of Robert Mueller’s report, North Korea’s claim that it has tested a new weapon, and the growing number of abortion bans in the U.S. The Justice Department released a redacted version of the report by the special counsel, Robert Mueller. It has been posted on the department’s website, but load times are very slow, presumably due to high traffic. Here are our live updates on the findings, with excerpts and analysis, and our live coverage of the events of the day. We’re also planning to send a special edition of the Morning Briefing email later today. Attorney General William Barr held a news conference before the report’s release, vigorously defending President Trump’s conduct and clearing him of obstruction and him, his campaign and associates of any knowing collusion. Here is a transcript of his remarks. We’ll have video shortly. Response: Mr. Trump’s Twitter account displayed a “Game of Thrones”-themed post that declared in uppercase: “No Collusion. No Obstruction. For the haters and the Radical Left Democrats — Game Over.” Another angle: Justice Department officials have repeatedly discussed the report’s conclusions with White House lawyers, our reporters were told, aiding the president’s legal team as it prepares a rebuttal. In what appeared to be a warning from Kim Jong-un to President Trump, North Korea said today that it had test-fired a new type of “tactical guided weapon.” There was no evidence that the test involved a nuclear detonation or an intercontinental ballistic missile. Analysts said the test shows that Mr. Kim is reverting to sabre-rattling as he moves to end the sanctions that are derailing his hopes of rejuvenating North Korea’s economy. What’s next: Mr. Kim said recently that he would give the U.S. until the end of the year to come up with proposals that would lift sanctions, an implicit warning that North Korea might resume nuclear and intercontinental missile testing. Today’s test suggested that he might raise the stakes sooner. Donations from wealthy French families and companies to rebuild the fire-ravaged cathedral in Paris are nearing $1 billion, intensifying the resentment that has been on display during the Yellow Vest protests about economic inequality. “If they’re able to give dozens of millions to rebuild Notre Dame, they should stop telling us that there is no money to pay for social inequalities,” one labor union leader said. Another angle: The Paris Fire Department’s chaplain, the Rev. Jean-Marc Fournier, has emerged as a central figure in the mission to rescue artworks and relics from the blaze. He told our reporter how more than 100 firefighters carried the precious pieces to safety. Yesterday: A man carrying two cans of gasoline, two bottles of lighter fluid and two lighters was arrested after entering St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York, the police said. The church was undamaged. So-called heartbeat bills — a ban on abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected, often before a woman even knows she is pregnant — have been on the fringes of the anti-abortion movement for years. But four states have passed such measures this year, and heartbeat bills are moving through the legislatures of 11 others, according to one policy expert. With an increasingly conservative Supreme Court under President Trump, anti-abortion activists hope to overturn Roe v. Wade, the decision that established a federal protection for abortion in 1973. Quotable: “Now is our time,” said Michael Gonidakis, the president of Ohio Right to Life in Columbus. “This is the best court we’ve had in my lifetime, in my parents’ lifetime.” The Daily: Today’s episode is the second of a two-part series on abortion. Listen to Part 1 here. During Susan Wojcicki’s tenure as chief executive of YouTube, she has had to contend with uploads of pedophilia and mass murder. Yet she has largely escaped the public scrutiny that her peers on other platforms have faced. To get a sense of what she is like as a leader, our reporter spoke to more than a dozen current and former employees, and Ms. Wojcicki herself. Tighter rules on Cuba: The Trump administration has imposed new restrictions on dealing with the island, including limiting nonfamily travel and allowing exiles to sue for property seized by the Castro government. New tent cities for immigrants: With existing facilities “beyond capacity,” the federal government will spend nearly $40 million to house detained migrant families and children in Texas. “Infatuated” with Columbine: An 18-year-old woman who officials said was armed and had traveled to Denver before the 20th anniversary of the shooting was found dead of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound. Ex-leader of Peru kills himself: A former president, Alan García, shot himself as the authorities were trying to arrest him in connection with one of the biggest corruption scandals in Latin American history. Pinterest I.P.O.: The digital pin board company has priced its shares at $19 each for today’s initial public offering, a valuation of $12.7 billion. Green buildings, or else: New York City is expected to pass a law to fine buildings that violate new caps on greenhouse gas emissions. Snapshot: Scientists were able to restore some function, above right, to brains from slaughtered pigs, in a study that raises profound questions about the line between life and death. Late-night comedy: Several of the hosts were eager to see Robert Mueller’s report. Jimmy Kimmel said, “Political analysts are going to try to read through these redactions like teenage boys trying to watch scrambled porn on cable in 1985.” What we’re reading: This piece from The Bulwark. “It’s a compelling counterpoint to the idea that being gay and running for president isn’t a big deal in 2019,” says Jeremy Peters, our national political reporter. “Tim Miller’s reaction to Pete Buttigieg kissing his husband onstage at a rally is a reminder that this is still very new.” Cook: Use leftovers to make salmon fried rice. Watch: Roxann Dawson’s faith-based film, “Breakthrough,” tells the story of a miraculous ordeal with an unassuming simplicity, our critic writes. Read: The Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer Robert Caro shares insights into his craft in “Working,” which is new this week on our hardcover nonfiction and combined print and e-book nonfiction best-seller lists. You can find all our lists here. Go: The moment Adam Driver steps onstage in “Burn This” is the most “impressively violent Broadway entrance” in 30 years, our theater critic writes.

Before you sign up for a movie subscription service like MoviePass, Sinemia or AMC’s A-List, check which works at the theaters you go to most often.

That’s not his entire name, but that’s all we use in The Times. The leader of the Future Forward Party, which shocked the Thai military establishment in last month’s elections by coming third in the popular vote, is Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit. Family names — a 20th-century innovation in Thailand — are constructed to be distinct, and that often means extra syllables. If foreigners find Thai names to be a mouthful, so, apparently, do Thais, who use nicknames in everyday life. Many people are called Lek (Thai for small), Nok (bird) and Poo (crab and, please, it’s pronounced more like “boo”). This writer’s younger son has played soccer against an Ice, a Python and a Bar Code. A girl in our building is called DTAC, which is the name of a cellphone operator.

2019,"Wing, Owned by Google’s Parent Company, Gets First Approval for Drone Deliveries in U.S.","Millions of drones buzzing through the air, delivering the groceries you need to make your dinner, the medicine you forgot to pick up from the pharmacy or even a hot cup of coffee. To some, it’s the inevitable, efficient future. To others, it might sound more like the beginnings of a dystopian horror story. Either way, it’s now closer to reality. The Federal Aviation Administration said Tuesday that Wing, the drone-delivery unit of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, had received the agency’s first approval to use drones to carry and deliver packages commercially. Wing had previously been testing its drones in a suburb of Canberra, Australia, where the machines had made more than 3,000 deliveries, in part to demonstrate the drones’ safety and gain the F.A.A.’s approval, the company said. There will be restrictions on its American effort. The drone deliveries will be limited to parts of southwest Virginia, where Wing is already part of an F.A.A. pilot program looking at how to integrate drones with society. The exact locations are still being determined. The drones can be operated only during the day, when the weather is clear enough that they can be seen, said Greg Martin, an F.A.A. spokesman. They can’t fly above 400 feet (planes and helicopters typically fly above 500 feet). One drone pilot can remotely fly up to five machines, though it’s not clear if there’s a hard cap on the total number of drones allowed in the sky at one time. Even with the restrictions, the drones’ backers portrayed the F.A.A.’s approval, called an Air Carrier Certification, as game changing, particularly as regulations, technology and public aversion have slowed the progress of drone-delivery initiatives. “From our perspective, it’s more treating drones like manned aviation,” said Mark Blanks, director of the Virginia Tech Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership, one of the organizations involved in the pilot program. “That accomplishment is huge, and I think it’s a preview of the future of where this is headed.” Hype about commercial drone delivery increased after Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, predicted in a “60 Minutes” interview in 2013 that drone deliveries could become commonplace within five years. That failed to materialize. But globally, drones are increasingly being used in different ways. Zipline, which delivers medical supplies, is distributing blood by drone in Rwanda, and Swoop Aero, an Australian company, is dispensing vaccines and medications in the remote South Pacific nation of Vanuatu. Chinese aviation administrators have approved drone deliveries by the e-commerce giant JD.com and the delivery services business S.F. Holding Company. In the United States, they’ve been used for emergency response, surveillance and aerial photography. Jonathan Bass, a Wing spokesman, said deliveries in Virginia should start later this year, though he did not have a specific date. What the drones will actually deliver is still to be determined, but the company said it would focus on goods from local businesses. Wing said it would seek input from local community leaders in the next few months on how to best implement the program. When a Wing drone makes a delivery, it hovers at about 20 feet and lowers the package on a hook. Customers can select what they want delivered on an app. In Canberra, where Wing has done most of its tests, one of the most common items delivered was coffee, Mr. Bass said. Drones also delivered ice cream, medicine, meals and, in one instance, mascara to a beautician who had run out while she was doing a makeover. “There’s lots of interesting uses, some of which we wouldn’t have anticipated,” Mr. Bass said. Mr. Bass said using the drones is “safer than getting in your car and going to pick something up, it’s better for the environment, it’s faster.” “Personally, I like to cook a lot,” he added. “I can’t count the number of times I get to the end of a recipe and realize I’m missing one ingredient. To have that delivered straight to my backyard or my front door will be extremely valuable.” Not everyone has taken to the idea of drones. A Pew Research Center survey in December 2017 found that 54 percent of Americans disapproved of drones flying near homes, 11 percent supported drones flying in those areas, and 34 percent favored limits on such use. There are also questions about the economics and whether consumers will pay the extra cost to have small and lightweight items delivered by drone. James Burgess, Wing’s chief executive, told The New York Times in March that “scale doesn’t concern us right now.” “We strongly believe that eventually we will be able to develop a delivery service for communities that will enable them to transport items in just a few minutes at low cost,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,Winnie’s Karaoke Bar Reopens in Chinatown,"Boite “There are old friends and new friends,” the owner said. “Are you going to sing?” For three decades, Winnie’s, an old-school dive and raucous karaoke bar, lured Chinatown residents and fashionable visitors for boozy singalongs in the shadow of the Tombs (otherwise known as the Manhattan Detention Complex). When it shut in 2015, it became another casualty of a gilded city. But an unlikely resurrection occurred on Valentine’s Day this year, when Winnie’s was reborn on East Broadway. On a cold Friday night in March, Teddy Mui, the manager and 40-year-old son of Winnie Mui, the owner, seemed as if he had returned from a lengthy stay on a desert island. “They’re not even calling it Chinatown — it’s Two Bridges,” he said of neighborhood newcomers. “At the old Winnie’s, our first crowd was Chinese gangsters.” As he reminisced, lyrics from a Journey song lit up the karaoke screen: “Strangers waiting / Up and down the boulevard.” Winnie’s is lodged above one of Chinatown’s busiest stretches, threaded up a staircase within a knot of cellphone repair shops and jewelry emporiums. The rectangular room has ambiguously underdesigned décor. The dark wood bar is decorated with a ZZ plant and a framed photo of Ms. Mui with Bill Clinton; a small stage and red booths conjure the spirit of its first location. “It has an underground vibe — the irony is that it’s upstairs,” said Stephanie, a 30-something woman who declined to give her last name because she works “for the city.” Earlier, she had mangled a rendition of “Blank Space,” by Taylor Swift. “I’m not proud of it,” she said. By midnight, the bar was fleshed out with older Chinatown residents and younger karaoke enthusiasts. There were Converse Chucks and drapey, silken blouses. Someone cracked open a fragrant carton of takeout dumplings. Two women performed “New York, New York” by Frank Sinatra, and Ms. Mui floated in, resplendent in a plum blazer. “There are old friends and new friends,” she said. “I’m very happy. Are you going to sing?” The erstwhile laserdiscs aren’t exactly gone; they’ve been repurposed in several chandeliers that resemble opaque, inverted lemon juicers. Digitized karaoke selections veer poppy and nostalgic: Bowie, Madonna, Paul McCartney. “We can have it up a little louder,” Mr. Mui said, of the new location. 21 and over, no cover. Miller High Life is $5, and small bottles of sake are $6. Winnie’s Dragon Punch, a fruity and liquor-masking blend, is $10. There are plans to serve food. For now, a bucket of pork rinds awaits behind the bar. Winnie’s Bar, 58 East Broadway, 2nd floor (between Catherine and Market Streets); (646) 838-8880.

2019,"Winning Tennis Titles Again, Bob Bryan Is Inspiring Athletes With Hip Injuries","MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — At 40, Bob Bryan can dive for volleys again. He can turn, twist and slap fast-twitch returns. He can also win more titles: He partnered with his twin brother, Mike, and triumphed at the Delray Beach Open and the Miami Open in the last six weeks. It is all beginning to feel so familiar that Bob Bryan, one of the greatest doubles players in history, often forgets that he now has a mostly metal right hip. “When I take the towel off, and I walk by a mirror, I go: ‘Whoa! Look at that scar!’” he said. “I have a 10-inch scar, and without that scar, I wouldn’t even know it’s in there.” Tennis has long produced first-rate comeback tales. It has been 30 years since Thomas Muster, the intense Austrian, whacked groundstrokes in a custom-designed chair designed to protect his postoperative left knee, which was injured when a drunken driver plowed into Muster’s parked vehicle at the tournament in Key Biscayne, Fla. Muster returned to the tour and reached No. 1. Bryan’s renaissance at an age when most tennis stars have long since retired is certainly one for the short list, too. It has been less than a year since he was hobbling down the boardwalk in Santa Cruz, Calif., with his wife, Michelle, certain that his remarkable career was over. He was concerned, above all, about getting healthy enough to play with his three young children. “I couldn’t walk for more than five minutes,” he said. The orthopedic surgeon Edwin Su resurfaced Bryan’s hip on Aug. 2 at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York and explained that, if all went very well, Bryan could envision returning to tournament play eight months later. He returned to action in five months and, now at the eight-month mark, is winning significant tournaments. “What Bob is doing is incredible,” Su said in a telephone interview on Monday. “He really is demonstrating what determination and his hard work can accomplish with a new implant.” “Incredible” is quite a word choice from a surgeon who has performed more than 4,000 such procedures. A few others were on professional athletes trying to save their careers, including the former major league pitcher Colby Lewis. But no professional tennis player has had this procedure and returned to the fore, although Andy Murray, who underwent the same type of operation in January in London after plenty of chatting and texting with Bryan, may try to do the same. “The things that make Bob Bryan great, you don’t know if you are going to lose that with an artificial joint and surgery,” Su said. “It’s amazing to see he doesn’t seem to have lost any of it and in fact is now able to play without pain.” David Macpherson, the Bryans’ longtime coach, said Bob was playing like the “30-year-old Bob.” “He’s exploding to poaches like the old days when he would just steal points from incredible cross-court returns by flashing across the net with the speed of light and picking off balls,” Macpherson said in Miami. “I also feel he’s a little more confident on the return, letting it go and doing more damage than before, and he is still serving just as nasty. So I really feel he’s in a great place right now, where he’s just enjoying his life and loves his family but is getting a second lease on tennis.” After Bob’s hip problem became acute in Madrid last May, Mike went on to win Wimbledon and the United States Open with Jack Sock. Bob attended their practices in New York while using a cane. But there was no doubt the twins would reunite on court if Bob could recover. “With all the success Mike was having with Jack in the majors, Bob just handled it all with so much class and was so supportive of Mike in that time,” MacPherson said. Doubles has been deeply overshadowed in the modern era, with the biggest stars like Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal focusing on singles in Grand Slam tournaments. But in a parched environment, the Bryans — Mike the right-hander, and Bob the lefty — have managed to carve out a rich niche with their winning ways and personalities. They have enthusiastically gone above and beyond to sign just about every autograph and pose for just about every selfie, but Bob is reaching a new audience now. “I talk to probably three or four people a week, people who get my number and call me about hip problems,” he said. “A professional soccer player in Australia. I’m getting hit up by people all the time.” He said he had spoken with Murray, the former world No. 1 from Britain, most recently about a week ago. “He was asking me a lot of questions in the early weeks, because obviously those are the weeks where you are not feeling great and probably a little concerned,” Bryan said. “But I think he’s probably feeling really good right now.” Murray has posted video of himself on social media lightly hitting tennis balls. But returning in singles, with full-court coverage required, is a more daunting prospect. “I think a three-out-of-five-set singles match is almost close to 50 times more physical than doubles,” Bryan said. “It’s going to really challenge Andy, the movement. But I can jump. I can lunge, and I am not sore after matches.” As Murray debated whether to have surgery, Bryan put him in touch with Su, who said Murray was an ideal candidate for the procedure. Murray ultimately chose to have it done closer to home by Sarah Muirhead-Allwood, a leading British hip surgeon.. Can he come back and play singles at the highest level? “I think he would be able to,” Su said. Hip resurfacing is not a total hip replacement. It calls for shaving a thin layer of damaged bone off the ball of the hip joint and replacing it with a metal cap — “like crowning a tooth,” Su said. A metal socket is also put in place. “When Bob refers to it as his metal hip, it is truly metal,” Su said. Bryan credited Su, an avid tennis player, for his success so far. “People tell me this surgery comes down to millimeters,” Bryan said. “I’ve talked to people who had different doctors and have done the same procedure, and they feel like crap.” Su said he believed Bryan’s recovery had been accelerated in part by the use of a relatively new rehabilitation tool: an anti-gravity treadmill, which supports a player at the hips with an inflatable lower-body compartment and reduces the risks of fractures in the recovery phase. “You can un-weight the body to 60 percent to 70 or 80,” Su said. Su saw Bryan compete in the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., last month. “I love it, just to see what he’s able to do,” Su said. “I cringe a little bit when he dives, but he’s done it several times, and no worse for the wear.” Will such acrobatics and the other rigors of professional tennis put Bryan at greater risk of requiring follow-up surgery down the road? “That’s a really good question we don’t have the answer to,” Su said. “We don’t have enough data in terms of how it would hold up to activity such as this. This has been done now for almost two decades, so there are some very active patients out there, and activity doesn’t seem to make it wear out. We’re drawing from the experiences of recreational athletes.” The Miami title was the Bryans’ 118th together on tour. They had once planned on retiring after the 2012 Olympics and were close to retirement at the 2017 Australian Open. But such plans are on hold, even with their 41st birthday looming on April 29. “Now we’re looking at Tokyo in 2020,” Bob said of the next Olympics, while emphasizing that “we never wanted to play until we were 45 or 46.” Skepticism is definitely permitted at this stage. “I know,” Bob said with a chuckle. “My wife doesn’t believe me, either.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Winning the War on Poverty,"The Canadians are doing it; we’re not. Opinion Columnist Jesus said the poor will always be among us, but there are a lot of people in Canada testing that proposition. According to recently released data, between 2015 and 2017, Canada reduced its official poverty rate by at least 20 percent. Roughly 825,000 Canadians were lifted out of poverty in those years, giving the country today its lowest poverty rate in history. How did it do it? The overall economy has been decent but not robust enough to explain these striking outcomes. Instead, one major factor is that Canadians have organized their communities differently. They adopted a specific methodology to fight poverty. Before I describe this methodology, let’s pause to think about what it’s often like in American poor areas. Everything is fragmented. There are usually a bevy of public and private programs doing their own thing. In a town there may be four food pantries, which don’t really know one another well. The people working in these programs have their heads down, because it’s exhausting enough just to do their own work. A common model is one-donor-funding-one-program. Different programs compete for funds. They justify their existence using randomized controlled experiments, in which researchers try to pinpoint one input that led to one positive output. The foundation heads, city officials and social entrepreneurs go to a bunch of conferences, but these conferences don’t have much to do with one another. In other words, the Americans who talk about community don’t have a community of their own. Every day, they give away the power they could have if they did mutually reinforcing work together to change whole systems. In Canada it’s not like that. About 15 years ago, a disparate group of Canadians realized that a problem as complex as poverty can be addressed only through a multisector comprehensive approach. They realized that poverty was not going to be reduced by some innovation — some cool, new program nobody thought of before. It was going to be addressed through better systems that were mutually supporting and able to enact change on a population level. So they began building citywide and communitywide structures. They started 15 years ago with just six cities, but now they have 72 regional networks covering 344 towns. They begin by gathering, say, 100 people from a single community. A quarter have lived with poverty; the rest are from business, nonprofits and government. They spend a year learning about poverty in their area, talking with the community. They launch a different kind of conversation. First, they don’t want better poor; they want fewer poor. That is to say, their focus is not on how do we give poor people food so they don’t starve. It is how do we move people out of poverty. Second, they up their ambitions. How do we eradicate poverty altogether? Third, they broaden their vision. What does a vibrant community look like in which everybody’s basic needs are met. After a year they come up with a town plan. Each town’s poverty is different. Each town’s assets are different. So each town’s plan is different. The town plans feature a lot of collaborative activity. A food pantry might turn itself into a job training center by allowing the people who are fed do the actual work. The pantry might connect with local businesses that change their hiring practices so that high school degrees are not required. Businesses might pledge to raise their minimum wage. The plans involve a lot of policy changes on the town and provincial levels — improved day care, redesigned transit systems, better work-force development systems. By the time Canada’s national government swung into action, the whole country had a base of knowledge and experience. The people in the field had a wealth of connections and a sense of what needed to be done. The two biggest changes were efforts in city after city to raise the minimum wage and the expansion of a national child benefit, which can net a family up to nearly $6,500 a year per child. Canada essentially has guaranteed income for the young and the old. The process of learning and planning and adapting never ends. The Tamarack Institute, which pioneered a lot of this work, serves as a learning community hub for all the different regional networks. Paul Born, the head of the institute, emphasizes that the crucial thing these communitywide collective impact structures do is change attitudes. In the beginning it’s as if everybody is swimming in polluted water. People are sluggish, fearful, isolated, looking out only for themselves. But when people start working together across sectors around a common agenda, it’s like cleaning the water. Communities realize they can do more for the poor. The poor realize they can do more for themselves. New power has been created, a new sense of agency. Born doesn’t think you can really do social change without a methodology, without creating communitywide collective impact structures. But in many American communities we’re mostly scattershot. That’s the problem with our distrust and polarization. We often don’t build structures across difference. Transformational change rarely gets done.

2019,Opinion | Winning the climate fight,"There are pro-climate policies that most voters favor. Opinion Columnist This article is part of David Leonhardt’s newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday. The politics of climate change can sometimes feel unwinnable. The oil and coal industries spend large sums of money to spread falsehoods. The leadership of the Republican Party echoes those falsehoods. Many voters, struggling with slow-growing living standards, are hostile to policies that would address climate change — namely, increases in energy prices. And so far the top-tier Democratic presidential candidates haven’t put the issue at the center of their campaigns. But for all of these challenges, I think there is a more promising political approach than many people realize. In the upcoming issue of The Times Magazine, I’ve written an essay about it, and it is online now. The brief version: Americans are skeptical of policies that directly raise the cost of energy, such as a carbon tax or cap-and-trade program. But polls show that most Americans are in favor of policies that promote clean energy even if those policies indirectly raise the cost of energy. One example is a mandate requiring utility companies to use more clean energy; most states already have such a mandate, and Michigan and Nevada have recently made theirs tougher. Another example is federal spending to subsidize clean energy — a program, in other words, that looks like a Green New Deal. Obviously, programs like these don’t eliminate the costs of moving away from dirty energy. But they can change the political calculus. When a policy calls attention to the costs of the transition, as a carbon tax does, people are wary. When a policy calls attention to the benefits, people often have a more favorable attitude and are willing to accept slightly higher costs. As a result, many climate activists have been changing their political strategy in recent years. “It makes sense to set a goal,” as Rhiana Gunn-Wright, a climate-policy expert, told me while I was reporting the magazine story. When people understand the goal — like a clean-energy economy — they are much more open to solutions than when the policy discussion focuses on mechanisms for reaching that goal. Even if the country adopted a sensible climate policy today — and it’s inconceivable under President Trump — it is too late to avoid some of climate change’s terrible damage. But it’s not too late to make a big difference. My article is part of the Magazine’s climate issue, and you can find more of it here. The theme is deliberately scary: “Putting a Price on the End of the World.” Also, the writer Nathaniel Rich has just released a book based partly on his August 2018 cover story for the Magazine on the history of climate policy. Last night, Nathaniel and I talked about climate change at the Brooklyn Public Library, and you can watch the conversation here. Related: Thomas Friedman argues that smart climate proposals could well be damaging to a president who has denied climate change at every chance he’s gotten. “If Democrats approach this right,” he writes, “they can win on this issue in 2020 and make Trump the laughingstock.” If you are not a subscriber to this newsletter, you can subscribe here.

2019,"Foxconn’s Deal With Wisconsin Should Be Revised, Gov. Tony Evers Says","Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin is dubious that Foxconn, the Taiwanese electronics giant known for making iPhones, will fulfill its promise of creating 13,000 jobs at a planned plant in the state. So he wants a redo of the contract. “I think at this point in time that would be an unreal expectation when they’re downsizing the footprint of what they’re doing,” Mr. Evers told reporters at his office in Madison on Wednesday. The project, once championed by President Trump as evidence of a manufacturing renewal, has been mired in mixed signals. Mr. Evers wants to revisit the arrangement that Foxconn made with the state in 2017 and “figure out how a new set of parameters should be negotiated,” according to a transcript of his statements. The deal initially envisioned the company making display screens for televisions and other electronics at a $10 billion facility, with the state offering $4 billion in tax credits and other inducements over 15 years. The agreement was drafted under Scott Walker, the Republican governor whom Mr. Evers, a Democrat, replaced. Earlier this year, Foxconn said it was rethinking its plans, citing “new realities” in the market. Even before then, the company had hinted that its Wisconsin project would focus more on research and development, rather than on the intensive factory work that tends to generate blue-collar jobs. Foxconn said at the time that it would hold to its pledge to create 13,000 jobs, telling The New York Times that 25 percent of its Wisconsin employees would be focused on manufacturing. Soon after, following a conversation between Mr. Trump and Terry Gou, Foxconn’s billionaire founder, the company said it still intended to build a plant to produce displays for consumer products. Mr. Gou announced plans on Wednesday to run for Taiwan’s presidency. Mr. Trump has praised his business acumen, calling him “one of the great businessmen of our time.” His company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “The present contract deals with a situation that no longer exists, so it’s our goal to make sure that the taxpayers are protected and environmental standards are protected,” Mr. Evers said. “And we believe we need to take a look at that contract and see if it needs to be downsized as a result.”",The New York Times
2019,"Wisconsin Woman Used Hacked Facebook Accounts to Recruit for ISIS, Prosecutors Say","Two people in Wisconsin have pleaded guilty to crimes related to providing support for the Islamic State, including a woman who used hacked Facebook accounts to share instructions for building explosives and mixing poison, the authorities said Monday. Prosecutors said the two cases were unrelated. The woman, Waheba Issa Dais, 46, a permanent legal resident of the United States who was born in Israel, pleaded guilty to attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. She used a series of hacked Facebook accounts to pledge allegiance to ISIS, recruit new members for the terrorist group, encourage supporters who said they wanted to launch terrorist attacks, and share plans for building explosives, prosecutors said. “Remember Boston Marathon bombing?” Ms. Dais asked an undercover F.B.I. officer on Facebook, according to a plea deal she signed last month. “It was very easy to make. All it needs is a pressure cooker, shrapnel and explosives. Join my channel and research.” Matthew D. Krueger, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, said in a statement that Ms. Dais “promoted ISIS’s hateful, violent agenda and provided detailed instructions on how to harm innocent people” from her home in the Milwaukee suburb of Cudahy. The second person, Yosvany Padilla-Conde, pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting a 2016 attempt by another man, Jason Ludke, to join ISIS by driving him from Wisconsin to Mexico, where the men thought they could evade United States law enforcement and travel to Syria or Iraq. Federal prosecutors said Mr. Padilla-Conde, a Cuban national who resided in Milwaukee at the time of his arrest, posted video online pledging allegiance to the Islamic State and describing plans to travel to the Middle East. The Justice Department said Mr. Ludke was convicted last year of conspiring to provide material support to ISIS. Mr. Padilla-Conde will be sentenced this summer. “Padilla-Conde swore allegiance to an extremely violent terrorist organization and then traveled across the country in an attempt to join it,” Mr. Krueger said in a second statement. “This case underscores that homegrown violent extremism remains a very real threat.” Ms. Dais and Mr. Padilla-Conde each face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000, the Justice Department said. Their plea deals were signed weeks ago but formalized in court on Monday, their lawyers said. John Campion, a lawyer for Ms. Dais, said in an email that he and his client “look forward to the September sentencing hearing where we will address the complicated history that led to her online conduct.” Craig Powell, Mr. Padilla-Conde’s lawyer, said his client had been set up by an undercover F.B.I. officer who offered to arrange for him to travel to Mexico if he made an ISIS video. He had been in “purgatory” since losing his immigration status after a criminal conviction because diplomatic tension with Cuba made him difficult to deport, Mr. Powell said. “He did not intend to go to the Middle East,” he said. “My client was trying to get to Mexico to start over because he had no legal status here.” Seamus Hughes, the deputy director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, said Ms. Dais’s case was the more significant of the two announced on Monday. He described Mr. Padilla-Conde’s case as run-of-the-mill. He said Ms. Dais had been “kind of a key voice online” whose activities highlighted the importance of the Islamic State’s female supporters, especially those from the United States. “American women supporters in general, but her in particular, tend to be the glue that hold different online spaces together,” he said. Ms. Dais played an important role online because “she wasn’t just a connector, she was providing some level of skill to individuals who otherwise wouldn’t have it,” he said. Prosecutors said she used Facebook accounts stolen from unwitting users for her ISIS activities because she thought it would make it harder for law enforcement to track her. Once she had control of an account, she replaced the original users’ friends with ISIS contacts and changed the display name to some variant of her online alias, Hind Salah Eddin, prosecutors said. Ms. Dais, who has seven children, also changed the profile pictures to a publicly available image of a little girl that was taken as part of a project on the Yazidi religious minority in Northern Iraq. The Yazidi were forced to flee their homes en masse after ISIS occupied their territory in 2014, abducting thousands of women and girls to be used as sex slaves for jihadist fighters. Ms. Dais wanted other ISIS supporters to be able to hack Facebook accounts, too, so she made a video that taught them how to do it, prosecutors said. She then used social media to share the video. Ms. Dais used the stolen accounts to post how-to videos that provided step-by-step instructions on how to build explosives, including how to build an explosive belt worn by suicide bombers, the Justice Department said in a statement. She also used Facebook to share a recipe for ricin, a deadly poison made from castor beans. When an undercover officer on Facebook asked her about it, she sang its praises, according to the plea agreement she signed. “I will send you the poison of Ricin for it is easier, more effective, and cannot be traced, even if the person dies, it cannot be found in the body,” she wrote. She said it could be especially useful in an attack against a government facility or a city water reservoir. But she warned the officer, who she thought was a jihadist, that it was dangerous stuff. “May Allah make you successful,” she wrote. “It’s easy to make but remember to be cautious.”",The New York Times
2019,"Wisconsin, Ground Zero for 2020 Politics, Looks Like a Tossup Again","MILWAUKEE — With their recent selection of Milwaukee for their party’s 2020 convention, Democrats left little doubt that they believe their path to the White House runs through the Midwest in general and Wisconsin in particular. Their optimism spiked in November, when Democrats defeated Scott Walker, the state’s two-term conservative governor. And they were energized and optimistic again this week for an intensely politicized State Supreme Court election they hoped would show Wisconsin trending steadily blue. Then reality hit: A conservative judge, Brian Hagedorn, appeared to win a narrow, upset victory on Tuesday, underscoring instead how competitive Wisconsin politics remain. For Democrats, an intense effort to rebuild their Midwestern “blue wall” for 2020 is showing gains in Michigan and Pennsylvania, both of which President Trump captured in 2016. On Tuesday, Democrats flipped a key Pennsylvania State Senate seat that Republicans had long held outside Pittsburgh. [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race.] But in Wisconsin, the apparent loss of the State Supreme Court race — Judge Hagedorn leads by nearly 6,000 votes and a recount is possible — underscored what strategists in both parties said in interviews this week: The state is a tossup in 2020 and its political identity is very much in flux. “Republicans know they need this state and are going to fight like hell to keep it in President Trump’s column,” said Joe Zepecki, a Democratic strategist in Wisconsin. He said that Mr. Walker’s loss in November may have fired up the conservative base just as Hillary Clinton’s 2016 loss did for Democrats last November. “They’re coming with everything they’ve got,” he said of Republicans. “That means we have work to do.” Wisconsin’s reputation as a battleground state is well earned. In the three closest presidential elections of recent times — 2000, 2004 and 2016 — Wisconsin was decided by the narrowest average margin of any other state: less than one percentage point in each election. Mr. Walker lost his re-election bid for governor by less than one percentage point, after warning all year of a coming blue wave. Over the weekend, Mr. Walker offered a pep talk to Republican activists in Milwaukee about the stakes in electing Judge Hagedorn, a former lead counsel to his administration, who defended contentious election issues such as a voter ID law. [Check out our tracker of the 2020 Democratic candidate field.] Democrats wanted to defeat Judge Hagedorn and gain a liberal Supreme Court majority, Mr. Walker warned, so they could seize control of redistricting after 2020 and “get rid of one, maybe two seats that we currently have in the House of Representatives.” Democrats “haven’t forgotten about how close the election was” in 2016, Mr. Walker told party activists gathered for breakfast at the American Serb Hall in Milwaukee. “They’re not going to make that mistake again.” Mark Jefferson, executive director of the Wisconsin Republican Party, said Judge Hagedorn’s apparent victory showed the power of the party’s engaged conservative base. “The grass roots took offense to the attacks on Hagedorn’s Christian faith,” he said, referring to news accounts that the judge founded a Christian school that allows firing teachers in same-sex relationships. But others say Mr. Walker’s midterm loss is probably a more relevant bellwether for 2020 than the Supreme Court race, because turnout was more than twice as high, and Mr. Walker is a polarizing, partisan figure in Wisconsin, much like the president. Barry White, a lawyer who voted for Mr. Walker in 2010 but snubbed him in 2018 in favor of his Democratic opponent, Tony Evers, said he had wanted to make a bigger point. His ballot was “a repudiation of Trump and Republicans that insist on carrying his water,” Mr. White said. “It was the only message I could send.” Mr. White lives in the Milwaukee suburbs, the state’s most populous Republican region. Mr. Evers’s gains there last year were a key to his narrow victory. In an interview, Mr. Walker said that should be a lesson to Mr. Trump. “To win, he’s going to have to improve his numbers in the suburbs,” he said. “With the passion the opposition is going to have, he’s going to have to make some inroads.” Last fall, Mr. Walker matched his vote totals from 2014 in the three suburban counties outside Milwaukee. But a surge of Democratic votes in the demographically changing suburbs meant his vote share dropped in 2018 by 12 percentage points in Waukesha County and by 16 points in Ozaukee County. “It’s the paradox of Trump’s strategy of appealing to his base constantly,” said Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll of the state. “It also helps gin up the feelings of your opposition. I think that it’s a gift to Democrats that keeps on giving.” One of those voters is Tiffany Duncan, a 26-year-old employee of a printing company, who skipped the 2016 election because she didn’t like either major party candidate. But she definitely plans to vote in 2020 — for whichever Democrat takes on Mr. Trump. “I didn’t think Trump was this crazy,” she said as she walked to Café Bavaria in Wauwatosa Village. Still, Mr. Franklin said, the state is so evenly divided, its chances of determining an Electoral College majority for either party “puts us at ground zero.” In a Marquette poll in January, 49 percent of Wisconsin voters said they would definitely vote for someone other than Mr. Trump. Only 27 percent plan to definitely support the president, meaning his path to a second victory in the state is both uphill and narrow. Many of today’s uncertain voters — who are Republicans or Republican-leaning independents — may come home to the party, especially once there is a Democratic nominee to contrast with the president. John Carlson, a 59-year-old engineer in Milwaukee, is one of those gettable voters for both parties. He went for Mr. Trump in 2016 but is uncertain if he will do so again. Democrats could win him over, he said — “if the Democrats came up with somebody reasonable, which I’m not expecting them to do.” Republicans are framing the Milwaukee convention as an opportunity to motivate their own base, expecting Democrats to showcase a parade of far-left figures and policies. National Republicans have already begun a coordinated effort to paint Democrats as wild-eyed radicals steering the country toward socialism. “Democrats were energized in 2018, like any party is out of power during the first midterm, but then decided to go off the rails once they seized control of the House,” said Rick Wiley, a former political director of the Republican National Committee, whose roots are in Wisconsin. “The president energizes base Republicans and has had great success with working class voters,” he said in an email. “Those same working class voters won’t check the box on a progressive/socialist nominee.” Mr. Jefferson of the Wisconsin Republican Party said he was upbeat about Mr. Trump despite public polling. “I expect to see the same thing this cycle as 2016, where all polling suggests it’s an uphill battle and on Election Day things look a lot different,” he said. “I think the Democrats are once again overplaying their hand and a little too confident.” When Mr. Trump holds rallies aimed at Wisconsinites, he visits media markets across northern and western regions, largely agricultural and rural, where in 2016 he outperformed earlier Republican nominees. In the Supreme Court race, Judge Hagedorn, the conservative, got a major boost in the Green Bay and Wausau markets, enough to overcome a deep deficit in Dane County, which includes Madison, the state’s bluest stronghold. In the 18 counties in the Green Bay media market, where TV ads linked Judge Hagedorn to Mr. Trump, voters swung by 18 points toward the conservative compared with a State Supreme Court election last year won by a liberal judge, according to an analysis by Craig Gilbert of The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The Saturday before Election Day, there was no shortage of avid Trump supporters at Roar Off the Shore, a tasting of craft beers and cheeses east of Green Bay in Kewaunee County, which is on the thumb of the Wisconsin mitten. Though the county’s populace is small, Mr. Trump’s ability to run up the score in such places was repeated all across rural America in 2016. He won Kewaunee County, a dairy region, by 28 points compared with Mitt Romney’s six-point margin as the 2012 Republican nominee. “I’m tired of politicians; he’s not a politician,” said Randy Boor, 57, who works in a factory that makes commercial cookware. He judged Mr. Trump’s chances of carrying the state in 2020 as even better than in 2016. “We’ve got a guy there that’s delivering,” he said. “He wants to do the frickin’ job. You know how much could get done if he wasn’t being opposed by all these idiots?” Another beer taster, Dave Soborowicz, a 47-year-old plumber, had driven across the state from Eau Claire to attend the event with his brother, who wore a Trump hat. But Mr. Soborowicz was less enamored of the president and unsure if he would vote for him the next time. “He’s so bloated in his head that he thinks he’s still going to get his frickin’ wall, when he’s been defeated,” he said. Mr. Soborowicz said business was good for him as a plumber but he wasn’t ready to give Republicans and the president credit. “All I know is it was a bad winter,” he said, “so we were very busy.”",The New York Times
2019,"With Brexit Delayed, British Businesses Say: Enough Already","The extension announced on Wednesday gives the country six more months to figure out a plan to leave the E.U., but firms, especially small ones, fear another impasse. LONDON — When will it be over? That was the collective response from many British businesses on Thursday after the European Union extended the deadline for the country’s departure from the bloc until Oct. 31, warding off a chaotic crash on Friday. The extension, giving the government an additional six months to come to an agreement over the terms of its divorce, puts off the prospect of a no-deal Brexit and the expected devastating hit to the economy. But even as the immediate pressure abated, businesses pleaded with politicians to come to an agreement swiftly and avoid being in the same position six months down the line. Despite the uncertainty, the British economy grew by 0.3 percent in the three months ending in February, according to numbers from the Office for National Statistics released this week. But some of the activity may have been a result of frantic preparations to leave the European Union, and economists warned that Brexit could slow growth further. For many of the larger businesses, Brexit has already happened. Banks have already set up shop overseas to continue serving their customers on the Continent. Carmakers have scrapped plans to develop more cars within the country. And those who could afford to prepare for a no-deal separation will continue to do so, said the Confederation of British Industry, a business organization representing about 190,000 companies. Food retailers will be focused on how to get perishable food into the country if Britain does leave at the end of October. Britain imports a higher proportion of its food in the cooler months, so the new date would come as sales of homegrown food would be slowing and imports ramping up in anticipation of Christmas. “The end of October presents many of the same challenges that we had in March in terms of importing foods and a high reliance on the E.U. at that point,” Tom Holder, a spokesman for the British Retail Consortium, said. Many companies, particularly small ones, have not had the spare cash or staffing to prepare for a potential overnight change in operating conditions, and have been simply hoping that a catastrophic no-deal would not happen. Now that the worst-case scenario has been put off, businesses of all sizes are still pleading for Parliament to give them clarity before the economy slows. An extension to the negotiations “comes with costs and uncertainty,” Josh Hardie, the deputy director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said in an interview. Businesses “place their bets on other countries” if Britain is no longer perceived as a gateway to Europe. “That’s already happening — it’s not something that will just happen with Brexit,” he said. Roni Savage, the director at Jomas Associates, an engineering consulting firm with 15 employees, has already seen the knock-on effect of the Brexit impasse. Her firm surveys ground conditions for construction companies. Half of her construction clients, she said, have started slowing new projects, like housing, because it is not clear whether demand will hold up after Brexit. “We get affected very quickly by issues with the economy, and Brexit is a huge one,” Ms. Savage said. “It’s a nightmare,” she added. “I’m really saddened by having another extension, having to wait for longer. We’ll all be hoping to get this over soon.” Farmers expressed the same concerns. “We have crops and livestock in fields, with farmers and growers still in the dark about what trading environment they will be operating in, whether they will have access to a sufficient work force to carry out essential roles this season, or what the U.K.’s future domestic agricultural policy will look like,” Minette Batters, the president of the National Farmers’ Union, said in a statement. Even an extension and a withdrawal agreement would be only the beginning of negotiations over Britain’s future relationship with the European Union, said Tim Durrant, a senior researcher at the Institute for Government, a think tank. “We’re in the long haul for Brexit, I’m afraid.” The Federation of Small Businesses was blunt in its assessment of this prospect on Thursday. “Unless we get a political consensus, all a further extension does is create even more uncertainty, which is driving small firms to despair,” Mike Cherry, the national chairman, said in a statement. About 60 percent of employees at private companies in Britain work at small and medium-size firms, or those with up to 250 employees. “Lots of small businesses are in wait-and-see mode, and it’s not sustainable for that to go on indefinitely,” Alan Soady, a federation spokesman, said in an interview. “They will need time to adapt to whatever future trading conditions will be.” In southwest London, Lars Andersen, the chief executive of My Nametags, a company of about 15 people that prints labels for children’s belongings, may have to open an office in the Netherlands if he is to maintain sales, 40 percent of which go to the European Union. Like others, he was momentarily relieved, but he fretted about the prospect of waiting another six months to know whether he might have to set up shop in another country. “We just have to be ready to jump, and that’s a bit scary,” he said. He has been grappling with the issue for so long, he added, that Brexit is starting to feel “a bit like when you go to the dentist for a long operation.” “Initially, you have all this adrenaline, and then you just hope it will finish.”",The New York Times
2019,"With Haenyeo, a Trailblazing Korean Chef Takes On Seafood","Restaurant Review 10 Photos View Slide Show › Looking around Haenyeo’s dining room one night in early March, I thought maybe Jenny Kwak’s time has finally come. Her third restaurant, Haenyeo was about three months old and already filled with people who looked as if they’d been going there for years. It sits on a prime corner lot, on a stretch of Fifth Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn, that is rich in local minichains serving banh mi, burritos, lobster rolls and so on, to take out or eat in. Intimidating restaurants don’t tend to prosper here. Very few people inside Haenyeo look the least bit intimidated as they lift grilled oysters by the shell to pour the dregs of hot seaweed butter over toast; or carve wedges of zucchini-scallion pancakes fried to a dark and satisfyingly rich brown; or stir mushrooms, squid, bean sprouts, steamed spinach and cabbage kimchi with a just-cracked egg into a bibimbap whose bottom layer of rice is golden and crunchy where it meets the hot stone bowl. The customers at Haenyeo seem to have an easy familiarity with Korean food. Some of them, at least, can probably thank Ms. Kwak for that. In 1992, when she began serving the cuisine in the East Village at her first restaurant, Dok Suni’s, the words tteokbokki and seolleongtang and jajangmyeon did not roll off the tongues of most non-Koreans. But that’s who she wanted to lure in with American music, date-night décor and Western-style service. Once she had them, she would tempt, teach, turn them on to the flavors she’d grown up with. Her mother, Myung Ja Kwak, shared cooking duties. Ms. Kwak’s was not the take-it-or-leave-it approach of 32nd Street, and she kept at it. She wrote “Dok Suni: Recipes From My Mother’s Korean Kitchen,” which was one of the few Korean cookbooks in English when it came out, in 1998. At her second restaurant, Do Hwa, she and her mother led customers deeper into unfamiliar ground. Each of the restaurants stayed open for about two decades, which is a very long time in New York. If you want a metaphor for how effectively Ms. Kwak paved the way for restaurants like Atoboy, Soogil, Danji and others whose chefs weave Korean cuisine into new patterns, consider that one of them, Oiji, moved into its address on First Avenue right after Dok Suni’s moved out. What Ms. Kwak is doing in Park Slope isn’t all that different from what she has done all her career, except that by now South Korean comfort food has become comfort food for New York in general. Haenyeo does pay more attention to seafood than Dok Suni or Do Hwa did, though. Ms. Kwak hasn’t gone pescatarian on us. She still serves impressive pork and beef bulgogis with ssamjang and lettuce, and the pan-fried dumplings are filled with high-fat ground beef seasoned with kimchi, garlic and soy. But her menu’s orientation has shifted slightly toward the ocean. This is good news, because the seafood at Haenyeo has a sparkle and sweetness you don’t always find in the smoke-filled rooms of 32nd Street. A bibimbap variant may be the menu’s sleeper dish, partly because it starts out looking like a lunch bowl from Sweetgreen. It is a version of hwe dup bap. At first you just see raw tuna, shredded romaine and perilla leaves, grated carrots and cucumber, and strips of seaweed. Hidden underneath is warm rice. But there is a pink mound of spicy cod roe in the bowl, too, with cured salmon eggs and a few lobes of sea urchin. Both of them will break apart as you stir, bringing their distinct saltwater intonations to the rice and vegetables. What the menu calls “white fish fillets” — pan-fried cod with rings of scallion showing through their thin gold sheet of egg batter, otherwise known as saeng seon jeon — is so modestly named it might get overlooked; it shouldn’t. The menu plays Don’t Mind Me again with “mackerel, grilled or braised.” Just get the mackerel, because the kitchen knows how to cook it, whether over a flame or in a dark, smoky pan of garlic and gochujang. In truth, the kitchen seems to know how to cook every kind of seafood, although perhaps it could come with a better partner for the fried scallops than the sweet, yellowish tartar sauce with corn in it. The walls are hung with photographs of Korean women in wet suits. These are the haenyeo of Jeju island, who dive up to 30 feet deep for conch, abalone and seaweed while holding their breath for several minutes at a time. The money they made diving is probably the reason parts of Jeju have a matriarchal family structure. Naming the restaurant after them, Ms. Kwak continues a theme started with Dok Suni’s, which means “strong women’s.” One dish that seems out of place is a revival of Dok Suni’s fried chicken. Was the batter always so pasty and airless? That’s not how I remember it, but it’s possible my standards have changed as Korean fried chicken has infiltrated nearly every part of town over the past decade. In any case, there is better chicken to seek out here, not just the home-style dokdoritang stewed in chile sauce but also the wings. Haenyeo double-fries wings that have been dipped in potato starch, then coats them with a fine version of a yangnyeom chile sauce, tangier and a little less sweet than some. When Ms. Kwak detours from the Korean straight and narrow, consider traipsing along behind her. You may wind up having beignets for dessert, buried under a fresh coat of powdered sugar in the best Café du Monde style. (This and the grilled oysters may betray the hand of her business partner, Terrence Segura, who is from New Orleans. He is also her husband.) Or you may follow her all the way to the joyous rice cake fundido, which starts out as tteokbokki in chile sauce and becomes totally atypical through the addition of chorizo, sliced jalapeños and a melted, browned topcoat of Oaxacan cheese that comes up in long, stretchy strings when you pull on it. It is, in all likelihood, the best Tex-Mex dish in New York. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

2019,"With Indigenous Languages in Steep Decline, Summer Camps Offer Hope","In July, about 20 7- and 8-year-olds will gather at a summer camp in the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation, in Northern California. They will sing songs, put on puppet shows and play games. And there will be one special rule: No English. That’s because this five-day summer camp is held almost entirely in Hupa, the native language of the roughly 4,000-member Hoopa Valley Tribe that mostly lives in that part of the state. For decades, native speakers of Hupa, also known as na:tinixwe mixine:whe, have dwindled. Only about 20 people are fluent enough today to teach the language and pass it on, tribe members estimate. The camp is a bet that immersion at a young age can help change that. “That’s always the goal,” said Sara Chase, a member of the tribe who organized the camp with the Hoopa Tribal Education Association. “How do you create new speakers?” As the number of languages spoken globally is in steep decline, it’s a goal shared by an increasing number of indigenous communities seeking to maintain a core part of their culture, inextricably tied to their history and way of life. “We are facing a really interesting chapter of human history where people are going against the tide to keep their language alive or bring back languages that are dormant,” said Gabriela Pérez Báez, a professor of linguistics at the University of Oregon. Some experts predict that half of the roughly 7,000 languages in existence today will lose all fluent speakers by the end of this century. In surveys of about 245 language revitalization programs that Dr. Báez, director of the university’s Language Revitalization Lab, conducted in 2016 and 2017, more than half began after the year 2000. About 30 percent started after 2010. “It just goes through the roof,” she said. The United Nations General Assembly has declared 2019 the International Year of the Indigenous Language in an attempt to raise “global attention” to the peril facing indigenous languages, as well as a way of celebrating revitalization efforts like those in the Hoopa Valley Tribe, said Boyan Radoykov, section chief for universal access and preservation in Unesco’s knowledge societies division. The United Nations initiative, through a series of events, is highlighting several programs around the world. A hackathon in Singapore last month explored ways to use free software to help preserve indigenous languages. And a conference this month held by the Institute of Linguistics of the Russian Academy of Sciences focused on Russian indigenous languages. “The world must find a way to preserve these languages,” Mr. Radoykov said. “We believe that it contributes significantly to the promotion of cultural identity and diversity and intercultural dialogue.” The story of the Hoopa Valley Tribe stretches back thousands of years, to when the tribe first populated the region that would become Northern California, Ms. Chase said. The valley itself is where the Trinity River cuts through the mountains. Tribes in the area used redwood trees to make homes and canoes. The discovery of gold in the mid-1850s brought white people — and violent conflict — to the area. In 1893, the Bureau of Indian Affairs created the Hoopa Valley Indian School, where, as at other such boarding schools around the country, white teachers burned traditional clothing, gave children Anglo names and forbade them to speak the language of their parents. For more than six decades, the government tried to “civilize” and “Christianize” Hupa children, according to the book “Our Home Forever: The Hupa Indians of Northern California” by Byron Nelson Jr. (Both Hoopa and Hupa are derived from the same word — a colonial interpretation of the Yurok term for the Hupa people. The proper name is Na:tinixwe, which is what the people call themselves.) In the Hoopa Valley and across the country, younger Native Americans became increasingly exposed to the English language. Many older people suppressed their native tongues and dissuaded their children from speaking them, if they were taught at all. “Some would say that whenever they try and speak the language, they could taste the soap in their mouths,” said Daniel Kaufman, a director of the Endangered Language Alliance, a nonprofit group in New York. Schools did eventually begin to teach na:tinixwe mixine:whe, but not enough to create new fluent speakers, Ms. Chase said. “Time is finite; that is always scary and always something that I think is in the back of our minds,” said Erika Tracy, the executive director of the Hoopa Tribal Education Association, which oversees tribal educational programs. “I just feel that urgency, to know that we need to learn, and we need to learn fast, and we need to teach fast to sustain our language and everything that comes with that.” Ms. Chase’s immersion camp began in the summer of 2017. She had graduated from Columbia University in 2014, where she majored in Native American studies and linguistics, after growing up on the reservation. She is enrolled as a Hoopa Valley Tribe citizen. The tribe, as its own sovereign nation, requires citizens to prove a certain level of tribal ancestry, Ms. Tracy said. As part of a senior thesis at Columbia, she held a “bare-bones” version of the immersion camp. Then, in 2017, after receiving a $10,000 grant from a nonprofit organization called Running Strong for American Indian Youth, she started her first summer camp, with about 15 children, which ran for four days. In 2018, there were about 20 children, and the camp expanded to five days. Ms. Chase hopes to eventually start her own school. Younger children, she said, can cognitively pick up languages much faster than older ones. There are precedents showing that a small effort like Ms. Chase’s can have a large impact. Two of the most prominent language revitalization efforts, of Maori in New Zealand and of Hawaiian, started in a similar fashion. By the 1980s, the number of fluent native speakers of the Hawaiian language had fallen to about 1,500. Professors at the University of Hawaii at Hilo set up a preschool where older Hawaiian speakers taught the language. Slowly, adding a new grade each year, they succeeded in creating a preschool-to-high-school system in which Hawaiian is the primary language of instruction. In New Zealand, activism by community groups led to the kohanga reo movement. Beginning in 1982, it immersed Maori preschoolers in the Maori language, among other efforts to recover the language. Maori became an official language of New Zealand in 1987. Today, indigenous people are increasingly embracing the language. The New Zealand government says it wants more than 20 percent of the country’s population to speak basic Maori by 2040 and has pledged to provide Maori lessons in all schools by 2025. Some efforts focus on revitalizing languages that had lost all of their speakers, like Myaamia, the dormant language of the Myaamia people who historically populated the Midwest. By the 1960s, there were no known living speakers, said Daryl Baldwin, the director of the Myaamia Center at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. Revitalization in that case began by delving into archives in the 1990s. One linguist from the University of California, Berkeley, used dictionaries recorded by French Jesuits in the 17th and 18th centuries. Mr. Baldwin used old documents belonging to his grandfather. The Myaamia Center was founded in 2001. It’s a partnership between the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma, where the Myaamia people were relocated, and the university, and today it develops curriculums for tribal youth programs, trains educators and researches tribal history. One of the goals of such revitalization efforts is to restore confidence. Dr. Báez said that “the loss of the language is a very tangible evidence of the oppression that a people might have suffered” and that it “signals a significant defeat and vulnerability.” For Ms. Chase, it’s about a resurgence of a way of life damaged by colonialism. “It really is a whole other way of looking at the world, of feeling,” she said. “There’s just so much power in the language.” Ms. Chase said she drew from the Maori and Hawaiian initiatives as she developed her summer camp idea. At least one attendee seems to have been inspired. Almost every day, Grace Kane, a 7-year-old member of the Hoopa Valley Tribe, sings songs in Hupa, said her mother, Brandice Davis. Grace calls to the family dog in Hupa, and has started teaching words and phrases to her older sister. To Ms. Davis’s chagrin, when Grace decides to defy her parents, she even says “no” in Hupa. “For her, it’s just fun at the time,” Ms. Davis said. “For me, it’s more along the lines of hope, hope for our future.” An earlier version of this article misstated the status of the Maori language in New Zealand. It is an official language, along with English and New Zealand Sign Language; it is not the country’s only official language.",The New York Times
2019,"With Letter on Sexual Abuse, Pope Benedict Returns to Public Eye","ROME — In his retirement, Pope Benedict XVI is apparently tired of hiding. The former pontiff, who declared he would “remain hidden to the world” when he became the first pope in six centuries to abdicate in 2013, has released a 6,000-word letter that puts the blame for the clerical sexual abuse crisis in the Roman Catholic Church on the sexual revolution of the 1960s, the disappearance of God from public discourse in the West and what he considers dangerously liberal theological ideas that eroded morality after the church reforms of the Second Vatican Council. Among his claims, Benedict wrote that the sexual revolution deemed pedophilia as “allowed and appropriate,” and that the landmark social protests of 1968 for “all-out sexual freedom” as well as sex education for young children and nudity in advertising prompted a “mental collapse” that he linked to “a propensity for violence.” “That is why sex films were no longer allowed on airplanes,” he wrote to illustrate his point, “because violence would break out among the small community of passengers.” The letter, written for the German church magazine Klerusblatt, was published overnight by conservative Catholic websites that have consistently exalted Benedict and criticized his successor, Pope Francis. The deeply theological and esoteric missive, which Benedict called his contribution “in this difficult hour” for the church, was written “absolutely on his own” by Benedict, according to Archbishop Georg Gänswein, Benedict’s longtime personal secretary, who is also the prefect of the papal household under Pope Francis. In writing the letter, Benedict realized the fears of many church experts who have argued that having two pontiffs living at the same time was a recipe for pastoral, theological and political disaster and could lead to confusion among the faithful. Although Benedict wrote that he gave his successor and the Vatican’s Secretariat of State a heads up about the letter, it amounted to the most significant undercutting yet of the authority of Pope Francis, who has instead blamed a systemic abuse of power and an unhealthy adoration of authority within the church’s hierarchy for the crisis. Francis, who two months ago held a landmark summit meeting on the crisis with church leaders from around the world, has struggled to find his voice on sex abuse, though he promised “concrete and effective measures” to resolve it. Those are yet to come. Benedict cited the summit meeting as the impetus for his letter. And by speaking up at such a vulnerable time, he made clear where he stands on the issue. Some theologians, describing the letter as “deeply flawed,” “troubling” or “embarrassing,” suggested it put him squarely on the wrong side of history. “The willingness to blame a permissive culture and progressive theology for a problem that is internal and structural is stunning,” Julie Hanlon Rubio, a professor of social ethics at the Jesuit School of Theology at Santa Clara University who has written on sexual morality, wrote on Twitter. Others noted that Benedict had seemed to violate not only his own promise to stay out of his successor’s way, but also guidelines set by the Vatican’s Directory for the Pastoral Ministry Of Bishops, which states that “the bishop emeritus will be careful not to interfere in any way, directly or indirectly, in the governance of the diocese. He will want to avoid every attitude and relationship that could even hint at some kind of parallel authority.” Until now, Benedict, who turns 92 next week and lives a secluded life in a convent behind the Vatican walls, has remained mostly quiet, limiting his appearances to warm and white-cloaked photo opportunities with Francis. His eight-year papacy was noted for its doctrinal orthodoxy but also for public-relations disasters — including an early speech that offended much of the Muslim world — that church experts said sapped influence and power from the shy German. But in recent years, especially as Pope Francis has struggled to respond to the sex abuse crisis, Benedict received a positive re-evaluation for having defrocked hundreds of abusive priests. That legacy now seems likely to undergo another revision. Benedict wrote that within the church, an erosion of moral theology, apparently also among abusive priests, left it “defenseless against these changes in society.” The letter was instead silent on Benedict’s tenure — for 24 years before becoming pope — as the church’s doctrinal watchdog, during which time much of the cover-up for abuse took place. He said that his former department, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, was ill-equipped to handle the abuse cases. Benedict has remained an icon to conservatives and traditionalists in the church who feel besieged by Francis, a pope they consider a dictator, a liberal radical and an existential threat to church doctrine. For years they have sought to draw Benedict into the Vatican’s political and culture wars. As the abuse crisis flared up again under Francis’ watch in the United States, Chile and Australia — where Cardinal George Pell, one of Francis’ top cardinal advisers, is now in a prison cell after being found guilty of abuse — conservative critics of the pope sought to weaponize it. In August, the former papal ambassador to Washington, Carlo Maria Viganò, wrote a letter calling for Francis’ resignation and accusing him, without proof, of covering up for homosexual cabals inside the church and for the abuses of Theodore McCarrick, the former archbishop of Washington whom Francis had stripped of his cardinal’s hat and eventually threw out of the priesthood. But it was Benedict and his predecessor, John Paul II, who were in power during the time abuse by Mr. McCarrick and his promotions took place. Nevertheless, Benedict in his letter echoed the theme promulgated by Archbishop Viganò and his allies. Benedict lamented “homosexual cliques” in the seminaries “which acted more or less openly and significantly changed the climate in the seminaries.” The former pope said the situation had since “greatly improved,” but his ideological allies still blame homosexuality for the abuse crisis, an assertion discredited by scientific studies. But Benedict more directly blamed the movement toward sexual freedom and God’s exit from public discourse for the abuse. “It could be said that in the 20 years from 1960 to 1980, the previously normative standards regarding sexuality collapsed entirely,” Benedict wrote, “and a new normalcy arose that has by now been the subject of laborious attempts at disruption.” While Francis has taken to blaming the devil for pedophilia in the church, an assertion that infuriates abuse survivors who instead blame priests and the bishops who cover up for them, Benedict instead pointed to God’s absence as a motive for the crimes. “Why did pedophilia reach such proportions?” Benedict writes. “Ultimately, the reason is the absence of God.” Physically feeble though, according to those who have visited him, still mentally sharp, Benedict apparently thought his letter would lend Francis a helping hand. “Since I myself had served in a position of responsibility as shepherd of the church at the time of the public outbreak of the crisis, and during the run-up to it,” Benedict wrote, “I had to ask myself — even though, as emeritus, I am no longer directly responsible — what I could contribute to a new beginning.”",The New York Times
2019,"With Polls and Private Meetings, Republicans Craft Blunt Messaging to Paint Democrats as Extreme","WASHINGTON — Republican leaders are sharpening and poll-testing lines of attack that portray Democratic policies on health care, the environment and abortion as far outside the norm, in hopes of arming President Trump with hyperbolic sound bites — some of them false — asserting that Democrats would cause long waits for doctors or make killing babies after birth legal. The blunt messaging underscores one of the biggest challenges facing Democrats as they try to defeat the incumbent president: the need to define themselves and their ideas before Mr. Trump and his conservative allies do it for them. The Republican National Committee has already begun polling in 16 states to assess ways to discredit ideas like “Medicare for all,” which Senator Bernie Sanders proposed in a bill this week, and build on the party’s broader argument that Democratic candidates like Mr. Sanders are promoting an extreme socialist agenda. Social conservative leaders have met with White House officials to discuss calling attention to Democratic-sponsored legislation to loosen restrictions on abortion in the second and third trimesters, like one that passed recently in New York. [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.] The recent focus on health care and abortion follows well-coordinated attacks on policies like the Green New Deal, which reduced the far-reaching climate change proposal to a punch line with jokes about cow flatulence and putting farms out of business. Some Democratic strategists said they have been taken aback recently by how successful Mr. Trump and Republicans have been at setting the terms of the debate around liberal policy ideas. And they are encouraging their party to be more nimble and deliver a more concise and accessible message. In a fight with Mr. Trump, they say, nuance is not usually the Democrats’ best weapon. “What our side has to understand is that to fight Trump it’s a battle for definition,” said Celinda Lake, a top Democratic pollster who has been working with left-of-center groups on a strategy to counter the messaging campaign from the right. “The Democrats will issue a 61-page white paper that nobody in their right mind will pass on to their friends,” she added. “He uses a one-sentence slogan, and his voters feel emboldened to share it, pass it on.” Democrats say they expect an asymmetrical battle against an opponent who makes his own rules and possesses a singular ability to saturate the national conversation. This can cut both ways, especially on issues like immigration where his fitful threats to close the southern border may cast him as more of a crisis instigator than mitigator. In 2018, Mr. Trump’s alarmist warnings about the Central American migrant caravan and his exaggerated claims about immigrants and crime were divisive with many suburban voters and contributed to Democratic victories that helped the party win the House. Still, the president’s purge of the Homeland Security Department this week signals his belief that strict immigration enforcement is a winning issue for him. And while the wall he promised in 2016 remains unbuilt, he will continue to look for new ways to hold a hard line on border security. It is not clear whether any of the Republican messaging is having an impact on voters outside of the president’s so far unmovable base. But Ms. Lake said that as she surveyed likely 2020 swing voters, she was surprised to hear people in focus groups repeat false assertions made by the president and his allies — that Democrats would end air travel in the United States and shut down dairy farms and beef production because of greenhouse gas emissions from cows. “It’s amazing the number of people who would volunteer that,” she said. The actual language in the proposal calls for cleaner transportation and agriculture “as much as is technologically feasible.” The misperception about cows and airplanes originated with a now-retracted fact sheet published by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s office that contained an ironic aside about getting rid of “farting cows and airplanes.” Republicans said they also saw “Medicare for all”-type proposals as a way to give their rallying cries on socialism more substance and potency. Some plans, like the one put forward by Mr. Sanders, would largely eliminate private insurance plans, which Republicans have found is overwhelmingly unpopular with the kinds of voters they need to win back. [Who’s running for president in 2020? Keep up with who’s in and who’s out with our candidate tracker.] “The debate that’s going to play out in suburbs across the country is a choice between capitalism versus socialism,” said Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee. “When Democrats talk about abolishing private health insurance, for example, most of my friends are on private insurance plans through their jobs or their husbands’ jobs. They don’t want to lose that. They don’t want to wait in line to get to the pediatrician.” “Whichever Democrat wins the nomination will have to own their party’s socialist agenda,” she added. “That’s a debate that President Trump is eager to have and knows he can win.” The Republicans’ data on voters from the 2018 midterms showed that coverage of pre-existing medical conditions was the top issue of concern. But here they face a serious disadvantage: They have no health care plan of their own. But they have been testing messaging on health care with likely voters in the 16 states they believe will be the most competitive in 2020. These include ones Mr. Trump narrowly won like Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida, as well as those he won by larger margins but have tilted more Democratic lately, like Arizona and North Carolina. The R.N.C. found that when voters were told that “Medicare for all” would eliminate private insurance and create a government-run system paid for by higher taxes, independents, married women and union members disliked the idea by wide margins. Among married women alone, nearly 60 percent disapproved. Mr. Trump’s own approach at labeling Democrats has been inconsistent. He has yet to come up with the kind of indelible rhetorical device that he used repeatedly to brand his opponents in 2016. So far he has nothing like “Crooked Hillary,” “Little Marco’’ and “Low-energy Jeb,” which delighted many of his supporters two years ago. But he has occasionally made graphic and false claims that Democrats support legislation that would allow “executing babies AFTER birth,” as he said in a recent tweet. During a meeting at the White House before his State of the Union address that included some conservative activists, Mr. Trump expressed amazement at comments by the governor of Virginia, Ralph Northam, who had to clarify his defense of abortion in later stages of pregnancy after activists accused him of saying doctors should be able to kill a baby born alive during the procedure. “Can you believe this governor?’’ the president said, according to two people at the meeting, who said that he was surprisingly animated about the subject and vowed to keep mentioning it. The Centers for Disease Control says such late-term abortions are extremely rare. Only about 1.3 percent of abortions in the United States in 2015 were performed in or after the 21st week of pregnancy, the agency reported. But anti-abortion activists said the efforts in some states like New York and Virginia to remove certain barriers to second- and third-trimester abortions allowed them to present the issue to voters in a new and graphic light. Democrats have struggled to defend the new legislation; privately some say they are not being persuasive in explaining the health situations the bills address while the other side accuses them of condoning infanticide. While polls show that Americans support allowing abortion in the first three months by wide margins, that support drops sharply when people are asked in general about the second and third trimesters. (They overwhelmingly support exceptions if the mother’s life is endangered.) “We’re in a totally different environment,” said Mallory Quigley, vice president of communications for the Susan B. Anthony List, a group that opposes abortion rights and that plans to test messages on the issue with voters in the months ahead. Democrats say they cannot let Mr. Trump and other Republicans go unanswered as they try to link the party to socialism — a term that Americans view negatively over all — and to extremism in a broader sense. That has been the motivation behind Republicans’ intense focus on two young, freshman members of Congress: Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, the congresswoman from Queens who calls herself a democratic socialist; and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, whose criticism of Israel led the president and others to condemn her as an anti-Semite. Some of Ms. Omar’s most vocal defenders have been self-described democratic socialists. Even if Americans say they like policies that are derivative of socialism, like Social Security, the term “connotes very clear imagery to people in a very dog whistle kind of way,” said Jefrey Pollock, president of the Global Strategy group, which advises Democrats on messaging. “Then they attach faces to it,” he added, “and I think it can have resonance, and it has had resonance.” The effort on the right to elevate Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, 29, as the most prominent socialist foil is something Democrats are watching, Mr. Pollock said. “She is, of course, six years away from being able to run for president. But they are still trying to make her the face of the party.” Conservatives have extended this line of attack beyond candidates like Mr. Sanders, who identifies as a democratic socialist. They are using it on other 2020 contenders like Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind. Laura Ingraham, the Fox News host, last week accused Mr. Buttigieg’s father, who died recently, and who had taught at the University of Notre Dame, of being “a committed Marxist, who affectionately embraced the Communist Manifesto.” She cited a Washington Examiner report as evidence. Democrats’ own research has found this approach to be effective with the Republican base, which can be more aware of liberal policies like the Green New Deal than liberals are. When Global Strategy Group and GBA Strategies surveyed Fox News viewers last month, they found that Republicans who watch Fox are more than twice as likely as all other groups to have heard about the plan than Democrats. Their verdict? Seventy-seven percent of them are very concerned about the influence of socialism in the Democratic Party. OpinionMichelle Goldberg",The New York Times
2019,"With Pressure and Persuasion, China Deflects Criticism of Its Camps for Muslims","In the opulent halls of the Emirates Palace hotel, a seat of power in Abu Dhabi where 114 domes decorate the vast rooftop, a delegation of about a dozen Chinese diplomats lobbied foreign ministers of the Muslim world last month. China has been fighting criticism that it has detained as many as one million members of Muslim ethnic minorities in indoctrination camps in its western Xinjiang region. But at the two-day conclave in early March, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation — a group of 57 nations that has been a vocal defender of the Rohingyas and Palestinians — handed Beijing a significant victory. In a resolution on protecting the rights of Muslim minorities around the world, the group praised China for “providing care to its Muslim citizens.” Its vast system of detention without trial has drawn condemnation from the State Department and Congress, but no sanctions, and only scattered criticism in Europe and at the United Nations. That is still more of a response than in the Muslim world, where nations — including Pakistan, Indonesia and other recipients of big Chinese loans — have overlooked China’s abuses against ethnic Uighurs, Kazakhs and others. And as Muslim countries fall in line, the West is under less pressure to take action. The major deterrent to antagonizing Beijing is its blunt economic power. In Washington, President Trump’s trade talks hang in the balance. China is building ports, railways and roads in countries rich and poor across Asia, Europe and Africa in its global trillion-dollar infrastructure push, the Belt and Road Initiative. Some of the recipients are moderate Muslim countries, like Turkey, Pakistan, Indonesia and Malaysia, which human rights advocates had hoped would counter conservative Arab states’ lack of concern for Muslim minorities. Even New Zealand’s Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, who forcefully condemned violence against Muslims after mass shootings at two mosques in Christchurch last month, focused on promoting trade with China during a visit to Beijing last week. She raised the treatment of the Uighurs with China’s top leaders only in private, and told reporters afterward, “You can’t do much more than that.” When the West imposed sanctions on China for the massacre of pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, policymakers gave little thought to retaliation. It was still a weak country then, without the economic leverage it now wields. China is the European Union’s biggest trading partner, and several newer members are grateful recipients of China’s new infrastructure. “No one wants to do this alone,” said Mikko Huotari, deputy director of the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin. “There’s a general fear of deterioration of relations with China.” In defending the detention camps to counterparts, Chinese diplomats have mounted some novel arguments. They have told American officials, for example, that Beijing is applying in Xinjiang best practices it gleaned from studying the United States. The Chinese argue that the facilities in Xinjiang are no different from the American military prisons in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, where foreign terrorism suspects have been held without trial. The Americans have replied that the detainees in Guantánamo eventually had access to lawyers, fair trial and visits from the International Committee of the Red Cross, none of which have been available in Xinjiang, two American officials involved in the conversations said. The government insists that the camps are vocational training centers that curb extremism. But witnesses and experts describe them as the heart of an immense campaign to transform Xinjiang’s 11 million Uighurs and other minority Muslims into loyal servants of the Communist Party. The campaign challenges traditional definitions of crimes against humanity, which complicates the world’s response, said Adrian Zenz, a lecturer at the European School of Culture and Theology in Germany. “What we are witnessing in Xinjiang is different, not quantitatively but qualitatively: a massive, concerted campaign of coerced sociocultural re-engineering,” he said. “It is not so much a crime against physical bodies as it is against souls.” There is also little dissent in China. The state’s censored news outlets run propaganda videos that make the camps seem like quiet oases of work, with Uighur inmates sitting in rows at work tables. Many Chinese support the government’s policies in Xinjiang because of concerns about Uighur separatism, including violent attacks. “Most Chinese are very supportive of the iron fist policy,” said Zhu Feng, a professor of international relations in Nanjing. “The Chinese fear of deep Islamization and Islamic extremism is increasing.” Beijing at first denied the camps’ existence. But it has since switched tactics, playing on fears of Islamic extremism. Last month, Chinese officials even wrote letters to their counterparts urging them to avoid an event held by the United States mission in Geneva to discuss Xinjiang, suggesting that participation could hurt ties with Beijing. Before the Abu Dhabi gathering in March, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation held a December session on human rights. There, member countries expressed concern about China’s mass internment of Muslims, a campaign that they described as “disturbing” and said needed monitoring. Around the world, rights activists cheered. It was a rare bright spot for Uighur advocates. Fatimah Abdulghafur, 39, a Uighur doctoral candidate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said that for the first time she had felt hopeful that her brother and father, whom she has been unable to contact for two years, would be released from the camps. “Maybe hope is coming our way, maybe we can raise some global awareness among Muslims,” she recalled thinking after the December event. But China responded with a diplomatic campaign targeting the Muslim world. In January, China escorted eight officials from the Organization of Islamic Cooperation on a 10-day tour of Xinjiang that included visits to select facilities, said a human rights advocate who was briefed on the visit. There were differences among the officials about what they saw at the camps. Still, they decided to close ranks because they did not want to upset China at the foreign ministers’ gathering, the advocate said. In the run-up to the Abu Dhabi meeting, China cemented its ties with two Arab friends — Saudi Arabia and Kuwait — who have a history of remaining silent on the plight of non-Arab Muslims. It also made an example of a country that dared to criticize the camps. In February, the spokesman for Turkey’s foreign ministry, Hami Aksoy, called the “systematic assimilation” of the Uighurs a “great shame for humanity” and urged China to close the camps. Beijing ignored the request and retaliated by closing a Chinese consulate in Turkey. The Chinese ambassador, Deng Li, warned that “criticizing your friend publicly everywhere” could hurt economic relations. Turkey is the current chair of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, but when the country’s delegate was given the floor in Abu Dhabi, he refrained from raising the issue of Xinjiang, the advocate who was briefed on discussions said. The resolution passed by consensus. Uighurs like Ms. Abdulghafur were devastated. “We don’t feel that global brotherhood love from them,” she said. “They sell their soul, they sell their faith, for money. They know that millions of people are suffering.”",The New York Times
2019,"With Sensuality and Coolness, a Debut Novel Considers the (Partial) Truths We Tell About Ourselves","Books of The Times When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. A young woman sits alone in a cafe in Paris. How lucky she is, you might think if you happened past, to have her life ahead of her, to be free in this lovely spot in this most romantic of cities. But people are seldom who we imagine them to be. The stories we assume for them are not the stories they tell themselves. Nunu, the narrator of Aysegul Savas’s delicate, melancholy debut novel, “Walking on the Ceiling,” does not feel bold or playful or sophisticated as she sips her coffee in Paris; she feels invisible, bereft. “I wondered how it was that people knew what to do,” she says, thinking about her fellow diners. “Small things, I mean. The rituals of a day. The hours.” Nunu has come to France to study literature after the death of her mother back home in Istanbul. Like a snail curling fearfully into its shell, she is receding from the world. Her isolation is the kind peculiar to big cities, magnified because she is estranged — from the world around her and also from herself. Her loneliness radiates like heat from the pages of this book. Invited to a picnic by another student, Nunu is overwhelmed by what she perceives to be the easy camaraderie of the others in the group, and turns back before they see her. Forcing herself to order a proper meal in the cafe, she brings the food home and leaves it to rot in the refrigerator. Savas’s novel unfolds in a series of 72 short, non-chronological chapters, pieces of a mosaic that demand careful attention as you attempt to fit them together. (Chapter 28 is a single parenthetical sentence of less than 40 words.) Gradually we understand that Nunu is writing from present-day Istanbul, where she has finally settled, and that we are reading her recollections of her past in that city and in Paris and London. The unreliability of memory; the ways we talk to ourselves and to each other; how we can act as detectives in our own lives, combing the past for clues; how places can seem clearer from afar than when we are there — all these themes are touched on in Savas’s spare, disarmingly simple prose. She writes with both sensuality and coolness, as if determined to find a rational explanation for the irrationality of existence, and for the narrator’s opaque understanding of herself. There is, for instance, Nunu’s lonely, bewildering childhood; her father, whose promise fizzled to nothing before his premature death; her mother, who fell into a kind of bewildered depression; her home, in which most everything was left unsaid. There is an interlude in England, where Nunu attends university and goes through the motions of normalcy with Molly, her friendly roommate, and Luke, her thoughtful boyfriend. And there is her time in Paris, where she is adrift until she is rescued by the unconventional sort-of friendship she forms with M., an older male writer known for his lyrical writing about Istanbul. They send finely crafted emails and go on meandering walks, talking about writing, exploring the difference between art and artifice, spinning tales for one another. M. relishes Nunu’s company, scavenging her stories for material, and speaks enthusiastically of the “invisible thread” connecting them. But Nunu jealously guards her real nature. No one has a complete picture of her, because she does not have a complete picture of herself. With Luke, she presents herself as “dark and exotic,” the victim of an abusive childhood. This is a deliberate portrait. “I was building my life piece by piece,” she says, “and it seemed that I had started from scratch.” With Molly, her English roommate, she creates “a parallel life that seemed like something from a book or a film,” featuring an exotic, eccentric mother and a noisy Mediterranean family boisterously crowded around the dinner table. Neither persona is precisely accurate, though each is partly true. In scene after scene, Nunu struggles to reconcile her memory with her desire to make its jagged details fit together. Savas doesn’t write much about modern-day Istanbul, but menace lurks around the corner of her prose. There are hints of distressing change, of a newly dangerous political climate. Most of Nunu’s old friends are abandoning the city just as she is returning. She takes a job at a travel magazine, where she indulges her emotional wanderlust and natural wistfulness, writing about cities that are “more beautiful, less troubled” than her own. Sometimes you want to shake her out of her stupor; other times you feel desperately sorry for her. Home for good, she has the leisure to ponder her friendship with M. and how it has colored her view of her past. Their relationship never becomes physical; there is none of the alarming, “Asymmetry”-style exploitation we have come to expect in such situations. But there is an imbalance nonetheless. Nunu does not want to be Scheherazade forever; she wants the freedom to tell her own story to herself. And so her story emerges, slowly. Mostly what she remembers is the deafening quiet. As a child in a home filled with near-pathological reticence, she secretly devised something she called “the silence game,” which involved seeing who — she or her mother — could go longest without succumbing to the weakness of speaking. It was a way to avoid getting hurt. But Nunu was not just a victim. As she got older, she turned the silence into a weapon. “It kept growing — this meanness inside me,” she says. “I knew how to hurt her, too. So slyly you could hardly point to it.” But though Nunu remembers her mother’s faults, she also remembers her fierceness, her independence, her struggles to do the right — the normal — thing. She recalls a particular pair of eyeglasses her mother wore, decorated with blue and green dots, in a valiant effort to be cheerful. “I wonder whether I could have told a different story of my mother all along, about the ordinary course of a life,” she writes. She learns that stories — what you include, what you withhold, what you manipulate for your audience — can drown out the truth. By the end, it feels as if she is coming close to matching the words to the reality, if that’s even possible. “It is a privilege to have a story,” Savas writes, “to know your own narrative as surely as you know your name.”",The New York Times
2019,"With Trump, NATO Chief Tries to Navigate Spending Minefields","WASHINGTON — He flew across the ocean to celebrate NATO’s 70th anniversary with the largest and most important member of the military alliance. So to outsiders it appeared to be an awkward moment on Tuesday for Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, as he sat stiffly by while President Trump criticized German defense spending and predicted that the United States would get along with Russia. “I accept there are differences, but when it comes to defense spending we all agree,” Mr. Stoltenberg said in an interview after his meeting with Mr. Trump, putting a positive spin on the situation. He said the president had helped push member states to budget an additional $100 billion in defense spending and credited Mr. Trump with “having a real impact.” “I say that because it is a fact,” Mr. Stoltenberg said. “Allies are now really stepping up.” But not all. Germany will most likely slow the growth of its defense spending — meaning that Europe’s economic powerhouse will defy a spending target set by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. And other member states are struggling to reach the current goal of spending 2 percent of their economic output on the military by the end of 2024. The scene on Tuesday was just the latest example of Mr. Stoltenberg’s unenviable efforts to bridge seemingly irreconcilable positions between Europe and the United States. He is the European leader who has shown the most deft hand with Mr. Trump. A trained statistician, Mr. Stoltenberg came to the White House with charts showing how defense spending has risen. But his credit of Mr. Trump for the spending increases has annoyed European leaders. “He is a little too diplomatic,” said Jim Townsend, a former Pentagon official who oversaw relations with NATO and is now a fellow at the Center for a New American Security. “Sometimes he has a hard time whacking an ally over the head.” Mr. Stoltenberg has sought to balance Mr. Trump against German politicians, who have made clear they are sick of the president’s demands. The challenge will only grow throughout this week as Mr. Stoltenberg appears before members of Congress to praise both their support of the military alliance and Mr. Trump’s drive for a more equitable share of military burdens. Germany this year is putting 1.35 percent of its gross domestic product toward defense spending, and in 2020 will spend 1.37 percent. New budget projections by Berlin show Germany will spend 1.25 percent of its economic output by 2023. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and the defense minister, Ursula von der Leyen, have said they remain committed to the 2 percent goal. “Germany will keep its promise,” Ms. von der Leyen said Tuesday on German public radio. Hours later, fueling the pressure, Mr. Trump said member states should spend potentially even more than 2 percent on defense. In the Oval Office, Mr. Stoltenberg sat stone-faced as Mr. Trump criticized Germany for “not paying their fair share.” The president also predicted: “I think we’ll get along with Russia.” Since 2014, NATO has deployed military forces to Eastern Europe to deter Russian aggression. It has also intensified efforts to rebuild European militaries that have eroded since the end of the Cold War. But the alliance faces an array of challenges it has not previously confronted, and does not yet know how to tackle — including Russian interference in elections and domestic politics, and China’s economic investments in telecommunications networks. In the interview with The New York Times, Mr. Stoltenberg suggested the alliance’s policy on Russia was consistent with Mr. Trump’s desire for better relations. He pointed to the cooperation by his own home country, Norway, with Russia on fisheries and other matters. “We now have a strong, common understanding of how to approach Russia,” Mr. Stoltenberg said. “Those allies who were skeptical of dialogue with Russia have seen that we have delivered on deterrence and defense.” The gatherings to commemorate NATO’s anniversary were originally planned as a week of events in Washington for heads of state and government. But Mr. Trump’s angry speeches, public and private, at other alliance gatherings over the last two years persuaded allies to downgrade the anniversary celebration to a meeting of foreign ministers. The goal, according to current and former American and European officials, was to limit Mr. Trump’s participation. Even Tuesday’s meeting with Mr. Trump was not originally on Mr. Stoltenberg’s agenda. But then Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that she had invited the NATO chief to address Congress, a speech that is scheduled for Wednesday. European officials said Mr. Stoltenberg had not yet accepted the invitation when Ms. Pelosi announced it. That put him in the position of potentially leaving Washington without seeing the president but addressing the Democrat-led House, which has approved a measure that seeks to block Mr. Trump from withdrawing from the military alliance. Last week, NATO made the unusual move of extending Mr. Stoltenberg’s term a second time, by two more years, meaning he would leave office in 2022. It is an acknowledgment of Mr. Stoltenberg’s deft touch not just with Mr. Trump, but also with other difficult alliance leaders, including President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary. Mr. Trump endorsed the extension on Tuesday. “I had no doubt in my mind who I wanted,” he said. European officials said their worries about Mr. Stoltenberg’s cozy relationship with Mr. Trump were pushed aside, largely to avoid giving the president an outsize role in selecting a new NATO leader. Mr. Stoltenberg was scheduled to step down in 2020, at the height of an intense election in the United States. In the interview with The Times, Mr. Stoltenberg said he had consulted with Ms. Merkel, and noted that the new budget unveiled by Germany was not final. Germany has submitted a spending plan to NATO that shows defense spending rising by 80 percent between 2014 and 2024, he said, adding that he expected Berlin to live up to that plan. “The Germans have told me it will further increase,” he said. Friction is growing in Germany. The Social Democrats, Ms. Merkel’s center-left coalition partners who control the finance ministry and were in charge of the latest budget plan, are using the dislike of Mr. Trump in their election campaign ahead of European parliamentary elections in May. Julianne Smith, a fellow at the Bosch Academy in Berlin and a former Obama administration national security official, said the Social Democrats were using the military budget to show they were the party “that stands up to Donald Trump.” “This decision became a bit of a referendum on Donald Trump, instead of a referendum on Germany’s hollowed-out forces that desperately need these resources,” she said.",The New York Times
2019,"New Hampshire, With a Death Row of 1, Ends Capital Punishment","Updated on May 30, 2019: After decades of debate, New Hampshire officially ended its use of the death penalty on Thursday, becoming the 21st state to do so. The New Hampshire Senate voted 16-to-8 to override Gov. Chris Sununu’s veto of the death penalty repeal it passed in April, just meeting the two-thirds majority required. The House voted to override the governor’s veto a week earlier, also with no votes to spare. CONCORD, N.H. — Soon after the man who killed his father with a shotgun blast to the chest was captured, Renny Cushing ran into a friend at the grocery store, who said that he hoped the culprit would be executed so that Mr. Cushing’s family could find some peace. “I didn’t know how to respond,” recalled Mr. Cushing, who is now a New Hampshire state representative. “I knew he was trying to give me some comfort.” Mr. Cushing, a Democrat, was then — and is today — a death penalty opponent. And in the 31 years since his father’s murder, he has become one of the nation’s leading opponents of capital punishment. But his efforts at repeal in his home state have always fallen short. On Thursday, though, New Hampshire moved closer to becoming the last state in New England to end capital punishment as the State Senate voted to repeal the death penalty. That followed a vote for repeal in the State House last month. Twice before — in 2000, and again last year — both chambers have voted for repeal, only to be blocked by a governor’s veto. New Hampshire could become the 21st state to abolish capital punishment. New Hampshire wash. Me. Mont. N.D. Vt. Minn. ORE. Mich. Mass. Idaho Ny. wis. S.D. wyo. R.I. Conn. Iowa Pa. Neb. Nev. Ohio N.J.

Alaska Hawaii States with no death penalty Source: National Conference of State Legislators By The New York Times But this time, the House and the Senate each voted with the two-thirds majority necessary to override another threatened veto by the governor, Chris Sununu, a Republican who is a capital punishment proponent. Hours after the vote, an aide to Mr. Sununu said that the governor still intends to veto the bill. But given the margin of the Senate’s vote on Thursday — 17-6 in favor of ending capital punishment — it appeared unlikely that a veto would survive an override vote. The House had also approved the measure by a veto-proof margin last month, 279-88. If approved, New Hampshire would become the 21st state to get rid of the death penalty, continuing a national trend toward fewer executions. Bills to limit the application of the death penalty or to repeal it have also been introduced in at least 18 states this year. With the suspension of capital punishment announced last month in California, most people in the United States now live in places where the death penalty is either outlawed or subject to moratoria, said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit. In nine states, he added, repeal bills have significant Republican sponsorship or support. In New Hampshire, too, the debate has not fallen exclusively along party lines. (The House was controlled by Republicans during the 2000 vote for repeal, and it was a Democratic governor, Jeanne Shaheen, who vetoed that legislation.) In recent years, some Republicans in the state have changed their stances on the issue and now favor abolishment; some have cited the more than $5 million the state has spent on the prosecution and defense of the state’s only current death row inmate as part of their reasoning for the change. At the same time, some Democrats still back capital punishment. State Senator John Reagan, a Republican who favors repeal, said he had long believed that the government’s primary role was to keep people safe, and that the death penalty was part of that. His views changed, though, because “the more and more experience I had with government, I concluded that the general incompetency of government didn’t make them the right people to decide life and death.” But it is Mr. Sununu who has remained the principal opponent to abolishing the death penalty, and who, according to supporters of repeal, had continued to urge Republican colleagues to reject the legislation. “Governor Sununu will always stand up for law enforcement and the families of crime victims,” said Benjamin Vihstadt, his spokesman, who said that representatives of the governor’s office had met with people on both sides of the issue. But Mr. Cushing said Mr. Sununu had avoided meeting with the relatives of victims who see the issue the same way Mr. Cushing does. “The governor has positioned himself as saying he’s vetoing the repeal of the death penalty because he cares about law enforcement and victims, but he’s refused to meet with murder victims’ family members who oppose the death penalty,” Mr. Cushing said. The debate over capital punishment has simmered in New Hampshire for decades, though the state hasn’t executed anyone in 80 years. The state’s only death row inmate — Michael Addison, 39, who was convicted of murdering a police officer — has no execution date. What’s more, the state does not actually have an execution chamber at this point. (State law authorizes lethal injection as the means of execution, with hanging as a backup option.) Asked how the state would proceed with Mr. Addison’s execution if it ever came to that, a Corrections Department spokeswoman said: “We have worked with our legal counsel on draft policies and procedures that have not yet been finalized. If an execution order is enacted then we would finalize the policies and move forward.” Yet Mr. Addison’s fate has taken on an outsize role in the legislative debate, serving as a rallying point for opponents of repeal, including state law enforcement associations. The legislation is not retroactive, and would not affect Mr. Addison’s case. But opponents of repeal say passage of the legislation would nevertheless make it more likely that a judge would be inclined to reduce his sentence. Laura Briggs, the widow of the officer killed by Mr. Addison, told a legislative committee last month that she worried that a vote to repeal would almost inevitably lead to the commutation of Mr. Addison’s sentence. “The person that killed my husband was smirking in court. He had no interest in feeling remorseful,” Ms. Briggs said. She added that her husband had also believed in capital punishment. “It’s about protecting our society from evil people that do evil things.” The debate has evoked powerful emotions on both sides. State Representative David Welch, a Republican, said he changed his mind to favor repeal after his wife died two years ago, causing profound grief and prompting him to be baptized. “The victim’s family goes through grief similar to what I went through,” Mr. Welch said in a recent speech. But “when that inmate is put to death, there’s another family going through the grief, and they’re innocent.”",The New York Times
2019,"With a Flurry of Shots, Dirk Nowitzki Wraps Up His Time in Dallas","DALLAS — Dirk Nowitzki’s final N.B.A. game will take place in the same city — San Antonio — where he played what he considers the most important game of his life as well as what many rank as the best game of his career. Wednesday’s date with the San Antonio Spurs is suddenly poised to be recorded as the final outing of Nowitzki’s 21 seasons with the Dallas Mavericks — thanks to the retirement announcement he sprang on the American Airlines Center crowd after Dallas’s 120-109 victory Tuesday night over the Phoenix Suns. After scoring a season-high 30 points, albeit on 31 shot attempts, Nowitzki punctuated a postgame ceremony arranged to honor his long and decorated career by announcing that he is indeed retiring from the sport. “As you guys might expect, this is my last home game,” Nowitzki told the fans, finally addressing his future after trying to dodge questions on that topic all season in a futile attempt to avoid a so-called farewell tour. The Mavericks’ regular-season finale on the Spurs’ floor thus provides Nowitzki with a serendipitous opportunity to go out where he broke in. It was a 33-point, 14-rebound performance in the 1998 Nike Hoop Summit Game in San Antonio as a 19-year-old that, in Nowitzki’s words, “literally changed my life,” convincing Dallas that it had to do anything it could to draft the little-known German. Nowitzki, 40, went on to overcome a string of playoff disappointments and lead the Mavericks to the only championship in franchise history in 2011. His 21 consecutive seasons with one team is an N.B.A. record — and the 37 points and 15 rebounds he delivered against the five-time champion Tim Duncan in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals in San Antonio in 2006 is widely regarded as his most complete single-game performance. As the game’s sixth career leading scorer with 31,540 points, Nowitzki is often described as the best European import in N.B.A. history and credited with ushering in the modern era of power forward play in which players of all sizes were not only encouraged but expected to shoot proficiently from long range. “He’s our Roger Staubach,” said the longtime Mavericks General Manager Donnie Nelson, who did the loudest lobbying to persuade his father Don, then the Mavericks’ coach and general manager, to make any maneuvers necessary to select Nowitzki in the 1998 draft. Mark Cuban, the team’s owner, announced recently that the reluctant Nowitzki was getting an ornate send-off against the Suns “whether he wants it or not.” The Mavericks duly arranged for five of Nowitzki’s favorite players growing up — Charles Barkley, Scottie Pippen, Shawn Kemp, Detlef Schrempf and even Larry Bird — to fly in, stay out of public view during the game and then emerge to take part in the ceremony. The game itself, predictably, was also all about Nowitzki, with teammates, particularly the league’s rookie of the year favorite, Luka Doncic, feeding him incessantly as fans bayed at him to shoot at every opportunity. Before tipoff, Nowitzki jokingly asked a team staffer to look up how many shots Kobe Bryant took on the way to scoring 60 points in Bryant’s farewell game in April 2016. Informed that Bryant hoisted 50 shots that night, Nowitzki conceded that he very likely wouldn’t reach that territory, but promised to “let it fly.” He wound up taking Dallas’s first eight shots, scored 19 points in the first half and finished with 30 points on 11-for-31 shooting to match what his longtime rival Dwyane Wade of the Miami Heat managed in Wade’s final home game before retirement Tuesday night. The Suns’ Jamal Crawford, at 39, remarkably countered with 51 points, making Crawford the first player in league history to crack the 50-point mark with four different teams. The spotlight, though, never left Nowitzki, who revealed at a news conference after the game that he had decided in recent days that his surgically repaired left foot could not sustain a 22nd season. “I would love to be there for K.P. and Luka and all these young guys and have fun with them and mentor them as much as I can,” Nowitzki said, referring to Dallas’s embryonic star duo of Kristaps Porzingis and Doncic. “But it just doesn’t make any sense anymore physically. I think mentally I could still do it — I can always push myself to work out hard — but physically the foot is just not quite there.” Said Doncic, whose 21 points, 16 rebounds and 11 assists were overshadowed, like Crawford’s scoring outburst, by the Nowitzki party, “I was emotional, and the whole team was emotional, so imagine him.” Nowitzki acknowledged that he has been increasingly weepy over the past week, as the end of the regular season for the lottery-bound Mavericks — and a decision he could no longer delay — drew near. But he was openly giddy when he spoke of the former stars who shared in Tuesday’s festivities, proclaiming it an “amazing” evening. “They did this right,” he said. Asked if he was bothered at all that one more road game remained on Dallas’s schedule, as opposed to closing out the regular season at home, Nowitzki scoffed at the idea that the league’s schedule-makers had wronged him. “I’m totally fine with it,” he said. “The N.B.A. can’t keep up with the plans of a million players. They didn’t know if I was going to retire this season, last season or whatever.” There was likewise no protest from Holger Geschwindner, Nowitzki’s longtime shooting coach and the former captain of West Germany’s 1972 Olympic team. Geschwindner is known in Mavericks circles for being far harder to please than his star pupil, but he embraced the storybook nature of Nowitzki’s returning to the scene of his breakthrough performance at the Hoop Summit by traveling to South Texas one last time. “I think it’s great,” Geschwindner said. “That’s where it all started.” An earlier version of this article incorrectly described Dwyane Wade’s game Tuesday night. It was his final home game in Miami before retirement, not his final game.",The New York Times

Mark Cuban, the team’s owner, announced recently that the reluctant Nowitzki was getting an ornate send-off against the Suns “whether he wants it or not.” The Mavericks duly arranged for five of Nowitzki’s favorite players growing up — Charles Barkley, Scottie Pippen, Shawn Kemp, Detlef Schrempf and even Larry Bird — to fly in, stay out of public view during the game and then emerge to take part in the ceremony. The game itself, predictably, was also all about Nowitzki, with teammates, particularly the league’s rookie of the year favorite, Luka Doncic, feeding him incessantly as fans bayed at him to shoot at every opportunity. Before tipoff, Nowitzki jokingly asked a team staffer to look up how many shots Kobe Bryant took on the way to scoring 60 points in Bryant’s farewell game in April 2016. Informed that Bryant hoisted 50 shots that night, Nowitzki conceded that he very likely wouldn’t reach that territory, but promised to “let it fly.” He wound up taking Dallas’s first eight shots, scored 19 points in the first half and finished with 30 points on 11-for-31 shooting to match what his longtime rival Dwyane Wade of the Miami Heat managed in Wade’s final home game before retirement Tuesday night. The Suns’ Jamal Crawford, at 39, remarkably countered with 51 points, making Crawford the first player in league history to crack the 50-point mark with four different teams. The spotlight, though, never left Nowitzki, who revealed at a news conference after the game that he had decided in recent days that his surgically repaired left foot could not sustain a 22nd season. “I would love to be there for K.P. and Luka and all these young guys and have fun with them and mentor them as much as I can,” Nowitzki said, referring to Dallas’s embryonic star duo of Kristaps Porzingis and Doncic. “But it just doesn’t make any sense anymore physically. I think mentally I could still do it — I can always push myself to work out hard — but physically the foot is just not quite there.” Said Doncic, whose 21 points, 16 rebounds and 11 assists were overshadowed, like Crawford’s scoring outburst, by the Nowitzki party, “I was emotional, and the whole team was emotional, so imagine him.” Nowitzki acknowledged that he has been increasingly weepy over the past week, as the end of the regular season for the lottery-bound Mavericks — and a decision he could no longer delay — drew near. But he was openly giddy when he spoke of the former stars who shared in Tuesday’s festivities, proclaiming it an “amazing” evening. “They did this right,” he said. Asked if he was bothered at all that one more road game remained on Dallas’s schedule, as opposed to closing out the regular season at home, Nowitzki scoffed at the idea that the league’s schedule-makers had wronged him. “I’m totally fine with it,” he said. “The N.B.A. can’t keep up with the plans of a million players. They didn’t know if I was going to retire this season, last season or whatever.” There was likewise no protest from Holger Geschwindner, Nowitzki’s longtime shooting coach and the former captain of West Germany’s 1972 Olympic team. Geschwindner is known in Mavericks circles for being far harder to please than his star pupil, but he embraced the storybook nature of Nowitzki’s returning to the scene of his breakthrough performance at the Hoop Summit by traveling to South Texas one last time. “I think it’s great,” Geschwindner said. “That’s where it all started.” An earlier version of this article incorrectly described Dwyane Wade’s game Tuesday night. It was his final home game in Miami before retirement, not his final game.",The New York Times
2019,"With a Patched-Up Heart, C.C. Sabathia Returns for One Final Run","When C.C. Sabathia climbs the mound at Yankee Stadium on Saturday, it will mark the first start of his 19th and final season in the major leagues. This year will be the capstone of a long road from his hometown, Vallejo, Calif. — and one that took an unexpected detour just months ago. During an off-season in which he was recovering from a planned operation on his right knee, Sabathia, 38, was suddenly faced with a more serious health scare: a nearly entirely blocked artery near his heart that required surgery to insert a stent. Professional baseball players rarely have to wrestle with their mortality — even with the occasional injury, they are at the top level of their sport because of peak physical performance. So for Sabathia, the final off-season of his career — one that has included 246 wins, 2,986 strikeouts, six All-Star appearances, a Cy Young Award and a World Series ring — was now laden with considerations about the importance of family and taking care of his body. “As a friend, it was a scary moment,” Yankees reliever Dellin Betances said of Sabathia’s heart issue. “I was praying for him throughout that process. Obviously, at that point, you just want him to be good. And thank God, he is.” Betances was with Sabathia when his heart problem first surfaced in early December. Betances, a Brooklyn native, and Sabathia, who lives in Alpine, N.J., with his wife and four children, are off-season throwing partners. One morning, Betances and Sabathia met at the workout facility where they train, Impact Zone in Norwood, N.J. After playing catch, Betances said Sabathia did not look like himself. “He just got tired a lot faster,” Betances said. Betances didn’t think much of it, however, knowing that Sabathia had been busy the previous few weeks. But later in his workout that day, Sabathia also found himself sweating more than usual after riding a stationary bicycle. “I was just trying to get through that workout, and couldn’t get through it,” he said, adding that he had been feeling a bit off for weeks. “I just didn’t feel right,” he said. “I know myself. I try to listen to my body.” So Sabathia called Dr. Paul Lee, the Yankees’ head internist at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, hoping to rule out any heart issues. He underwent a stress test. During his drive home to New Jersey from the hospital, Sabathia received a call: He needed to come back to the hospital. Recounting the visit during a January episode of his podcast R2C2, Sabathia said he was scared upon learning of a 90 percent blockage found in the widowmaker artery, an ominous nickname for the left anterior descending artery, a critical blood vessel leading into the heart. Doctors performed an angioplasty on Dec. 11, inserting a stent into Sabathia’s artery to allow the passage of blood to his heart. Sabathia returned quickly to his normal day-to-day activities at home, which he said helped ease his concerns following a jarring experience. “That was good in the sense of trying to wrap my mind around what just happened with my family,” he said. Sabathia admitted on his podcast that he could not think about baseball in the first few days after the angioplasty. Instead, he thought about Chris Bosh, the Miami Heat star who was forced into early retirement because of repeated blood clots. According to Dr. Pedro Moreno, a cardiologist at Mount Sinai St. Luke’s who was not involved in Sabathia’s treatment, there was little reason for Sabathia to be concerned about pitching after having the stent inserted — a procedure performed on hundreds of thousands of patients in the U.S. every year. “I’ve been performing angioplasties and stents for the past 25 years,” said Dr. Moreno said, “So I can tell you that an athlete that goes through an angioplasty — a single vessel angioplasty, uncomplicated with no heart attack and normal ventricular function — could easily go back to his work as an athlete at the right time with the proper recovery.” Sabathia’s own manager, Aaron Boone, a former infielder, returned from open-heart surgery in 2009 to play the 10 final games of his career with the Houston Astros. Doug Brocail, a former relief pitcher, recovered from two angioplasties to play four more major league seasons. Jeff Green, a basketball player, is on his seventh season since his open-heart surgery. The Yankees have taken precautions with Sabathia. General Manager Brian Cashman said during spring training that Sabathia had received extensive medical tests and hurdles to clear, including follow-up stress tests, in order to return to play. That does not mean Sabathia is free of all heart worries in the future. His family has a history of heart issues: His cousin, Demetrius Davis, died of heart disease in 2012 at 45. Sabathia said doctors told him this winter that history highly increased his own odds of heart trouble. That he had this surgery in his 30s, Dr. Moreno said, raises questions about premature heart disease and other contributing factors such as cholesterol levels, stress and weight. Sabathia weighed more than 300 pounds for most of his career and, even though he had already resolved to lose weight by then, the loss of his cousin opened his eyes. So Sabathia shed nearly 25 pounds off his 6-feet-6-inch frame. But that led to a drop in velocity and two of his worst seasons, in 2013 and 2014, a drop-off Sabathia attributed in part to the fact that he had drastically dropped so much weight. Sabathia eventually returned to 300 pounds with better eating, incorporated a cut fastball into his repertoire as his velocity diminished, and evolved into a serviceable back-of-the-rotation pitcher. He had a 3.65 E.R.A. over 153 innings last season and re-signed for $8 million in November with the Yankees, the only team he wanted to return to. After he is done playing, Sabathia said, he plans to lose more weight. For now, he said doctors told him to keep watching his diet, which changed several years ago anyway, and continue avoiding alcohol. (Sabathia skipped the 2015 playoffs to enter an alcohol rehabilitation clinic.) “They told me whatever I was doing was on the right track,” said Sabathia, who reported to spring training five pounds lighter than his listed weight of 300 from last season. “It’s not much change I need to make.” As he built up from an off-season slowed by two operations, Sabathia said in spring training that he had no concerns about his heart’s ability to handle the strain of pitching. He also said then that he was using blood thinners “for a little while” under doctor’s supervision. He made his final rehabilitation start on Sundayin Tampa for a Yankees’ minor league team, his five-game suspension stemming from an episode in which he threw at a batter last fall out of the way. “I feel good doing everything: playing catch, running, doing all my stuff,” he said during spring training. “So I’m excited.” Even before his heart scare, Sabathia had already decided to retire at the end of this season. He had been thinking about it since last season, he said, because of the condition of his brace-supported right knee and his desire to spend more time with his children. The stent surgery reminded Sabathia about the importance of family and health. He wants to still have a good quality of life beyond this season to enjoy the time with his children — “and my grandkids,” he said. An earlier version of this article misstated the year in which Aaron Boone had open-heart surgery. It was in 2009, not 2003.",The New York Times
2019,"With a Rebel Yell, Molly Shannon Claims Collusion","A Word With Love did not come easy for Molly Shannon and Emily Dickinson. “In all honesty,” said Shannon, “I had the image of her that was presented to the public” — an apparition in white, shuttered in her bedroom in 19th-century Amherst, Mass., and loath to share her talents with the world. “She sounded so dark and dreary.” Then she was offered the lead in “Wild Nights With Emily,” and suddenly her passions flared. Written and directed by Madeleine Olnek, the dramatic comedy presents Dickinson as a lesbian who minced no words expressing her desire for her sister-in-law, Susan Gilbert Dickinson. And who desperately longed to see her nearly 1,800 poems in print, stymied by men at every step. “It’s like, wow, we were fed a story about a spinster recluse who apparently didn’t want to be published and was rocking in her chair, peeking out her window at funerals, when really it’s the opposite,” Shannon said. “She’s a trailblazer rebel artist who pushed the envelope with a poetic form.” Shannon is something of a rebel herself. From 1995 to 2001 on “Saturday Night Live,” she rivaled the physical humor — and influence — of her male co-stars with characters like Mary Katherine Gallagher, a Catholic schoolgirl with superstar dreams, and Sally O’Malley, a high-kicking 50-year-old dancer (impersonated by Hugh Jackman on Twitter in October when he hit the milestone birthday). In 2017, she won an Independent Spirit Award as a dying mother in Chris Kelly’s “Other People” — then recently joined him and Sarah Schneider, former “S.N.L.” co-head writers, to play the momager of a Bieber-esque pop star in Comedy Central’s “The Other Two.” And later this year she’ll return as Diane, the high-strung confidante of Sarah Jessica Parker’s uncoupled Frances, in HBO’s “Divorce.” On a call from Tokyo, where Shannon, 54, and her husband, the painter Fritz Chesnut, were spending spring break with their teenagers, Stella and Nolan, she spoke about Emily Dickinson as an unlikely L.G.B.T.Q. hero and the collusion that tried to silence her. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. Madeleine has said that casting you was extremely important to her — that with Emily Dickinson she knew that she finally had a part worthy of your stature. Madeleine and I met at N.Y.U. drama school. She directed this show called “The Follies,” which was scripted comedy in a black box theater at midnight, and Adam Sandler was in it and we would do impersonations. I created the character of Mary Katherine Gallagher in that show, so early on I just thought Madeleine was amazing. And she knows how hard I struggled to make it in comedy, so I think that’s why she thought I would be great to play Emily Dickinson. After Emily’s death, Susan’s name was erased from their correspondence. How did their relationship come to light? Through spectrographic technology, we were able to examine erasures in Emily’s letters. And I think the presence of shame around the feelings that Emily expressed in her letters of love would not just be there in a friendship. This was Puritan New England, where there was no way that they could talk about this. We have this story that she wanted her poems burned upon death when in reality she’s an L.G.B.T.Q. hero. She’s a model for new wave feminism, which talks about equality for all. [Screams] It makes me want to start a riot. The poems as you read them in the movie feel fresh. You’re understanding that she’s writing about her romantic life, which she was scared about initially when she was younger because she’s writing erotic poems about a woman she loves. When you read them with that lens, you are hearing them differently. I think [her editors] were worried when she became so successful after her death that if the reading public found out that she was in love with a woman it might not be as interested in her. So there was collusion. Emily got a lot of pushback from male mentors and editors, who seemed not quite to understand her writing. Have you experienced the same? When I did first start “Saturday Night Live,” I was trying to get Mary Katherine Gallagher on television. I had done the character in my stage show for years and I knew — this works. But I went to different writers — men — and I said, “I have this character,” and I wrote up a sketch and — I don’t want to say who it was — people would look at it on paper and go, “That will never work.” I’d use my frustration and anger to fuel me forward. And then finally I did go to one guy, Steve Koren, who said, “O.K., tell me what you do.” He basically typed up a version that I did in my stage show and that was the first sketch. I remember I was like, “I’m going to be physical, I want to be like those boys, I want to be like Chris Farley and I’m going to fall into chairs and I’m going to make my heart bleed and make them understand this.” And when [the sketch] got on the air it was huge. And I was like, Yes! “The Other Two” has an “S.N.L.” pedigree, with Chris Kelly and Sarah Schneider as the creators and Lorne Michaels as an executive producer. Is that why you signed on? I’m very close to Lorne. He is truly the greatest, and he completely changed my life. And Chris Kelly is very special, and because we did “Other People” together, I just jumped at the chance to get to work with Chris again and to meet Sarah Schneider, his partner. So when I read the pilot, I had a feeling about it. They’re one-of-a-kind writers. What drew you to play the character Pat Dubek? I love that she is having a Chapter 2. It was revealed that her husband was a terrible alcoholic who died with his penis frozen to the roof of the house. She moved to New York City with her son, so she’s experiencing a whole new kind of reinvention. She’s going to get her own talk show. She’s not cynical at all about showbiz, so I relate to that part of her and her family values. Mary Katherine Gallagher had that school uniform. Pat has that funky hair. Do you come up with your own costumes? [With Mary Katherine Gallagher] Lorne came right into the dressing room and he goes, “I think you should make the skirt a little shorter because that will be funny when you lift your leg up to sing a song and it will show your underwear.” [With Pat] they said, “We want a Kate Gosselin kind of Ohio-comes-to-New York City look with a certain type of coloring that would be done in the Midwest but maybe not as cool as somebody who’s lived in New York City for a while.” I love changing myself. As a matter of fact, I always felt less self-conscious when I was playing a character. I just look at the character and don’t see myself in it. Before you go, can you recite your favorite Emily Dickinson poem? You must let mego first, Sue, becauseI live in the Seaalways and knowthe Road —I would have drownedtwice to saveyou sinking, dear,If I could onlyhave covered yourEyes so you would’nthave seen the Water — Oh, I love it. Isn’t it gorgeous? Ahh, I can’t get enough.",The New York Times
2019,"With a Roster Full of Holes, the Jets Tried to Place Their Draft Bets Wisely","FLORHAM PARK, N.J. — This was the fun part for Mike Maccagnan. The Jets’ general manager sat at a table on Thursday flanked by two of the team’s new Gotham Green helmets happily sharing a story about a pre-draft meeting with Quinnen Williams, the team’s first-round draft choice. Williams, who went to the Jets with the third overall pick, had watched film with the team’s coaches during the visit. The 303-pound defensive tackle, who’d taken care of three siblings after his mother died when he was 12, impressed the coaches with his insight, proving to be a student of the game. “He’s a guy we feel very good about,” Maccagnan said, “and he’s just scratching his potential.” One night later, Maccagnan took a seat at the same table, still adorned with the two helmets, and had considerably less fun talking about his next draft choice, Jachai Polite, a linebacker from Florida. Polite, who on talent might have been a first-round pick, knocked himself down many lists with an awful showing at the league’s scouting combine in March. Maccagnan found himself defending using a third-round pick on a player who had been labeled lazy, difficult to coach and disruptive in the locker room. Polite had added to the knocks against him by grumbling that the Green Bay Packers “bashed” him in a pre-draft interview. “We know some of the risk in him,” Maccagnan said of Polite. “We also think there are some very good qualities about him.” In the world of the N.F.L. draft, a player with certain limitations is much more common than one with a résumé as spotless as Williams’s, and figuring out which ones can overcome those limitations is a key part of an N.F.L. executive’s job. In addition to Williams and Polite, the Jets added four more players in the draft, two of whom are defensive players — Minnesota linebacker Blake Cashman and Rutgers cornerback Blessuan Austin — who have rebounded from surgery. Though the Jets could still use a center, Maccagnan used the draft to continue fortifying the team’s defense, which ranked 25th in the N.F.L. last year in terms of yards allowed and 29th in points allowed. The Jets went 4-12, missing the playoffs for the eighth consecutive season, and Todd Bowles was fired as their coach. The Jets had already addressed some of the team’s offensive deficiencies by signing Le’Veon Bell, a three-time All-Pro at running back. Many expected the team to use the No. 3 pick on an edge rusher, as that was a distinct position of need, but Williams proved to be too enticing. Williams said Thursday that his mother, Marquischa, “drove me a lot — just to be humble and disciplined and not get complacent. Just thinking about my mom staring down at me is an amazing thing.” While Williams is expected by many to thrive, with his game having been compared favorably to the Hall of Famer “Mean” Joe Greene, Polite offers the potential of a somewhat richer reward, simply because so many analysts had written him off. In 2018, Polite — whose first name is pronounced juh-KAI — forced six fumbles and had 11 sacks and 17½ tackles for loss after being benched for the first series of the season opener because he “failed to meet the Gator standard.” Polite did himself no favors at the combine, openly complaining about questions from the Packers’ staff who had used film to point out some of his bad plays in college. “I regret saying any team was bashing me because they weren’t really bashing me,” Polite said in a conference call with reporters Friday night. “They were just trying to interview a guy to come play for their team. They wanted to see how I was, how I react. It was all my fault, and I learned from it.” Polite then said, “I have a lot of people to prove wrong. Growing up, there were always a lot of negative things said about me, and I just worked my whole life to not let them get in the way of my work.” Even after the combine, Maccagnan decided to bring Polite to the Jets’ facility for a closer and more relaxed look. Interviews between draft prospects and N.F.L. teams at the combine are only 15 minutes long, and as Maccagnan said, “for a lot of those guys it’s a fairly high-stress environment.” Maccagnan said he thought the Jets had some “character guys” who could help Polite make the transition to the N.F.L. But considering Polite’s strong play against top-caliber opposition in the Southeastern Conference, the Jets know he is capable of handling the on-field aspects of the game. The Jets rounded out their draft with Chuma Edoga, an offensive tackle from Southern California; Trevon Wesco, a tight end from West Virginia; Cashman; and Austin. Each comes with some baggage while also offering some potential. Austin, who played sparingly over the last two years after surgery on his left knee, was perfectly happy going in the sixth round. “I’m just thankful, and I’m actually humble, too,” Austin said. “But at the same time I have a burning fire in my chest right now that I don’t think can be put out as long as I’m playing this game.” Even with six new draft picks and a few new free agents, Maccagnan acknowledged on Saturday that when you work to reshape the roster of a struggling team, there is no time to sit back and relax. “You’re never really done,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,"With the Birth of My Son, I Stopped Hiding","Modern Love Fearing judgment of her interracial relationship and mixed-race child, a woman keeps both from her family. Until she doesn’t. My son, Roman, turned to me from his book and said, “Mom, can you throw me a blanket? This is my favorite part in the book and I don’t want to stop.” When I look at my son, I see myself: the inability to tolerate pain, even from the smallest of physical hurts; the deep fear of the dark, of the deserted street, of that strange insect on the ceiling; and the intense, abiding love of reading. Most of all, I see myself in his face, the eyes like mine, left slightly larger than right, especially when he’s tired, and the toothy smile that breaks through the most serious situations. All of it: me. Yet when he and I walk along the street, so many people feel the need to tell me how much he isn’t like me, how incredibly unalike we appear, how he looks just like his father. They say it with such authority. [The topics new parents are talking about. Evidence-based guidance. Personal stories that matter. Sign up now to get NYT Parenting in your inbox every week.] My son is biracial. His father is Haitian-American and I’m of Chinese descent; Often, I have to work to prove that my son is mine. On our daily subway commute to school, at least one person will look at me, then at him, and then back again. I am forced to see what they see: His skin is darker and his hair wavy, while I’m fair, prone to freckling, with hair that won’t hold a curl. If their eyes happen to meet mine, they’ll catch me glaring, holding them accountable for what I deem to be their silent judgment. Perhaps I’m too hard on these strangers who wonder about the people before them, a mother and child reflected in a train window, one holding the other’s hand. But my own judgment has roots, too, and each time I face a stranger’s gaze, I’m forced to confront them anew. Ten years ago, I stood alone at a Chinese banquet after my stepfather’s funeral, deciding where to sit. I was seven months pregnant with my son and hadn’t told my family, but I knew that my expanding waistline would elicit questions. After contemplating which relatives would be least likely to grill me, I wound up sitting with my mother, who offered me her silence. I was unmarried and close to giving birth: the worst outcome in Chinese tradition. I knew my mother was disappointed, but I felt elated. I had dreamed of my son for years, envisioned the joy his existence would offer. I imagined the weight of his milk-scented body on my chest, him sleeping there as we breathed, exhausted but so in love. At the banquet, I ate soup without tasting it, swirling bits of scallion in the broth. My partner, Claude, was waiting at home, cleaning the apartment in preparation for the months ahead. He offered to accompany me to the funeral, but I told him I wanted to go on my own to avoid questions about us, though I didn’t explain what that meant. His parents, who had emigrated from Haiti, taught him to rise above conflict with enviable grace. When I met Claude, the prospect of being in an interracial marriage with mixed-race children wasn’t something we discussed. I lived as I wanted, dated whom I wanted and followed my heart. I didn’t, however, assume my heart would lead me to question the depths of race and my own biases, or to ask how whiteness shaped my upbringing, and how that seeped into a struggle over who I was or chose to start a life with. Before I left for the services, Claude asked me one last time if he should come. I sheepishly shook my head and closed the door. On the way to the subway, I thought about the man we were to bury. Growing up, we called my stepfather “Archie Bunker,” the 1970s sitcom patriarch who spewed racist views but was, at his core, softhearted. Archie was a prime example of white audacity, a posture embraced by my stepfather, who emigrated from Hong Kong knowing little English. His bigotry seemed to spring from self-doubt about his own place in a country that prided itself on diversity even if the imbalance of nearly every power dynamic suggested otherwise. My stepfather lived by stereotypes and assumptions and made his views known about classes or races that weren’t his own. At dinner, he and I would go head-to-head as I questioned his intolerance until my mother told me to hush. I gave in because it was Asian tradition to obey my elders no matter the personal cost. At my stepfather’s funeral, I bowed my head, weary with the memory of him. I didn’t bring my partner as some oddball way of honoring a man who had soiled my ideas of love. Although his racism didn’t permeate my thinking, it had caused me to act in a way that countered the love I felt growing inside me. I could imagine the disapproval he would have shown for my future husband and son simply because they are black. The thought was unbearable. Determined not to let a deceased man’s ideas control my life, I decided I would gather my immediate family to be open with them about my love and my pregnancy. A week later, on a summer day, we all came together for a picnic, my belly heavy, my partner and family exchanging awkward greetings under blooming red maple trees. I watched as my brother threw a football to Claude and they tossed it back and forth, not like siblings but ones who may be one day. Each small gesture was magnified. I touched my belly, assuring my son that I would defend his presence and that I was sorry for having hidden him from anyone. His life, then and now, prompts me to answer the question, “What do you believe?” Nearly 10 years later, leaning next to him as he read his book, I realized he’s large enough to hold me. Lately, his obsession with books has paved the way to writing. His favored genre is science fiction, graphic novels that contemplate the world’s end, filled with five-horned demons and dragons that drop from the sky. In one of his illustrated frames, there is a lone dark figure standing in a throng of white ones. Below it he had written, “Who am I?” His words stopped me. Was he speaking for a fictional character in one of his apocalyptic scenarios, or for his present self? “What do you mean by this line?” I asked. He shrugged. “It’s the story of a boy who goes into a room, peels off his skin, comes out into the world and he wants you to guess who he is.” I carried Roman’s words with me for days, wondering if I had done enough to help him to understand his selfhood. My thoughts moved beyond my stepfather to my ancestors who I believed took part in building a world that could have possibly rejected the person I love most. I challenge many of the traditions I was born into; I reject the racism I perceived growing up. And yet within my family, aspects of love and how it is revealed and accepted have changed. As I watch Roman grow, his questions become my questions. As he claims his identity, I feel bound to claim mine as well. When his teacher scolds him too harshly, I ask myself if it’s because of his skin color. If he is left out of a play date, I wonder if it’s because he is black. Every thought and action I now contemplate with an interior dialogue about race. I am his mirror; he is mine. It’s a human process, with answers not definitive but ongoing. Each day he grows stronger, more able to face the world racing toward him. Perhaps I can say the same for myself. We grow together, loving within the struggle of our bond. In the moments before my son’s birth, Claude sat with me, stroking my arm. With the most tenderhearted touch, he told me everything would be O.K., and I fell asleep during labor believing him. For once, I was completely relaxed. Roman would be here soon. How I waited for him. I wrestled with my ancestors to let me claim hold of my life. As if I were a character in one of his sci-fi stories, I dove into the muck in the minutes before his birth. It seemed as if there were serpents, an ocean and a terribly gray sky that held me underwater with its furious hand. Begging them to let me return to the real world again, I fought to be with my son. I could almost see him now, all the colors of my longing inside of him, the universe sweating to move him from an idea to being, the both of us born from the urgency of belief. He arrived as a boy, a very real boy, placed right there beside me. Alive. Tina Chang, Brooklyn’s poet laureate, is the author of the forthcoming collection, “Hybrida,” appearing in May from W.W.

2019,"With ‘Unplanned,’ Abortion Opponents Turn Toward Hollywood","CLIFTON, N.J. — It was a rare packed house for a weeknight in the suburbs, and when the movie was over, the sold-out crowd of about 100 last Wednesday spilled haltingly into the light. A few — a gaggle of nuns in their habits, at least one collared priest — wore their dispositions on their sleeves. Others communicated in muted gestures, dabbed at tears, or lingered for long stretches in the popcorn-strewn vestibule at the AMC multiplex here, as if still processing the deliberately provocative movie they had just seen. Since March 29, similar scenes have played out across the country as faith-based groups and many others have gathered en masse to see “Unplanned,” a new movie that paints a scathing portrait of abortion rights in general, and Planned Parenthood in particular. Molly Livingstone, a social media marketer in Dallas, organized about 170 people from her church to attend an early screening of the movie. It so struck her, she said, that she was moved to volunteer for an anti-abortion pregnancy center. In Davenport, Iowa, the St. Thomas Aquinas Guild of the Quad Cities, an anti-abortion medical organization, raised $4,000 to buy tickets for members and civic leaders. Maggie Schoonmaker, a fertility educator who was involved in the effort, said she felt compelled to spread the word about the film. “The movie provides a way for people to learn the truth about abortion and reproductive rights outside of a church,” she said. “Unplanned” has banked on its ability to draw such motivated crowds, despite what the filmmakers — Christian anti-abortion advocates hoping to make a dent in Hollywood — described in interviews as a torrent of adversity. First, they said, came the denial letters from companies holding the rights to songs they had hoped to include on the film’s soundtrack. Then it was an R rating from the Motion Picture Association of America, normally a kiss of death in evangelical, Mormon and other religious communities. Television networks, too, rejected the film’s trailer as too political to touch; the official “Unplanned” Twitter account, erroneously linked to online trolls, was temporarily suspended on opening weekend; and the star of the movie, Ashley Bratcher, has struggled to book TV interviews outside Fox News and the Christian Broadcasting Network. Of course, no film is entitled to media exposure. And in each of the above cases, the companies and networks denied singling out “Unplanned.” But the belief among anti-abortion communities that powerful forces have arrayed against the film has kindled long-smoldering claims of liberal and anti-religious bias in the media and Silicon Valley. And it has animated high-profile conservatives — including Vice President Mike Pence, Senator Ted Cruz and Donald Trump Jr. — who have risen to the movie’s defense, seeking to turn it into the latest battlefront of the culture wars. For now, the writer-directors Chuck Konzelman and Cary Solomon can console themselves with a hit. “Unplanned” exceeded box-office expectations on its opening weekend, earning more than $6 million — and recouping its budget — from just 1,100 screens. It expanded that figure this weekend, earning $3.2 million after spreading to 500 more theaters. The movie comes as conservatives are feeling emboldened to roll back abortion rights, including potentially overturning the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, after the confirmation last October of Justice Brett Kavanaugh solidified their majority on the Supreme Court. Another anti-abortion film, “Roe v. Wade,” starring the conservative actor Jon Voight, was promoted at the annual March for Life rally in Washington, D.C., in January, but has yet to announce a distribution partner or release date. Solomon said he hoped the film would help trigger “the cultural moment that overturns Roe v. Wade.” “That would absolutely be a victory for us,” he added. The success of “Unplanned” follows that of other faith-based films, such as last year’s “I Can Only Imagine” and an earlier Konzelman and Solomon effort, “God’s Not Dead,” which have demonstrated the box-office power of a passionate demographic that often says it is overlooked, if not persecuted, by left-leaning Hollywood. The filmmakers said they want the same treatment as that given to films favored by the abortion-rights movement, such as “RBG,” the documentary about Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Konzelman also referenced an announced film that will star Sandra Bullock as the former Texas state senator Wendy Davis, who has campaigned against restrictions on abortion rights. “Would any of the places that turned us down for advertising turn down Sony, or Paramount, or Universal with a Sandra Bullock movie from the other side?” he asked. “I dare say not.” “Unplanned” is based on the memoir of the same name by Abby Johnson, a former director of a Planned Parenthood clinic in Bryan, Tex., who became a celebrity of the anti-abortion movement after what she said was a crisis of conscience. The film dramatizes her conversion narrative and includes three unflinching portrayals of abortions, the first and most explicit of which occurs in the first 10 minutes. (Reports in Texas Monthly and Salon have raised questions about the details of Johnson’s story, and Planned Parenthood said in a statement that the movie adaptation “promotes many falsehoods.”) The abortion scenes earned the movie its R rating, for “some disturbing/bloody images,” which meant that its trailers couldn’t run in front of non-R-rated films, or even on some Christian radio stations, such as K-Love and Air1. But the filmmakers said they weren’t willing to compromise on the graphic portrayals, which are central to the film’s appeal to viewers as a self-proclaimed exposé that promises hard truths. In that first scene, teased in the trailer and on posters as “the moment that changed everything,” Abby, played by Bratcher, witnesses an ultrasound-guided termination of a pregnancy at 13 weeks. The ultrasound, as depicted onscreen, shows a fetus with a discernible head, torso and limbs frantically squirming away from a doctor’s probe — an action that Abby later describes as “twisting and fighting for its life” — before being liquefied by suction. Given a description of this scene, Jennifer Villavicencio, a fellow with the nonpartisan American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists who performs ultrasound-guided abortions but has not seen the film, said that while an ultrasound of a 13-week-old fetus may show a visible head and body, the notion that it would be “fighting for its life” is misleading. “If you watch an ultrasound, certainly there is movement, but it’s not kicking its legs or recoiling,” said Villavicencio. She noted broad scientific consensus that fetuses cannot experience pain, and therefore would not recoil from it, until well after 13 weeks. “There is no neurological capability for awareness of danger — that part of the brain is simply not there yet,” she said. Konzelman and Solomon defended the scene as faithful to Johnson’s personal account and said it had been vetted by Anthony Levatino, a retired obstetrician-gynecologist and longtime anti-abortion activist, who also plays the doctor in the scene. Ultimately, “Unplanned” may not need scientific consensus to be effective with its most critical base of support. At the sold-out AMC theater in New Jersey, several attendees, who identified as being against abortion rights, said they were moved by a film that addressed what they said was the deeper truth of a subject few are willing to face head on. “This movie tells the truth, and a lot of times we don’t get an opportunity to see that,” said Cheryl A. Riley, director of the Respect Life office for the Archdiocese of Newark, who organized the viewing and works with women who have had abortions. Describing herself, like Johnson, as formerly in favor of abortion rights, Riley choked up while recalling her own experience terminating a pregnancy at 19: “I know that story, and I know that pain.”",The New York Times
2019,Woman From China Carrying Malware Arrested After Entering Mar-a-Lago,"A 32-year-old woman from China carrying four cellphones and a thumb drive infected with malware gained access to Mar-a-Lago during President Trump’s visit to the Florida resort over the weekend, federal court records show. The woman, identified as Yujing Zhang, had arrived at the Palm Beach resort and showed two Chinese passports when she sought to be admitted, saying she wanted to use the pool. She was allowed to enter by Secret Service agents stationed outside the resort after the Mar-a-Lago security manager on duty verified that her last name matched the surname of a member of the club, according to a complaint filed in Federal District Court in South Florida. When asked if she was the member’s daughter, “she did not give a definitive answer,” the complaint said. It said she was permitted to enter and was escorted to the front desk in a valet-driven golf cart. Once inside, according to the account filed with the court, the woman said she was there to attend a United Nations Chinese American Association event later in the evening. But no such event existed, according to the complaint, so the club receptionist alerted the Secret Service. Though she had initially said she had come to use the pool, she was not carrying a swimsuit, the complaint said. Ms. Zhang told the agent who questioned her on site that she was there for a “United Nations friendship event” and had arrived early to see the pool and take photos. She showed the agent an invitation to the supposed event — but it was in Chinese and no one present could read it. At that point, the Secret Service agent escorted her off the property. The agent continued to question her, and when the agent suggested that she had unlawfully gained access to the club, she became “verbally aggressive” and was detained, the complaint states. From there, she was taken to the Secret Service’s office in West Palm Beach. During the second interview, Ms. Zhang told the authorities that a Chinese friend named Charles had told her to travel from Shanghai to Palm Beach in order to attend the United Nations friendship event and said that she should try to speak with a member of the president’s family about Chinese and American foreign economic relations. The agents were unable to learn more about Charles, as Ms. Zhang told them that she had only spoken to him via the Chinese instant messaging app WeChat. When the authorities searched her belongings, they found that she was carrying four cellphones, a hard drive, a laptop and a thumb drive that was found to be infected with malware. She was arrested at that point and charged with lying to a federal agent and gaining access to a restricted area. At the time of the incident shortly after noon on Saturday, Mr. Trump was off-site, at the nearby Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. He did not return to the resort until 4 p.m. The Secret Service said in a statement that determining who gets access to Mar-a-Lago is up to the resort’s management; entering the resort does not permit access to areas used by the president, which require additional security screening, it said. It said agents do conduct a physical screening to make sure no prohibited items enter the property, and did so in the case of Ms. Zhang. “After undergoing screening at the second Secret Service checkpoint the individual, per club protocol, was immediately met by club reception,” the statement said. “The Mar-a-Lago reception staff then determined that the individual should not have been authorized access by their staff and Secret Service agents took immediate action resulting in the arrest of the individual.” Ms. Zhang’s lawyer, a federal public defender, did not respond to a request for comment, nor did the management at Mar-a-Lago. Access to Mr. Trump by Chinese nationals became an issue last month, when news media reports surfaced showing that a Chinese-American woman in Florida who once owned a chain of Asian massage parlors that had been investigated for prostitution had attended a number of events there, and had been photographed there with the president and other officials. The woman, Cindy Yang, collected contributions directed toward Mr. Trump’s campaign from her friends, family and employees, and had a website on which she advertised that she could provide access to the Trump administration. Ms. Yang had advertised an event for March 30 — the day of Ms. Zhang’s arrest — called the “International Leaders Elite Forum,” described as a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” and the first event at Mar-a-Lago with “the Chinese as the protagonist,” The Miami Herald reported. The event was later canceled. Ms. Yang worked with an event promoter named Charles Lee, who runs a group called the United Nations Chinese Friendship Association, which is similar to the name of the event that Ms. Zhang cited, the newspaper reported. The criminal complaint filed Monday did not draw any connection between Ms. Zhang and Ms. Yang or any of the Chinese-American events scheduled over the weekend. Elaborate security measures are set up around Mr. Trump’s exclusive, members-only club, which he frequently visits on weekends away from Washington. When the president is in town, roadblocks are set up in the street leading up to the resort and uniformed Secret Service agents typically establish a large security screening area across the street, with a large sign notifying visitors that they are entering a restricted area. Mar-a-Lago club members are allowed past the initial screening checkpoint and inside the protective perimeter. Security breaches surrounding American presidents have been a major issue in recent years. There have been several cases of intruders scaling the White House fence and entering the grounds. In one episode in 2014, a man carrying a knife, Omar J. Gonzalez, managed to overpower a Secret Service agent inside the North Portico entrance and run through the ceremonial East Room before he was tackled. Weeks after Mr. Trump took office, another man was able to elude multiple layers of security before being stopped near the entrance at the South Portico. In that case, Jonathan Tuan-Anh Tran, who was carrying a backpack, jumped over a fence and came within several steps of the White House while the president was inside the residence. In perhaps the most notable example, in 2009, a Virginia couple sneaked into a White House state dinner and shook hands with President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama as they stood in the receiving line. Known later as the “State Dinner crashers,” the intrusion by Michaele and Tareq Salahi prompted an internal Secret Service investigation and demands for a congressional inquiry. Security agents on several occasions in the past have had to turn away people who tried to enter the Mar-a-Lago resort, some with the apparent intention of approaching the president. In several cases, according to The South Florida Sun-Sentinel, which reviewed police incident reports, members of the public arrived and told security agents that they had arranged meetings with Mr. Trump. A 27-year-old Ohio man flew in to Palm Beach International Airport and was flagged to Secret Service agents in April 2018 after he told people he was planning to smoke marijuana with the president; a 32-year-old Georgia man wearing military-style fatigues told local sheriff’s deputies in February of that year that he had an important message “about the war” to deliver to Mr. Trump. Don Mihalek, executive vice president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, which represents the Secret Service, said the episode showed how much the Secret Service relied on the security at Mar-a-Lago. He said the fact that Secret Service agents apparently relied on the determination by a Mar-a-Lago security agent that Ms. Zhang was related to a member of the club — simply because she shared the member’s last name — was problematic. “It’s a hard position for Secret Service to be in to potentially deny a million-dollar committee member,” Mr. Mihalek said. “It puts Secret Service in a very difficult position because we don’t know who are members and who aren’t.” “You’re depending on them to say this is an employee and this isn’t an employee. We work off a list of names,” he said. “Our priority is, are you coming in with explosives or not.” Ms. Zhang, who court records say was born in 1986, appeared in court in Palm Beach on Monday, and a bond hearing was scheduled for next week, court records show.",The New York Times
2019,"Lyra McKee, Northern Ireland Journalist, Is Killed in ‘Terrorist Incident,’ Police Say","DUBLIN — The police in Northern Ireland on Friday blamed militants opposed to British rule there for the killing of a young journalist who was covering a night of violent unrest in Londonderry. “We are treating this as a terrorist incident, and we have launched a murder inquiry,” Mark Hamilton, an assistant chief constable, said of the fatal shooting of the journalist, Lyra McKee, 29. A deputy chief constable, Stephen Martin, told reporters that the police were searching for several suspects. “There was certainly more than one person involved,” he said, adding: “This was not done to further any cause. This will have achieved nothing other than to plunge a family into grief.” [Update: 2 men arrested in killing of journalist Lyra McKee.] Mr. Hamilton said the police were attributing the violence and the killing to the New Irish Republican Army, a militant republican group formed several years ago from the merger of several splinter groups. It is not affiliated in any way with the Provisional Irish Republican Army, which renounced violence in 2005. Many people in Northern Ireland, primarily Roman Catholics, consider themselves republicans, meaning that they want the region to break away from the United Kingdom and join the Republic of Ireland. But the number who pursue that end through violence is relatively small. The violence took place in Creggan, a heavily Catholic area of Londonderry — a city that Catholics and republicans generally call Derry — after the police started carrying out searches in the area because of concerns that militant republicans were storing firearms and explosives there in preparation for an attack to commemorate the 1916 rebellion in Dublin known as the Easter Rising. The searches were followed by a riot in which gasoline bombs were thrown — more than 50, according to the police — and then the attack that killed Ms. McKee. Mr. Hamilton, the assistant chief constable, said she was hit by a gunman firing toward the police. “We saw unrest last year in the run-up to Easter and this year it’s exactly the same,” said Marisa McGlinchey, an expert on dissident republicans at Coventry University. “We’ve seen an escalation of activity coming up to Easter, and then you have the police responding with searches and arrests, which can lead to street riots.” The outburst of violence was an ominous reminder of the deadly conflict between militant groups of Catholic republicans and Protestant loyalists, who favor remaining part of Britain, that plagued Northern Ireland until a peace agreement was signed in 1998. “It’s important that we all stand together now and resist any further escalation of this,” Mr. Hamilton said. Saoradh (Irish for “Liberation”), a group linked to the New I.R.A., said in a statement that “the blame for last night lies squarely at the feet of the British crown forces, who sought to grab headlines and engineered confrontation with the community.” The group said that a “republican volunteer” had tried to defend Creggan from an attack by the police, which had prompted the riot. “Tragically a young journalist covering the events, Lyra McKee, was killed accidentally while standing behind armed crown force personnel and armored vehicles,” the statement said. Sinn Fein, the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army, and the Democratic Unionist Party condemned the killing of Ms. McKee. Sinn Fein called it an “attack on all the community.” In her last Twitter post — which was retweeted by Naomi O’Leary, a friend and fellow journalist — Ms. McKee wrote: “Derry tonight. Absolute madness.” The violence on Thursday came amid the turmoil caused by Britain’s plans to leave the European Union, a bloc that includes the Republic of Ireland. There are concerns that Britain might leave without any agreement defining its relationship to the union, leading to a “hard border” between Ireland and Northern Ireland, with barriers and checkpoints. Northern Ireland has not had a functioning government for over two years, since the collapse of a power-sharing agreement between its two main parties — one mostly Protestant, the other mainly Catholic. The Brexit border paradox and the political deadlock in Northern Ireland have, in turn, raised concerns about a resumption of violence, particularly after several packages containing explosives were found last month at the University of Glasgow and three London transport hubs, including Heathrow Airport. The authorities attributed the packages to a splinter group of the Irish Republican Army. “I don’t have any doubt that Brexit is something that is going to invigorate them and bring them out of the shadows,” said Darach MacDonald, a writer and journalist based in Londonderry. Despite the outside perception that the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement ended violence in Northern Ireland, police figures for weapons seizures, arrests, assaults and armed attacks remain high, Ms. McGlinchey said, although nothing on the scale of the 1968 to 1998 era of “the Troubles.” Mr. MacDonald also sees a cultural force at work, a perverse nostalgia for the Troubles, particularly among bored urban youths too young to have experienced them. He says that while the shots that killed McKee may have been fired by a republican militant, most of the young men rioting in the streets were most likely unaffiliated, merely participating in what has become, in many run-down areas of Northern Ireland, a sort of folk ritual. “It would be something that they would see on news reels,” he said. “A large part of the youth subculture in Derry is now a re-enactment of the past.” He added: “Part of the culture here is a nostalgia for a period when people in the outside world took heed of what happened here. There is an anger about being sidelined, and I suppose that does hanker back to a period when Derry mattered, for all the wrong reasons, but it mattered.” The apparently accidental victim of the shooting, Ms. McKee, was an investigative journalist from Belfast who was recognized by Forbes magazine in 2016 as one of its “30 Under 30 Europe” for digging “into topics that others don’t care about.” She had worked as an editor for the website Mediagazer since 2011 and had written for BuzzFeed News and Mosaic Science. “Letter to My 14-Year-Old Self,” an article she wrote about the abuse and support she received while growing up gay, was widely read online and made into a short film. Ms. McKee grew up on Cliftonville Road in Belfast, near the area that saw some of the worst violence during the Troubles. Her work often examined the legacies of that era. A local journalist, Leona O’Neill, wrote on Twitter that she was standing beside Ms. McKee on Thursday night when Ms. McKee fell. She said the police immediately put her in the back of their vehicle and took her to a hospital. In her Twitter feed, Ms. O’Neill described people throwing gasoline bombs, bricks and bottles at the police in the Creggan area. Videos showed vehicles on fire. She said people had gathered in the streets after a large number of police officers started searching a home in the area. After violence erupted, the police appealed for calm. The killing happened the same day that Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the city to show support for the peace agreement that the United States helped broker two decades ago. Ms. Pelosi said it was vital to keep a “seamless border” after Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union. Ms. McKee wrote a book, “Angels With Blue Faces,” about the 1981 murder of the Rev. Robert Bradford, a member of the British Parliament from Belfast. Last year, she signed a two-book deal with the publishing house Faber & Faber. One of those books, “The Lost Boys,” investigates the disappearances of young men in Belfast in the late 1960s and 1970s, and is scheduled for release next year.",The New York Times
2019,Woman Wakes After 27 Years Unconscious,"LONDON — When Munira Abdulla had last been fully awake, the first George Bush was America’s president and the Soviet Union was nearing its demise. It was the year the Persian Gulf war ended. In 1991, at the age of 32, Ms. Abdulla, from the oasis city of Al Ain in the United Arab Emirates, suffered injuries in a road accident that left her in a state of reduced consciousness for most of the next three decades. After 27 years, she awoke last June at a clinic near Munich, where doctors had been treating her for the complications of her long illness. “I never gave up on her, because I always had a feeling that one day she will wake up,” said Omar Webair, her 32-year-old son, who was just 4 when the accident happened. He shared his mother’s story with the Emirati news website The National on Monday. Dr. Friedemann Müller, the chief physician at the Schön Clinic, a private hospital with campuses around Germany, said that Ms. Abdulla had been in a state of minimal consciousness. He said only a handful of cases like hers, in which a patient recovered after such a long period, had been recorded. Patients in a state of reduced consciousness are usually classified into three categories. In a full coma, the patient shows no signs of being awake, with eyes closed and unresponsive to the environment. A persistent vegetative state includes those who seem awake but show no signs of awareness, while a minimally conscious state can include periods in which some response — such as moving a finger when asked — can be noted. Colloquially, all three categories are often described as comas. Signs that Ms. Abdulla was recovering started to emerge last year when she began saying her son’s name. A couple of weeks later, she started repeating verses from the Quran that she had learned decades ago. “We didn’t believe it at first,” Dr. Müller said. “But eventually it became very clear that she was saying her son’s name.” Dr. Müller said he had not expected such a recovery from Ms. Abdulla. She had been at the German clinic for treatment for seizures and contorted muscles that made her body hard to handle and that kept her from being able to sit in a wheelchair safely. Part of the treatment was to install a device that delivered medication directly into her spine, a factor that Dr. Müller said could have brought on her recovery. Only a handful of people are known to have made similar recoveries. Terry Wallis, from Arkansas, was 19 when he skidded off a bridge in a pickup truck. He uttered his first word since the accident, “Mom,” nearly two decades later, in 2003. His recovery was so unusual that scientists used it as an opportunity to study how the brain functions and to help determine which patients with severe brain damage had the best chance of recovering. The issue is often of vital importance. In a landmark ruling in 1976, the New Jersey Supreme Court found unanimously that the father of Karen Ann Quinlan had the right to decide to forgo life-sustaining treatment on her behalf. Ms. Quinlan died in 1985, a decade after she slipped into a coma. The case of Terri Schiavo, a Florida woman who spent 15 years in a persistent vegetative state before her feeding tube was removed in 2005, stoked further debate in the United States and beyond about a person’s right to live or die. With medical care, some can stay in a state of reduced consciousness for decades. Aruna Shanbaug, an Indian nurse, spent more than 40 years in such a condition until her death at age 66 in 2015. She had been left in a permanent vegetative state after being strangled with a metal chain during a sexual assault. Mr. Webair, Ms. Abdulla’s son, said he had avoided serious injury in the accident in 1991 because his mother had seen the crash coming and managed to embrace him before the impact. “To me she was like gold; the more time passed by, the more valuable she became,” he told The National. According to the newspaper, Ms. Abdulla, who has returned to the United Arab Emirates, is being treated at a hospital in Abu Dhabi.",The New York Times
2019,Womansplaining the Pay Gap,"in her words I asked the gender editor of The Times to walk us through the details. You’re reading In Her Words, where women rule the headlines. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox. Let me know what you think at dearmaya@nytimes.com. “Unequal pay hurts women. It hurts their families. And it hurts us all.” — Lilly Ledbetter, whose lawsuit against the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. led to the signing of the Fair Pay Act of 2009 If I had a nickel for every time someone told me, “The gender pay gap is a myth,” I may have made back the income I’ve lost over the years for being a woman. It’s not a myth. And yet the nuance required to explain what perpetuates these misconceptions is not the stuff made for 280-character sound bites on social media, where sweeping dismissals (Men work longer hours! Men pick higher-paying careers!) can quickly snowball. Today is Equal Pay Day — created in 1996 by the National Committee on Pay Equity, a coalition of women’s, civil rights and labor groups, to draw attention to the gender pay disparities in the United States. The day marks about how long into 2019 American women would have to work to earn what their male counterparts already earned last year. (Though race factors into this as well. More on that below.) I asked Jessica Bennett, The Times’s gender editor and author of the book “Feminist Fight Club,” to demystify some commonly misunderstood aspects of the pay gap. Here’s what she said. ______ The pay gap doesn’t account for women’s job choice. Bennett: While it’s true that women are more likely to work in lower-paying fields like education and health care, the pay gap also persists within those fields. As our colleague Claire Cain-Miller has written, female food preparers earn 87 percent of what male food preparers earn, according to data from Claudia Goldin, a Harvard economist. (Female surgeons earn 71 percent of what male surgeons earn in the same specialties, Professor Goldin found.) The gap persists because women take time off to have children. Bennett: Women’s compensation does often suffer when they return to work after having children. But even in their first year out of college, childless women earn 93 percent of what their male peers do, even if they had a similar G.P.A. and were working in the same fields. Women get paid less because they have less education. Bennett: Actually, more women than men have earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees since the 1980s. And for the past 10 or so years, they have also earned more doctoral degrees. Women don’t get paid well because they don’t negotiate well. Bennett: That has long been a factor in the pay gap. But a 2018 study, published in the Harvard Business Review found that — perhaps as a result of all that talk about women not negotiating — women are asking for raises as often as men, though they are less likely to get them. Maybe in part because when women ask, they can be perceived as “demanding.” (Remember that essay that Jennifer Lawrence wrote, about not getting paid as much as her male co-stars? She said she “didn’t want to seem ‘difficult’ or ‘spoiled.’”) O.K., but we’re on our way to closing the gap, right?Bennett: If you consider the year 2059 soon, sure. That’s how long it will take in the United States, according to the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, at the current pace of change. ______ Here are some more figures you might want to know: 80 Cents That’s the median amount that American women who work full time, year-round in the United States are paid for every dollar their male counterparts earn, according to U.S. census data analyzed by the American Association of University Women. When broken down by race and compared with white men, the numbers are: 85 cents: The amount for Asian women 77 cents: The amount for white women 61 cents: The amount for black women 58 cents: The amount for Native American women 53 cents: The amount for Hispanic women $10,169 That’s how much the pay gap costs American women each year, according to the National Women’s Law Center, which based the figure on the difference between women’s and men’s median annual earnings for full-time, year-round workers. Over the course of a 40-year career, that amounts to $403,440. 1 in 3 That’s the number of Americans who are unaware of the wage gap, according to research by LeanIn.org. Congrats! You’re no longer one of them. ______ Here are five articles from The Times you might have missed. “In Afghanistan, we laugh differently.” For a handful of teenage girls, robotics offered a reprieve from their violent, patriarchal country.

It was named after an Alabama woman who at the end of a 19-year career at Goodyear discovered she had been paid less than her male peers. She sued and the case reached the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of Goodyear — stating that Ms. Ledbetter should have filed her suit within 180 days of the first unequal paycheck she received. The Fair Pay Act corrected that time limit so that each discriminatory paycheck, rather than just the first one, resets the 180-day limit to file a claim. “I’m so excited I can hardly stand it,” Ledbetter had said after the bill passed the Senate. And after Obama signed it, she said: “Goodyear will never have to pay me what it cheated me out of. In fact, I will never see a cent. But with the president’s signature today I have an even richer reward.” Sign up here to get future installments of In Her Words delivered to your inbox. Read past articles here.",The New York Times
2019,Women Did Everything Right. Then Work Got ‘Greedy.’,"How America’s obsession with long hours has widened the gender gap. CreditCreditRodrigo Corral Daniela Jampel and Matthew Schneid met in college at Cornell, and both later earned law degrees. They both got jobs at big law firms, the kind that reward people who make partner with seven-figure pay packages. One marriage and 10 years later, she works 21 hours a week as a lawyer for New York City, a job that enables her to spend two days a week at home with their children, ages 5 and 1, and to shuffle her hours if something urgent comes up. He’s a partner at a midsize law firm and works 60-hour weeks — up to 80 if he’s closing a big deal — and is on call nights and weekends. He earns four to six times what she does, depending on the year. It isn’t the way they’d imagined splitting the breadwinning and the caregiving. But he’s been able to be so financially successful in part because of her flexibility, they said. “I’m here if he needs to work late or go out with clients,” Ms. Jampel said. “Snow days are not an issue. I do all the doctor appointments on my days off. Really, the benefit is he doesn’t have to think about it. If he has to work late or on weekends, he’s not like, ‘Oh my gosh, who’s going to watch the children?’ The thought never crosses his mind.” American women of working age are the most educated ever. Yet it’s the most educated women who face the biggest gender gaps in seniority and pay: At the top of their fields, they represent just 5 percent of big company chief executives and a quarter of the top 10 percent of earners in the United States. There are many causes of the gap, like discrimination and a lack of family-friendly policies. But recently, mounting evidence has led economists and sociologists to converge on a major driver — one that ostensibly has nothing to do with gender. The returns to working long, inflexible hours have greatly increased. This is particularly true in managerial jobs and what social scientists call the greedy professions, like finance, law and consulting — an unintentional side effect of the nation’s embrace of a winner-take-all economy. It’s so powerful, researchers say, that it has canceled the effect of women’s educational gains. Just as more women earned degrees, the jobs that require those degrees started paying disproportionately more to people with round-the-clock availability. At the same time, more highly educated women began to marry men with similar educations, and to have children. But parents can be on call at work only if someone is on call at home. Usually, that person is the mother. [Sign up for In Her Words, a twice-weekly newsletter on women, gender and society.] This is not about educated women opting out of work (they are the least likely to stop working after having children, even if they move to less demanding jobs). It’s about how the nature of work has changed in ways that push couples who have equal career potential to take on unequal roles. “Because of rising inequality, if you put in the extra hours, if you’re around for the Sunday evening discussion, you’ll get a lot more,” said Claudia Goldin, an economist at Harvard who is writing a book on the topic. To maximize the family’s income but still keep the children alive, it’s logical for one parent to take an intensive job and the other to take a less demanding one, she said. “It just so happens that in most couples, if there’s a woman and a man, the woman takes the back seat.” Women don’t step back from work because they have rich husbands, she said. They have rich husbands because they step back from work. It’s a rarefied problem that many families would love to have — and not all educated couples who face it choose this path. But unpredictable hours also pose challenges for others, including same-sex parents, middle-class families and low earners. Researchers have focused on college-educated women because they’re most prepared to have big careers, yet their careers flatline. Across American life, decision-making power rests mostly with men. The same thing is happening in other rich countries. In Japan, despite efforts to encourage more women to work, they are often stuck in limited roles and part-time jobs, largely because men work such long hours. (The word karoshi means “death from overwork.”) In European countries, with more family-friendly policies, women are likelier to work than they are in the United States — but they’re even less likely to reach senior levels. It’s only in the last two decades that salaried employees have earned more by working long hours. Four decades ago, people who worked at least 50 hours a week were paid 15 percent less, on an hourly basis, than those who worked traditional full-time schedules. By 2000, though, the wage penalty for overwork became a premium. Today, people who work 50 hours or more earn up to 8 percent more an hour than similar people working 35 to 49 hours, according to a sociology paper using Current Population Survey data by Youngjoo Cha at Indiana University, Kim Weeden at Cornell and Mauricio Bucca at the European University Institute. Overwork is most extreme in managerial jobs and in the greedy professions, a term coined by the sociologist Lewis Coser in 1974 to describe institutions that “seek exclusive and undivided loyalty.” (Rose Laub Coser, a sociologist and his wife, also used it to describe the expectations of motherhood). But overwork (or at least time in the office or online, regardless of whether much work is getting done) has become increasingly common in more jobs, whether it’s accounting, information technology or any job in which someone’s manager stays late or sends emails on weekends and expects employees to follow suit. Technology is one reason for the change, researchers say; workers are now more easily reachable and can do more work remotely. Also, business has become more global, so people are working across time zones. A big driver is the widening gap between the highest and lowest earners, and increasingly unstable employment. More jobs requiring advanced degrees are up-or-out — make partner or leave, for example. Even if they aren’t, work has become more competitive, and long hours have become a status symbol. “The reward to become the winner is a lot higher now than in the past,” Ms. Cha said. “You have to stick out among workers, and one way is by your hours.” For Ms. Jampel and Mr. Schneid, both 35, two more equal and less time-intensive jobs weren’t an option, they said. For one, they’re hard to find in corporate law: “At the end of the day, these jobs are client service jobs, so if you’re not responding to your clients, someone else might be more responsive to them,” said Mr. Schneid, who does commercial real estate law. Also, they would be leaving money on the table — both now and later, because by putting in long hours now, he’s setting himself up for higher future earnings. If he had a 40-hour-a-week job and she had her current half-time job, they would be working 60 hours a week total — but earning significantly less than he now earns working 60 hours, they said. “Being willing to work 50 percent more doesn’t mean you make 50 percent more, you make like 100 percent more,” she said. “The trade-off between time and money is not linear. It took a long time to get myself to the point of accepting that.” [Get The Upshot’s twice-weekly newsletter for analysis on politics, policy and everyday life.] There’s no gender gap in the financial rewards for working extra long hours. For the most part, women who work extreme hours get paid as much as men who do. But far fewer women do it, particularly mothers. Twenty percent of fathers now work at least 50 hours a week, and just 6 percent of mothers do, Ms. Cha and Ms. Weeden found. There has always been a pay gap between mothers and fathers, but it would be 15 percent smaller today if the financial returns to long hours hadn’t increased, they found. “New ways of organizing work reproduce old forms of inequality,” they wrote in another paper. Men and women with law and business degrees have similar jobs right out of college, other research has found — but a decade later, women earn significantly less. It’s explained by the fact that they work shorter hours and take more breaks. Today, a smaller share of college-educated women in their early 40s are working than a decade ago. With the rise of college-educated, dual-earner power couples, it was realistic to imagine that two people could each work in jobs at the top of their fields and share the duties at home. But at the same time as work became more demanding, family life changed, too. People are increasingly marrying people with similar educations and career potential — a doctor is likely to be married to another doctor instead of a nurse. Yet the pay gap between husbands and wives is biggest for those with higher education and white-collar jobs. Some parents on elite career paths each continue on them and outsource child care, while others decide not to maximize their family earnings and each take lower-paying, more flexible jobs. But researchers say that because of the changes in work and family, many educated couples are finding that couple equity is out of reach — and many women are left with unused career potential. “The fundamental problem all along is that someone has to take care of the children,” said Till von Wachter, an economist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “What’s changing here is the assortative mating piece. These women have made all these skills and investments and are not fully reaping those returns.” It’s affecting more people, because highly educated women are more likely to have children than they recently were. Eighty percent of women in their early 40s with doctorates or professional degrees are mothers, up from 65 percent two decades ago, according to the Pew Research Center. In 1980, only half of women working in the 10 highest-paying occupations were married, and only a third had a child, found research by Marianne Bertrand, an economist at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. By 2010, they were slightly more likely to be married than other working women, and just as likely to have a child. Meanwhile, being a parent, particularly a mother, has become more intensive. Working mothers today spend as much time with their children as stay-at-home mothers did in the 1970s. The number of hours that college-educated parents spend with their children has doubled since the early 1980s, and they spend more of that time interacting with them, playing and teaching. The same challenge affects single parents, same-sex parents and couples in which the father is the primary parent. But in opposite-sex couples, when one career takes priority, it’s generally the man’s. Men are much more likely to have a spouse who’s on call at home, which enables them to reap the benefits of being on call at work, found a new paper by Jill Yavorsky, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, and colleagues. Three-quarters of men in the top 1 percent of earners have an at-home spouse. Just a quarter of women in the top 1 percent of earners do — and they are likely to be self-employed, suggesting that they have more control over their hours. A third paper by Ms. Cha, using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation, found that in dual-earner households in which a man worked 60 or more hours, particularly in a professional or managerial job, women were three times as likely to quit. (Men with wives who worked long hours were no more likely to quit.) Ms. Jampel and Mr. Schneid had other reasons to split their responsibilities the way they did. She graduated during the Great Recession and was laid off early on. By the time he graduated two years later, he earned more than she did. But gender factored in. Mr. Schneid is a hands-on father. He coaches one of his daughter’s sports teams, and tries to come home before the children’s bedtime (he works from home afterward). But Ms. Jampel said she always knew she’d do more at home, even if she worked full time: “Women are expected to carry the mental load, and I just took on that responsibility.” There are many ideas about how to close the gender gap — things like paid parental leave and anti-bias training. Women could negotiate more; men could do more housework. But most are band-aids, Ms. Goldin said — they probably help, but they don’t address the deeper problem, and leave individual families to figure out their own compromises. “It’s this system we put in place in the era of ‘Mad Men’ and we’re stuck with, and we’re sort of hammering away at in small ways rather than taking the whole thing down,” she said. Certain changes would lighten parents’ demands at home, like universal public preschool, longer school days, free afterschool care and shorter school breaks. But the ultimate solution, researchers say, is not to make it possible for mothers to work crazy hours, too. It’s to reorganize work so that nobody has to. The most effective way to do that, Ms. Goldin’s research has found, is for employers to give workers more predictable hours and flexibility on where and when work gets done. One way that happens is when it becomes easier for workers to substitute for one another. Conventional wisdom, especially in the greedy occupations, is that this is impossible — certain people are too valuable and need to be available to clients anytime. But some professions have successfully challenged that notion. Obstetricians, for instance, used to be on call when patients went into labor. Now it’s much more common for them to work eight-hour shifts in a hospital — and many more women do the job. At an elite global consulting firm, one team gave everyone one weeknight off, no calls or emails allowed — and realized that working late nights might not be necessary after all. “It’s hard to get people to change because they take so much for granted that this is the way it has to be,” said Leslie Perlow, author of “Sleeping With Your Smartphone: How to Break the 24/7 Habit and Change the Way You Work” and a Harvard Business School dean and professor. “But this is really a system problem. People don’t recognize how being always on is creating this pressure to be always on.” The change is unlikely to happen, researchers say, unless workers start to demand it. Companies benefit from always-on workers; they won’t change just to be humane. They have to risk losing valuable employees if they don’t — including men. When women are the only ones who switch to jobs with predictable hours or take advantage of flexibility, it just hurts their careers more. There are signs that things could change. Younger men say they want more equal partnerships and more involvement in family life, research shows. Women are outperforming men in school, but employers are losing out on their talents. And people increasingly say they are fed up with working so much. “It may mean rearranging jobs, but you’d think there’d be a lot of money in it,” said Nicholas Bloom, an economist at Stanford who studies companies’ management practices. “Firms have enormous incentive to really design jobs so they can access these highly educated people who want to work 40 hours a week and not 80.” The arrangements that the Schneid-Jampel family settled on are the best they could have hoped for, given the way things are, they said. But he feels overstretched between relentless pressure at work and time away from his family. “I think I’d be happier in life if I was home more with my children and if I didn’t have the same stress at work,” he said, “but I think this was the best decision for our family.” Ms. Jampel feels angry that the time she spends caregiving isn’t valued the way paid work is. “No one explains this to you when you’re 21, but in retrospect, it was not a smart decision” to go into debt for law school, she said. She said she feels lucky that she’s found substantive, interesting part-time work. He feels lucky that he found a firm that doesn’t require him to do all his hours at the office.

2019,Women Dominate Shortlist for Booker International Prize,"LONDON — The Polish author Olga Tokarczuk could win a second consecutive Man Booker International Prize, arguably the world’s most significant award for literature translated into English, after she was shortlisted for the honor on Tuesday. Five of this year’s six nominated authors are women. If Ms. Tokarczuk wins for “Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead,” an unconventional detective novel that also discusses topics like animal rights and the influence of the Roman Catholic Church in Poland, it would be an unusual back-to-back victory for a major literary award. She won last year’s prize for “Flights,” a series of literary vignettes about modern-day travel. “Flights” was translated by Jennifer Croft, but her new novel was translated from the Polish by Antonia Lloyd-Jones. The Man Booker International Prize is awarded each year to the best book translated into English and published in Britain or Ireland. It is distinct from the more well-known Booker Prize, for fiction originally published in English, but both carry the same prize money of 50,000 pounds, or about $65,000. The prize is split equally between author and translator. “Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead” is about an eccentric woman in her 60s in rural Poland who decides to investigate the murders of members of her local hunting club. Despite being a whodunit, the book caused some controversy among Polish conservatives for its wider discussion of issues like the Catholic Church and environmentalism. “It will make you want to read everything Tokarczuk has written,” Nilanjana Roy wrote in the Financial Times. In The Guardian, the author Sarah Perry said the book “provides an extraordinary display of the qualities that have made Tokarczuk so notable a presence in contemporary literature.” The other shortlisted books, all of which were translated by women, are: • Annie Ernaux’s “The Years,” an experimental autobiography from the French author, which was also a history of French consumerism. “This is an autobiography unlike any you have ever read,” Edmund White said in a review for The New York Times. It was translated from the French by Alison L. Strayer. • Marion Poschmann’s “The Pine Islands.” Originally written in German and translated by Jen Calleja, it is about a lecturer who specializes in the unusual subject of male facial hair in cinema, who flees to Japan and ends up tracing the footsteps of the poet Basho. • “The Shape of the Ruins,” by the Colombian author Juan Gabriel Vásquez — the only man on the shortlist. It focuses on conspiracy theories that surround two political murders in Colombia, with Mr. Vásquez making himself the book’s central character. It was translated from the Spanish by Anne McLean. • Alia Trabucco Zerán’s debut novel “The Remainder,” about three friends in Santiago who take a road trip and end up confronting generations of family pain and the legacy of Chile’s dictatorship. Sophie Hughes did the translation from Spanish • “Celestial Bodies” by Jokha Alharthi of Oman. Translated from the Arabic by Marilyn Booth, the novel tells the story of her country’s evolution from slavery to skyscrapers through the prism of one family. The chairwoman of this year’s judging panel, the historian and author Bettany Hughes, said in a statement that the shortlist contained “wisdom in all its forms.” “Unexpected and unpredictable narratives compelled us to choose this vigorous shortlist,” she added. “Subversive and intellectually ambitious with welcome flashes of wit, each book nourishes creative conversation.” The winner is to be announced on May 21 at a ceremony in London.",The New York Times
2019,Women’s Final Four: Notre Dame Knocks UConn Out Again,"N.C.A.A. Basketball Tournament TAMPA, Fla. — After Notre Dame defeated Connecticut in the Final Four on Friday, Coach Muffet McGraw, wearing a shirt as shiny as the university’s Golden Dome, did a jig of sorts on the court. There were plenty of reasons to celebrate after the Irish advanced to their second straight N.C.A.A. women’s basketball title game. [Read about Baylor’s win over the Oregon Ducks.] Once again, they had upended the game’s longtime powerhouse in a national semifinal. In a Final Four classic last year, Notre Dame beat UConn on a last-second overtime shot by Arike Ogunbowale. Friday’s 81-76 win for the Irish was a fitting encore, with similar back-and-forth drama. They will try to repeat as champions on Sunday, when they face Baylor in a rematch of the 2012 final, which the Lady Bears won easily. For UConn, this was the third consecutive year of falling a win short of reaching the championship game. Coach Geno Auriemma had poked fun at suggestions that the Huskies reached a down cycle after winning four straight titles and 111 consecutive games until the 2017 Final Four. “We had a lot of adversity this year. We lost two games,” Auriemma said before Friday’s defeat turned the Huskies’ record to 35-3. Though he acknowledged on Friday that the Irish were the better team, Auriemma reminded reporters twice of his dynasty at UConn, which includes 11 national titles. “We knew coming in there’s things Notre Dame does that we don’t have an answer for. I’ve had those kind of teams a couple of times,” he said smiling. The lead changed hands 26 times between the Irish and the Huskies, almost mirroring the earlier semifinal, in which Baylor barely escaped a tenacious Oregon team. Early in the fourth quarter, UConn surged to a 9-point lead. “We had Coach a little bit stressed,” Notre Dame forward Jessica Shepard said. That deficit, Auriemma said, could have rattled a lesser team, but not the Irish. “Why? Because they’re defending national champions,” he said. “They have five all-Americans who are really, really good. Like I said, I remember being in that situation a couple of times.” The Irish kept their composure, and key defensive plays by the senior forward Brianna Turner plus big shots from Ogunbowale changed the momentum. “She’s almost an impossible matchup one-on-one,” Auriemma said of Ogunbowale. After a quiet first half with just 2 points, Ogunbowale exploded in the final 20 minutes, finishing with 23. Turner had 15 points and 5 blocks, setting the school’s career blocks record with 371. “That was the key. The girl was amazing,” McGraw said about Turner’s defense. When the Irish won the national title last year, Turner was out with a knee injury, which made this victory especially meaningful. Now she has a chance to win a national title of her own. A healthy Turner contributed a lot this season, and she will be called upon against Baylor’s seemingly indomitable duo in the post, Kalani Brown and Lauren Cox. “She gives us just a totally different look,” McGraw said. “What she can do defensively, she can switch out and guard the point guard, she can certainly guard the post. She’s a shot-blocking presence inside. I think it makes us a little more dominant inside, which won’t be so dominant against Baylor because they’re equally talented in the post.” A day after giving a passionate speech about gender inequality and the need for more female leaders, McGraw took note that both coaches in the final are women. The last time that happened was in 2012, when McGraw also faced Baylor’s Kim Mulkey. Though that was significant to McGraw, she quickly turned the conversation back to the task at hand. “This weekend is really all about basketball,” she said. “So we really want to focus on that.”",The New York Times
2019,Woodstock 50’s Backer Says the Festival Is Off. Its Promoter Is Holding Out Hope.,"It was supposed to be the golden anniversary of the most famous rock concert in history, the event that crystallized in mud the free-love 1960s and the drawing power of a new generation of music stars. But on Monday, Woodstock 50 appeared to be all but dead. According to a statement from the festival’s primary investor, the event — planned for Aug. 16 to 18 in Watkins Glen, N.Y., with acts including Jay-Z, the Killers and Dead and Company — was off. “It’s a dream for agencies to work with iconic brands and to be associated with meaningful movements,” the investor, an arm of the Japanese advertising giant Dentsu, said. “But despite our tremendous investment of time, effort and commitment, we don’t believe the production of the festival can be executed as an event worthy of the Woodstock brand name while also ensuring the health and safety of the artists, partners and attendees. “As a result and after careful consideration,” the statement continued, “Dentsu Aegis Network’s Amplifi Live, a partner of Woodstock 50, has decided to cancel the festival. As difficult as it is, we believe this is the most prudent decision for all parties involved.” The agency believed that production milestones had not been met and was concerned about delays in acquiring permits, as well as a reduction in the originally planned capacity, from 100,000 visitors a day to 75,000. But while Dentsu’s statement ricocheted around the news media, Michael Lang, the promoter of Woodstock 50 and one of the primary forces behind the original festival in 1969, denied that the event was kaput. “They do not have the right to unilaterally cancel the festival,” Lang said in an interview shortly after Dentsu released its statement, which Lang said caught him by surprise. On Monday evening, Mr. Lang’s team released a statement insisting that the show would go on, but giving no further details. “We are committed to ensuring that the 50th anniversary of Woodstock is marked with a festival deserving of its iconic name and place in American history and culture,” the statement said. “Although our financial partner is withdrawing, we will of course be continuing with the planning of the festival and intend to bring on new partners.” “The bottom line is,” the statement added, “there is going to be a Woodstock 50th Anniversary Festival, as there must be, and it’s going to be a blast.” Lang said that all acts had already been paid in full, leaving open the possibility that he could rescue the festival with another backer. He is no stranger to last-minute saves. The 1969 Woodstock festival lost its original venue, in Wallkill, N.Y., and relocated to Max Yasgur’s farm in Bethel, N.Y., just weeks before it took place. It was unclear what prompted the timing of Dentsu’s announcement. The company declined to make any further comment. Several major music agents and acts booked for the event said they had not received any notification of cancellation. The list of performers also includes Miley Cyrus, the Raconteurs, the Lumineers, Chance the Rapper, Imagine Dragons, Halsey, Robert Plant and some who had played the original event, like Santana, Country Joe McDonald and John Fogerty of Creedence Clearwater Revival. Woodstock 50 was announced in January as an ambitious and principled celebration of the original event. Organizers envisioned a three-day camping festival, for approximately 100,000 people a day, with what Lang said would be music as well as representation by activist organizations. “We want this to be more than just coming to a concert,” Lang said at the time. “And hopefully a lot of the bands will become part of this effort to get people to stand up and make themselves heard, to get and out vote. And if they don’t have a candidate that represents their feelings, to find one — or to run themselves.” But from the start, Woodstock 50 drew skeptics throughout the industry, who doubted that such an event could be successful in an era now dominated by big festivals and tours promoted by giant companies like Live Nation and AEG. Through permit applications, the organizers had also quietly reduced its intended capacity to 75,000. The lineup was announced last month, but the on-sale date for tickets — April 22, Earth Day — came and went with no more information. According to news reports, the organizers had applied for but not yet received a mass gathering permit from the New York State Department of Health. Without that permit, no tickets could be sold. Woodstock 50 was to have been the most prominent event among a series of anniversary celebrations throughout the Northeast, including a series of events at the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts, located on the site of the original Woodstock festival. Another event, Woodstock Experience 2019, has a lineup including a number of artists who played the original festival, like Melanie, Ten Years After and Jefferson Starship, an offshoot of Jefferson Airplane. It is to take place in West Jefferson, N.C., Aug. 9 to 11, and then in Palm Bay, Fla., Aug. 16 to 18. Its slogan: “Keeping the spirit of Woodstock alive.”",The New York Times

As a restorative justice program, it offers a survivor-centered accountability process that “gives those directly impacted by acts of violence the opportunity to shape what repair will look like, and, in the case of the responsible party, to carry out that repair instead of going to prison.” … _________ The Word of the Day and the quiz question have been provided by Vocabulary.com.

Winners were expected to use their moments of glory to rail against the systemic sexism and silence that allowed the behavior of men like Mr. Weinstein, James Toback, Louis C.K. and Mr. Spacey to fester for decades. On the red carpet, eight actresses walked hand in hand with activists who focus on sexual harassment and gender inequality. … And inside the ballroom, the ceremony in many ways felt like business as usual. Stars, producers and studio executives schmoozed in frantic fashion during the commercial breaks and straight through some awards. The vibe even approached easygoing and carefree — as if Hollywood felt it had exculpated itself with all of the serious talk on the red carpet and the sharp-edged jokes Mr. Meyers cracked during his monologue. _________ The Word of the Day and the quiz question have been provided by Vocabulary.com.

Hirsch: Boston has four infamous hills between 16 and 21 miles, just where you don’t need them. The last is the dreaded Heartbreak Hill. I trudged up the first three, fearful about Heartbreak just ahead. Then I was on it, leaning steeply into the slope. Near the top, I heard a police officer on a bullhorn exhorting the runners. Suddenly, he was speaking directly to me: “No. 622, at the crest of the hill, you have five miles to go, and it’s all downhill.” I’ll never forget his next words: “Your achievement is superb and you have my fullest admiration.” I knew then that I would finish the Boston Marathon.

The army was enlisted to help spread salt and to shovel slush from the city’s streets, where dozens of cars had become stranded. … A Siberian weather front nicknamed the Beast from the East sent temperatures plunging and brought snow and icy conditions to many European countries in recent days.

These days, comics are singing almost every night of the week at intimate spaces like Union Hall, Caveat and Club Cumming, packed with the kind of 20-something audiences that New York theater has long courted (mostly unsuccessfully). … While Cohen’s act is more like a musical that breaks into song when the characters need to express something more emotional, Owens is at his best when he quickly jumps right into a song. Of all the comedians who sing, he has the most virtuosic voice, a powerful, nimble instrument that can inject a cover of the “Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” theme with an ominous intensity or imbue a ballad to Oprah Winfrey with the kind of gravitas that could make you weep. _________ The Word of the Day and the quiz question have been provided by Vocabulary.com.

That brief work’s stark cries of heraldry served as a moving, climactic end to a show that was paced to entertain. In progressing without breaks for applause over 75 minutes, this concert’s movement from one piece to the next was, at times, too smooth. Brief tape-music compositions by Bahar Royaee and Mr. Lorenzo (who also contributed an LED artwork titled “Light Flute” to the staging) were presented casually — essentially serving as interstitial music, while Ms. Chase darted between platforms inside the Kitchen’s space. Though as far as downsides go, this occasional sense of being too charged-up is the right kind of problem for an organizer to have during a multidecade initiative as demanding as this one. _________ The Word of the Day and the quiz question have been provided by Vocabulary.com.

Since it made landfall on Sept. 14, the storm and its aftermath have been blamed for at least 45 deaths in the Carolinas, and about 1,800 people remain in shelters at schools, recreation centers and National Guard armories.

In 1914, with the war just five months old, enlisted men on both sides emerged from their no-man’s-land trenches on Christmas Day to bury their dead and exchange small gifts. Also, they sang, and if you had been standing in the mud and the cold near Ypres, Belgium, you could have heard those voices joined in “Auld Lang Syne” before the shells began to wail again. … The plangent tenors, lush baritones and rumbling basses are in excellent voice, and when they come together, the sensation is tremendous and the musical chill effect engulfing. I can’t have been the only person who spent the evening in a pretty much constant state of horripilation. The show is a lesson, if any were needed, in music as a vehicle for emotion.

Awareness of this phenomenon has given rise to two appealing, but conflicting, schools of thought. One is that fever is a natural response to infection, so one shouldn’t interfere with it; the other is that fever is a potentially harmful consequence of infection, so one should suppress it to minimize its complications. The theory of the salubrious fever has an interesting history. In the pre-antibiotic era of the early 20th century, doctors prescribed pyrotherapy, a medically induced fever, as a treatment for a variety of conditions from syphilis to rheumatic fever. They used various methods to raise the patient’s body temperature to between 103 and 107 degrees Fahrenheit. _________ The Word of the Day and the quiz question have been provided by Vocabulary.com.

2019,Words of Introduction,"DAILY CROSSWORD COLUMN Brendan Emmett Quigley needs none. SUNDAY PUZZLE — Can a puzzle gleam with burnished self-assurance? Brendan Emmett Quigley is a crossword guru who sits benevolently on a mountain of his own work, if I may wax a bit poetic. He has made a lot of puzzles — this is his 182nd grid for The Times, and his 36th Sunday. It is a perfect example of how a big themed grid can still be evenly difficult — there were hardly any soft spots today, easy-ish chunks of fill that can be a little boring on a Sunday when there are so many entries. And I thought the challenge level was high but entirely fair. Plenty of Sunday obscurity, hard clues for entries like RENO, ALES, EDDA, VANS, FORBID and AIOLI, among others. My religion blind spot hurt me on AME and REUEL — brutal to have both of them in one corner. Loved the notion of an ARK borne on a “flood” of EMAIL, the proximity of SLAV to BALKANS, and the clue for SUNS. I didn’t think there were too many odd names — the clue for ELLIS might have been educational, and maybe the Venn diagram of people who know both HEATON and ROARK isn’t a full circle. 24A: I can’t be the only one who took Zoe “Kazan” as a gimme and then learned about Zoe AKINS, who wrote “The Greeks Had a Word for It,” a play that inspired “How to Marry a Millionaire” and “The Old Maid,” which won the 1935 Pulitzer for drama. 26A: All these years warbling along to I AM A ROCK as if it is some motivational anthem to independence and I never knew the lyrics. “Emotional detachment,” indeed. 72A: For a sanity-doubting moment I was unable to locate “E Pluribus Unum” on the back of a dollar bill (it’s in the eagle’s schnoz on the back, on the right). It doesn’t matter here because Mr. Quigley wants another little word, ORDO, of “Novus Ordo Seclorum,” under the pyramid on the left, meaning “A new order for the ages.” 78A: Quite a whimsical clue here, those “large bills” are the extravagant schnozes of TOUCANS. Who knew that their purpose was thermoregulation? Not I. 7D: If you watch this game show, you would know that prizes that one would think of — cars, vacations, barbecues, dog spa gift certificates, who knows what else — come packaged as a SHOWCASE. I was stumped for a bit. 84D: The Equator circles the Earth like a belt, and I knew about the regions just north and south of it but had never really considered them as individuals — each is a TROPIC, one of Cancer, one of Capricorn, and they do go all the way around. 98D: I had “skip” instead of WARP for a while, and “sools,” therefore, instead of “wools” from Scotland — as in, who will save your “sools,” ye sinners? I like the inclusion of BURP and WARP in one grid. Mrs. Malaprop would view this theme, which manifests in five across and two down entries, with acrimony. Sorry, couldn’t resist. It’s apt, though, right? Mr. Quigley has taken seven familiar little words and clued them with the word “words.” Sounds complicated when I put it that way, doesn’t it, but you can see it for yourself — he has “BAD words” and “LAST words” and “KIND words” and so on. The answers are well-known phrases, the initials of which spell that initial little word. That is the root of the lame joke above — these seven words are being enlisted as acronyms for the purpose of the theme. I thought of other examples like TIME magazine (TIME being short for “The International Magazine of Events”) and ZIP codes (“Zone Improvement Plan”), which are reverse engineered: Take a punchy word and use the letters to create an apt phrase. Mr. Quigley’s are reverse reverse engineered, the words being generated by the phrases. Or is that just engineered? My head’s spinning — let’s look at an example. My first complete entry was at 15D, “BAD words?” because I gained some steam in the northeast corner and got BEYOND ALL DOUBT mainly on crosses. I didn’t see the forest for the trees at this point, although I did get that the three capitalized letters started the three words in the answer. Then I got 35A, “HAS words?,” which solved to HEART AND SOUL, and I got the gist of it — not that it made the rest of the theme answers easy, but it made them make sense. Did anyone glean any secondary pattern in these entries? I didn’t, but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t there. There were a couple that seemed to have some hidden meaning — “BIG words?” at 60A, for example, solved to a “big” idea, and 82A, “ROOT words?” solved to RUN OUT OF TOWN, which is applicable to one definition of “root,” right? But others, including my favorite by far (“KIND words?”) didn’t seem to have any trick to them. Subscribers can take a peek at the answer key. Trying to get back to the puzzle page? Right here.

2019,Opinion | Would Any Atrocity Turn Off Investors to Saudi Arabia?,"The kingdom this week executed 37 “terrorists” after torture and sham trials. Corporations and governments should demand an end to the kingdom’s egregious violations of human rights. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. This month, Saudi Arabia’s oil company, Aramco, revealed that it generated $111.1 billion in net income last year, making it the world’s most profitable company by far. So it is not particularly surprising that a scant six months after the murder and dismemberment of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi by government goons stunned the world, businesses and banks are once again courting the kingdom. Hundreds of investors lined up this month to bid in Aramco’s first bond sale; among businesses humming in the kingdom, the movie theater giant AMC is moving ahead with plans for 40 new theaters, and Google is working on a data center. “The fact that there are issues in the press does not tell me I must run away from a place. In many cases it tells me I should run to and invest because what we are most frightened of are things that we don’t talk about,” explained Larry Fink, the BlackRock chief executive, who created waves earlier this year when he argued that business must provide leadership on social and political issues. Mr. Fink’s statement appeared to be a variation on what many other corporate barons have used as justification for working with the de facto Saudi ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman — that they are helping Saudis to reform and modernize their society. In that context, it might be instructive to revisit some of the “issues in the press.” Let us set aside for the moment the strong indications provided by American and Turkish intelligence that Prince Mohammed was behind Mr. Khashoggi’s murder, which he denies. The purported modernization decreed by the prince has been accompanied by a broad campaign of arrests, trials, convictions and executions. On Tuesday, the official Saudi news agency announced that 37 men, nearly all from the minority Shiite Muslim community, had been executed on terrorism-related charges. Executions in Saudi Arabia are usually by beheading, often in public, and the Interior Ministry said one man was also crucified, something reserved for the most grievous crimes. According to Human Rights Watch, 11 of the men were charged with spying for Iran and 14 in connection with protests during the Arab Spring of 2011. Some of the convictions were based on confessions that the men withdrew in court, saying they had been tortured. One of those beheaded was Mujtaba al-Sweikat, who was 17 and preparing to enter Western Michigan University when he was arrested in 2012 after attending a pro-democracy rally. The most-heralded evidence of modernization under Prince Mohammed was his lifting of a ban on women driving. The very fact that there was such a ban is ridiculous, but a few weeks before it was ended, in May 2018, several women’s rights activists were rounded up — including women who had campaigned against the driving ban — and accused of crimes against the kingdom. According to human rights organizations and their families, at least some of the women were tortured. The techniques included beatings, electric shocks, whipping and waterboarding. The parents of Loujain al-Hathloul said after a visit that her thighs were black with bruises, and she was shaking uncontrollably, unable to sit or walk normally. Several of the women reportedly went on trial in March, but the charges were not specified and reporters and diplomats were barred from the courtroom. Several other women remain in prison, including Samar Badawi, whose case ignited a major diplomatic row between Canada and Saudi Arabia after Canada requested her immediate release. None of these human-rights violations have put a dent in the strong support Prince Mohammed enjoys from President Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Mr. Kushner in particular has been ardently cultivating the prince’s friendship to win support for a long-promised Israeli-Palestinian peace plan. Last week, Mr. Trump cast only his second veto against a bipartisan resolution that would have forced an end to American military involvement with Saudi Arabia’s intervention in Yemen’s civil war, which has contributed to appalling civilian suffering. Yes, Saudi Arabia is a strategic ally, and it is a fountain of petrodollars. But Prince Mohammed needs Washington’s arms and global business investment at least as much as it needs his money or oil. Demanding a modicum of civilized behavior must be a nonnegotiable part of any deal. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2019,Would You Want to Be Proposed to on a Jumbotron?,"Student Opinion Close your eyes and try to imagine your wedding proposal. If you think you’re not really the marrying type, then imagine an alternative proposal — asking someone on a date or to the prom? (Did you know there was such a thing as a promposal?) What did you see: a beautiful setting? Candles? Rose petals? Are you down on one knee? Is there a ring? Now add 50,000 cheering people to your fantasy. Would that make the moment more special? Does the idea of a Jumbotron proposal fill you with romantic delight or deep, cringy fear? (You can watch two examples here and here.) In “Thinking of a Jumbotron Proposal? Some Say, Ugh. Others, Say Yes.,” Britni de la Cretaz writes: Jumbotron proposals have become as much a part of baseball as the seventh-inning stretch — no matter that they are often considered tacky and in bad taste. When a proposal appears on the giant screen, a large segment of sports Twitter world (mostly women) chime in about how they hope no one ever proposes to them at a sporting event. Still, hundreds of these public, grandiose gestures happen every year and many proposees walk out of the stadium happily ever after. On March 31, 2018, Joanna Chan, who works for Netflix, proposed to her girlfriend of five years, Julie Morris, who is employed at Hulu. The moment happened during the first period of a Calgary Flames game and was shown on the giant screen at Scotiabank Saddledome — known as the Enmax Energy Board — home to the National Hockey League’s Flames. Ms. Chan and Ms. Morris, both 36 and living in Los Angeles (since married and now both going by Chan-Morris), had just embarked on a five-year tour of all 31 N.H.L. arenas, and the Saddledome was their final stop. Joanna Chan-Morris says that a few stops before their final one, she knew she wanted to propose in Calgary. “It’s not about the public aspect of the proposal, really,” she said. “It was really just about making that last game special.” Even still, with that gesture, their engagement became a viral sensation, traveling beyond the area and onto the internet. Joanna paid 5,000 Canadian dollars ($3,782) for the opportunity, which she says was “worth every penny.” The Saddledome is far from the only sports arena that gives fans the option to propose on a really big TV screen in front of thousands. Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox, does 50 to 60 live, in-game proposals each season at a cost of $350 each. At Dodger Stadium, getting engaged onscreen will set you back $5,000, an event the team estimates happens two or three times a season. The article continues: The whole concept irks Jessica Kleinschmidt, a content producer/reporter at NBC Sports Bay Area and a self-proclaimed “hater of in-game proposals.” “It’s as if this person needs to show these complete strangers they love this person by making a show out of it,” Ms. Kleinschmidt said. “Needing validation from complete strangers? Go on Twitter if you want to do that.” Also, she noted, an in-game proposal “puts the woman under pressure to say yes.” When those traditional gender dynamics are reversed, the public response can be cruel. In 2014, a woman surprised her boyfriend by proposing to him at an N.B.A. game. At the time, she told Fox 5 DC, “I thought this would make me the best wife-to-be ever to do it in front of his favorite team.” Her fiancé seemed happy she asked. But the response online was less than kind, with the frequently misogynist sports and culture website Barstool Sports calling it “the absolute worst proposal of all time,” among other worse things. Another blogger wrote that he would “never want to be proposed to by my girlfriend, and at an N.B.A. game no less, not in a million years.” When Jumbotron proposals go wrong, spectators take an almost perverse pleasure in the rejection. In 2017, a rejected proposal at Fenway Park resulted in the entire ballpark chanting, “She said no!” (Jasmine Guillory’s newest novel, aptly named “The Proposal,” opens with a rejected proposal at Dodger Stadium that goes viral on the internet.) This virality is something that more and more Jumbotron proposers are experiencing now that social media is a thing and everyone in the stadium has a smartphone, or the teams broadcast feel-good content across their various platforms. What is it about our culture’s ideas about love, romance and marriage that allowed the phenomenon to gain traction in the first place? “Romantic comedies,” Chloe Angyal wrote for Buzzfeed in 2015, “teach us that the truer a true love is, the grander and more public the public grand gesture will be.” Students, read the entire article, then tell us: — What do you think about Jumbotron proposals?

2019,"Would You Want to Learn With a Personalized, Online Learning Program Instead of a Teacher?","Student Opinion Imagine your school has started a new method of teaching and learning. Instead of being led through lessons by teachers, you and your classmates now use a personalized, web-based learning platform. This program is tailored to your individual abilities, needs and interests and you can complete it at your own pace. Your teacher no longer directs the class, but acts as your personal “mentor,” helping you with assignments as needed and meeting with you for 10 minutes a week to check on your progress. How similar does this scenario sound to the way your classes function right now? Is this a program you would want at your school? Why or why not? In “Silicon Valley Came to Kansas Schools. That Started a Rebellion,” Nellie Bowles writes about a similar platform backed by Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg that was introduced in two Kansas high schools: The seed of rebellion was planted in classrooms. It grew in kitchens and living rooms, in conversations between students and their parents. It culminated when Collin Winter, 14, an eighth grader in McPherson, Kan., joined a classroom walkout in January. In the nearby town of Wellington, high schoolers staged a sit-in. Their parents organized in living rooms, at churches and in the back of machine repair shops. They showed up en masse to school board meetings. In neighborhoods with no political yard signs, homemade signs with dark red slash marks suddenly popped up. Silicon Valley had come to small-town Kansas schools — and it was not going well. “I want to just take my Chromebook back and tell them I’m not doing it anymore,” said Kallee Forslund, 16, a 10th grader in Wellington. Eight months earlier, public schools near Wichita had rolled out a web-based platform and curriculum from Summit Learning. The Silicon Valley-based program promotes an educational approach called “personalized learning,” which uses online tools to customize education. The platform that Summit provides was developed by Facebook engineers. It is funded by Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, and his wife, Priscilla Chan, a pediatrician. Many families in the Kansas towns, which have grappled with underfunded public schools and deteriorating test scores, initially embraced the change. Under Summit’s program, students spend much of the day on their laptops and go online for lesson plans and quizzes, which they complete at their own pace. Teachers assist students with the work, hold mentoring sessions and lead special projects. The system is free to schools. The laptops are typically bought separately. Then, students started coming home with headaches and hand cramps. Some said they felt more anxious. One child began having a recurrence of seizures. Another asked to bring her dad’s hunting earmuffs to class to block out classmates because work was now done largely alone. “We’re allowing the computers to teach and the kids all looked like zombies,” said Tyson Koenig, a factory supervisor in McPherson, who visited his son’s fourth-grade class. In October, he pulled the 10-year-old out of the school. In a school district survey of McPherson middle school parents released this month, 77 percent of respondents said they preferred their child not be in a classroom that uses Summit. More than 80 percent said their children had expressed concerns about the platform. “Change rarely comes without some bumps in the road,” said Gordon Mohn, McPherson’s superintendent of schools. He added, “Students are becoming self-directed learners and are demonstrating greater ownership of their learning activities.” John Buckendorf, Wellington High School’s principal, said the “vast majority of our parents are happy with the program.” Students, read the entire article, then tell us: — How much classroom time do you spend learning online? Do you enjoy it and wish you had more of it? Or would you rather spend more time offline, working with your teachers and classmates? Why? — What do you think about Summit Learning? Would you want to learn with a personalized, online learning program instead of in a classroom led by a teacher? Why or why not? — What specific concerns would you have about using a program like Summit? What aspects of the program do you think you would find most beneficial?

Do you think they are just being resistant to change, as Diane Tavenner, Summit’s chief executive, suggested? Or are their concerns legitimate? If Summit Learning came to your school, do you think parents, teachers and students would embrace it or reject it? — What are your thoughts on Silicon Valley’s efforts to “remake American education in its own image” — that is, an institution heavily reliant on technology?

2019,Would You Want to Live a Life Without Ever Feeling Pain?,"Student Opinion Imagine you could live your life without experiencing pain. Not quite as a superhero, you wouldn’t be super strong — you just wouldn’t feel any pain, physical or emotional. Ever. Would you choose that life? In “At 71, She’s Never Felt Pain or Anxiety. Now Scientists Know Why.,” Heather Murphy writes: She’d been told that childbirth was going to be painful. But as the hours wore on, nothing bothered her — even without an epidural. “I could feel that my body was changing, but it didn’t hurt me,” recalled the woman, Jo Cameron, who is now 71. She likened it to “a tickle.” Later, she would tell prospective mothers, “Don’t worry, it’s not as bad as people say it is.” It was only recently — more than four decades later — that she learned her friends were not exaggerating. Rather, there was something different about the way her body experienced pain: For the most part, it didn’t. Scientists believe they now understand why. In a paper published Thursday in The British Journal of Anaesthesia, researchers attributed Ms. Cameron’s virtually pain-free life to a mutation in a previously unidentified gene. The hope, they say, is that the finding could eventually contribute to the development of a novel pain treatment. They believe this mutation may also be connected to why Ms. Cameron has felt little anxiety or fear throughout her life and why her body heals quickly. The author discusses how Ms. Cameron was discovered by scientists: The sequence of events that led scientists to investigate Ms. Cameron’s genes began about five years ago. She was living a happy, ordinary life on the banks of Loch Ness in Scotland with her husband, she said. After a hand operation, a doctor seemed perplexed that she was not experiencing any pain and did not want painkillers. “I guarantee I won’t need anything,” Ms. Cameron recalled telling Dr. Devjit Srivastava, a consultant in anesthesia and pain medicine at a National Health Service hospital in northern Scotland and one of the authors of the paper. A few follow-up questions revealed that Ms. Cameron was unusual. At 65, she’d needed to have her hip replaced. Because it had not caused her pain, she had not noticed anything was amiss until it was severely degenerated. Cuts, burns, fractures — these did not hurt either. In fact, it often took the smell of burning flesh or her husband identifying blood for her to notice something wrong. She also reported that eating Scotch bonnet chili peppers left only a “pleasant glow.” The article continues: Scientists are also intrigued by Ms. Cameron’s extraordinarily low anxiety level. On an anxiety disorder questionnaire, she scored zero out of 21. She cannot recall ever having felt depressed or scared. “I am very happy,” she said. In retrospect, she sees how her genetic disposition may have aided her at work. After years as a primary-school teacher, she retrained to work with people with severe mental disabilities. Erratic, aggressive behavior never riled her, she said. But though having this mutation may sound like a dream, there are downsides. One is that she is quite forgetful; prone to losing her keys and her train of thought midsentence. The other is that she’s never felt the “adrenaline rush” that other people talk about, she said. Students, read the entire article, then tell us: — Would you want to live a life without ever feeling pain — physical and psychological? What would be the advantages and disadvantages of a life without pain? — How do you imagine your life would be different? In what ways might you be happier? What growth or development, stemming from anxiety or pain, might you have missed? Would you choose to live a pain-free life if it meant that you would never experience an adrenaline rush, as Ms. Cameron says she never has? — What role has physical pain played in your life? Do you think you have a high or low threshold for pain? Tell us about a memorable experience with physical pain. Were you able to take something positive from the experience? — In a related article, “The Value of Suffering,” Pico Iyer writes: Wise men in every tradition tell us that suffering brings clarity, illumination; for the Buddha, suffering is the first rule of life, and insofar as some of it arises from our own wrongheadedness — our cherishing of self — we have the cure for it within. Thus in certain cases, suffering may be an effect, as well as a cause, of taking ourselves too seriously. I once met a Zen-trained painter in Japan, in his 90s, who told me that suffering is a privilege, it moves us toward thinking about essential things and shakes us out of shortsighted complacency; when he was a boy, he said, it was believed you should pay for suffering, it proves such a hidden blessing. Do you agree? What life lessons can pain and suffering teach? — By some estimates, tens of millions of Americans suffer from chronic pain. The global pain management drug industry is valued at over $58 billion. Should scientists and pharmaceutical companies investigate Ms. Cameron’s case in hopes of developing more effective treatments for pain? If scientists were successful in developing a pain intervention or vaccine, would you seek out this product? Would you choose to shield your children from physical or emotional pain?

2019,Wouldn’t It Be Nice,"daily crossword column Amanda Chung and Karl Ni make some noise. TUESDAY PUZZLE — Amanda Chung and Karl Ni return with a delightfully smooth and noisy puzzle. 54A: The cartoonist Georges Rémi, popularly known as Hérge, created the comic book hero TINTIN in the 1920s. Now a 90-year-old teenager, TINTIN is a reporter who travels the world with his trusty sidekick Snowy, a wire-haired fox terrier. 69A: Don’t overthink this one. Remember, it’s only Tuesday. 7/4/1776 and 6/6/1944, while both historically important, are still merely DATES. 7D: Solvers are likely to think TINA when they see “Singer Turner,” but in this puzzle, there are only three squares. The answer turns out to be singer IKE Turner, her domestically violent ex-partner. 43D: Hi, kids! The “jokey 1978 Steve Martin song” is “KING TUT.” You may not know that you know this, but you probably do: Ms. Chung and Mr. Ni offer us a set of four seemingly disparate entries that each have four shaded squares. The shaded squares — which are the sounds that certain animals make —made the puzzle much easier and the revealer at 64A a tad less fun to discover, but it is only Tuesday. Even so, I enjoyed the PET SOUNDS that resonate inside their grid. Before you say, “But Deb, a pig who says OINK (37A) is in no way a house pet,” let me tell you about the time I helped train Adonis, the potbellied pig. I was working as a canine behaviorist, and I occasionally helped train dogs to be service animals. Adonis’s owners, a lovely married couple, were interested in having him certified to help the wife, who had a degenerative disorder. These clients lived in a very small apartment in Manhattan. This will be important later. Pigs are very smart animals, probably smarter than dogs. One of the things they are very good at is manipulating their humans. Adonis was able to get my clients to cave to his every demand, and the larger part of my job consisted of warning them not to do that. “He’s going to get much bigger as he gets older, “ I told them, “and you are going to want to teach him manners so the building’s management doesn’t ask you to re-home him.” We went about teaching Adonis to help the wife: he fetched things she had dropped, he brought her things she asked for, the usual stuff. But my clients continued to indulge Adonis, much to my chagrin. At some point, Adonis went through puberty. One week he was a cute little piglet, the next week he was a 150-pound coffee table with tusks. And if he was demanding before, he was the apartment dictator now. When male, unneutered pigs don’t get their way, they sometimes make their displeasure known by charging their target and trying to gore them, which is exactly what Adonis began to do. I asked Adonis to perform a specific behavior and, instead of cheerfully doing it, he lowered his head — it bears repeating that this was the head with the tusks — and lumbered across the room at us. There was no place to go, so three panicked adults jumped onto the kitchen table to avoid being punctured by an angry pig. This was not going to bode well for Adonis or his owners, so once we were able to distract him and get off the kitchen table, I called an acquaintance who trained pigs for television. If anyone would know how to get through to Adonis, it would be this guy. I like to think I am self-aware enough to know when I’m setting myself up, but that day, I was only thinking about how to save Adonis. “How do I stop a pig from charging?” I asked. Without missing a beat, the trainer said, “Take away his credit cards.” And then he hung up. But yes, many people do, in fact, keep pigs as pets. One of Amanda's friends frequently posts silly, punny riddles such as ""If April showers bring May flowers, then what do Mayflowers bring?"" HOMEOWNER was the answer to one such riddle (though the actual riddle has since been forgotten) and became the seed entry for this puzzle. TWO OF A KIND and THIS SIDE UP were found pretty quickly, but we struggled to get that last entry. CHOO CHOO TRAIN was a contender, but it didn't seem like owls were really pets outside of the Harry Potter books. And ZOINKS seemed a bit too short. TATTOO INK saves the day! DANDRUFF and SPURRED ON were among the others we thought about, though they didn't span a couple of words. The Beach Boys have such great music — PET SOUNDS immediately jumped to mind as the revealer. Our original clue for 3-Down paid homage to the hamster dance song of our college years, but the new clue is a lot more fun. Thanks as always to the editorial team! Almost finished solving but need a bit more help? We’ve got you covered. Warning: There be spoilers ahead, but subscribers can take a peek at the answer key. Trying to get back to the puzzle page?

2019,Woven Into the Fabrics of France,"For the Paris fashion world, Notre-Dame and all it represents was a gravitational pole. There has never been a fashion show inside the Cathedral of Notre-Dame, or in the piazza splayed in front of it, the way there have been in French cultural landmarks like the Louvre, the Palais de Justice and the National Archives. But there might as well have been. It is embedded on the psychographic style map of the city, its two towers as defining a silhouette as the New Look, its image practically a brand in itself. Four times a year, as the couture and ready-to-wear shows dawn in Paris, town cars and editors and retailers shod in stilettoes or Stan Smiths would crisscross the quais from the Tennis Club de Paris to Bercy, Austerlitz to the Pompidou. Each time, they would swirl past the towers and rose windows of the cathedral on the Île de la Cité, the nexus of a diagonal from the Sixth Arrondissement headquarters of Sonia Rykiel to the Fourth Arrondissement home of Azzedine Alaïa, all around it other showrooms and ateliers like pearls on a string. When it burned, so did one of the poles by which the fashion world orients itself, and not just geographically. The tragedy at Notre-Dame pierced viewers around the world, and leaders of all kinds have responded with emotion and support. For the French, there’s a more visceral connection between French fashion and French monuments that has to do with definitions of the country’s culture and how it is disseminated around the world. To designers of French brands, whose identity is wrapped up in the history of Paris, Notre-Dame is not just an example of gorgeous architecture (though it is that, and designers often cite various buildings as catalysts for their imagination), nor is it just another tourist draw that helps bring their customers to France (though it is that, too). It is, in a more abstract sense, part of their own patrimony, an example and embodiment of the values they hold dear and that define their work at its best: beauty, artisanship, handwork, heritage, the emotion that can be evoked by creativity. A concrete — or rather, stone and wood — example of the worth that resides in these concepts. A character in the myth of Frenchness written by Victor Hugo and Disney. And for anyone trying to capture that elusive quality of Frenchness and give it form — which is, let’s face it, part of the promise of French fashion, especially those brands that are synonymous with that je ne sais quoi (Dior, Saint Laurent, Givenchy, Chanel and Hermès) — Notre-Dame was an essential reference. Just as it was shorthand for the sagas that surround it, be they of Joan of Arc, Napoleon or de Gaulle, which also provide the elements of a sartorial vocabulary all designers share. That is why over the years it was so often used as a backdrop in glossy magazine features, an image that could immediately telegraph place as well as aura and association. As the photos of flames went round the world, so many designers joined the chorus of mourning. “While it was burning, a part of all of us was smoking away with immense sadness,” Anthony Vaccarello, the creative director of Yves Saint Laurent, said on Tuesday. Earlier he had posted a photo of the burning building on Instagram with one simple word: “sad.” He was not the only one to demonstrate solidarity on social media. “Sadness for what is happening right now at Notre Dame, a place which holds a big space in my heart,” posted Riccardo Tisci, the Burberry designer who was creative director of Givenchy for 12 years. Diane von Furstenberg and Clare Waight Keller of Givenchy likewise took to Instagram to express their emotions. In a text, Nicolas Ghesquière, the artistic director of Louis Vuitton women’s wear, called the cathedral a “testament to human strength, inventiveness and faith.” And Peter Copping, the former designer of Nina Ricci, who is British but based in Paris, wrote in an email that when he moved to the city, Notre-Dame “was the first place on my list to see. It is a huge part of the fabric of Paris — a city I love, that I have made my home and is very special to me.” Little wonder that the titans of the two largest French fashion and luxury groups — Bernard Arnault of LVMH and François-Henri Pinault of Kering — were among the first business leaders to pledge millions of euros to the restoration of the cathedral. (Together their donations total over $300 million.) For those who aspire to be guardians and stewards of French savoir-faire, what better way to prove it? Especially at a time when luxury itself is under attack, the windows of its gilded emporiums broken by the so-called Yellow Vest movement, a symbol of elitism and division rather than culture. Now, of course, Notre-Dame’s famous buttresses and centuries-old lines have been warped by disaster. But if there is one thing that fashion knows, it is that the designs of the past can be given new form, and new life.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Wrong Turn on Central America,"letter A reader says President Trump’s approach to the region is completely off the mark. To the Editor: Re “Trump Directs State Dept. to End Aid to 3 Central American Countries” (nytimes.com, March 30): The Republicans’ latest move on immigration is to halt foreign aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. This move is 180 degrees off the mark. People are leaving Central America because life there is dangerous. Life is dangerous there because local governments cannot govern. Local governments cannot govern because they are outgunned and corrupted by the drug cartels. A solution that is politically feasible for the United States is to create centers of economic power in Central America much as President John F. Kennedy’s Alliance for Progress envisioned.

2019,Wyatt Cenac Has a Thing for Slot Car Racing,"Encounters The creator of “Wyatt Cenac’s Problem Areas” crushes his competition at Buzz-a-Rama in Brooklyn, where model cars still rule. Wyatt Cenac was lapping the competition. He was speaking softly in paragraph-long thoughts about his HBO show, “Wyatt Cenac’s Problem Areas,” his love for animation and his relationship with his modest fame. Simultaneously, he was winning an unspoken competition at Buzz-a-Rama, the only place in New York City where a comedian can destroy all takers in a slot car race while seemingly not trying. Mr. Cenac’s drowsiness is an illusion. “Problem Areas” combines elements of a talk show, an animated show and a documentary series, and is perhaps the most structurally ambitious news-comedy hybrid on television. (The second season will have its premiere on April 5.) Among the show’s executive producers are John Oliver and Ezra Edelman (an Oscar-winning documentarian), and its writing staff includes Emma Carmichael, the former editor of Jezebel. Mr. Cenac has a knack for choosing talented collaborators. And also, apparently, for slot car racing. “You’re doing pretty good,” said Frank Perri, as he watched Mr. Cenac’s initial runs around the circular track. Mr. Perri, whom everyone calls Buzz, opened Buzz-a-Rama in the Kensington neighborhood of Brooklyn in 1965. Now 83, he runs the place with his wife, Dolores. He stayed with Mr. Cenac until 2 p.m., when he had to rush off to host a birthday party for a 6-year-old boy named Rocco. Slot cars (so-called because their chassis are fitted with nibs that slot into racing tracks) are operated by remote control. The simplest ones, which are about the length of an adult man’s hand, are fairly easy to get the hang of. The fastest can reach speeds well over 100 miles an hour. Children love them, and so, it turns out, does Mr. Cenac. His earnest response when Mr. Perri showed him some previously operational steering wheels was: “Wow. They’re amazing. Wow. These are great.” It makes sense that Mr. Cenac, who had a peripatetic childhood, would be taken with model cars. Born in New York, he moved to Dallas when he was a young child and returned to Brooklyn over the summers to stay with his grandmother, who lived in Crown Heights. After a friend moved to Cleveland, he started spending parts of the year there as well. “When I was very young, I was given a St. Christopher’s medal,” Mr. Cenac said. “I guess he’s the patron saint of travelers.” Now, he wears a pendant with a picture of a bird on it, which he was wearing at Buzz-a-Rama along with a Muhammad Ali sweatshirt and a patch from the Houston apparel company Grits featuring its cartoon mascot Roscrow. Mr. Cenac, who turns 43 later this month, is single and has lived in his Brooklyn neighborhood for close to a decade. Asked about his personal life, he said: “I don’t think I have much of one. Work kind of dominates everything.” Episodes of “Problem Areas” consist of three sections. In the first, Mr. Cenac explores topics like energy policy and worker protections, adding jokes and animated bits. The second features comic riffs on civic problems (say, the glut of umbrellas whenever it rains) and solutions (government-mandated retractable awnings on every building). The final section, which takes up most of each episode, concentrates on a single subject throughout a season. In the first, the subject was policing; the second will feature education. Mr. Cenac talks about his goals for “Problem Areas” as a journalist might, saying that he is interested in starting a conversation about the issues he has chosen, rather than presenting easy answers. He is less glib about his reporting than his former boss at “The Daily Show,” Jon Stewart, who was known to dismiss questions about the dual role he pioneered. With “Problem Areas,” Mr. Cenac said, “I’m not necessarily saying ‘Oh, here’s the answer for everything.’ But maybe if I show you someone who’s building a staircase you might think, ‘Oh, it’s maybe not as challenging or weird as I thought to build a staircase.’ It’s maybe something worth tackling as opposed to getting caught up in the intractability of ‘we’ll never be able to do this.’” Several times, Mr. Cenac’s blue car went so fast that it plowed into an orange one he was racing, knocking it out of the slot. He would then get up to place them back on track. Asked if, in his fifth decade, he ever felt concerned that his peers were passing him by in some way, he responded that he sometimes felt envious of people who had gotten cool new jobs or bought houses. But, he pointed out: “The only person who’s really keeping score in any way is me. And if I’m keeping that score, is that the healthiest thing for me to be doing?” He would prefer to think about what his show can do better. He returned several times to the idea of change, suggesting that it should be the goal of any good policy, whether it pertains to policing, education or eradicating the accursed umbrella. As he continued to race his car, he made his priority clear: “How do you make it actually work so we don’t have to do the same things over and over again?”",The New York Times
2019,"Wynn Leaders Helped Hide Sexual Misconduct Allegations Against Company’s Founder, Report Says","The Massachusetts gambling regulator found that some Wynn Resorts executives “were part of affirmative efforts to conceal” complaints against Steve Wynn. Executives at the casino operator Wynn Resorts helped hide sexual misconduct allegations against the company’s billionaire founder, Steve Wynn, the Massachusetts gambling regulator said Tuesday. The finding was included in a report released by the regulator, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission, as it began a three-day hearing on whether to allow Wynn Resorts to start operating a $2.6 billion resort near Boston in June as planned. High-ranking company executives knew about the allegations but did not follow company policy — including a zero-tolerance rule against sexual harassment in place since 2004 — and initiate an investigation, according to the report. The executives also failed to report the allegations either to the full Wynn Resorts board or to the board’s audit and compliance committees, the commission found. “In some instances, particular company executives, with the assistance of outside counsel, were part of affirmative efforts to conceal allegations against Mr. Wynn that came to their attention,” the report states. Mr. Wynn was forced to resign as the company’s chairman and chief executive last year, after The Wall Street Journal published articles describing a pattern of sexual misconduct, including accusations that he had pressured employees for sex. The Massachusetts report is the second this year to find that Wynn Resorts executives had failed to confront him. The Massachusetts commission began its inquiry after The Journal’s articles were published. Its report cited some of the same allegations, including one woman’s claim that Mr. Wynn raped her, and detailed the company’s failure to follow its own procedures for addressing them. The commission said Mr. Wynn, 77, had declined to participate in its investigation. A lawyer for him, Brian T. Kelly, said in a statement on Tuesday that Mr. Wynn “denies all allegations of nonconsensual sex and nothing in this report changes that.” Mr. Kelly added that the commission had said that it was not “its role to decide the truth or falsity of those allegations and that Mr. Wynn’s conduct is not the focus of their hearing.” Investigators for the Massachusetts commission note in the report that gambling licensees are expected to report potential violations of industry rules to regulators. “Casinos operate in a framework where their reputation, honesty, good character, integrity and responsible business practices are prerequisites for continued licensure,” they wrote. The report includes a 2005 rape allegation made against Mr. Wynn by a manicurist at the Wynn Las Vegas casino. The claim was eventually conveyed to Wynn Resorts’ chief operating officer, the report said. The company did not conduct an internal investigation or notify the board, the report says. Instead, the woman received a $7.5 million settlement through a limited liability company created to conceal the arrangement’s existence. Mr. Wynn said in a deposition in 2017 that the woman had initiated sex, calling the encounter “bad judgment on my part,” according to the report. Investigators also found that the chief human resources officer and general counsel of Wynn Las Vegas had known in 2006 of an allegation by a former employee that Mr. Wynn had pressured her into a sexual relationship. Neither the board nor regulators in Nevada were informed, the report says. The company reached a $700,000 settlement in 2008 with a woman who said she had a consensual sexual relationship with Mr. Wynn while working for him, the report says, noting that no evidence of an internal investigation was found. Other failings cited by the gambling commission included not properly documenting or recording the allegations and not evaluating potential conflicts of interest involving lawyers representing Wynn Resorts and Mr. Wynn. The report, which relied on a trove documents and on interviews with more than 100 people, also described a company culture that made Wynn Resorts employees fear losing their jobs or simply going unheard if they complained about Mr. Wynn’s behavior. Investigators were unable to speak with some of Mr. Wynn’s accusers or with some people considered potential witnesses, the report says, adding that “fear of potential litigation initiated by Mr. Wynn cannot be discounted as a factor.” The commission said it was aware of three defamation actions that Mr. Wynn had filed recently related to sexual misconduct allegations against him. In February, regulators in Nevada allowed Wynn Resorts to keep its gambling license there but fined the company $20 million for ignoring complaints about Mr. Wynn’s behavior, a finding the company did not contest. The fine was the largest ever imposed against a gambling licensee in Nevada. In a statement, Wynn Resorts said it had cooperated with the commission and did not dispute any of its findings. The company said it had “changed from a founder-led organization to a global enterprise overseen by a capable, independent and accountable board of directors,” separating the chief executive and chairman roles and overhauling the board’s makeup. The company also said that it had cut ties to Mr. Wynn without paying him severance, and that employees who had known of the allegations against him and hadn’t investigated or reported them were no longer at Wynn Resorts. The company’s shares rose more than 4 percent on Tuesday.

2019,Xi Praises a Student Protest in China. From 100 Years Ago.,"BEIJING — One hundred years after thousands of Chinese students marched on Tiananmen Square in a watershed revolt, President Xi Jinping seized on the event Tuesday to burnish his brand of authoritarian nationalism. Mr. Xi gave a stark display of the Communist Party’s determination to control the legacy of the movement that has inspired both friends and foes of party rule. The May 4, 1919, protest against Western colonialism had inflamed Chinese nationalism and helped spread a wave of ideas rejecting Chinese tradition and hierarchy. In a speech marking the centenary of the event, Mr. Xi extolled the patriotic image of May 4 while ignoring its anti-authority themes. “History profoundly reveals that patriotism has flowed in the blood of the Chinese nation since ancient times,” Mr. Xi said in the Great Hall of the People, next to Tiananmen Square. “Those who are unpatriotic, who would even go so far as to cheat and betray the motherland, are a disgrace in the eyes of their own country and the whole world.” “Chinese youth in the new era must obey the party and follow the party,” Mr. Xi said. May 4 is one of several politically charged anniversaries that the Communist Party must carefully manage — or muffle — this year. The party has reason to be on guard: The anniversary of May 4 has prompted protests in the past, including pro-democracy demonstrations at Tiananmen Square in 1989 that soldiers extinguished in a night of carnage on June 3-4 that year. The party is also grappling with slowing growth that has magnified its fear of popular unrest. Officials have told schools to guard against displays of discontent around May 4 and other “sensitive” dates, according to notices on government websites. “From the start of the school term, they told us that this is no ordinary year and is very sensitive, so don’t speak out of line,” said Guo Yuhua, an outspoken professor of sociology at Tsinghua University. The May 4 protests in 1919 broke out after victorious Western powers at postwar peace talks in Paris decided to let Japan keep colonial territory in eastern China that Japan had seized from Germany, ignoring promises of national self-determination. Many Chinese had hoped that the territory would be returned in recognition of China’s siding with the Allies in the war. Angered by their country’s inability to stand up to Western governments, students in the Chinese capital marched. This year, millions of Chinese students are relearning the official lessons of 1919, stripped of any suggestion that they should ever take to the streets. In lectures and displays, they have been told that China will never again be bullied. “It’s all about keeping a patriotic spirit alive,” Wu Mingke, an accountancy student, said last week while walking with three friends through an exhibition about May 4 in a museum in the former campus of Peking University, where many demonstrators had studied. “When China demanded its territory back after the First World War, the world didn’t listen to us. Now, I think, they have to listen.” Mr. Xi was the latest Communist Party leader to retell the May 4 story to fit his agenda. Generations of Chinese students have absorbed textbooks that present the 1919 protests as a prelude to the founding of the Communist Party in 1921 and its unstoppable victory. And leaders since Mao Zedong, a provincial activist in the May 4 era, have used the movement to court or admonish students and intellectuals. “Even authoritarian states have to have some kind of story they tell the people about why they deserve to rule,” said Jeffrey Wasserstrom, a professor of history at the University of California, Irvine. The May 4 story of national awakening served Mr. Xi’s promise of a “new era” of confident Chinese power, Professor Wasserstrom added. “You can see why a tightly controlled version of May 4 could serve this kind of new-era rhetoric.” In 1919, the crowds of banner-waving students wearing traditional gowns tried to present their demands to Western diplomatic missions in Beijing and a few burned down the home of a Chinese politician they blamed for bowing to Japan. The protests spread across China. Officials agreed to free students arrested on May 4 and refused to sign the Treaty of Versailles, a symbolic victory for the students, though the territory remained in Japanese hands. But for other Chinese, the 1919 protests can evoke memories unwelcome to the party. The May 4 movement erupted after a time of intellectual ferment in China — later called the New Culture Movement — in which students called for “Mr. Science and Mr. Democracy,” or a free society unfettered by tradition, and explored anarchism, feminism, socialism and individualism. That anti-authority legacy of the May 4 era has offered inspiration for critics of the party. In 1989, the 70th anniversary of the 1919 protests drew hundreds of thousands of students on to the streets during the Tiananmen protests. This year, universities have promoted benign commemorative activities, like a “May 4 Youth Race” at Peking University. It will pass through the Old Summer Palace, an imperial garden ransacked by British and French troops in 1860, creating ruins that are now a symbol of national grievance. In recent months, the police have mounted an intense offensive against dozens of Marxist students in Beijing who supported aggrieved workers in southern China, some citing May 4 as an inspiration. Officials have also tried to silence Xu Zhangrun, a professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing who, starting in July, issued a series of essays that made stinging criticisms of the Communist Party. In March, Tsinghua suspended him and put him under investigation. On Sunday, security police in plain clothes kept watch as Professor Xu gathered with two dozen or so friends and well-wishers to lay flowers at an inscribed stone memorial that commemorates Wang Guowei, a Tsinghua scholar, for his “independence of spirit and freedom of thought.” May 4 represented a time when Chinese people, especially students and scholars, “awoke” to their right and duty to speak out about the country’s political future, Professor Xu said by text message. “Commemorating May 4 today must still be founded in this ‘awakening,’” he said. But Lin Xianzhi, a writer in southern China, said that a few weeks ago publishers backed out of reissuing his book, “The Spirit of May 4,” which stresses the iconoclastic side of that time and was last published in 2012. “Ten years ago I wrote that the spirit of May 4 was dead,” Mr. Lin said. “Today it’s even more dead.” Part of the reason officials are concerned about students is economic. This year 8.3 million will graduate from Chinese universities and colleges — more than ever. Quite a few are likely to have a hard time finding jobs that meet their expectations. Still, few students appeared ready to challenge Mr. Xi’s message of loyal unity under the party. “It’s really shocking to see this history,” said Pang Tianjin, a high school freshman, gesturing at the museum exhibition for the May 4 movement. “The student protesters back then were so brave.” And how would he be marking the day of the centenary? “Well, protesting is out of the question,” he said. “You’d get detained right away.”",The New York Times
2019,Y.A. Novels That Let Teenage Boys Be Vulnerable,"Children’s Books Larger-than-life heroes like Captain America, Batman and Superman now grace our screens year-round, projecting an idea of masculinity characterized by unfettered strength. Yet ask any teenage boy what growing up is like, and he’ll likely give answers that are starkly different from the endless displays of male determination and domination we often see in entertainment. Rather, the process of growing up can make even the most confident of boys feel lost, aimless, confused and powerless. Three new Y.A. novels explore that tension, showcasing different tenors of young male vulnerability. In BARELY MISSING EVERYTHING (Atheneum, 320 pp., $17.99; ages 12 and up), Matt Mendez gives us a peek into the lives of three people — Mexican-Americans living near the border — who have lost their way: Juan, a star basketball player who has a run-in with the law; JD, Juan’s best friend; and Fabi, Juan’s mom. Each is spiraling for different reasons. Juan is arrested at a party after a basketball game and his ankle is injured in the process. Now he’s worried that his injury will jeopardize his basketball career, casting doubt over a potential scholarship and his future. JD is an aspiring filmmaker, but his home life is thrown into turmoil when his father’s affair comes to light. And Fabi is trying her best to care for Juan while feeling aimless herself, when she unexpectedly receives a letter from an ex-boyfriend who is on death row and is scheduled to be executed on Valentine’s Day. If that sounds like a lot of plot, that’s because it is. And there’s also a pseudo-love interest in Roxanne, a leering gang that seems to have it in for Juan and JD, and a mystery over Juan’s parentage, just to name a few other plot points. Oh, and an interlude delivered from the perspective of … an algebra test? All these story lines struggle for airtime. Toward the beginning of the novel, Juan reads the letter from Fabi’s ex-boyfriend and assumes the man is his father, but that plot is set aside, and referenced sporadically, until Juan and JD come up with a plan to visit the jail almost 100 pages later. Roxanne first appears as a girl whom Juan tries to flirt with at school, and then she isn’t seen again until a few chapters later, suddenly reappearing as Juan’s friend’s cousin, who turns into Juan’s math tutor. (In addition to worrying about his ankle, Juan must pass his algebra test or else he’s off the team.) But despite a brief flirtation between the two, Roxanne never fully develops as a character. And the aforementioned gang pops in and out of the book, making you too often forget they’re even there, until they precipitate a conclusion that feels rushed. Still, Mendez offers enticing glimpses of Mexican-American life, and he has an uncanny ability to capture the aimless bluster of young boys posturing at confidence, behaving rashly to mask feeling insecure. “JD wondered what everything would look like outside the city limits, once they were no longer in the desert,” he writes. “How different would the air be? The landscape? The look of the sky? Would he be able to breathe the difference or feel it somehow? Would he be different? Could he be?” In meditations like this, we can almost feel the existential claustrophobia of adolescence. If only Mendez had dived more deeply into those themes. Zack Smedley’s DEPOSING NATHAN (Page Street Kids, 400 pp., $17.99; ages 12 and up) has a propulsive start: “What you have to understand about Cam — and this is important — is that up until he jammed a shard of ceramic in my gut, he was the best friend I’ve ever had.” Nate has been called to give sworn testimony against Cam, and the book is told through a present-day deposition and extended flashbacks that track our two characters until the moment of this climactic fight. The result is an interesting tale in its own right, told in a surprising form — a stylistic experiment that becomes a charming look at the formation and deterioration of an unlikely friendship between two boys who are both lost in their own ways. Nate is trying to get through high school under the ever-increasing pressure of his abusive aunt, and Cam is the new kid in school who has an eidetic memory, resulting in “memory attacks,” where he is unable to stop remembering painful instants from his past. Midway through, “Deposing Nathan” pivots into a deft exploration of sexuality. Cam and Nate realize they are bisexual and may or may not be in love with each other, all the while grappling with their personal religious beliefs and achieving varying degrees of self-acceptance. It’s a rewarding twist, especially considering that in the canon of L.G.B.T.Q. literature, the “B” for bisexual is not as often represented as some of the other letters are. Some of the plot feels predictable, especially a surprise that comes at the end of the deposition, and sometimes the dialogue feels over the top. Still, “Deposing Nathan” is a superb story, told in an original and masterly way. Smedley navigates the novel’s refreshing ideas about sexuality and religion with grace and intelligence. And most of all, Nate and Cam’s friendship feels complex, authentic and heartwarming, both when it’s at its most ridiculous and when it’s at its most painful. Rather than exploring vulnerability from within, Tony Johnston and María Elena Fontanot de Rhoads’s BEAST RIDER (Amulet, 176 pp., $17.99; ages 12 and up) tracks the greater systems outside of us that can leave us feeling exposed and defenseless. The book details the journey of Manuel, a boy from Oaxaca, Mexico, who leaves his home to travel north and cross the border to the United States. His mode of transportation? La Bestia, “a network of freight trains that move from Southern Mexico to the U.S. border,” Johnston and Fontanot de Rhoads explain in an authors’ note. Manuel doesn’t initially plan on making the journey, despite missing his brother Toño, who rode the Beast a few years prior and now lives undocumented in Los Angeles. But when Manuel discovers a young boy who is injured and eventually dies from wounds sustained during his time on the Beast, inspiration strikes: Manuel dreams that the boy tells him, “I failed, but you — a sign, as sure as anything!” Yet the trip is anything but simple. Manuel is soon robbed, and that’s just the start of a series of obstacles — from gangs to the police — that Manuel must face. “Beast Rider” is a short book, coming in at 176 quick pages, a good choice for readers toward the younger end of the Y.A. spectrum. And that is the book’s greatest strength and its biggest weakness. Some plot points and emotional beats feel as if they end before they even get started. For instance, midway through his journey, Manuel wants to call his family back home, but when he reaches into his pocket, he discovers that the slip of paper with his family’s phone number is missing. It’s a chapter-ending cliffhanger … that is resolved two pages later when Manuel realizes that he actually memorized the phone numbers. Yet given that the plight of Latinos fleeing to the North is such a big and important subject, it’s impressive how much information Johnston and Fontanot de Rhoads are able to share, so economically: the violence migrants face during their journey to the States, the help from strangers they receive along the way, the danger that can be found at the border, and the challenges that new immigrants face when they’re in the United States. This novel is as sharp as it is brief.",The New York Times
2019,Yale Museum of British Art Chooses Dia Curator as Its Director,"The Yale Center for British Art announced Wednesday that it had named Courtney J. Martin as its new director. Ms. Martin is currently deputy director and chief curator of the Dia Art Foundation in New York. In an interview, Ms. Martin described the appointment as an “opportunity to expand what we think of as British art, not only for the 20th and 21st centuries, but for all periods.” One of her priorities as director will be to reposition British art within a global framework of migration and cultural exchange. “The museum has amazing collections of art that might have once been described as coming from the Commonwealth, and I would really like to show more works that come from the South Pacific and South Asia,” she said. “There are notable links between British artists working outside of the country and artists born in those places.” Ms. Martin has deep experience with British art, particularly of the postcolonial era. She has written extensively on the Pakistani-born artist and editor Rasheed Araeen, and in 2012 she organized an exhibition of the Guyanese-British painter Frank Bowling at Tate Britain in London. The new role at the Yale Center in New Haven, the biggest repository for British art outside Britain, is a homecoming for Ms. Martin, who earned her Ph.D. in art history at Yale, writing her dissertation on British art of the 1970s. Ms. Martin came to Dia in 2015 as an adjunct curator, organizing the first New York exhibition in over two decades of the painter Robert Ryman. She became chief curator two years later, and she and her team gradually expanded the foundation’s purview to include a fuller range of abstract artists of the 1960s and ’70s. Artists exhibited at Dia in New York City and in Beacon, N.Y., during her tenure included Dorothea Rockburne, Mary Corse and Nancy Holt. A major presentation by Sam Gilliam, the Washington-based painter, opens this summer. [Read more about the Louis Kahn building here.] Ms. Martin will begin her new position in July. She succeeds Amy Meyers, who has led the Center since 2002 and who oversaw the renovation of its renowned building, designed by the modernist architect Louis Kahn. The museum reopened in 2016 after a year-and-a-half closure.",The New York Times
2019,Yankees Add Giancarlo Stanton and Miguel Andujar to a Crowded Injury List,"A rough start to the 2019 season got significantly worse for the Yankees on Monday. In a surprising announcement in the morning, the already-bruised Yankees placed their star outfielder Giancarlo Stanton on the injured list with a left biceps strain. Then, 30 minutes before the start of a 3-1 win over the Detroit Tigers on Monday night, the team announced that third baseman Miguel Andujar had joined the list with a right shoulder injury that might require a season-ending operation. Stanton, a crucial power hitter, and Andujar, the American League rookie of the year runner-up last season, exhibited no obvious signs of injury during a season-opening series loss to the lowly Baltimore Orioles. Andujar, 24, hurt his shoulder while sliding back into third base in the fourth inning of Sunday’s 7-5 loss to the Orioles. But he finished the game, reporting no problems. Scheduled to be off on Monday, he visited the trainer’s room to have the shoulder checked and then was sent for a magnetic resonance imaging exam, which revealed a torn labrum. Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said the team would try therapy for Andujar and then re-evaluate his shoulder in a couple of weeks to see if surgery seemed necessary. “His physical test with the doctor is really good, so there is some optimism that, treated conservatively, he can respond and come back and play,” Boone said. “But we’ll know that in a couple weeks.” In his absence, the Yankees will lean on D.J. LeMahieu at third base, and they have called up the utility man Tyler Wade from Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. The list of key Yankees who are either injured or still returning from injury now contains eight players: Stanton, Andujar, shortstop Didi Gregorius, outfielders Aaron Hicks and Jacoby Ellsbury, and pitchers Dellin Betances, C. C. Sabathia and Luis Severino. In that group, there are a combined 17 All-Star appearances, one Cy Young Award winner (Sabathia) and one most valuable player (Stanton). “It’s unfortunate right now,” Stanton said before the game, “but I guess it’s better to be in the beginning than at the end of the year.” Stanton, 29, played every inning of the Orioles series in left field and was 2 for 8 at the plate with four strikeouts and seven walks. He later revealed that he felt discomfort while swinging during a third-inning at-bat on the chilly Sunday evening. He considered alerting Yankees coaches but instead chalked it up to a cramp. When the tightness in his arm persisted after the game and he started thinking it had affected the quickness of his swing, Stanton informed the team. A magnetic resonance imaging examination revealed a Grade 1 strain — the mildest on a scale of three — so Stanton will be shut down for 10 days and, according to Boone, could return at any point this month. “I don’t like it at all,” Stanton said. “Just worked for six weeks to get here, plus the off-season. I’d much rather this would’ve popped in spring training. But that’s where we’re at. I don’t have to start from scratch when I come back.” ” Still, as the injuries have piled up during spring training and in the early days of the season, the Yankees’ depth has been getting a stiff early test. “People asked me all spring how I like the team, and I tell people I love the team not just because of the guys we have in the room but the depth that we have,” outfielder Brett Gardner said. “Obviously we’re not expecting to get that depth tested this early on, but here we are April 1 and already making moves. Guys will just have to step up and get the job done.” Against the Tigers, the remaining Yankees provided victory. Domingo German, a rotation fill-in, provided five stout innings while catcher Gary Sanchez and Gardner each homered. Betances may be among the first of the injured Yankees to return this month, as Boone said he was progressing well after shoulder inflammation late in spring training. Sabathia, who is serving a five-game suspension stemming from an episode in which he threw at Tampa Bay’s Jesus Sucre in a game last fall, is also expected back this month. Once his suspension ends, Sabathia will move to the I.L. since he is a few weeks behind his fellow starting pitchers because of off-season operations on his heart and knee. Severino is expected back from a shoulder injury in May, and Gregorius is expected to return from Tommy John surgery sometime during the summer. It is unclear when Ellsbury, who missed all of the 2018 season and was originally expected to be ready for spring training, could be ready for the major leagues since he is still recovering from hip surgery last year and a flare-up of a foot ailment. Hicks’s nagging back injury has improved recently, but it required two cortisone shots. He has been out since March 1 and has not yet resumed baseball activities. “I don’t think it’s going to be deep into the season by any means, but he’s still got some weeks to go,” Boone said. The Yankees once had six outfielders on the roster, but now three are on the I.L. Their outfield options now consist of Aaron Judge; Clint Frazier, who was also called up from Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on Monday; Michael Tauchman, who was acquired in a trade just before the season began; and Gardner. Boone said Frazier would play frequently in Stanton’s absence. Frazier, once a top prospect who missed most of last season with a concussion, has hit .238 in limited opportunities in the major leagues over the past two years but made improvements to his swing this spring.",The New York Times
2019,Yankees Lose to Astros and Send Luis Severino for More Tests,"HOUSTON — In a young season already defined by injuries, the Yankees have sent their best pitcher for further tests on his throwing shoulder after his rehabilitation efforts stalled. Luis Severino, 25, the staff ace, has not been able to throw off a mound as he tries to recover from rotator cuff inflammation in his right shoulder. After he did long tosses on flat ground at the team’s spring training facility in Tampa, Fla., over the weekend, Severino “didn’t feel as great” as he had after recent tosses, Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said Monday night, before the team’s 4-3 loss to the Houston Astros. Severino was sent to New York to be evaluated by Christopher Ahmad, the team’s head doctor. Boone said Severino was expected to have a magnetic resonance imaging examination on Tuesday, and perhaps other tests. Boone said Severino’s shoulder felt “O.K., but just not where he wants to be.” And the Yankees (5-5) are unsure why the pitcher’s shoulder hasn’t felt ready for him to get on a mound, the next step in the throwing program. Severino last threw from 130 feet on flat ground. “I’m hoping it’s just him not able to get over the hump quite yet,” Boone said. “The original testing that we did with him led us to be pretty confident,” he added. “But we’ve got to make sure he’s right. The fact that he hasn’t graduated from the flat ground throwing yet to the mound, we’ve got to try and answer those questions as best we can.” Severino is one of the Yankees’ major-league-leading 11 players on the injured list. The Yankees have nearly $87 million in 2019 salaries on the I.L., which includes stars like outfielder Giancarlo Stanton and reliever Dellin Betances and standouts such as outfielder Aaron Hicks and starter pitcher C. C. Sabathia, who is expected to return this weekend. Before this, Severino had not been on the I.L. since May 2016, when he had a strained right triceps. Severino has been out since March 5, when he was scratched from his first spring training start because of discomfort in his throwing shoulder. An M.R.I. exam then revealed only rotator cuff inflammation, according to the Yankees, and Severino received a prescription for an injection, anti-inflammatory medication and rest. In order to complete a four-year $40 million contract extension in February, Severino passed a physical, which included an M.R.I. exam. Severino originally was not expected back from the injury until sometime in May. Until the latest tests are done, it will be unclear whether that estimate will change. The Yankees can ill afford to lose Severino, a two-time All-Star and one of the best starters in the American League, for a significant period of time. But the rotation has managed without him so far. With solid pitching from Masahiro Tanaka and James Paxton, plus the fill-ins Domingo German and Jonathan Loaisiga, the Yankees’ rotation entered Monday with a 3.09 earned run average, ranking eighth in the majors. Tanaka fired six strong innings on Monday, allowing one run on a homer by Houston’s Jose Altuve. The Yankees took a 3-1 lead into the seventh inning, partly because of a solo homer that Aaron Judge hit off Justin Verlander in the fifth. But relievers Zack Britton and Adam Ottavino, neither of whom had been scored upon this season, allowed a combined three runs. A cueball infield single by Carlos Correa that went between Ottavino and first baseman Greg Bird in the eighth inning brought Alex Bregman home, giving the Astros the winning margin. “He couldn’t bunt it better than that,” Bird said.",The New York Times
2019,Yankees Send Red Sox Deeper Into Their Early-Season Gloom,"On Baseball The Boston Red Sox welcomed back the veteran catcher Sandy Leon for Tuesday’s game in the Bronx. Leon usually coaxes the best from Chris Sale, their struggling ace, so the Red Sox summoned him from the minors and dropped Blake Swihart from the roster. Swihart, a first-round draft choice eight years ago, never quite reached his potential in Boston. Mookie Betts, the Red Sox’ fifth-round pick from the same draft, won the Most Valuable Player Award in the American League last season. “The first day I stepped in here with the Red Sox, back in 2011, he was there,” Betts said on Tuesday night, after another dreary day for the defending World Series champions. “We’ve been tight ever since. It’s definitely tough. But I’m kind of happy for him — new beginning.” The Red Sox could all use a new beginning. They have dropped 12 of their first 18 games, the latest an 8-0 loss featuring a masterpiece by the Yankees’ James Paxton on Tuesday. The Red Sox have not started this badly since 1996, Roger Clemens’s last season at Fenway Park. As a hard-throwing strikeout artist, Sale is an heir to Clemens and Pedro Martinez. He has filled the role so well that Boston gave him a five-year, $145 million contract extension in March, through 2024. Sale, 30, has 1,803 career strikeouts, the most by any pitcher through 1,500 innings, a threshold he crossed in the bottom of the fifth on Tuesday. But at that point the Yankees had already scored four runs off him, with big hits off his fastball (by DJ LeMahieu), his changeup (by Clint Frazier) and his slider (by Mike Tauchman). Sale has lost all four of his starts this season, with an 8.50 E.R.A. His fastballs were harder and his sliders sharper on Tuesday, but he would accept no positive feedback after five mostly lackluster innings. He could not remember ever pitching this poorly, he said. “I’m not going to sugarcoat it: I just flat-out stink right now,” Sale said, adding later, “This is flat-out embarrassing — for my family, for my team, for our fans. This is about as bad as it gets. I have to pitch better.” So do his teammates. Boston’s starters have a 7.18 E.R.A., the highest in the majors, part of a team-wide slump despite having no significant injuries — unlike the Yankees, who have 12 players on the injured list. “We’re healthy and we’re not playing good baseball,” Red Sox Manager Alex Cora said. “We’ve been inconsistent in every aspect of the game: pitching, offense, defense, base running. It’s on us to clean it up and start playing better. “When we do that, we’re one of the best teams in the big leagues, if not the best. But at the same time, right now, we’re not. We know where we’re at, we know the way we’ve been playing, and we know the things that we have to get better at. And it’s pretty simple: Get better at everything.” The Yankees are only 7-9, and Tuesday marked the first time since 1992 that the rivals had played each other at least 15 games into a season with both of them under .500. But this game was the Yankees’ best of the season, with contributions at the plate and in the field from Frazier, Tauchman and Gio Urshela, all reinforcements for the wounded. “Got to roll with it,” Manager Aaron Boone said. “I’m sure you guys are a little sick of me saying, ‘Next man up,’ but it truly is the case.” Paxton, who arrived in an off-season trade from Seattle, was supposed to be a headliner, and on Tuesday, he was. It was not the best performance of his career — he is the last major leaguer to throw a complete-game no-hitter, for the Mariners last May — but it was close: eight shutout innings with two hits, 12 strikeouts, a walk and a hit batter. The last Yankee to fire eight scoreless innings with at least 12 strikeouts against Boston was the Hall of Famer Mike Mussina, in his near-perfect game on Sept. 2, 2001. “Throwing a lot of strikes, keeping it out of the middle of the plate — even when it was, he’s got good life on his fastball,” said Betts, who struck out looking on 97 miles-per-hour heat to start the game. “He pitched an amazing game.” Betts is hitting .212, part of Boston’s meager .229 team average, which is worse than every major league team’s final average in 2018. That underscores the moderating effects of a long season, and there is no reason to think that a healthy Red Sox roster will continue to struggle. But the bigger problem for the Red Sox is the strength of their top competition. Even without Luis Severino, the Yankees should contend because their rotation — Paxton, J.A. Happ, Masahiro Tanaka, CC Sabathia and Domingo German — remains relatively solid. And the Tampa Bay Rays are for real, with a major league-best 13-4 record and the best pitching staff in the majors. The Red Sox, for now, can only look inward. They cannot concern themselves with the Yankees, the Rays, or anyone else. “If we play well, we’ll worry about other things,” said Dave Dombrowski, Boston’s president of baseball operations. “But if we play the way we’re playing now, it won’t really make much difference.”",The New York Times
2019,Yankees and Flyers Will Stop Playing Kate Smith After Discovering Racist Songs,"For the Yankees, Kate Smith’s version of “God Bless America” was a staple of the seventh-inning stretch since 2001. For the Philadelphia Flyers, the connection was even tighter, with Smith serving as a mascot of sorts for the team’s 1970s Stanley Cup winners, and performing live at games. Now both teams have announced they will stop playing Smith’s version of “God Bless America” after discovering that she sang songs with racist lyrics in the 1930s. The Flyers will also cover a statue of Smith that has been in front of their arena since 1987. Smith, who died in 1986, is most closely identified with “God Bless America,” but she recorded numerous other songs over her long career. Among them were “Pickaninny Heaven” and “That’s Why Darkies Were Born,” which contain disturbing lyrics that demean black people. The Yankees used Smith’s “God Bless America” early in the season but stopped after an email from a fan alerted them to Smith’s racially insensitive work. “The Yankees have been made aware of a recording that had been previously unknown to us and decided to immediately and carefully review this new information,” a team spokesman said. “The Yankees take social, racial and cultural insensitivities very seriously. And while no final conclusions have been made, we are erring on the side of sensitivity.” The Flyers said in a statement: “We have recently become aware that several songs performed by Kate Smith contain offensive lyrics that do not reflect our values as an organization. As we continue to look into this serious matter, we are removing Kate Smith’s recording of ‘God Bless America’ from our library and covering up the statue that stands outside of our arena.” The Flyers have a tradition of playing Smith’s version of “God Bless America” as a replacement for the national anthem at big games. The song has been said to bring the team good luck. Smith performed it live before Game 6 of the 1974 Stanley Cup final, the game in which the Flyers won their first Cup. The Daily News first reported that the Yankees had stopped playing their recording of Smith. Like many white singers of her era, Smith sang some songs that at best are dated and insensitive and at worst are downright racist. In “Pickaninny Heaven,” Smith sings of a place where “great big watermelons roll around and get in your way.” “Pickaninny” is a demeaning term for a black child. In the 1933 film “Hello Everybody,” Smith sings the song to a group of black orphans listening on the radio. “That’s Why Darkies Were Born” begins: “Someone had to pick the cotton,/ Someone had to pick the corn,/ Someone had to slave and be able to sing,/ That’s why darkies were born.” The lyrics also include: “Sing, sing, sing when you’re weary and sing when you’re blue/ Sing, sing, that’s what you taught all the white folks to do.” The song was also recorded by the black singer and civil rights activist Paul Robeson, although “one has to think that Robeson’s take on the lyrics was decidedly ironic,” Steven Carl Tracy wrote in “Hot Music, Ragmentation and the Bluing of American Literature.” Jeffrey Magee, the director of the school of music at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the author of the book “Irving Berlin’s American Musical Theater,” said songs like “Pickaninny Heaven” and “That’s Why Darkies Were Born” reflected racial attitudes embedded in the cultural fabric of Smith’s era. “To have shaped pop music in this country necessarily implicates musicians and songwriters in a history of racial exchange, impersonation and appropriation,” Magee said. “Kate Smith was inexorably part of that. She became a pop star on a foundation of songs like these.” Magee noted that other popular white musicians of the 1930s, including Sophie Tucker, May Irwin and George M. Cohan, known as the father of Broadway, regularly performed minstrel songs, sometimes in blackface. “The difference is you’re not going to find Cohan on YouTube,” Magee said.",The New York Times
2019,"Yankees, With 3 Blasts by Gary Sanchez, Cap Homer-Driven Sweep of Orioles","Yankees 15, Orioles 3 BALTIMORE — Gary Sanchez stepped to the plate in the ninth inning on Sunday with a chance at history. Four-homer games are more rare than perfect games, and Sanchez had already gone long three times on Sunday as part of an offensive explosion by the wounded Yankees that produced 14 home runs against the Baltimore Orioles this weekend. With the goal of the at-bat so clear, and with Hanser Alberto, an infielder, on the mound, Sanchez was under enormous pressure to go deep a fourth time. “I tried to do what everyone was thinking about,” Sanchez said, smiling. “But some anxiety didn’t let me hit it.” It did not matter that Sanchez flew out to left field. With seven home runs on Sunday, the Yankees still drubbed the Orioles, 15-3, to improve their record to 5-4 and cap a three-game sweep in which 26 of their 29 runs came via the long ball. “That would’ve been a way to top off,” left fielder Clint Frazier, who clubbed two home runs himself, said of Sanchez. “But three homers isn’t too bad, either.” Fault Sanchez, the Yankees’ primary catcher, for certain aspects of his game; he has made a handful of baserunning and defensive miscues a week and a half into the season. But do not fault him — or, for that matter, the Yankees’ depleted lineup — for a lack of power. Serving as the designated hitter on Sunday, Sanchez produced career highs in home runs and runs batted in (six). The four hits and four R.B.I. by Frazier, who missed most of last season because of a concussion, were also career bests. “I just feel healthier this year, and I feel better,” said Sanchez, who endured the worst all-around season of his career in 2018 along with off-season surgery on his nonthrowing shoulder. “And I hope to keep doing that.” After the game, Sanchez grinned while describing how thrilled he was with his performance at the plate. His six home runs over all pace a Yankees squad that has 11 players on the injured list. Although the injured hitters Miguel Andujar, Didi Gregorius, Giancarlo Stanton and Aaron Hicks accounted for 119 of the Yankees’ major-league-record 267 homers last season, the lineup still showed off its firepower against the Orioles, who are rebuilding after posting the worst record in baseball in 2018. “Sometimes, it takes the whole 40-man roster,” Frazier said, adding later, “We’re someone to still be worried about whenever we come to town.” The power display, which also featured home runs by shortstop Gleyber Torres and catcher Austin Romine, supported the stout pitching of Domingo German, who did not allow a hit until the sixth inning. German has pitched well in two starts for a rotation lacking the ace Luis Severino and C. C. Sabathia, who might return from the I.L. next weekend. “Now I have the opportunity, I’m doing everything I can to show all my work on the field,” German said. “Every start I want to execute like it’s my last.” At the plate last year, the Yankees led baseball with 51 percent of their runs coming via homers. They were second entering Sunday. “Never too much for us,” Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said. “I’m always good with us hitting as much as we need to.” The Yankees needed Sanchez now, and on Sunday he reinforced the team decision makers’ faith in him — previous defensive and baserunning miscues and all. “He’s a great player that’s still growing, and it’s our job to help him continue to reach his peak in every facet of the game,” Boone said. “He’s making strides in a lot of areas of the game. And we know we’ve got a special talent on our hands and a guy that impacts the game — period.” INSIDE PITCH Sunday’s win was the 2,000th of Brian Cashman’s 22-season tenure as the Yankees’ general manager.",The New York Times
2019,Yeti Footprints Found in Nepal Are Maybe (Definitely) From a Bear,"Someone found the footprints of a yeti, yet again. Mountaineers from the Indian Army spotted the 32-inch footprints near the Makalu Base Camp in Nepal, the army said Monday on Twitter. It is unclear if the expedition team was serious about its findings or conducting a trolling experiment on its followers. Photos the team posted show several long prints in the snow, one directly in front of the other. Twitter users immediately responded to the tweet, calling the footprints a “yeti catwalk” or saying that the yeti was “hopping” because the footprints were in a line instead of side by side. Others tweeted that it was a “mythological one-legged creature.” One asked the army to please “delete this tweet to avoid international embarrassment of India.” But what is a yeti? Could these footprints have been from one? And if yetis are real, how could they have existed for so long without posting a single selfie? The yeti is the mysterious cousin of Bigfoot, both part of the same extremely elusive family. They are part human and part creature — the best of both worlds, if you will. Legends of hairy, oversize hominids lurking at the outer reaches of civilization have been around for centuries and are part of the folklore of several cultures. The extraordinary thing about the footprints is that they are 32 inches long, Daniel C. Taylor, author of “Yeti: The Ecology of a Mystery,” said. “The only animal that has made a footprint that long is a dinosaur.” Because a single, lonely animal cannot survive on its own, according to Mr. Taylor, there are two possibilities. Either there is a population of dinosaur-size creatures roaming the mountains of Nepal, or — and this idea is supported by basic logic — the footprints were created by a bear and its cub. The footprints in the photos appear to lead into bushes, Mr. Taylor noted, where he said he would expect to find a clearer set of prints — “not the one that is out in the sun and melted.” “I am not interested in the one footprint as I am in the trail of what the footprint leads to,” said Mr. Taylor, who is also president of Future Generations University. He added that the prints would eventually lead to a bear and her cub. “In every case you will find that all yeti footprints were made by the Himalayan black bear, Ursus thibetanus,” he said. Most people could probably distinguish a bear’s paw print from the footprint of a half-human creature. But a bear’s paw is not necessarily three feet long, so how to explain these prints? “The front foot of the mama bear goes down and the back foot goes down so you have an overprint,” Mr. Taylor explained. The footprint becomes 32 inches long “when a baby cub hops behind the mother,” he said. The cub hopping behind the mother, combined with the snow slightly melting around the edges of the print, could very clearly create a 32-inch-long print. Still, that does not mean yetis do not exist. In his research, Mr. Taylor discovered what he considers the three types of yetis. The first yeti Mr. Taylor identified is the legend. “That yeti is very much like Santa Claus,” he said. The second yeti “is the yeti that lives inside of people,” Mr. Taylor said. That yeti is fueled by humans’ need to be closer to nature. As humans increasingly live in cities, and as climate change begins to endanger Earth’s least populated, most remote natural places, humans indulge their inner yeti to be closer to nature, according to Mr. Taylor. “We are seeing more yeti sightings now — or footprints now — than we did 20 years ago,” he said. “The third and final yeti is the one that actually made the footprints,” Mr. Taylor said: the mama bear and her cub. “I would love for the yeti to exist, but I have never found any yeti evidence that I can’t explain,” he added. “Nothing would make me happier than to find a yeti.” Perhaps the most likely possibility? That the footprints lead to the yeti inside of everyone.",The New York Times
2019,"Yisroel Avrohom Portugal, Revered Orthodox Rabbi, Dies at 95","He had no more than a few hundred followers and no cavernous synagogue or prestigious yeshiva as his base. Yet Rabbi Yisroel Avrohom Portugal, the grand rabbi of the tiny Skulen Hasidic sect, a slender man with a broad, snowy beard and long white sidelocks, was revered throughout the growing ultra-Orthodox world. On April 2, tens of thousands of black-hatted and black-garbed Hasidic men from every major sect crammed the thoroughfares of Borough Park, Brooklyn, for his funeral. The jostling columns stretched for blocks along 14th Avenue and spilled into the radiating side streets. Mourners stood riveted to the eulogies piped through loudspeakers. They then thronged the black-draped coffin, hoping to help support it, as it seemed to float atop the crowd on its way to a hearse. A similar outpouring came later, in a more rural setting: Monsey, N.Y., in Rockland County. There, a long ribbon of Hasidim followed the coffin as it was carried to the cemetery of the Viznitz Hasidim. Rabbi Portugal had died the day before at 95, at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, succumbing to an infection he had had for months, said Yosef Rapaport, a media consultant for Agudath Israel of America, the ultra-Orthodox umbrella group. Yossi Gestetner, a founder of the Orthodox Jewish Public Affairs Council, said Rabbi Portugal may have been the last of the Hasidic grand rabbis who survived the ordeals of both the Holocaust and the Iron Curtain and rebuilt their communities in New York and Israel. “He exemplifies the two great challenges that the Orthodox community faced, the darkest part of Jewish history of the last hundred years,” Mr. Gestetner said. “He and his father suffered from them both and came out strong on the other side.” Rabbi Portugal and his father, Rabbi Eliezer Zusia Portugal, rescued and cared for more than 300 Jewish children orphaned by the German effort to exterminate the Jews of Europe. They eventually settled with many of them in Bucharest, Romania. There, the Communist authorities jailed father and son for five months on charges of teaching Torah and smuggling children into Israel. The two were tortured, some reports said. Outraged, prominent American Jews in 1959 successfully prevailed on Dag Hammarskjold, the United Nations secretary general, to intervene, and the Portugals were freed. They emigrated to the United States in 1960. In Borough Park, Rabbi Portugal gained a reputation for compassion and a spare and humble lifestyle: He ate one meal a day and was said to get little sleep. On any given day he drew long lines to the door of his home for blessings and counseling. “If someone told him her tsoris, he would literally cry,” Mr. Rapaport said, using the Yiddish word for troubles. “There were tears running down his face.” Yet he never chose to translate that veneration into a community of acolytes on the scale of, for example, the Satmar Hasidim, who number almost 75,000 around the world. Nor did he create the synagogues, yeshivas, kosher certification enterprises and other institutions that the larger sects possess. “He was doing God’s work and wasn’t interested in building a following,” Mr. Rapaport said. Like his father, Rabbi Portugal was famed for the melodies he composed to accompany passages in Psalms and holiday prayers, some of which are regarded as Hasidic classics. Although he did not know musical notation, he carried a cassette recorder to capture the melodies he would sing as they came to him. But he was wary of some forms of modern technology. He was among the sponsors of a gathering in 2012 that filled seats at Citi Field and Arthur Ashe Stadium in Queens — the turnout was so large that a second venue was added — to alert ultra-Orthodox Jews to the dangers of using the internet without special filters to block objectionable material. “Whoever uses the internet without a filter is a beast, because the source of the internet is beastliness,” he was quoted as saying by the ultra-Orthodox newswire JDN. Hasidim, however, remain avid users of the internet for business and professional needs. Many of them sell products through Amazon. Rabbi Portugal was more successful in his exhortations against possessing television sets that might introduce unwanted secular influences into the home. To underscore his point, every year, on the morning of the Passover Seder, he and his supporters threw a discarded television into a bonfire of forbidden grain products, the usual objects of the burning ritual. Rabbi Portugal was born on June 2, 1923, in the town of Skulyany (Skulen in Yiddish) in what is today Moldova, to Eliezer and Sheina Rachel Portugal. (The name Portugal does not refer to the country but is an approximation of the family name’s pronunciation in Yiddish.) His father was the leader of Skulyany’s Hasidim before being urged to move to the city of Chernowitz to serve a larger community of Jews. The son became the Skulener Rebbe when his father died in 1982. Rabbi Portugal’s wife, Reisel, died in 2005. He is survived by five sons, three daughters and scores of grandchildren and great-grandchildren. His sons, Yeshaya Yaakov, Meir, Ephraim, Zvi and Shmuel, are all rabbis. His three daughters, Leah Libba Stern, Chaya Sarah Weinberger and Nechamah Klughaupt, are all married to rabbis. Yeshaya Yaakov is expected to succeed his father as the sect’s head. Rabbi Portugal founded and raised funds for Chesed L’Avraham, a network of schools and orphanages in Israel largely devoted to the children of immigrants; they were established to counter the influence of more secular institutions. But according to the Orthodox news website Hamodia, Rabbi Portugal, unlike other grand rabbis, did not create yet another yeshiva for his followers in the United States, preferring to devote himself to spiritual development. “What would my yeshiva add to all the others?” he asked.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | You Are Not as Good at Kissing as You Think. But You Are Better at Dancing.,"We overestimate and underestimate our abilities in weird ways. Mr. Greenberg is a mathematician; Mr. Stephens-Davidowitz is an economist. Do you think you are an above-average driver, as most people do? How do you compare with others as a parent? Are you better than most at dancing? Where do you rank in your capability to save humanity? Many of you will answer these questions incorrectly. For some of these skills, you will think you are better than you actually are. For others, you will think you are worse. We have long known that, for particular skills, people tend to rate themselves imperfectly. In a famous study from 1981, researchers asked people to rate their driving ability. More than 90 percent considered themselves above average. Of course, some people who think they are above-average drivers really are. But the 90 percent statistic shows that many people inflate how they compare with others. By definition, only 50 percent of people can rate above the median. Similar results have been found in many other arenas. More than 90 percent of faculty members at one state university considered themselves above-average teachers. More than 30 percent of one company’s engineers rated themselves among the top 5 percent. Studies like these led social scientists to conclude that people systematically exaggerate their own capabilities, that they have what researchers call “illusory superiority.” But that’s not the whole story. More recent studies have found examples in which people tend to underestimate their capabilities. One found that most people thought they would be worse than average at recovering from the death of a loved one. Another study reported that people thought they were worse than most at riding a unicycle. Here, they exhibit illusory inferiority. So when are people likely to be overconfident in how they rank? And when are they underconfident? One of us has conducted research on this topic. Spencer and his collaborators used Positly, a new platform he started that allows researchers to conduct a large number of studies rapidly. Instead of asking people where they rank on just a few skills, they asked where they ranked on 100 skills. For each skill, participants were asked how they thought they compared with others on the platform who shared their age and gender, and lived in their area. If, on average, people thought they could outperform more than 50 percent of others at the task, that suggests systematic overconfidence. If, however, people thought they would outperform less than 50 percent, that’s evidence of underconfidence. There was great variation in how people assessed their relative skills at a task. On average, people rated themselves better than 75 percent of others in their ability to use a computer, for instance. But people rated themselves better than only 32 percent of others in their ability to knit a sweater. People tended to overestimate how they compared with others in their ability to dodge a fraud, win a trivia contest or cuddle. But they tended to underestimate how they ranked in their ability to predict the outcome of a sporting event, win a fistfight or dance. People tend to be overconfident about... People tend to be underconfident about...

People tend to be underconfident about... Having interesting conversations Getting an animal to like them Avoiding falling for a fraud Winning a game of trivia Kissing Driving Using a computer Being a reliable friend Controlling their emotions when it’s useful to do so Quickly reciting the alphabet backward from memory The researchers next investigated what traits the skills that people were overconfident in have in common. To do this, they asked a different group of people to rate each of the 100 skills on 21 dimensions. They asked, for example, whether the skill involves a lot of luck, whether being bad at the skill would be considered embarrassing or whether the skill is usually performed by experts. Four factors consistently predicted overconfidence. (If you want to try this yourself, go here.) First, people tend to be overconfident on skills that reflect one’s underlying personality or character. This helps explain why people overestimated how they compare with others in their ethics, their reliability as a friend and their value as a human being. And since many people feel pressure to conform to gender norms, this may help us understand why men and women tend to be particularly overconfident on different tasks. Across the 100 skills tested, men are a bit more overconfident overall in how they compared themselves with members of their gender. But men’s overconfidence is particularly noticeable in stereotypically male tasks. Men think they can best the majority of other men in poker, fixing a chair and understanding science. Women are far less confident that they can outperform other women in these tasks. In contrast, women think they are better than most other women in understanding other people’s feelings, cooking a delicious meal and child-rearing. Men are less confident that they outrank other men in these tasks. Fun fact: The average man thought he would be better than 63 percent of other men if he had to survive a zombie apocalypse. The average woman thought she would be better than 47 percent of other women at this task. Another factor that predicted overconfidence is how much a person’s skill level at a trait is a matter of opinion. Give people more wiggle room in how they can define the skill, and they will tend to rate themselves higher. People were slightly more overconfident in how they ranked their intelligence (somewhat subjective) than their performance on an IQ test (seemingly more objective.) Next, the researchers found that people tend to be overconfident on tasks that are perceived as easy and underconfident on tasks that are perceived as hard. People overestimate how they compare with others in chopping vegetables (easy) but underestimate where they rank in their ability to recite the alphabet backward (hard). You can see the effect of difficulty on overconfidence clearly in a series of questions the researchers asked about lifting weights. On average, people thought they could outperform 71 percent of others in lifting 10 pounds; 64 percent in lifting 30 pounds; and 55 percent in lifting 50 pounds. The final factor that influenced confidence is experience. The more experienced people are at a task, the more people tend to be overconfident. People tend to be overconfident in their skill at making scrambled eggs, which most people have done multiple times, and underconfident in their ability to paint a portrait, which most people have rarely tried. Doing something often will, of course, tend to increase your skill. But it seems that as people gain experience, their confidence goes up faster than their skill. One of the implications of this research is that people may systematically underestimate their ability to do really hard things that they have never tried before — a notable exception being men’s rating of their ability to handle a zombie apocalypse. People are indeed overconfident in their ability to drive. (In our sample, people thought they would outperform 66 percent of others in driving.) But people think they are better than 52 percent of others at driving on ice, something that is more difficult and that they do less frequently. And they think they would be better than only 42 percent of others in driving a racing car, something that is really difficult and that most people never try. Other difficult, relatively rarely tried activities in which people think they would be worse than most include running marathons, making a billion dollars and saving humanity. What does this research tell us about human nature? Some of the early work on confidence presented a picture of human beings as comically cocky. Most people, we were told, walked around falsely convinced that they were better than other people. This new research gives us a more nuanced picture. Sure, many people still traipse around deluded that they outshine others in their driving on non-icy roads, vegetable-chopping and cuddling. But when they imagine doing something difficult or something that they haven’t tried before, people tend to be timid and doubtful of their capabilities. When they go outside their comfort zone, people systematically sell themselves short. Spencer Greenberg (@SpencrGreenberg) is a mathematician and the founder of ClearerThinking.org.

2019,You Can’t Stop Robocalls. You Shouldn’t Have To.,"Tech Fix Today’s solutions for fighting spam and scam calls are ineffective. But the onus should be on the phone companies, not you, to solve this problem. The robocalls come when you are driving and they bother you at night. It doesn’t matter if you’re in bed or in a meeting. Here’s the worst news: There is really no way for you to stop them. I know this because for the past few years, I have been bombarded with robocalls alerting me that I owe student loans, or that I won a free vacation, or that I am being audited by the Internal Revenue Service. Like many people, I have tried the available solutions. I added my cellphone number to the Do Not Call Registry and installed apps that purport to block spam calls. Yet many of those calls still came through. Since this column is called Tech Fix and not Tech Rage, I have been waiting for real solutions to recommend before writing about robocalls. I’m still waiting, but I have some good news. Technologists have been working on technical protocols for blocking the calls before they come through. If they succeed, you won’t even notice when scammers or bots try to call you. For now, robocalls are on the rise. By some estimates, nearly 50 percent of calls made this year will be spam. That means phone calls are reaching a point similar to the one email got to about 20 years ago. Remember when email spam was so bad that we thought that method of communication would become unusable? The problem put pressure on tech companies to find ways to catch the vast majority of spam mail before it reached your inbox. The telecommunications industry is now working toward a similar solution for robocalls. “We should make sure that every consumer gets all the communication they want — every company and person that they communicate with, those should rise above the noise and all the bad people out there, and that’s the goal,” said Jeff Lawson, the chief executive of Twilio, a communications company that is working with carriers on eliminating illegitimate calls. More on that later. Here’s why today’s robocall blockers are incomplete, and what to look forward to. In the past few years, carriers and others have offered various products to block spam calls. A sampling of the apps includes RoboKiller, Verizon’s CallFilter, AT&T’s CallProtect and T-Mobile’s NameID. They all generally work the same way: The apps rely on a blacklist of phone numbers deemed to be spam callers that was compiled by multiple parties and data sources. Companies continually update the lists, adding more numbers associated with scammers or spammers. So if you have one of these apps and a call comes in from a number that has been flagged, it may be blocked. But while the apps are helpful to an extent, they aren’t sufficient to put an end to robocalls. The problem: Scammers can use internet apps to “spoof” calls, manipulating phone networks to ring your phone from numbers they actually aren’t calling from — including numbers that belong to honest people like you, your doctor or your pharmacist. Spoof calls usually get past the filters. After activating the RoboKiller app on my iPhone, for instance, I received calls from five phone numbers known to be robocallers. One of the numbers successfully rang my phone without being blocked. Ethan Garr, chief product officer of TelTech, which makes RoboKiller, said that when robocalls get through, it may be because they came from numbers unfamiliar to the app. Other apps I experimented with produced similar results. Another solution is signing up for the Do Not Call Registry, which is managed by the Federal Trade Commission. At this site, you register your cellphone or land line number to opt out of receiving calls from telemarketers. People who try to spam numbers on the list risk hefty fines from the federal government. While everyone should add their phone number to the Do Not Call Registry as a preventive measure, it’s an incomplete solution. Robocallers don’t care if you are on the list because they can hide their identities by spoofing numbers, so they will call you anyway. See what I’m getting at? Spoofed calls, and the inability to verify that a call is truly from the person or business it appears to be from, are a major problem. It’s a problem the phone industry is now working to address. As far back as the 1970s, phone companies allowed numbers to be spoofed because there were legitimate purposes for doing so. Businesses benefited from the practice. If a customer service representative from your power company called you, the call would appear to be from the company’s general 800 number and not the direct line for that customer service representative. The feature was intended to protect the privacy of people like that customer service representative. But this became a weakness that now allows robocallers to spoof numbers, which they can easily do using internet calling apps. The calls could actually be coming from a scammer in Nigeria or India, but your phone will say it’s coming from someone domestically. The next step is a mouthful, but bear with me. Phone companies are working on a technology called Stir/Shaken, an industry-coined acronym for a method of authenticating phone numbers. (You don’t want to know what it stands for.) The gist is that phone companies are upgrading their networks to attach digital signatures to each phone call. The signatures ensure that the calling party is authorized to use that phone number. So if a call is coming from Joe, the phone company can analyze the signature and verify that Joe is calling. If someone other than Joe is using his number, the lack of a signature could indicate that the number is being spoofed. Phone companies are experimenting with letting calls ring your phone and telling you whether or not the token has been “signed,” or verified as coming from the actual caller. Depending on which smartphone you own, a verified call could appear on your screen with a check mark or a message like “call authenticated.” Phone carriers hope to eventually reach a point where they can prevent unverified numbers from ringing your phone at all, said Joseph Russo, a senior vice president of network operations for Verizon. “At this point, the strategy is to display it to the customer and allow them to have the choice as to what they want to block and not block,” he said. “The end goal is to not let the calls come through in the first place.” A lot needs to happen for the effort to succeed. Service providers, handset makers and others in the telecom industry must all work together, Mr. Russo said. The solution wouldn’t be as useful if Verizon authenticated numbers only between its own customers, for example. All carriers need to use the same methodology to cooperate and pass the information along to one another. The collaborations are just beginning. This year, T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon announced successful experiments with Stir/Shaken. Comcast also unveiled partnerships with those carriers for authenticating calls made between its voice customers and their networks. Mr. Lawson of Twilio said he was optimistic that robocalling could be reduced. Carriers have a history of working together on technical standards and protocols to ensure that their networks succeed, he said. “Carriers, in particular, are well situated to be able to solve the problem,” he said. So you and I can’t do much to fight robocalls. But hopefully, someday soon, we won’t have to.",The New York Times
2019,T.W.A. Hotel: You May Want to Stay at Kennedy Airport. By Choice. Seriously.,"The new T.W.A. hotel at J.F.K. is proving a designer magnet. Stan Herman, the “father of fashion week,” explains why. Is it possible that Kennedy Airport is going to be fashionable again? Given that J.F.K. is often voted among the worst airports in the United States; given the fraught state of many airlines today, what with Boeing’s safety concerns and the Wow Air bankruptcy; and given the general malaise around air travel as an experience to be endured, preferably with the help of some Ambien, rather than enjoyed, it’s hard to imagine. And yet designers are casting their eyes, not skyward necessarily, but to a long-abandoned terminal in the heart of Kennedy Airport, the transformation of which could (maybe, possibly, if they have anything to do with it) change the image of the much-derided port of entry. The terminal in question is the old T.W.A. Flight Center, designed by the Finnish architect Eero Saarinen in 1962 to sit like a bewinged white U.F.O. amid the tarmac. Closed since 2001, it was a ghostly relic of space-age architecture. In 2016, the Port Authority granted the developer MCR/Morse the rights to restore it to period glory. In May it will reopen as a 512-room hotel replete with the kind of time-traveling touches, including Knoll furniture, a sunken lounge bar and rotary phones in every room, that generally serve as Pavlovian bells for the style-minded. No wonder Louis Vuitton announced that it would hold its resort show — which has in the past taken place at the I.M. Pei-designed Miho Museum in Kyoto, Japan, and the Oscar Niemeyer-designed Niterói Contemporary Art Museum in Niterói, Brazil — in the hotel on May 8. The following week, when the hotel officially opens, guests will find themselves met by “greeters” in T.W.A. uniforms of yesteryear by designers like Valentino, Ralph Lauren and Oleg Cassini (just in case anyone needs reminding that once upon a time even the most haute designers saw the aisle as a potential catwalk). After they make it past the greeters, guests will find themselves amid various employees in uniforms created by Stan Herman, the longest serving president of the Council of Fashion Designers of America (from 1991 to 2006), whose 90th birthday party was recently hosted by Donna Karan. As far as seals of approval go, this is like having the godfather give you his blessing — if the godfather was a grizzled and unassuming man who helped shape the New York fashion world. “They approached me around 2015, 2016,” Mr. Herman said of how he got involved with the project. As he spoke, he was sitting at a Saarinen tulip table in the T.W.A. lounge on the 86th floor of One World Trade Center, a space set up by MCR/Morse to show off the project. From the floor-to-ceiling windows, you could see the white blob far in the distance that was the hotel. “They were all excited because they wanted the operation to look very ’60s, and they’d found someone who was there,” he said. Or almost there. Aside from being known as the “father of fashion week,” Mr. Herman may also be the most famous ready-to-wear designer to trade the runway for the uniform world. He said he made his first uniform for T.W.A. in 1974, which was one year after he started making uniforms for Avis. He has also worked with, among others, FedEx (where he is still creative consultant), McDonald’s, the Loews hotel chain, Amtrak, Eastern Airlines, US Airways and JetBlue, with whom he is still involved. He has dressed hundreds of thousands of people. “I’m a people’s designer,” Mr. Herman said. “I’ve always been a people’s designer. And for that it doesn’t get better than uniforms, as far as I’m concerned.” “The airline uniform that was the most memorable was Pan Am,” he said. “The Pan Am blue was perfect branding. They stuck to the same color for years and years and years. T.W.A. had a completely different attitude. It was amazing what they let designers do. Once they told me the colors, they let me go any direction I wanted.” The first direction he went, in 1974, was sort of YSL meets Danskin: a bright red safari jacket and matching skirt, a blue ribbed tee and shirt, and a denim halter shirtdress over a ribbed tee and wide khaki pants. For the hotel, though, it’s very “Mad Men.” “We decided everything should be plaid,” Mr. Herman said. “Plaid vest, plaid jacket, plaid pants for the guys; a cropped jacket with big Jackie O buttons and a box-pleat skirt for the women.” The back-of-house outfits are also on-theme: red and blue bowling shirt for men and tunic-like camp shirts for women. “It looks jaunty,” Mr. Herman said. It also fits with the time warp that is the hotel’s aesthetic. As Tyler Brûlé, the editor of Monocle and something of an air-travel obsessive, said, air travel has become so deglamorized that whenever anybody tries to frame it in a positive light, they are forced to look back. But while the results have an old-fashioned eye-candy appeal, they don’t necessarily do much to move things forward. Mr. Herman points out, however, that, like the 1950s Western Electric phones in the rooms, which have been retrofitted with a pulse-to-tone converter, the clothes have been modernized, thanks to stretch technology and the fact that they come in sizes 0 to 22. “It’s going to set a new precedent,” he said. “It’s going to be fun.” So is a collection of T.W.A. merch, inspired in part by the uniforms, the logo and the aesthetic, and created under the auspices of another fashion-world stalwart: Somsack Sikhounmuong, the designer of Alex Mill and a former designer for J. Crew and Madewell. The goods will include cashmere sweatshirts and sneakers with the logo on the side that, said Tyler Morse, the chief executive of MCR/Morse, “you can’t get anywhere else.” After the Stan Smith, the T.W.A.? It’s a moonshot, of sorts.",The New York Times
2019,You Need Vitamin D to Live. How Could This Woman Survive With None in Her Blood?,"Trilobites She had a series of bone fractures, but when doctors did blood tests, the supplements she took for treatment were nowhere to be found. In 1992, a 33-year-old Lebanese woman had just immigrated to Canada and went to see a doctor. She was hunched over, and had limited mobility in her lower back, neck, shoulders and hips. Her doctor, Raymond Lewkonia at the University of Calgary, diagnosed her with ankylosing spondylitis, a medical condition that causes vertebrae in her spine to fuse, and thought that was it. Then, about eight years later, the woman had a series of fractures in her ribs, feet, left arm and right hip. Her doctor had her take vitamin D supplements, but they had no effect: Lab tests revealed that she didn’t have any vitamin D circulating around in her blood. That seemed impossible. Some vitamin D, after all, is thought to be essential for maintaining bone health, and taking supplements after a bone injury or fracture is commonly used to expedite the healing process. Why was none of this vital substance in the woman’s system? [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] A medical geneticist who looked at this case, Dr. Patrick Ferreira, suspected that a binding protein that partners with vitamin D to get in and around the body — or a lack of it — might have something to do with this medical mystery. But losing the ability to transport vitamin D would be lethal to humans, according to what doctors conventionally know. Dr. Ferreira set out to test his hypothesis, but had trouble confirming that the vitamin D binding protein was indeed missing in the woman’s system. He and others sent blood samples to labs in Europe and Vancouver, but these tests — which can be unreliable — came back saying that binding protein levels were normal. When Dr. Ferreira retired, he passed the patient’s case to his colleague, Dr. Julien Marcadier, a clinical geneticist at Alberta Children’s Hospital Research Institute, now the lead author of a case report published last month in The New England Journal of Medicine. Fortunately for Dr. Marcadier, researchers at the University of Washington in Seattle had just developed a more sensitive method of detecting the protein. Dr. Andrew Hoofnagle and his colleagues agreed to examine the blood sample, and found that there was no vitamin D in her blood, or any vitamin D binding protein. “When you think about the biology of vitamin D,” Dr. Hoofnagle said, “that shouldn’t work. That person should not be alive.” Martin Hewison, a molecular endocrinologist at the University of Birmingham in England, who was not involved in the study, says that this case is the first of its kind. How could this woman have lived nearly six decades without a substance considered essential to human life? While vitamin D binding protein sequesters vitamin D in the body, it’s the unbound molecules of vitamin D that are ultimately important for bone growth. “The amount of vitamin D that is needed may vary by organ,” said Dr. JoAnn Manson, an endocrinologist and principal investigator of the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. In this case, the amount of free vitamin D that this woman received from her diet or exposure to sun may have been sufficient to develop her bones and keep them alive. And there’s still a question of exactly how much vitamin D our bodies need, although some recent research suggests that the dose of vitamin D might not matter much for bone mineral density, fractures or falls for the elderly. “I don’t think this makes a strong case for the need for less vitamin D, but simply how well the body can adapt to limited vitamin D binding protein,” said Ellen Fung, director of the Bone Density Clinic at Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute in California, “although ultimately it caught up with her.” An earlier version of this article misstated the name of a clinic at Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute. It is the Bone Density Clinic, not Bond Density Clinic.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | You Say Industry Can Regulate Itself? Prove It,"The Trump administration is eager to let businesses police their own behavior. There is reason to fear the consequences. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. In the slaughterhouses where pigs are reduced to their constituent parts, the disassembly lines carry about 1,100 pigs per hour — a new carcass every three seconds. For decades, the federal government has sought to prevent food-borne illnesses by stationing inspectors along the slaughter lines to eyeball the passing pigs for signs of disease and decay. The Trump administration plans to overhaul this system, slashing the number of inspectors who work the lines and shifting some responsibility for food safety to the slaughterhouses. The shift toward self-regulation of slaughterhouses is part of a broader trend. The Trump administration also has proposed letting oil companies assume greater responsibility for the safety of offshore drilling platforms, and it is considering letting employees of nuclear power plants conduct some safety inspections in the place of federal regulators. The system of slaughterhouse regulation is out of date. The industry has succeeded over time in sharply reducing the kinds of problems visible from the slaughterhouse floor — the government says its health inspectors increasingly are policing aesthetic issues — but the incidence of some illnesses caused by pork consumption has stopped falling. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates, pork consumption causes more than 80 deaths a year and sickens more than half a million Americans. Unfortunately, there is no evidence that the Trump administration has a better plan. The Clinton administration agreed in 1997 to let five hog plants adopt the inspection system that the Trump administration wants to embrace for the whole industry. In 2013, the Agriculture Department’s inspector general reported that the pilot program had not demonstrably improved food safety. In response, the government defended the new system as no worse than the old one. But there is some evidence of increased risk. Last year, the nonprofit Food & Water Watch used the Freedom of Information Act to obtain more recent inspection records for the plants in the pilot program. It found 22 instances between 2012 and 2016 in which companies were cited by the remaining federal inspectors for failing to identify and remove from the slaughter line a hog carcass that could cause food poisoning. Using a pilot program is an excellent way to test a proposed change in regulation. But the point is to reach a clear conclusion. In this case, the government — rather astonishingly — has maintained the pilot program for two decades without proving that it works. The Trump administration now says that expanding the pilot program to include a vast majority of the industry would significantly reduce episodes of salmonella poisoning. But outside experts point out that the administration simply assumes the testing methods that haven’t worked in the pilot program will begin to yield better results. The Trump administration also foresees considerable financial benefits: The government would save $6.4 million a year, while the industry’s profits would rise by $47.3 million a year because slaughterhouses would be allowed to move hogs down the line at even higher speeds. But that would make life more difficult for the people who work the slaughter lines. The Agriculture Department insists it is not responsible for the safety of workers, and this is narrowly true. That job belongs to a different agency. But the White House is responsible for taking a broader view of proposed regulations. The government’s tabulation of the costs and benefits needs to weigh the consequences for the people who work in the plants against the benefits for the people who own the plants. In other cases, too, the administration is allowing self-regulation contrary to evidence and experience. It is seeking to roll back some of the stringencies imposed on offshore oil drilling after the Deepwater Horizon blowout in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010. Before the blowout, which caused the largest maritime oil spill in American history, the government allowed oil companies to inspect and certify the safety of their own equipment. In the aftermath, the Obama administration required the use of third-party inspectors approved by the government. The proposed rule would let companies choose their inspectors. Similarly, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission voted this year to reverse some safeguards imposed on nuclear power plants following the March 2011 tsunami that caused a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan. And Annie Caputo, a member of the commission, told industry executives last month that she was open to letting plants assume responsibility for some safety inspections. The administration says it is reducing the cost of regulation without compromising public safety. But an administration that has acquired a reputation for indifference to scientific evidence needs to prove its changes are for the better.

2019,YouTube Fact-Checks the Fire at Notre-Dame With Facts About ... 9/11,"It was designed to fight misinformation, but a relatively new fact-checking feature on YouTube sputtered on Monday as it displayed information about the Sept. 11 attacks alongside live streams of the fire that ravaged Notre-Dame cathedral. The mistake, attributed to a misguided algorithm, underscored the difficulties the sprawling video platform faces as it responds to criticism that it has allowed harmful, hateful and false content to flourish virtually unimpeded. On Monday, news organizations were quick to share live footage on YouTube of the fire as it ripped through Notre-Dame, deeply scarring one of the most recognizable landmarks in Paris. But some of those feeds were presented atop a gray box that, to some viewer confusion, presented information from the Encyclopaedia Britannica about the 2001 terrorist attacks. “These panels are triggered algorithmically and our systems sometimes make the wrong call,” YouTube said in a statement, adding that it had disabled the boxes on streams related to the fire after recognizing the error. The company did not say why the algorithm paired the live streams with information about the terrorist attacks. A cause for the Notre-Dame fire has not been identified, though investigators are treating it as an accident. The panels, which pull information from Encyclopaedia Britannica and Wikipedia, were announced last summer as part of a broader effort to root out misinformation. At the time, YouTube said they would appear “alongside videos on a small number of well-established historical and scientific topics that have often been subject to misinformation, like the moon landing and the Oklahoma City Bombing.” For years, YouTube, Google, Facebook, Twitter and other tech giants have faced criticism that they have looked the other way as misinformation and hateful speech coursed through their platforms. The companies have taken steps to address the problem, though lawmakers, columnists and others have criticized them for not moving fast enough. In January, YouTube said it would work to stop recommending videos based on conspiracy theories or unfounded claims. “We’ll begin reducing recommendations of borderline content and content that could misinform users in harmful ways — such as videos promoting a phony miracle cure for a serious illness, claiming the earth is flat, or making blatantly false claims about historic events like 9/11,” it said. This month, the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the proliferation of hate speech online, to which it had invited public policy officials from Facebook and Google, YouTube’s parent company. The hearing was streamed live from the committee’s YouTube channel, but the company soon disabled the ability to comment on the feed, citing hateful speech.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Your Average American Joe,"Biden is not an individualist. Opinion Columnist Joe Biden’s father led the high life as a young man: yachts, fast cars, polo. But his fortunes ran out, thanks to a few bad business deals. Eventually, he got a job managing a used car dealership. But at the office Christmas party, the owner decided to issue bonuses by taking a bucket of silver dollars and strewing them across the dance floor, forcing the employees to scramble about on their knees picking up the loot. Joe Biden Sr. and his wife got up instantly and walked out of that job. Desperate as he was, he could not work for someone who didn’t respect people’s dignity. This is the first fact about Joe Biden Jr.: He came from a principled family, and he and his wife have nurtured a principled family. Covering his past presidential campaigns was like covering a rolling Biden family reunion. There were sometimes more Bidens at the rallies than voters. One of the hallmarks of the Biden family is emotional transparency — you know what they’re feeling. But another is this: We treat everyone the same. Joe Biden has spent nearly his entire adult life in the Senate or as vice president, but no one could fairly accuse him of being haughty or elitist. People still have the instinct to call him Joe. Average Joe. Other people may claim to be populist in their policies — and because they are “right” on those, they are allowed to be contemptuous toward those who are less enlightened. Biden is a populist in his person and makeup — where he comes from and how he relates. He wasn’t raised in the Adlai Stevenson stream of Democratic history, which identifies itself by education. He was raised in the Harry Truman stream, which identifies itself by middle-class decency, personal loyalty and practical sense. How has he kept this average Joe, Everyman status? Well, he has a strong need to connect with people — everybody, regardless of social rank. Sometimes his hunger for connection over-spills its bounds. In 1974 he gave an interview to Kitty Kelley of Washingtonian magazine that was jaw-dropping in its candor — all sorts of inappropriate talk about his late wife’s figure, his salary, his own ambition, a woman he might start dating. Life and the vice presidency have disciplined him, but he still has this bonding instinct. He is also an Everyman because of suffering — that great equalizer. He lost his first wife and daughter to a traffic accident just before he was sworn in to the Senate. “I could remember vividly,” he later wrote, “after my wife Neilia died, not being able to open the closet door of the bedroom we shared. I could recall the anguish of smelling her scent on the pillows and looking at the empty spot on the bathroom sink where her toothbrush had been.” Decades later he lost his son Beau to cancer. To read Biden’s book on that period of time, “Promise Me, Dad,” is to be sucked into a tragedy. We suffer our way to wisdom, and Biden has suffered his way to a sensitivity to other people’s pain, an awareness of how it feels and what to say into it. One day in 2014, when he was V.P., he represented the administration at the funeral for Rafael Ramos, a New York cop who had been executed along with his partner just for being a cop. It was a tense situation. Police brutality was at the forefront of national politics, and Biden had to celebrate those who serve and sometimes give their lives protecting us. He broke through the ideological “positions” by adopting a personalistic lens. Emphasizing the plight of the particular individuals involved. In Brooklyn he visited the family of Ramos’s partner, Wenjian Liu. He sat with Liu’s widow, Sanny, and passed along advice he’d been given: Before you go to bed, grade each day emotionally on a 1-to-10 scale. After six months graph the scores. You’ll see the 1 days will get a little less frequent and the better days more common. Someday there will be a day when you remember your beloved with a smile and not a tear. He gave Sanny his private number. During the visit, Liu’s father, who spoke little English, just hovered at Biden’s side, clinging to him and saying, “Thank you, thank you.” The character issue will play out in all sorts of subterranean and powerful ways this election. We have lost our love for ourselves as a people, a faith in our basic goodness, and this loss of faith has been a shock. A lot of voters want to raise their children in an atmosphere marked by decency and compassion, not narcissistic savagery. Values are central to this race. Here is what is subtly different about Biden. He’s not an individualist. He is a member. He belongs to his family; his hometown, Scranton; his Democratic Party; his Senate; his nation, and is inexplicable without those roots. He used the word “we” 16 times in his short video announcing his candidacy. Some candidates will run promising transformational change. Biden offers a restoration of the values that bind us as a collective. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2019,Your Friday Briefing,"Good morning, We start today with takeaways from the Mueller report, a warning from North Korea and an essay about why gardening can heal. In 448 pages, the special counsel, Robert Mueller, cataloged attempts by President Trump to thwart the investigation into Russia’s 2016 election interference, and laid bare how Mr. Trump was elected with the help of a foreign power. The special counsel’s team decided not to charge Mr. Trump, citing numerous legal and factual constraints, but it pointedly declined to exonerate him. Mr. Mueller concluded that there was “insufficient evidence” to establish a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, but that Russia did interfere in the U.S. election. Takeaways: President Trump tried to sabotage the investigation. In instance after instance, his staff defied his orders and acted as a bulwark against Mr. Trump’s most destructive impulses. Read our other takeaways. We also have a cheat sheet to the report. On obstruction: President Trump’s lawyers have argued that it was impossible for him to illegally obstruct the Russia investigation because he has full authority over federal law enforcement. Mr. Mueller rejected that sweeping view of executive power. See for yourself: One of our most-read stories in the last day was the report itself. Many readers wanted to comb through the 400-plus pages. American-led sanctions against North Korea are hurting its leader, Kim Jong-un, in a new way: by targeting the party and military elite who support his totalitarian rule. Previous international sanctions were aimed at preventing North Korea from acquiring weapons, but newer penalties have hit its lucrative exports — the regime’s main source of income. North Korea’s test of a “guided tactical weapon” on Wednesday might be both a sign of Mr. Kim’s frustration and a warning to Washington that there will be no progress on nuclear disarmament unless the sanctions are eased. What’s next: Mr. Kim said recently that he would give the U.S. until the end of the year to come up with proposals around the deadlock, an implicit warning that North Korea might resume nuclear and intercontinental missile testing. Wednesday’s test suggested he might raise the stakes sooner. An outwardly cordial meeting this week between Pope Francis and his predecessor, the pope emeritus, Benedict XVI, masked a growing concern within the Vatican and far beyond: that having two popes can be confusing to the faithful — and can risk creating schisms within the Roman Catholic Church. Francis and Benedict are vastly different in their style, substance and visions of the church. Benedict has remained an icon to traditionalists who feel threatened by Francis, a pope they consider a dictator, a liberal radical and an existential threat to church doctrine. The background: In 2013, Benedict became the first pontiff in centuries to resign, but he hasn’t disappeared completely from view. Last week, he released a 6,000-word letter explaining his views on the church’s clerical sex abuse crisis, effectively undercutting Francis on the issue. The Indian elections are an unruly behemoth, not only to administer but also to monitor. Thousands of candidates deliver campaign speeches and post on social media at the same time. The Sisyphean task of keeping an eye on it all falls to the Election Commission. Already, it has temporarily banned two candidates from campaigning for making incendiary remarks, postponed the release of a Bollywood biopic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and canceled voting in one district after uncovering a cash-for-votes scheme. The commission faces perhaps its greatest test of legitimacy in trying to rein in disinformation in a country with more than 600 million internet users. In the past year, rumors on social media have led to fatal lynch mobs across the country. Two phases into a seven-stage election, there has already been an explosion of fake poll results, doctored news clippings and other election-related falsehoods, according to a fact-checking website. The commission can count some successes. WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook and other platforms have taken down posts that violate the commission’s rules, and developed tools to curb the spread of falsehoods. But concerns remain. — Alisha Haridasani Gupta Send us your feedback or questions on this series here. France: There is already a growing debate about how the Notre-Dame cathedral should be rebuilt. How closely should the planned reconstruction adhere to the original design and materials? Pinterest: Shares in the digital pin board jumped more than 28 percent on its first day of trading as a public company. The company’s stock began trading at $23.75, above the initial public offering price of $19, and finished the day at $24.40. It is more valuable than the retail chains Macy’s or Nordstrom. Germany: After a bus plunged off a road on the Portuguese island of Madeira and killed 29 tourists, possibly all Germans, Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was “saddened and distressed” by the crash, as her nation awaited word of the victims’ identities. Health: Two new studies confirm there are biological reasons that some people struggle with their weight and others do not. Some people have a gene alteration that suppresses appetite and makes them feel full. Amazon: The world’s largest retailer and eight South American countries that contain the world’s largest rain forest are in a battle over who owns the name Amazon. At stake is the domain name .amazon — for the company, it means marketing opportunities, and for the countries, it’s a question of heritage and symbolism. Snapshot: Gardens, like the Montreal Botanical Garden, above, have healing power, according to Oliver Sacks, a neurologist and author who died in 2015. In a collection of essays being published posthumously next week, he wrote that in 40 years of medical practice, “I have seen in my patients the restorative and healing powers of nature and gardens.” Britain: We spoke with David Miliband, the former British politician who is now the chief executive of the International Rescue Committee, a nonprofit humanitarian group. “I sort of came to the conclusion that, if you can make a difference, you should,” he said. Music: Our reviewer said “Homecoming,” the highly anticipated Netflix documentary made by Beyoncé, reinforces the idea that Beyoncé the performer is also Beyoncé the creator. Cook: This ultra-tangy tart is somewhere between a lemon tart and a lemon pie. Go: Lucian Freud’s nudes from the ’90s, a Gretchen Bender retrospective and more are among what you should see in New York art galleries. Watch: What is remarkable about “Ramy,” Hulu’s new show about a young American Muslim, isn’t that it significantly differs from other millennial coming-of-age stories. It’s that it doesn’t. Read: Far-right nationalists are now in power in governments across Europe. How surprised should supporters of liberal democracy in Europe be? Not very, according to Sheri Berman’s “Democracy and Dictatorship in Europe.” Smarter Living: Checking to see if something can be repaired before you replace it is a simple way to save money and the Earth. YouTube has plenty of instructional videos, and iFixit offers how-to guides and repair discussion forums. In Europe, repair parties and cafes are starting to spring up. There’s also a movement to support “right to repair” laws that would require companies to make their products easier to fix. And we have guidance on the right way to use a public bathroom. As we’ve been covering the fire that tore through the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris, we’ve often wondered why it’s not just Notre Dame. Why would Our Lady Cathedral need extra punctuation? We got the answer from the national commission that preserves and guides France’s conventions of official names. (The French have earned their reputation for being literate, logical and bureaucratic.) Elisabeth Calvarin, who helps lead that agency, the Commission Nationale de Toponymie, explained that the hyphen differentiates place names from proper nouns. The mother of God who is worshiped at the cathedral is Notre Dame. The cathedral named for her must have a hyphen. Part of the landmark’s address is named after a pope: Place Jean-Paul II. Saint Denis is the martyr; Saint-Denis is the name of the Paris suburb. But it’s Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Paris. Why do the hyphens stop halfway through? Because France has many churches and cathedrals listed as Notre-Dame, adding the name of the location is helpful — but not registered officially. That’s it for this briefing. See you next time. — Melina Thank youKatie Van Syckle helped compile today’s briefing. Mark Josephson, Eleanor Stanford and Kenneth R. Rosen provided the break from the news.

2019,Your Monday Briefing,"Let us help you start your day. Good morning, We start today with updates from devastating bombings in Sri Lanka, claims of shoddy production at Boeing and the results of the Ukrainian election. Soldiers shut down roads across Sri Lanka, social media platforms were blocked and a dusk-to-dawn curfew was imposed after a series of coordinated bombings ripped across the country on Easter Sunday at Roman Catholic churches and at high-end hotels frequented by foreigners. Nearly 300 people were killed and hundreds more injured. At least 27 of the dead were foreigners, including American, British, Chinese, Dutch and Portuguese nationals, according to officials and news reports. There were no immediate claims of responsibility. But 10 days earlier, a top police official had warned government security officials of possible suicide attacks at churches by National Thowheeth Jama’at, a group that aims to spread Islamic terrorist ideology. The police have arrested 24 people in connection with the bombings. See: We have photographs and video of the aftermath. Social media: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and the messaging services Viber and WhatsApp were inaccessible. A government official said the platforms were blocked to prevent the spread of misinformation about the attacks and hate speech that could inspire more violence. Context: Christians were a primary target in the bombings, and their faith has been increasingly under attack by militants and politicians across South and Southeast Asia. Workers at a 787 Dreamliner plant in South Carolina have complained of defective manufacturing, debris left on planes and pressure not to report violations. There is no evidence that the problems have led to major safety incidents. But faulty parts have been installed in planes. Tools and metal shavings have been left inside jets, often near electrical systems. Aircraft have taken test flights with debris in an engine and a tail, risking failure. A Times investigation found a culture at the 10-year-old plant that often valued production speed over quality, echoing broader concerns about Boeing in the wake of two deadly crashes involving its 737 Max. How we know: Reporters reviewed hundreds of pages of internal emails, corporate documents and federal records, and interviewed more than a dozen current and former employees. Response: “Boeing South Carolina teammates are producing the highest levels of quality in our history,” Kevin McAllister, Boeing’s head of commercial airplanes, said in a statement. Parallel interpretations of the report by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, have played out since its release on Thursday, as Democrats and allies of President Trump battle for control over the narrative of the report’s conclusions. Here’s the report, in searchable form. On Sunday morning talk shows, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, and other Trump aides claimed vindication for the president. Democrats have focused on the culture of deceit in the White House, the Trump campaign’s welcoming of help from Russian actors, and Mr. Trump’s failed efforts to have aides fire Mr. Mueller. Impeachment: Democrats have fallen into two camps. Leaders in the House are focused on the political perils of initiating an impeachment inquiry. The party’s left flank argues that not beginning proceedings would amount to an abdication of constitutional responsibility. Fear: Witnesses cited in the report are concerned about potential retaliation. Russia: The report shows how the Kremlin dispatched oligarchs and bankers to connect with the Trump team after the election. Volodymyr Zelensky, best known for playing the role of an accidental president on television, easily won the real-life election for president in Ukraine on Sunday, according to exit polling. Zelensky, a 41-year-old comic actor who has never held public office, won more than 70 percent of the vote, a decisive victory over the incumbent president, Petro Poroshenko, who conceded. Calls for change: Many voters said they had supported Mr. Zelensky because they wanted to punish Mr. Poroshenko for deflating the hopes raised by Ukraine’s 2014 revolution and for doing little to combat corruption. More than half of India’s 1.3 billion people depend in some way on farming. And many of them are suffering. The government has focused on maintaining low consumer prices, and booming harvests last year sent food prices tumbling further. Now, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party seeks another five years in power, hundreds of millions of farmers will have the chance to express their frustration at the ballot box. Iran: The country’s supreme leader has replaced the top commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, state media reported Sunday, two weeks after the Trump administration designated the elite force of the Iranian military as a foreign terrorist organization. Notre-Dame fire: Disaster planning at the cathedral underestimated risks, and even a flawless response would have a built-in delay of about 20 minutes, from the moment the alarm sounded until firefighters could climb to the attic to begin battling a fire. “Yellow Vest” protests: As billionaires’ donations to rebuild the cathedral renewed anger over inequality, the protests — now in their 23rd week — drew 7,000 in Paris. England: Less than 1 percent of the country’s population — including aristocrats, royals and wealthy investors — owns about half of the land, according to a forthcoming book. Many are members of families that have held the property for generations, or even centuries. Snapshot: Above, a hobbyhorse competition in Helsinki, Finland, last month. The country’s subculture of girls who ride stick horses long flourished under the radar, but it’s out in public now as a national export and a celebration of girlhood. Tech: Silicon Valley came to schools in Kansas. It didn’t go well. With an education approach focused on online learning, students complained of new headaches and anxiety and said they missed talking to teachers and students in class. Some have staged a rebellion. Royal baby fever: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are already bucking traditions when it comes to their future child. We looked at 100 years of photos that feature royal baby traditions. One photo features then-Princess Elizabeth’s christening cake, which weighed 150 pounds.

Smarter Living: Professional rejection hurts. Brain scans show that the physiological response to verbal or visual rejection looks fairly similar to the processing of physical pain. But research shows that blaming rejection on the relationship between the rejected and the rejecter, instead of on either individual, encourages people to keep on trying, and even get better. So consider whether your values were a mismatch for your interviewer, or if your skills didn’t quite suit the job. And, since the best businesses are always looking for ways to improve, here are a few ways to take your business to the next level. Today is Earth Day. Around the world, at least a billion people are expected to participate in trash cleanups, tree planting or other environmental activities. The day has been celebrated since 1970 as pollution became more evident — and as space exploration made clear that our planet is finite. One powerful factor was “Earthrise,” a photograph taken by the NASA astronaut William Anders in December 1968, as the Apollo 8 spacecraft turned at just the right angle. He realized that only color film would do the image justice, and scrambled to load his Hasselblad camera before the moment passed. Photography, along with spacewalks and scientific experiments, is part of astronauts’ job description. Today, astronauts are equipped with state-of-the-art gear and receive technical training. American astronauts learn about photography and video from instructors like Paul Reichert of NASA’s Flight Operations Directorate. NASA collects their work. Don Pettit and Jeff Williams are among the astronauts whose images have earned special note. Friday’s Back Story about Notre-Dame Cathedral referred incorrectly to Roman Catholic reverence for Mary.

2019,Your Monday Briefing,"Good morning, We start today with cautionary tales of high-tech in the U.S. and China, an exploration of the growing importance of women in India’s election and the world’s largest plane. The technology giant tracks the locations of hundreds of millions of phones worldwide, The Times found as part of our opinion section’s Privacy Project. The police in the U.S. have started using warrants to tap into Google’s location database, known as Sensorvault, not only for information about suspects but also for “geofence” requests on an area where a crime occurred. The dragnet can include data from dozens or hundreds of devices — and can sometimes ensnare innocent people. How we know: Reporters interviewed Google officials and employees, prosecutors and law enforcement agents, and reviewed warrants and other legal documents. Response: In a statement, Richard Salgado, Google’s director of law enforcement and information security, said that the company tried to “vigorously protect the privacy of our users while supporting the important work of law enforcement.” He said identifying information was provided only “where legally required.” Explainer: Here’s more about Sensorvault, and how you can disable Google’s data collection. Chinese authorities are using facial recognition technology embedded in its nationwide surveillance camera network to track and control Uighurs, a largely Muslim minority group, even beyond Xinjiang, the western area where they are most concentrated. It is the first known example of a government intentionally using artificial intelligence for racial profiling, experts said. How we know: The technology was described by five people with direct knowledge of the system. The Times also reviewed databases used by the police, government procurement documents and materials distributed by the A.I. companies making the systems. Message from Australia: Uighur Muslims who found sanctuary in Australia are pressuring their adopted homeland to take action against the mass incarcerations in Xinjiang, for what Beijing calls “re-education.” Stanford University is investigating the interactions one of its professors, Stephen Quake, had with a Chinese scientist, He Jiankui, as Dr. He was working on creating the world’s first gene-altered babies. Dr. He’s announcement of success last November sent shock waves around the world. The president of his university in China later wrote to Stanford’s president, accusing Dr. Quake of having helped in the experiment. Response: Dr. Quake denies the allegations. In his email exchanges with Dr. He, which he showed to The Times, there are no signs that he was involved with the work itself, but the messages do contain polite encouragement. Bigger picture: Scrutiny of Dr. Quake reflects the issues that the global scientific community is now grappling with: When and how should scientists report their colleagues’ controversial research ideas? The golfer won his first major title in 11 years, capturing the Masters title at Augusta National. It was an extraordinary comeback from personal and professional setbacks that almost derailed his career. His pursuit of Jack Nicklaus’s record 18 major championships is now officially back on. Background: In 2009, a marital dispute led to a car accident and a succession of lurid tabloid headlines. On the golf course, back and leg injuries led to an addiction to painkillers and raised questions about whether he could ever play professionally again. The Times profiled him last year. In 1962, less than half of India’s women voted. By 2014, that figure had shot up to 66 percent. This year, many expect women’s votes to outnumber men’s. That could be a political game changer. “Women are getting more educated, they’re more emancipated, they’re more independent,” said Prannoy Roy, co-founder of India’s NDTV news channel and a veteran poll analyst. Women have shown generally less support for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party. In 2014, if only women had voted, the B.J.P wouldn’t have won the historic majority it did in the lower house of Parliament, according to Mr. Roy, who analyzed the data for his new book, “The Verdict: Decoding India’s Elections.” What do women care about in this election? Jobs, Mr. Roy said. Record unemployment has hit women particularly hard. According to the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy, an independent think tank, of the 11 million jobs India lost in 2018, 8.8 million had been held by women. It’s little surprise, then, that several political parties, including the B.J.P. and the Congress Party, have proposed policies specifically intended to improve the job picture for women. Send us your feedback and questions about this series here. U.S.-China relations: The F.B.I. has started barring Chinese scholars from visiting the U.S. if they are suspected of having links to Beijing’s intelligence agencies, a sign of the mounting concerns in both countries over espionage, commercial theft and political meddling. ISIS: The Red Cross kept secret the identity of a nurse who was abducted by the terrorist group in late 2013 in Syria to increase her chances of survival. Now that the Islamic State has collapsed, the aid group has broken its silence — identifying her as Louisa Akavi from New Zealand — in the hopes that the public can help find her. Julian Assange: The extradition of the WikiLeaks founder to the U.S. will be a long and complex process of legal filings, hearings and administrative decisions that could take at least a year, experts said. Seychelles: The president of the archipelago made an impassioned plea to save the world’s oceans, from the inside of a submersible craft 400 feet below the surface of the Indian Ocean. Climate change: Rising temperatures and extreme weather cycles in Mexico and Central America are disrupting crops and harvests. That’s proving to be a tipping point for many farmers, who are increasingly abandoning their land and heading north toward the U.S. Stratolaunch: The world’s largest plane — with a wingspan longer than a football field — took flight for the first time. It’s designed to carry rockets to blast commercial satellites into space, which is considered more efficient than launching them from the ground. Animal rights: Many tourists visiting Egypt’s major attractions have been appalled by sights of abused, overworked horses and camels, calling on visitors to boycott animal rides. Snapshot: Above, the police commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar, India. Britain has stopped short of apologizing for the 1919 killings that claimed the lives of hundreds of people peacefully protesting colonial rule. What we’re reading: This article in Science News. “Dumbo is a delightful movie, but an elephant is never going to fly by flapping its ears,” says Michael Roston, a science editor. “This fun article by Bethany Brookshire examines the anatomical obstacles.” Cook: This dish of tomatoes, rice and melty Cheddar can be best described as pizza rice. (Yes, pizza rice.) Watch: Alex Ross Perry’s new feature, “Her Smell,” focuses on an all-female band’s lead singer (a raw, charismatic Elisabeth Moss) as she runs off the rails. Listen: The composer George Crumb turns 90 this year. The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center is presenting two concerts in tribute, but, if you can’t make those, we have a Spotify playlist of his compositions. Read: In “Horizon,” the environmentalist Barry Lopez reconstructs decades’ worth of his observations of the natural world. It’s one of eight new books we recommend. Smarter Living: There are scientifically proven, somewhat surprising ways to increase your memory power. Give your mind a chance to consolidate information by retreating to a dark, quiet room for 10 minutes of inactivity (but not sleep). And you can boost your brain’s ability to retrieve memories by quizzing yourself on them, or sharing them out loud. And we look at the benefits of sharing — whether triumphs, photos or difficulties — in person rather than on social media. With the arrest last week of its founder, Julian Assange, WikiLeaks is back in the headlines. “Leaks” is obvious for the name of the anti-secrecy organization, which started in 2006, but where does “wiki” come from? In 1995, the computer programmer Ward Cunningham introduced the first wiki, a website that’s collaboratively produced by users. He called it WikiWikiWeb, after the Hawaiian word for “quick,” which he had picked up from the name of an airport shuttle in the islands. The word was later adopted by Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia that started in 2001, and was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2007. The wiki isn’t Mr. Cunningham’s only contribution to modern online life. He also gave his name to Cunningham’s Law, the idea that the best way to find the correct answer on the internet isn’t to ask a question, but to post the wrong answer. It’s the eye of the Tiger, it’s the thrill of the fight. See you next time. — Alisha Thank youTo Mark Josephson, Eleanor Stanford and James K. Williamson for the break from the news.

2019,Opinion | Your Privacy Is Our Business,"Let us reassure you: You’re worried only because you don’t understand anything about anything. Ms. Powell writes about the tech world. You look upset. You’ve been making a lot of noise lately about deleting our company’s app from your phone. But please, sit down. Let me explain. You just don’t understand how technology works. I don’t mean that in a condescending way — it’s just that you clearly don’t have a Ph.D. in internet security, and I think you sometimes get a little confused when you talk about these matters. You keep saying we don’t respect your privacy, but look — here’s your data, right here in front of you. Here’s your picture of Uncle Greg throwing his face into the Mai Tai Volcano Bowl at that tiki bar. There’s your post on President Trump (nice job! That one got a lot of likes!). It’s all there, safe and secure in the warm blue blanket we’ve placed around it. No one has hacked it. It’s totally safe. Private. [As technology advances, will it continue to blur the lines between public and private? Sign up for Charlie Warzel’s limited-run newsletter to explore what's at stake and what you can do about it.] Maybe by “privacy,” what you really mean to say is “control” — that you don’t have any control over your data. Believe me, we are all about control. We have a ton of privacy settings on our app. Just click on the top right of your screen, and then the link on the pull-down menu, and then follow that one and the one after that and — there you go! The reason we make it a bit hard to get to your settings is that people aren’t really that interested in messing with those things. We know this because we watch everything you do. Having said that, we care deeply about privacy and security, and think it’s so empowering for you (for all of us, really) to have control over your data. So by all means, if it will make you feel better, go right ahead and change your ad settings so that we can’t target you as closely as before. But just so you know, this means we’re going to have to show you a lot of ads for colorful socks with elephants on them, because we really have no idea who wants to buy those things, and we’re paid to show them to someone. (Also, don’t be surprised if you suddenly feel lonely when all of our precision targeting disappears and your favorite brands are no longer in touch with you. What are you going to do? Go outside? Call your friends on the phone? This is 2019. No one wants to talk to you as much as the advertisers on our app.) You’re mumbling again and looking irritated. Something about us and a data breach. I can tell you’ve been reading the newspapers. Don’t you know those things are obsolete? And journalists are so ill informed on security matters. They don’t respect privacy — their whole job is to reveal private things! They are the last people you should listen to on this issue. Trust me when I assure you that there hasn’t been any data breach. Your data is secure. I mean, we did give third parties access to your data and sat back and watched as a political party used an ethically dubious service to target people in one of the most fraught elections in modern history, but really, who doesn’t do that in this industry? Also, we want to be really clear on this point since you aren’t a very technical person: Your data was secure the whole time — it was just in someone else’s very secure hands. You’re shaking your head. Look, I know this is hard for you to understand, but I’m basically Henry Ford here and you are the old carriage driver who’s really worried that I’m going to run over your horse with my new car. And well, yes, I am going to do that — but here’s the thing! We’re doing it together. All right, I’m still working on that metaphor, but let’s talk about the printing press. You see, when the printing press was invented, people were very afraid of it. They tried to stop it. But the printing press democratized access to information. That’s what we want to do with your information — democratize it — and make it available to every person, everywhere. We want to set your data free! And we intend to make a fortune doing it.

2019,Your Student Loan Servicer Will Call You Back in a Year. Sorry.,"Your Money Many public servants in the federal loan forgiveness program spot errors in the count of their qualifying payments. Their servicer tells them reviews will take a while. The emails started arriving in my inbox from borrowers in the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program in late February. Their states of residence — Tennessee, California, Michigan — were all different. So were their jobs — teacher, doctor, member of the military. But their stories were the same. FedLoan, the servicer the federal government employs to administer the program, had undercounted the payments they had made, sometimes by years. And when they called to request a review, FedLoan told them that it would take a year to sort it all out. You read that right. A year. Trying to have kids? Considering buying a house? Pondering your next career move? You’ll need to make those big life decisions without knowing whether your student loan payments will go away in 2021, or five years later instead. “It is enough to make a grown man cry,” wrote David Russell, a science teacher in Ann Arbor, Mich. Another bewildered borrower, Meghan Keller, a lower and middle school counselor in Washington, D.C., simply asked this: “What in the world is going on over there?” Here’s what’s going on: The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is an administrative quagmire unlike nearly anything I’ve covered in a quarter-century as a journalist. It wasn’t supposed to end up like this. When the program was created in 2007, the big idea was to dismiss the remaining loan balances of government and nonprofit employees after 120 on-time payments. Participants have to be in the right kind of repayment plan with the right kind of loan, and end up at the right servicer: FedLoan. These rules did not end up being easy to explain or administer. The program became such a mess that Congress stepped in recently with $700 million-plus to try to help people who inadvertently disqualified themselves. Amid this chaos, plenty of borrowers have managed to follow the right-job-right-loan-right-plan rules only to discover that their all-important payment count is off. So they call FedLoan and ask for a review. I started making inquiries with both the Department of Education and FedLoan about a month ago. Since then, the story that FedLoan has told borrowers has started to change a bit: from a long estimated wait time, to a refusal to render a guess. I asked readers to take careful notes about their conversations. Nicole Skrzyniarz, a physical therapist who lives in Medford, Mass., said she had been requesting a review since March 2018. But when she asks how long it will take, she gets different answers. “Three months, six more weeks expedited, up to one year and, today, ‘a long time; nobody should have given you a time frame,’” Ms. Skrzyniarz, who works at a nonprofit hospital, wrote in an email last week. On Wednesday night, Katherine Cejda Bailey, who counsels children and families in a Memphis hospital, pressed a FedLoan phone worker for an updated timeline. She said the representative had told her that even expedited reviews “are taking forever.” Kyle Stefano, a Sacramento social worker for the homeless, thought FedLoan had botched her initial inquiry. Then, she said, she was told that she shouldn’t bother following up for now because FedLoan was prioritizing reviews for people who have already made 120 payments. The reason: increased media attention. The representative would not offer a timeline for her case. “It’s a mess,” Ms. Stefano told me. FedLoan’s own phone representatives seem to be losing patience, too, according to an email from Ms. Keller, the school counselor. During a call to FedLoan this week, she asked whether her account would just stay under review until she simply gave up. She said the rep had told her: “That about sums it up. It’s not O.K. how they are treating people.” I asked FedLoan and the Education Department about these problems. I heard back from the Education Department, which said it would speak for them both. “Any excessive delay in customer service is unacceptable,” the department said. “We understand the time it takes for borrower accounts to be reviewed is a problem, and we are working with our loan servicers to fix it,” said the department’s press secretary, Liz Hill. A United States Government Accountability Office report last year enumerated many flaws in the system that could lead to payment miscounts and confusion. In a budget hearing last month, Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, grilled Betsy DeVos, the secretary of education, over the sorry state of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program (and the journey of Jed Shafer, a borrower whose story I chronicled over the last two years). Ms. DeVos said Congress had made it difficult to qualify, while Mr. Merkley insisted that the Education Department wasn’t holding servicers accountable for poor customer service. Who’s right? The law is indeed complicated. That makes FedLoan’s job difficult, particularly as more people qualify — or want to find out if they do — for a highly popular program. And because of the many moving parts, borrowers may discover that they have misunderstood the rules, or that the servicer has miscounted their payments. One big problem, Ms. Hill said, is that borrowers often need their previous servicer to transfer payment records to FedLoan. If it’s not in a format FedLoan’s software can read, that creates delays. FedLoan has hired a consulting firm to make the process more efficient, Ms. Hill said. A bill introduced in the Senate on Thursday could simplify the program. Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, who helped coordinate the proposal for that $700 million-plus in fix-it money, also helped lead the effort on proposed legislation that would allow every federal loan and every federal repayment plan to qualify for the program. Another proposed change: Allow partial loan forgiveness after five years in a public service job. When I told Mr. Kaine about what I had heard from readers, he did not seem surprised. “I’m incredibly pissed off about it,” he said. “And it’s evidence for my proposition that this is not accidental but an intentional effort to sabotage.” There’s reason to be concerned. President Trump’s most recent budget suggested dismantling the program altogether. The odds of this happening are low, and borrowers already in the program would almost certainly be grandfathered in if it did. But budgets are a statement of values, and the Department of Education ultimately answers to the president. Mr. Kaine’s hope is that the new bill could be attached to a reauthorization of the federal Higher Education Act, which may happen this year. If it does, is he confident that FedLoan can follow whatever new regulations survive the legislative gantlet? “I don’t have confidence that would enable me to celebrate if this thing passes,” he said. “I’m going to feel good if it passes, and then there is going to have to be executive oversight.” The shame here is that it took a decade to recognize that the program’s dysfunction had become so acute. And even the best legislative developments are only as effective as the people who carry them out. So I expect that this problem will be with us for a long time. If you’re one of the people doing good work in the world and counting on the program, don’t just trust what you’re told. Print everything. Ask for written verification. And cross your fingers the next time you call for help, and hope the very people who are supposed to be looking out for you won’t tell you to come back in a year.",The New York Times
2019,Your Tuesday Briefing,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning, We start today with breaking news out of Paris, the rise of hard-line Islam in Indonesia’s political sphere and all things “Game of Thrones.” Thousands of people watched in shock from the banks of the Seine, and many more were riveted to television screens, as flames tore through the beloved medieval landmark’s wooden roof, and the spire collapsed. Gray smoke filled the Paris sky into the night. Tourists and residents alike came to a standstill, pulling out their phones to call their loved ones. Older Parisians wept over the loss of a national treasure. For hours, hundreds of French firefighters battled to contain the blaze. No one was killed or injured, officials said. Cause: None had been identified as of this writing, but officials said the fire had begun in the attic. The cathedral is currently undergoing extensive renovation work, and several statues were lifted by crane from the spire last week. Go deeper: We have photos and video of the disaster, and a short history of this scarred jewel of Gothic architecture. Ahead of the presidential election on Wednesday, candidates are polishing their religious credentials to appeal to growing conservatism. The incumbent is Joko Widodo. His victory in 2014 was seen as a triumph for moderate Islam, but he’s veering right as he runs for re-election. His opponent, Prabowo Subianto — a European-educated son of a Christian — has also embraced the language of hard-line Islam. Background: Indonesia, home to the world’s largest Muslim population, has long been considered a shining example of how Islam and democracy can coexist. But in the past few years, the country’s Muslim majority has embraced stricter interpretations of the religion, including Wahhabism, which dominates in Saudi Arabia. Hundreds of Indonesians went to Syria and Iraq to join the Islamic State, and more cheer on the group on social media. With the 2020 election over a year away, President Trump is turning back to a strategy that resonated with his older, white voting base — playing on fears of Muslims. This time, he has a specific target: Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota and one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress. Last week, Mr. Trump posted a video on Twitter of a speech by Ms. Omar interspersed with video of the Sept. 11 attacks. And his advisers describe her as an ideal foil who could be used to paint the entire Democratic Party as extreme. Anti-immigration agenda: Our reporters have the back story behind the Trump administration’s recent purge of high-ranking immigration officials. The key ingredient: the fury of Stephen Miller, the 33-year-old White House senior adviser. He clashed for months with the officials, pushing for policies they saw as legally questionable, impractical, unethical or unreasonable. Prosecutors brought criminal charges of aggravated fraud against the executive, Martin Winterkorn, for his role in the automaker’s yearslong effort to deceive regulators about its vehicles’ diesel emissions. If convicted, Mr. Winterkorn could receive up to 10 years in prison. Details: German prosecutors said the charges were linked to events from 2006, when the deception was initially conceived, to 2015, when it first came to light. Prosecutors say that Mr. Winterkorn tried to conceal the emissions fraud even after he was told that it was beginning to raise some questions. Reminder: Last May, the U.S. Justice Department also charged Mr. Winterkorn with fraud, placing the scandal within the upper echelons of the company for the first time. Bangladesh is responsible for just 0.3 percent of global carbon emissions, yet it is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. Already, cyclones are stronger and more frequent. Survival takes many forms. In one area, people scavenge the debris left after storm surges devastated their village to sell to those rebuilding, making enough money to feed their children and send them to school. New Zealand: A rift emerged on Monday between the country’s government and the Red Cross over the humanitarian organization’s decision to identify a New Zealand nurse who was kidnapped by the Islamic State five years ago — and who her employer believes could still be alive. Japan: The operator of the Fukushima nuclear power plant has begun removing radioactive fuel rods at one of the reactors that melted down after an earthquake and a tsunami in 2011, a major milestone in the long-delayed cleanup effort. South Korea: President Moon Jae-in said that he wanted to meet again with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, even after Mr. Kim dismissed Mr. Moon’s mediating efforts between the North and the United States as “officious.” Canada: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose cabinet by design has equal numbers of men and women, has been fighting to salvage his feminist credentials after the country’s first Indigenous female attorney general quit accusing Mr. Trudeau of inappropriately pressuring her in a criminal case. “Game of Thrones”: Here’s a recap of the first episode of the HBO show’s last ever season. Don’t read this if you haven’t watched it yet — or at least don’t tell us we didn’t warn you about the spoilers. Snapshot: Above, “Game of Thrones” tourists in Ballintoy Harbour, Northern Ireland, which has stood in for several locations in Westeros. The hit HBO series has transformed the tourism industry in Northern Island, generating $65 million a year. What we’re reading: This essay in The Atlantic. Tom Jolly, who oversees production of our daily print edition, writes: “This is a nice distillation of the joys of reading the newspaper, at your own pace, uninterrupted by texts, calls and general attention-deficit issues. And you can even model your robe for your neighbors!” Cook: With some advance preparation, you can cook buttermilk-marinated roast chicken. (Our Five Weeknight Dishes newsletter has more recommendations.) Listen: “Boy With Luv,” the new song by the K-pop stars BTS, features the American singer Halsey singing in Korean, exactly the sort of bilingual exchange that’s all too rare, Jon Caramanica writes. Watch: The new TV adaptation of “Les Misérables” hews much more closely to Victor Hugo’s often tragic novel than to the musical version. Go: The musical “Beetlejuice” is now in previews on Broadway. Here’s how the eye-popping set came together. Smarter Living: Simone Davies, an author and Montessori teacher, took our writer through a calming makeover of her children’s playroom. The main idea: Kids play more when there’s less to play with. So toys and books went into a closet, to be rotated out a few at a time. A quilt with pillows marked out a reading corner. Older children’s crafts went into accessible bins. And the baby got a ground-level, stocked play space. Experts at Wirecutter have recommendations to affordably make your flight less dismal and more enjoyable. In smaller cities and rural areas of the U.S., demographic decline is a painful reality. Hungary is stressing about its declining population. Same with Japan. Even China. It’s an economic truism: Growing populations drive economies. But in this era of climate change, is it wiser to have fewer people to house, feed and provide power for? Globally, a smaller population would “make a difference, certainly,” said Joseph Chamie, a former U.N. population official. “Fewer people means fewer items consumed, and fewer resources used, so your carbon footprint would be less.” But limiting population growth, he said, can’t solve the environmental problems caused by mass production and consumption, especially in wealthier parts of the world. And companies whose business models rely on constant growth have little incentive to change. More customers and more consumption mean more profits. “We can try to maintain the quality of the environment,” Mr. Chamie said. “But we have to change our mind-set regarding how the economy moves.” That’s it for this briefing.

2019,Your Tuesday Briefing,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning, We start today with a look at Israeli elections, a record seizure of pangolin scales and a remarkable rail journey through the Horn of Africa. A court is expected to rule today in the case of nine activists facing public nuisance charges over months of large pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong in 2014, symbolized by the umbrellas many protesters carried. The charges carry a maximum penalty of seven years in prison. Three of the activists were founders of Occupy Central With Love and Peace, one of the main groups that urged a sit-in and demanded changes to Hong Kong’s electoral system. Background: Hong Kong was a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” arrangement that allowed it more robust civil liberties than the mainland. The semiautonomous city had hoped to eventually be able to elect its leader directly, and restrictions set out by Beijing sparked the protests. Impact: The government has prosecuted 266 people in connection with the protests so far, with 118 convictions. Prime Minister Theresa May’s government met with officials from the opposition Labour Party to resuscitate stalled talks over a compromise plan for Britain’s withdrawal from the E.U., which is currently scheduled to take place on Friday. Over the weekend, Mrs. May suggested that a compromise could be worked out around immigration from the E.U., which could pave the way for maintaining close economic ties with the bloc. What’s next: The prime minister is expected to seek another Brexit extension from European leaders on Wednesday. Some French officials expressed reluctance to grant her the delay unless she had a new plan with “credible political backing” in hand. A day after the U.S. homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, resigned, the president expected the departure of the director of the Secret Service, the head of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the department’s general counsel. The exodus appeared to be part of an effort by the president to clear out the department and steer it in a “tougher” direction. However, many immigration policy changes require congressional approval. Visas: The federal government wants to issue more visas for foreign workers to take temporary jobs in housekeeping, landscaping and other fields, even as Mr. Trump threatens to seal the border with Mexico, where most of those workers come from. The country heads into a parliamentary election today with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, one of the country’s longest-serving leaders, facing stiff competition from a new rival, Benny Gantz, a former army chief. Mr. Netanyahu has overseen healthy economic growth but this time charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust have loomed over his campaign. Political bombshell: Over the weekend, Mr. Netanyahu pledged that, if re-elected, he would extend Israel’s sovereignty over the West Bank, an apparent last-ditch attempt to woo right-wing voters. The West Bank is home to 2.6 million Palestinians. If Mr. Netanyahu carried out his promise, it could end any possibility of a two-state solution. Iran: In a move that could give Mr. Netanyahu a boost, President Trump designated an arm of the Iranian military — the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps — as a foreign terrorist organization, the first time the U.S. has made such a declaration about part of a government.

Japan: Roman Catholic bishops plan to conduct a nationwide survey on sexual abuse of children by members of the clergy, church officials said on Monday. Maldives: The party of the president, Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, appeared to have won decisively in parliamentary elections over the weekend. The result may help him restore political freedoms in the country, which has an authoritarian past, and some believe he could also push back against China’s growing influence in the archipelago. Britain: The government has proposed sweeping powers to fight the online spread of violent and extremist content, false information, and harmful material aimed at children in one of the world’s most aggressive plans to regulate the internet.

But a new retrospective of the British designer Mary Quant reminds us of an earlier fashion flash point: the miniskirt revolution. Ms. Quant, a trailblazer of Swinging Sixties fashion, famously said she “didn’t have time to wait for women’s lib.” Her higher-than-high hemlines insisted on young women’s right to bare their legs. She named her trademark skirt after her favorite car, the original Mini Cooper. Pieces of clothing resembling miniskirts have been identified by archaeologists as far back as the 1300s B.C., but it wasn’t until the mid-20th century that the mini really took off. Staying true to the Hemline Index (whereby skirt hemlines rise along with stock prices), the miniskirt perfectly captured 1960s London. The trend has followed a boom-and-bust cycle ever since. Bans on short skirts are enforced in several African countries, however, and wearing a mini can prompt outrage — and even criminal arrest — in parts of the Middle East. That’s it for this briefing. And today, take some inspiration from “Dumbo”: Don’t just fly, soar. — Alisha Thank youTo Mark Josephson, Eleanor Stanford and James K. Williamson for the break from the news.

2019,"Japan, Venezuela, Apple: Your Wednesday Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning, We’re covering the ascension of Japan’s new emperor, uncertainty in Venezuela and the tales hidden in tree rings. Emperor Naruhito ascends to the Chrysanthemum Throne today, signifying the start of a new era. Yesterday, his father, Akihito, became the first emperor to abdicate in 200 years. For this unusual shift in the world’s oldest monarchy, our Tokyo bureau chief took a deeper look at the royal family, which has faced near extinction, intrigue, drama and disappointments. Part 1: After World War II, when Akihito was a 12-year-old crown prince, international pressure was mounting to prosecute Japan’s royal family, and the fate of the monarchy hung in the balance. Part 2: In 1975, Akihito and his wife, Michiko, visited a seething Okinawa. His mission: to atone for Japan’s wartime sins. Part 3: A decade later, the future of the royal family was again at stake, this time hinging on Naruhito’s finding a wife — and fathering a son. He fell in love with a diplomat and, despite the country’s impatience, waited six years for her. Part 4: To marry Naruhito, Masako Owada gave up everything: career, travel, independence. But all the country seemed to care about was whether she could give birth to a son. Part 5: Princess Mako, the oldest granddaughter of Akihito, fell in love with a commoner with shaggy hair. Even though she won’t come anywhere near the throne, the country is grappling with one question: Is he good enough? In a video posted on social media, the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, called on the people and the military to rise up against President Nicolás Maduro. He was flanked by men in uniform at an air force base in the heart of the capital, Caracas. Later in the day, John Bolton, the U.S. national security adviser, told reporters that central figures in the Maduro government had committed to help transfer power to Mr. Guaidó. They, however, publicly stated their support for Mr. Maduro. Here’s our live briefing. Catch up: Here’s an overview of the situation in Venezuela. President Maithripala Sirisena announced the “immediate” lifting of a temporary ban on social media networks imposed after the Easter Sunday bombings, aimed at preventing the spread of misinformation that might foment unrest. The investigation: The Islamic State’s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, said the bombings were carried out by his fighters, but investigators are still trying to pin down direct connections between ISIS and a local terrorist organization. One lead they’re following is possible travel to Syria by one of the bombers. Go deeper: Religious tension has surged in Sri Lanka since the attacks, which killed more than 250 people in churches and high-end hotels. The mostly Buddhist Sinhalese say their survival is being threatened by the country’s Muslims, though the Sinhalese make up three-quarters of the population and dominate politics. This dynamic, sometimes known as a majority with a minority complex, can be seen in the rise of right-wing populism and nationalism around the world. Trees, it turns out, are giant organic recording devices. The circles etched into the trunk tell ancient stories about past climate, civilizations, ecosystems and even galactic events, much of them many thousands of years old. In recent years, techniques to pry that kind of data from tree rings have expanded, helping scientists forecast future climate patterns. Apple: The company’s revenue fell in the latest quarter on weak iPhone demand, its first consecutive quarterly decline in more than two years. Check back here for updates. C.I.A.: A former officer accused of working with Beijing is expected to plead guilty to charges of unlawful retention of secret information and conspiracy to deliver it to aid a foreign government. His prosecution came amid increased concern in Washington about Chinese espionage in recent years. China: President Xi Jinping commemorated the 100th anniversary of the May 4 student protests against Western colonialism, using the moment to burnish his brand of authoritarian nationalism while playing down the anti-authority themes that emerged from the movement. Facebook: The social media company unveiled a redesign of its mobile app and desktop site, adding features to promote private group communication rather than the public News Feed. The shift is a sign of how privacy scandals have forced Facebook to change. U.S.: President Trump ordered new restrictions on asylum seekers, including setting a fee for their applications and work permits. The move is the latest attempt by the president to shape asylum law, which is usually decided by Congress. Muslim Brotherhood: The Trump administration is said to be pushing to designate the Islamist political movement as a foreign terrorist organization. The designation would come on the heels of an April 9 White House visit by the Egyptian president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who is politically opposed to the group. Snapshot: Above, the Somali-American model Halima Aden, who will be the first woman to wear a hijab and burkini in Sports Illustrated’s annual swimsuit issue. Afghanistan: Fights involving dogs, birds and camels feed the Afghan love of animal “sports,” although religious leaders decry them as sinful. The Obamas: Barack and Michelle Obama’s new video production company revealed it is working on seven projects for Netflix, including a drama series on “the barriers faced by women and people of color,” a movie about Frederick Douglass and an adaptation of The Times’s “Overlooked” obituary series for people whose deaths were previous unreported in the paper. What we’re reading: This piece in The Guardian. Stephen Hiltner, who’s been writing some of our briefings, says: “This characteristically brilliant essay by one of my favorite nature writers, Robert Macfarlane, asks us to consider the world’s oft-neglected underground spaces — and what they might tell us about our planet’s future.” Cook: Are you a planner?

In many countries, today is observed as International Workers’ Day. The date memorializes a conflict that became a flash point in the organized labor movement around the world. In 1886, on the fourth day of national protests in the U.S. calling for an eight-hour work day, police officers responded to a homemade bomb in Chicago’s Haymarket Square with gunfire. Within minutes, seven officers and four protesters were dead. Eight labor organizers were arrested, tried and convicted. Socialist and Communist groups meeting in Paris a few years later chose to remember the Haymarket affair by making the date the protests began, May 1, a labor holiday. But some U.S. politicians feared following suit. The country eventually followed the lead of a handful of states and Canada, which had been observing a holiday for workers in September since the early 1880s. In 1894, the U.S. made Labor Day a national holiday, to be celebrated each year on the first Monday in September. That’s it for this briefing.

2019,Your Wednesday Briefing,"Good morning, We start today with the latest from Israel’s election, a conversation with Pakistan’s leader and a deep dive into everything you need to know about the coming royal baby. Breaking Voting has ended in Israel and exit polls show a dead heat between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his main rival, Benny Gantz. We’ll bring you the results as they become clearer. Prime Minister Imran Khan gave an hourlong interview to The Times and other foreign journalists in which he sought to project resolve, including on one of the biggest issues he faces. “We have decided, for the future of our country — forget the outside pressure — we will not allow armed militias to operate anymore,” he said. He acknowledged that “the Pakistan Army created them,” referring to the 1980s, when Pakistan and the U.S. backed Muslim insurgents in Afghanistan against Soviet forces. Backdrop: An international watchdog group, the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force, is on the brink of blacklisting and leveling sanctions against Pakistan over the militias, which would make it more difficult for the country to obtain financial bailouts and loans. On India: Mr. Khan expressed concerns over the shift toward Hindu nationalism and surging anti-Muslim crimes under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party. (India’s general elections begin tomorrow and proceed in phases until May 19. Results will be announced on May 23. Follow our coverage of the election here and in this Briefing.) House Democrats took the opportunity of a routine appropriations subcommittee meeting on the 2019 budget to grill the attorney general, William Barr, about his handling of the special counsel’s findings about the Trump campaign’s links to Russia and questions of whether President Trump obstructed justice. One lawmaker called Mr. Barr’s brief summary of the report and his rapid conclusion that it showed no obstruction “unacceptable.” Mr. Barr said, “From my standpoint, within a week I will be in a position to release the report to the public.” He said he would be transparent about redactions, but he declined to say whether he had briefed the White House on the report. Trump tax returns: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers that White House lawyers and his department had discussed a congressional request for the president’s returns — the first public acknowledgment of what is shaping up to be an extraordinary legal battle between two branches of the U.S. government. Beijing has been pushing back against global criticism for detaining as many as one million members of Muslim ethnic minority groups in the western Xinjiang region. Last month, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation — a group of 57 nations that has been a vocal defender of the Rohingyas and Palestinians — praised China for “providing care to its Muslim citizens,” surprising human rights activists. China’s power: In a word, money. Many Muslim countries — including Indonesia, Pakistan and Turkey — have embraced Beijing’s trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, for which China is building a network of ports, railways and roads in nations across Asia, Europe and Africa. Why it matters: As Muslim countries toe China’s line, pressure on the West to act on Xinjiang shrinks. Demonstrators in Sudan are demanding the departure of the country’s authoritarian ruler. Algeria’s longtime leader was forced out. And in Libya, an aging general is promising to end the chaos that followed the ouster of the dictator Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2011. Our correspondent, a veteran of the uprisings across the Arab world eight years ago, says the rebellions are still reverberating across North Africa. Takeaway: The problems that sparked the Arab Spring — disaffected youth, closed and corrupt economies, and authoritarian governments unresponsive to the public — remain. The Boeing 737 Max jet that crashed twice in five months relied on decades-old systems and left pilots without some common safety features. “It was state-of-the-art at the time, but that was 50 years ago,” said a former engineer who helped design the Max’s cockpit. “It’s not a good airplane for the current environment.” Bitcoin: Beijing is planning new steps to put an end to Bitcoin mining in China, which would quash one of the world’s largest sources of the unstable cryptocurrency. Hong Kong: Nine democracy activists were convicted on Tuesday on public nuisance charges for their roles in the Umbrella Movement protests that swept the city five years ago, demanding electoral reform. The activists face up to seven years in prison. Standard Chartered: The British bank agreed to pay $1.1 billion to settle allegations from U.S. and British authorities that it violated economic sanctions by processing hundreds of millions of dollars in transactions from Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria. Carlos Ghosn: The former head of Nissan Motor slammed the company’s management in a video made before his fourth arrest in Tokyo last week and played at a hastily arranged news conference on Tuesday. He accused the same executives he says were plotting against him of running the Japanese automaker into the ground. India: The authorities in the southern state of Kerala charged a bishop with repeatedly raping a nun, the first case of its kind in the country. Saudi Arabia: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, facing criticism that the Trump administration was too soft on the kingdom after the killing of the dissident Jamal Khashoggi, barred 16 Saudis from entering the U.S., including one of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s closest aides. Snapshot: Above, a scene from the popular new Amazon Prime India series “Made in Heaven,” about a pair of wedding planners for the elite upper class.

For someone who called Canada home for only about five years, Frederick Arthur Stanley certainly found effective ways for his name to live on. The signature park that dominates Vancouver’s downtown bears his name. Even more famously, there’s the Stanley Cup, the silver trophy he donated in 1892. (It cost about $50.) Top teams in the National Hockey League begin this year’s competition for it today. Stanley was a British politician who was appointed governor general of Canada in 1888. Canadians were still British subjects, so the job as Queen Victoria’s representative loomed large. He created the hockey award because of his sons’ interest in the sport. Originally called the Dominion Challenge Trophy, it was for the best amateur team in Canada. But there is no indication that the man who first awarded it ever picked up a stick and took to the ice. His real passion was horse racing. That’s it for this briefing. See you next time. — Alisha Thank youTo Mark Josephson, Eleanor Stanford and James K. Williamson for the break from the news.

2019,Your Wednesday Briefing,"Good morning, We start today with the latest from Paris, a preview of Indonesia’s presidential election and a disturbingly successful facial recognition experiment. A day after a monstrous fire ravaged the roof of Paris’s famed cathedral, investigators are looking for the cause. Already, more than $600 million has been committed to the reconstruction of the 850-year-old landmark. What we know: The cathedral’s twin medieval towers survived, but its 300-foot spire collapsed and two-thirds of its roof was destroyed. No one was killed, officials said, but one firefighter and two police officers were injured. Here’s a guide to the latest details and a look at how the fire spread. The treasures: The fire endangered Notre-Dame’s vast collection of Christian artworks and relics. Some significant items have suffered, but many were saved, including a relic of what many believe is the crown of thorns worn by Jesus. And by some miracle of timing, the copper sculptures on the spire also escaped a fiery end — they were removed for restoration just days before the blaze. Go deeper: As France struggles to cope with recent social and political unrest, the symbolism of the blaze was hard to miss, our architecture critic writes. One of the world’s largest countries heads into presidential elections today, facing an important choice: Continue with the low-key, steady leadership of President Joko Widodo or switch to his opponent, Prabowo Subianto. Mr. Joko, a former furniture seller who was born in a slum, has risen to the top of Indonesia’s political sphere. As president, he expanded health care for the poor and built thousands of miles of roads, bridges, airports and a subway in the capital city of Jakarta. Mr. Prabowo is a former general and the son-in-law of the country’s former dictator, Suharto. Mr. Prabowo’s human rights record earned him a yearslong ban on entering the U.S. This election cycle, he has transformed himself into a populist, wooing hard-line Islamists and the poor. Forecast: Personality often prevails over ideology in Indonesian elections, and the policy differences between the two candidates are not great. A victory for Mr. Prabowo would most likely mean advancing measures to promote Islam in daily life and greater military spending to rebuild the armed forces; a victory for Mr. Joko offers continuity, though the country is notoriously hard to govern. Mr. Trump has referred to their country as “our enemy” and “a major threat,” but some of China’s intellectual and business elite are semi-seriously cheering on the U.S. president as he confronts their country. True reform would have to come from within China, but if its trade dispute with the U.S. forces the Communist Party to step back from the economy, it might also have to loosen its grip on the rest of society. Related: Mr. Trump has used his unpredictability as a source of leverage in trade discussions with Europe, Canada, Mexico and others. But business groups and foreign officials worry that his negotiating style has a cost. Looking ahead: Beijing is expected to release economic growth data today. The French automaker still controls Nissan, but with their former leader, Carlos Ghosn, in a Tokyo jail, the union he stitched together seems to be teetering on the edge. In recent weeks, Renault has scrambled to keep its Japanese partner happy. It created a new leadership board that gives Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors equal weight, and has largely let Nissan dismantle the power structures that they say Mr. Ghosn put in place. But there’s still one source of tension: Renault’s outsize stake in the more successful Nissan. Looking ahead: A Tokyo court has ruled that Mr. Ghosn — who was rearrested earlier this month while out on bail — will remain in custody until Monday at least. The Times ran publicly available images of people who work near a New York City park and a day’s worth of surveillance camera footage through a commercially available facial recognition service. It cost less than $100 and was all completely legal. We’ve deleted the data, but the experiment, part of our Privacy Project, highlights just how easy it is to track people without their knowledge.

The designers Richard Saul Wurman and Harry Marks organized the gathering around the convergence of technology, entertainment and design — TED. Mr. Wurman welcomed attendees to “the dinner party I always wanted to have but couldn’t.” Financially, it was a flop. There wouldn’t be another for six years.

2019,Your Wednesday Briefing,"Good morning, We start today with the latest news from Sri Lanka, the logistical hurdles to beginning a new era in Japan and a journey along the fabled Silk Road. In his first televised address since a series of bombings on Sunday killed at least 321 people, President Maithripala Sirisena promised to restructure the military and police over failure to act on warnings that the attacks were being planned. “I must be truthful and admit that there were lapses on the part of defense officials,” the president said. Islamic State: The group claimed responsibility for the attacks but their statement was difficult to independently verify. “If the ISIS link in Sri Lanka proves true, this could be their most deadly attack outside Iraq and Syria,” writes Rukmini Callimachi, our ISIS expert. Follow her on Twitter for the latest analysis. The victims: On Tuesday, the country observed a full day of mourning and began the first mass burials of victims. Read profiles of those who died. Catch up: Here’s what we know and don’t know about the attacks. Stabbing a defenseless teenager to death. Using a sniper to shoot at a schoolgirl and an unarmed old man. Indiscriminately spraying neighborhoods with machine-gun fire. These were some of the shocking allegations against a highly decorated platoon chief, Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher, during his time in Iraq. But when Navy SEAL commandos reported his actions, they were told that speaking out could cost them their careers. How we know: The Times obtained a confidential Navy criminal investigation report. What’s next: Because the commandos forced the referral of their concerns to authorities outside the SEALs, Chief Gallagher was arrested in September on more than a dozen charges, including premeditated murder and attempted murder. He has pleaded not guilty, and his court-martial trial is set to begin on May 28. Publicity: His wife and brother have been making television appearances to demand his release and mustering support among Republican lawmakers, and, after President Trump commented on the case, Chief Gallagher was moved to less restrictive detention. In a stage-managed vote, the country approved a set of constitutional amendments that arm President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi with expansive new powers over the judiciary and Parliament. The amendments also allow him to remain in office until 2030. Since Mr. Sisi came to power in 2013, he has implemented harsh austerity measures, quashed any hint of criticism and eliminated political opponents. His supporters see him as a bulwark against terrorism, a friend to Egypt’s Christian minority and an economic reformer. Takeaway: The results of the three-day referendum crystallized analysts’ suspicions that Mr. Sisi is erasing the democratic gains of the 2011 uprisings and also building a brand of authoritarianism surpassing that of Hosni Mubarak, the ousted former leader. When the clock strikes midnight next Tuesday, most of the world will remain in the year 2019. But across Japan, which internally uses an ancient imperial calendar that honors the reigning emperor, it will mark the first day of the first year of the age of Reiwa. In practice, the succession from Emperor Akihito to Emperor Naruhito means turning the clock to Year 1 on all official government documents, from tax forms to marriage registrations, and updating software. Impact: The city of Nagoya estimates it will spend about $4.3 million preparing for the Reiwa era. In the city of Koga, employees preparing for the changeover accidentally erased 1,650 water bills. Background: Japan adopted the imperial calendar from the Chinese in the seventh century, and government agencies have been required to use it since the late 1970s. The current hiccups have prompted a wider conversation about whether it’s time to finally switch to the Gregorian calendar completely. Reiwa: There’s no single translation for the name of the new imperial era. Sudan’s Air Force chief, Lt. Gen. Salah Abdelkhalig, initially opposed the protesters who were calling for an end to the autocratic leadership of President Omar al-Bashir. But as more demonstrators gathered outside his office at the military headquarters, he started to have a change of heart. Amid the masses was his own son. Saudi Arabia: The kingdom executed 37 men on Tuesday for terrorism-related crimes. The state-run news agency identified them by name, mostly Shiite Muslims, but gave little information on what crimes they had committed or when. The Philippines: Six soldiers were killed by Communist rebels in the central island province of Samar, the military reported.

Are you insane? If your ancestors lived in the U.S., they could have faced that question in censuses past. The Supreme Court heard arguments on Tuesday on universalizing a controversial census question historically asked only of some population groups before being dropped decades ago: whether the respondent is a citizen. The population count, required every 10 years by the U.S. Constitution, has changed with time and political concerns. The first census, in 1790, listed the names of only heads of household. By 1850, the census included all household members, but left out the enslaved. After the Civil War, race questions became tortuous. An article in The Sun of New York in 1890, headlined “A Census Puzzle,” detailed objections to classifying people as Negro, mulatto, quadroon, octoroon, white, Chinese, Japanese or Indian. That version of the question was abandoned by 1900. Many would say mental health and competency are also hardly simple issues. From 1850 to 1880, census officials gave it a shot, asking if any household members were “deaf and dumb, blind, insane or idiotic.” The question was tweaked for 1890 and then dropped. That’s it for this briefing. Tuesday’s briefing incorrectly identified some of the foreign victims of the suicide bombings in Sri Lanka.

2019,Opinion | You’re About to Get Fewer Robocalls. But Maybe Not for Long.,"Telecommunications companies are adopting new technology to kill phone spam — but the spammers may stay a step ahead. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. If you think robocall scams have gotten worse lately, you’re right. By one reckoning, Americans received 48 billion robocalls last year, up from 30 billion in 2017. But there’s good news: Major telecom companies, including AT&T, Comcast, T-Mobile and Verizon, have announced that they will voluntarily adopt the dual technologies known as Secure Telephone Identity Revisited and Signature-Based Handling of Asserted Information Using Tokens, known collectively as STIR/Shaken. The industrywide use of STIR/Shaken should hamper the prolific robocall industry by making it harder to fake calling from a number belonging to someone else. But will that be enough to end the onslaught of robocalls we all live with today? The earliest iteration of the technology, which isn’t all that different from what we’re about to get, was introduced in 2006. While robocalls were getting worse and worse, the Federal Communications Commission — a government agency that is supposed to protect consumers where communications networks are concerned — was being kneecapped by a movement toward deregulation playing out in the courts and eventually within the F.C.C. itself. “We’re at least five years short of where we should be,” said Henning Schulzrinne, who was chief technology officer of the F.C.C. during the Obama administration. He is also one of the architects of several key technologies, including those that underlie the Voice Over Internet Protocol, or VoIP, which was made popular with Skype, Google Hangouts and FaceTime, and a key tool for robocallers. He attributes the lag to inaction at every level — from industry, to regulators and even technologists like himself. “We didn’t call up The New York Times and say there will be a catastrophe coming,” Mr. Schulzrinne said. “We didn’t raise as much hell as we should have.” The same technology that lets grandparents video chat with their distant grandchildren makes robocalling cheap and lucrative. Robocallers — often located overseas — make thousands and sometimes millions of phone calls using VoIP. One of the reasons these calls are so difficult to police is that robocallers usually spoof their origin: They appear to be calling from a phone number they don’t actually own. It’s why you get so many unwanted calls from your own area code, sometimes only a few digits off from your own number. Spoofing also helps robocallers evade any block lists and spam filters that the carriers use, or that you might have signed on to. To pierce the fog of spoofing, STIR/Shaken adds a layer of authentication to calls. It makes spam call filters more effective, it makes uncovering the source of a robocall easier and it helps ordinary people who might get confused by someone pretending to call from, say, their bank’s official 1-800 number. Things never had to get this bad. The standards body that proposed the first iteration of STIR/Shaken back in 2006 went on to identify robocalling even more urgently as a problem in 2008. By 2012, robocalling had become such a menace that the Federal Trade Commission called a meeting to develop solutions. And in 2016, the F.C.C., under Tom Wheeler, who was then the chairman, asked carriers to voluntarily adopt fixes. They are finally acting now. While the government was convening meetings and was finger-wagging at companies, an ideological battle over deregulation was in full swing. Legal experts disagree as to whether the F.C.C. currently has the authority to police robocalls. It’s enough of a question mark that legislation introduced by Senator Ed Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, and John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, would specifically require providers of voice services to use authentication services like STIR/Shaken. In the wake of the companies’ action against robocallers, what’s likely to happen is that they will adjust their tactics — for example, by buying cheap, “legitimate” United States-based numbers in the hundreds, maybe thousands, rather than spoofing phone numbers from abroad. “The hope is that an industry-led regulatory body is nimble enough to catch spammers as they adapt, and update standards accordingly,” Jake Swearingen wrote in New York magazine. But there's no guarantee the telecom companies will continue to fight the scammers as their shady tactics evolve. Phone calls are not the lucrative part of the current array of services the telecom companies offer and are dirt cheap to boot. Telecoms don’t lose much (if any) money on the fire hose of seconds-long spam calls that proliferate. Why invest a lot of resources in blocking them instead of, say, developing 5G networks? Regulatory agencies exist to protect consumers when economic incentives fail them. Although communications czars under the Obama administration were less averse to regulation, even they did not do enough to stop the robocall scourge. Now a hamstrung F.C.C. is in even worse shape to deal with agile scammers armed to the teeth with technologies that enable them to exploit and torment consumers.

2019,You’re Covered in Fungi. How Does That Affect Your Health?,"Following extensive study of the body’s bacterial occupants, researchers are turning to how our fungal residents may contribute to inflammatory bowel diseases and other maladies. The connections among different parts of the human body are full of surprises, but here’s one you might not have considered: Could a thing that causes dandruff on your head also be contributing to your digestive problems? That’s one mystery that scientists are trying to unravel with research into the fungi that live in your gut. While the bacteria that colonize our intestines have been a scientific focus for more than a decade, the fungal critters there are starting to get more attention. Already, these studies have uncovered striking connections between fungi and several chronic illnesses, including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. As is typical in medical science, a simple explanation (A causes B, which can be cured by C) is unlikely. But the potential to improve the lives of hundreds of thousands of patients — and to uncover complex processes we never realized were at the root of these diseases — has made the fungal field tantalizing to medical researchers. “It’s a very exciting area of science to be involved in,” said David Underhill, research chair for inflammatory bowel diseases at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. “I think over the next five years, certainly 10 years, we will develop a very different understanding of this area.” Dr. Underhill’s team is investigating the links between fungi in the gut and inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn’s. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Researchers first became interested in studying the microbiome when advances in DNA technology made it easier to identify microorganisms in and on the human body. Earlier work, Dr. Underhill said, focused mainly on bacteria, because there are far more of them in our bodies, compared with any other type of organism. There are trillions of bacteria in the digestive tract, and as many as 100 different species. Fungi number in the hundreds of thousands, with just a handful of different species. For years, fungi were given scientific short shrift. Now, with our understanding of the bacterial microbiome better established, researchers have turned their attention to fungi, what some call the mycobiome. It has quickly become evident that these organisms play a distinct role in our health. One fungus at the center of Dr. Underhill’s research is Malassezia. Though its name may be unfamiliar, you’re currently coated in it. The fungus is ubiquitous on a healthy human body; it colonizes the skin shortly after birth. For some people, Malassezia on the scalp creates irritation that causes dandruff. But it also turns up inside our bodies, along the digestive tract. Recently, Dr. Underhill and his colleagues published a study in the journal Cell Host & Microbe that suggested a link between Malassezia in the gut and Crohn’s disease. Individuals with Crohn’s had high concentrations of Malassezia on their intestine walls, while healthy patients had almost none. The researchers then demonstrated that simply adding this type of fungi to the gut — at least, in mice — was enough to exacerbate the inflammation seen in Crohn’s. This work built on a growing body of evidence linking fungi to inflammatory bowel diseases. As early as 2010, researchers reported that antifungal medications helped I.B.D. patients go into remission. By 2012, Malassezia in particular was found to be associated with these kinds of disease. In 2016, researchers in France published a study that showed the fungal populations in people with bowel conditions were wildly different than those in healthy patients. “It’s small pieces that we are putting together,” said Mathias L. Richard, a microbiologist at the Micalis Institute in France and a co-author of that study. The race is on to make these connections and add to the growing body of evidence. The findings could benefit hundreds of thousands of people. Crohn’s disease, for example, is commonly treated using anti-inflammatory drugs known as TNF inhibitors. But these treatments are only effective for about 60 percent of patients, according to the Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation. The drugs are also costly: The anti-TNF drug Humira can run as much as $38,000 per year, depending on a patient’s insurance. The link between Crohn’s and Malassezia raises the possibility — not yet proven — that something as simple as a generic antifungal drug could provide relief: Wipe out the fungus, wipe out the inflammation. Dr. Underhill and his colleagues are moving into clinical trials now, just one of many teams eager to test the idea. Scientists in Montreal are pursuing a similar clinical trial, with treatment beginning as early as this summer, according to Martin Laurence, a researcher and the creator of The Malassezia Project, which tracks the research published on this particular organism. It’s not just inflammatory bowel diseases that have been connected to the mycobiome. A study published last year showed that altering the composition of gut fungi in mice exacerbated symptoms of asthma. Some early evidence suggests a link between fungal infections and prostate cancer. “The technology improves every year, we get better and better at identifying organisms and their role in disease and symptom processing,” said Dr. J. Curtis Nickel, a urologist at Queen’s University in Canada. Dr. Nickel is the co-author of forthcoming research that suggests links between Malassezia and interstitial cystitis, a chronic and painful bladder condition. He said the next step for many researchers is to investigate how these fungi interact with and are affected by the other organisms that live alongside them. “I personally suspect that it’s an interaction of all the different bacteria, fungi and viruses,” Dr. Nickel said. “An unhealthy population of these organisms exacerbates disease and perhaps even — this is the next step — causes it. But boy, we’re not there yet.” Although we’re far from declaring antifungals a panacea for gut ailments, scientists are optimistic that further research into the mycobiome will help solve the mysteries surrounding these inflammatory diseases, and may even offer new forms of treatment. “When you speak about this research to the people who have these diseases, it’s like a new light in the dark,” Dr. Richard said. “It’s a new hope.”",The New York Times
2019,You’re a Widow. Now What?,"Retiring Susan Covell Alpert was crushed by grief when her 71-year-old husband, Larry, died of leukemia in 2008. Adding to her misery, a tidal wave of financial decisions and tasks demanded the new widow’s attention at a time when she could barely think straight. Like many couples, Susan and Larry, who were married for 46 years, had divided the financial chores. Larry handled the investments, and Susan paid some bills. Though Ms. Alpert owned a business arranging travel incentives for large corporations, she was not prepared to manage the household’s financial affairs. “I knew every stock, and I knew where everything was,” said Ms. Alpert, 78. “But I didn’t know what to do with it all.” Nor did she know what the investments were worth. Rather than holding securities in a brokerage account, Mr. Alpert had opted for paper certificates, which he kept in his desk in their home in Newport Beach, Calif. Ms. Alpert hired a bookkeeper and a financial adviser, and it took them a year to determine the value of the more than 120 certificates, she said. That was just one of numerous issues that Ms. Alpert confronted. Besides the settlement of the estate, there were insurance companies to call, banks to visit, credit cards to cancel, documents to collect and her husband’s business partnership to unwind. “I was in the most fragile part of my life, and there was no time to breathe,” she said. Ms. Alpert decided to approach the “chaos” as she would a business. She spent six to eight hours a day for many months tackling the paperwork — color-coded file folders and all. A grief therapist advised her to get dressed every day and to eat regularly. “She also made me promise not to go into my home office one day a week,” Ms. Alpert said. In 2013, Ms. Alpert opened a consulting business to advise other widows on handling the practical aspects of settling an estate. She also wrote a book, “Driving Solo: Dealing With Grief and the Business of Financial Survival.” A spouse’s death is one of the most emotionally wrenching events in a person’s life. Because they live longer, women are more likely than men to lose a spouse. Roughly 34 percent of women 65 and older were widows in 2016, compared with about 12 percent of men, according to the Census Bureau. The financial challenges can be especially daunting for women. Husbands tend to earn more than their wives, and the end of that income can be a big blow. And in more cases than not, husbands oversee the household finances, often leaving their widows scrambling to sort everything out. If that’s not enough, many widows are immediately deluged by tasks that come with settling an estate. “I was buried in boxes filled with legal paperwork, tax paperwork, trust paperwork, and I didn’t know what I was doing,” said Ellen Speyer, whose husband died in 2003. As tempting as it may be to charge ahead, however, new widows should postpone making major — and irreversible — financial decisions for six months to a year, said Alexandra Armstrong, a certified financial planner in Washington. Those decisions include selling a house, lending money to relatives or paying off a mortgage. It also means resisting sales pitches to plow insurance proceeds into annuities or other investments that tie up funds perhaps forever. “Widows may not recognize that they are in a state of shock, and they will not make wise decisions,” said Ms. Armstrong, author of “On Your Own: A Widow’s Passage to Emotional and Financial Well-Being.” “They should not jump into anything until they have a grip on their financial situation.” Surviving spouses can alleviate some stress by attacking the to-do list in stages, Ms. Armstrong said. At the top: Notify the Social Security Administration, call the life insurance company and pay important bills, such as those for utilities and property insurance premiums. If a husband was still working when he died, his widow should check with his employer for any unpaid salary, accrued vacation days and retirement plans. She also may be eligible for veterans’ benefits. One of Ms. Alpert’s first moves was to name her two adult daughters as her agents for her financial and health care powers of attorney. When it comes to insurance proceeds, Ms. Armstrong said, widows typically can choose between a lump sum and monthly payouts. The decision, she said, will depend on the widow’s immediate cash needs and whether she could earn more than the payout by investing the lump sum. She said a widow should ask an objective adviser to review her overall financial picture before she decided. By choosing the right Social Security claiming strategy based on her age and income, a surviving spouse can increase her benefit. “This is as close to free money as you can get,” said Jeffrey Levine, chief executive of BluePrint Wealth Alliance in Garden City, N.Y. A widow who waits until her full retirement age of 66 (for those born between 1945 and 1956) can claim the full survivor benefit, which is 100 percent of her husband’s benefit. She is eligible for a survivor benefit at 60, but it will be reduced for each month she claims before 66. If both spouses are at least 70 when the husband dies, a wife should switch to a survivor benefit if her benefit is smaller than his. Younger spouses have more options to maximize benefits, Mr. Levine said. For example, a surviving spouse who is the lower earner can create an income stream by collecting her own retirement benefit when she is eligible at 62 and switch to the higher survivor benefit when she turns 66. Taking her retirement benefit early will not reduce the survivor benefit. A wife who is eligible for a higher retirement benefit should take the opposite tack: She can collect a reduced survivor benefit early and switch at 70 to her own retirement benefit. Meanwhile, a spouse who inherits an individual retirement account has several choices. If she is younger than 70½ and does not need the money, she could, with the help of a brokerage firm, transfer her husband’s account directly into her own I.R.A. and then update the beneficiaries. She will not be required to take annual distributions until she is 70½, thus extending the time the funds can grow tax free. If a widow is younger than 59½ and may need the money, she can transfer the assets into a new inherited I.R.A. She can take taxable distributions without having to pay the 10 percent penalty imposed on early withdrawers, Mr. Levine said. For a preliminary assessment of cash flow, a widow can tote up sources of income and fixed expenses. But for a deeper dive, Ms. Alpert recommends adding a financial adviser to a team of professionals. While she and her husband already had an estate lawyer and an accountant, a friend helped her find a financial services firm. When she met with two young men from the firm, “I told them, ‘Take care of me like you would take care of your mother,’” she said. The financial adviser may reposition investments to provide additional income, Ms. Armstrong said. Though each case is different, she said, “I believe in buying good-quality stocks where there is a good potential for rising dividends.” If Ms. Armstrong decides an annuity is a nice fit, she will analyze the oft-hidden costs of an array of complex products. Kathleen M. Rehl, an author and a speaker who helps financial planners address the needs of widows, cautioned that widows often changed advisers because many do not understand a widow’s grief. “A widow should find an adviser who listens to her and does not try to rush her,” said Ms. Rehl, of St. Petersburg, Fla. Ms. Speyer and her husband, Ronald, had been seeing a financial adviser at a large brokerage firm who, she said, “did not take my questions seriously.” Shortly before Mr. Speyer died of Hodgkin’s lymphoma at age 57, they switched to an adviser at a small firm. “She was very kind and very thoughtful,” said Ms. Speyer, 71, a therapist in Irvine, Calif. For years, Mr. Speyer had monitored the overall finances and transferred what his wife needed to pay household bills. “I didn’t have to worry when I turned up the heat or went to the market,” Ms. Speyer said. “But I didn’t know the total cost of everything against our savings and income.” After her husband died, Ms. Speyer lost the income from a consulting firm he owned. Though moving to a smaller house would have freed up cash, she wanted to reduce the disruption for her 10-year-old daughter, she said. The adviser, whom Ms. Speyer still sees, diversified her portfolio and invested the proceeds from a life insurance policy. The adviser also created a budget and a long-term investment plan. To help make ends meet, Ms. Speyer received help from her parents, dipped into savings and “went into overdrive” at work, she said. Using personal-finance software that her brother installed, Ms. Speyer monitored her spending and reduced her discretionary expenses, such as new clothes, travel and entertainment. Sixteen years later, Ms. Speyer said she hoped to keep her finances on a firm footing by postponing retirement indefinitely. “It took a long time to get back the feeling of security,” she said. “I feel very proud about what I have accomplished.”",The New York Times
2019,Yuma Declares Emergency in Bid for Help Handling Surge in Migrants,"[Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.] LOS ANGELES — The mayor of Yuma, Ariz., a town on the front lines of the latest surge in migration on the southwestern border, signed a proclamation of emergency on Tuesday as his community struggled to cope with an unprecedented number of migrant families released there by the Border Patrol. In a news conference posted on the town’s Facebook page, Mayor Douglas Nicholls said he was seeking help from state and federal authorities as a result of the “imminent threat” posed by “too many migrant releases into our community.” “It is something that we need to do to make sure that our community is maintained and that the human rights of all the migrants are maintained and that we have a path forward that respects both,” said Mr. Nicholls, who leads an agricultural city of about 100,000 people. “We are looking for a FEMA-type response. This is not a natural disaster, but it is a disaster either way. Their resources could come in and take care of the situation,” said the mayor, referring to the need for help from government resources such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency. A growing number of migrants are entering through remote areas of Arizona and New Mexico. Customs and Border Protection officials said more than 1,000 migrants had been apprehended in the Yuma sector over the past three days. On Saturday, a group of 50 Central Americans surrendered to agents in the area. Mr. Nicholls said local nonprofits had been doing their best to provide migrants with shelter, food and assistance to arrange travel to their final destinations in the interior of the country. However, “the transportation network is insufficient to keep up with demand. The backlog of people has created this capacity issue,” he said. Since opening three weeks ago, the only migrant shelter in Yuma has grown quickly, from housing 60 people at first to 200, its official maximum capacity. On Tuesday, it was sheltering 214 migrants, all of them men and women with children, and more were on their way. “With the amount of people arriving, this is very quickly escalating to the point we won’t be able to handle it,” said Capt. Jeffrey Breazeale, the Yuma County coordinator for the Salvation Army, which is running the shelter with the help of staff and volunteers from Catholic Community Services. “It’s a southern border crisis, and we are seeking help from the federal government,” Mr. Breazeale said. “The only way we know how to do that is declare an emergency.” A high-ranking border patrol official in Yuma said recently that officers there had been overwhelmed by an entirely new population of border crossers that the agency was not prepared to handle: families. From the beginning of the fiscal year on Sept. 1 through March 31, Yuma experienced a 273 percent increase in the number of migrants apprehended in the area by the Border Patrol, to 24,194 from 6,487 who arrived during the same period the previous fiscal year. The number of unaccompanied children taken in by authorities, totaling 3,679, was 51 percent higher. The Border Patrol has invested thousands of dollars on supplies — including feminine care products, diapers and baby formula — to help accommodate the influx of families. The Yuma office had been approved for overtime funding and additional agents, but none of it has been enough to handle the rising number of asylum seekers, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the situation. California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas have all been scrambling to handle the surge in migrant arrivals, most of whom are coming through Mexico from Central America. The number of families has eclipsed the number that arrived during the last spike, which occurred during the Obama administration. Despite the crush of the arrivals, authorities have not dropped migrants in the streets of Yuma. Mr. Nicholls said the city had not spent any of its own funds on the migrants, and had relied instead on donations from the community, for everything from coloring books to diapers. He said he had spoken with the staff of Gov. Doug Ducey, who will receive the declaration, and had held discussions with the Department of Homeland Security. He said he hoped that the emergency declaration would trigger further assistance. “This has moved faster than I believe anyone had predicted. The solution rests at the federal level,” said the mayor, adding that he planned to enlist other municipalities to take a similar stance.",The New York Times
2019,"Zack Wheeler, With His Bat and Arm, Carries the Mets Over the Phillies","Zack Wheeler hit his first major league home run and struck out 11 in seven sharp innings as the Mets handed the Philadelphia Phillies their fifth loss in six games, 9-0, on Tuesday night. The only spirit the Phillies showed came in the ninth when two fastballs by Mets reliever Jacob Rhame sailed over Rhys Hoskins’s head. The benches started to clear after the first time, and Hoskins angrily slung his bat after the next one, which was ball four. Wheeler also doubled and drove in three runs and Todd Frazier connected for a grand slam that made the score 8-0 in the fifth. Bryce Harper was hitless in three at-bats, striking out twice. The Phillies star had an uneventful night a day after his wild rant at an umpire that has Major League Baseball looking at whether he should be penalized. Wheeler put on a power display with his bat and arm, becoming the majors’ first 100-100 player this season — he hit and pitched a ball at least 100 miles per hour, according to Statcast. In his 100th career start, Wheeler struck out seven straight in the early innings and gave himself a cushion at the plate. A career .129 hitter, Wheeler lined a two-run double in the second off Zach Eflin. The next time up, Wheeler did even better, launching a drive over the wall in left-center. Wheeler kept up a longball show by Mets pitchers. Noah Syndergaard and Jacob deGrom also have gone deep this year, making the Mets the first National League team in more than 110 years to have three pitchers homer in the first 25 games of a season.",The New York Times
2019,Zagat Guide Will Reappear in Print,"The Infatuation will revive the popular survey of New York City restaurants this fall. Last published in fall 2016, the Zagat New York City restaurants guide is about to be revived in print. The 2020 survey will be issued this fall by Zagat.com, which is now owned by the Infatuation, a restaurant rating and guides platform. For the last two years, the guides have had only an online presence. For the Infatuation, restoring the restaurant-goer’s slender bible was a priority. “From the moment we took control of the brand, we were interested in bringing Zagat back to print,” said Chris Stang, a founder and the chief executive of the Infatuation. “It didn’t take long to understand how much the community wanted the guide back as well.” It was exactly 40 years ago that the notion of having friends rate a bunch of restaurants started Tim and Nina Zagat, both lawyers, on their effort. Their guides — for New York and other cities and regions around the world — became the standard-bearer in the days before Yelp, the popular alternative to professional critics. Google acquired Zagat in 2011 from the founders for $151 million, and subsequently stopped publishing the books. The Infatuation bought Zagat from Google last year for an undisclosed amount. The company has no plans at the moment to bring back any of the printed guides besides the New York survey. “Zagat published an excellent little phone book,” said Pete Wells, the chief restaurant critic for The New York Times. “I can find the phone numbers and addresses of most restaurants faster by scanning an alphabetical list than by swatting my thumbs at my phone screen.” But publishing a new Zagat survey requires help from the public, so the Infatuation is also reviving online voting. Voting for restaurants in the new guide will be open through May 5. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

2019,Zone 1 or Group E? Making Sense of the New Boarding Rules,"Airlines have been toying with boarding plans and line-jumping shortcuts since they began charging for checked bags 10 years ago. Here, the latest changes and how to make them work for you. For airlines, time on the ground is money. Financially speaking, planes only earn revenue for their companies when they are in the air, ferrying paying passengers. Which is one strong incentive to speed up boarding, deplaning and turnaround time. That is why airlines continue to tinker with boarding procedures. United Airlines remodeled its boarding processes last fall to discourage passengers from lining up and clogging the boarding area. In January, Delta Air Lines expanded from having six numbered groups determine the order of boarding to eight color groups. Southwest Airlines is testing front- and rear-door boarding and deplaning at airports where the weather allows. Boarding hierarchy didn’t matter much until about 10 years ago, when airlines began charging for checked bags. As the propensity to carry on luggage grew, so did the overhead bin wars. Early boarding, now aligned with frequent flier status and more expensive tickets, largely means avoiding them. “Southwest maintains one reason it doesn’t assign seats is that it leads to faster boarding,” says Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst and the founder of Atmosphere Research Group. “The problem is, at other airlines, you now have customers with frequent flier status who expect early boarding and have been educated for more than a decade that they’re special.” That doesn’t stop airlines from toying with boarding plans and dangling line-jumping shortcuts, as the following chart on domestic boarding procedures suggests. Boarding by: Groups A through E. A and B have frequent flier status or premium class seats, C is in the back half of the main cabin, D is in the front and E is for “Saver” seats, which are the cheapest, largely nonrefundable and do not allow advance seat assignments. What’s new: Alphabetical group boarding was adopted in 2018; Group E was added in early 2019 with the low-price fares. Preboarding: Families with children under the age of 2, active duty military, first class. How to line-jump: n/a, other than preboarding groups. Carry-on policy: One personal item and one carry-on, measuring 22-by-14-by-9 inches maximum, are free. When overhead bin space runs out, bags checked at the gate are free. Boarding Groups: Groups 1 through 9. Group 1 is first and/or business class and active-duty military; 2 through 4 reflect frequent flier status; 5 is for tickets purchased with extra legroom; 9 is for the lowest price “Basic Economy” where seats cannot be selected more than 48 hours in advance. What’s new: Boarding was last updated in March 2017. Preboarding: Members of the airline’s invitation-only ConciergeKey program. Families with children under the age of 2 may ask to preboard. How to line-jump: Holders of most of the airline’s AAdvantage credit cards board with groups 4 and 5 (annual fee $99). Travelers may also buy priority boarding for $9 to $74 each way. Carry-on policy: One personal item and one carry-on up to 22-by-14-by-9 inches free. When overhead bin space runs out, bags checked at the gate are free. Boarding Groups: Groups one through eight are classified by color on a spectrum running from purple, for the highest-status frequent flier members, to navy blue for Basic Economy, the lowest fare, which offers seat assignments only after check-in. What’s new: The color system was adopted in January, expanding to eight boarding groups from six. Preboarding: Customers needing extra time and active military members. How to line-jump: Delta SkyMiles American Express credit card holders get priority boarding in the first Main Cabin group, or fifth group (annual fee $95). Carry-on policy: One personal item and one carry-on up to 22-by-14-by-9 inches free. When overhead bin space runs out, bags checked at the gate are free. Boarding Groups: Zones 1 through 4. Zone 1 fliers have paid for a carry-on bag. Zones 2 through 4 go from the rear of the plane to the front. What’s new: n/a Preboarding: Anyone needing a wheelchair or other boarding assistance; unaccompanied minors. How to line-jump: Flyers purchasing amenity bundles known as the Works or the Perks get priority boarding and free checked and carry-on bags. A passenger purchasing a carry-on bag gets Zone 1 boarding. Families with children under the age of 3 board after Zone 1 but before Zone 2. Holders of the Frontier Airlines World Mastercard get Zone 2 boarding (annual fee $79). Carry-on policy: One personal item is free. Carry-on bags must be no larger than 24-by-16-by-10 inches and cost $35 at booking and run up to $60 at the gate. Boarding Groups: Groups A through E. A is for travelers purchasing an “Even More Space” seat; B through E groups stagger passengers seated throughout the plane to minimize congestion. What’s new: In November, JetBlue introduced biometric self-boarding gates using facial recognition technology on international flights at New York’s Kennedy and Washington, D.C.’s Reagan airport. Preboarding: Customers with disabilities; Mint (premium class); and Mosaic (high frequent flier status) fliers. How to line-jump: To join Group A, purchase an “Even More Space” seat, which has extra legroom and varied prices but recently cost about $100 one way on a $300 round trip between New York and San Francisco. Passengers traveling with children in car seats and strollers and active military personnel board between Groups A and B. Carry-on policy: One personal item and one carry-on up to 22-by-14-by-9 inches free. Boarding Groups: Open seating for Groups A through C, each with a boarding position numbered 1 through 60. Passengers line up by number (assigned, with some premium exceptions, by order of check-in) in their alphabetical group. What’s new: At four airports in California — Burbank, Long Beach, Sacramento and San Jose — Southwest is experimenting with speeding up boarding and deplaning by simultaneously using front jet-bridge entries and rear doors that require the use of stairs. Preboarding: Customers who have a specific seating need to accommodate their disability, or need assistance in boarding or stowing an assistive device. How to line-jump: Business Select fares, which vary but can be double the lowest, nonrefundable fares, guarantee a boarding position between A1 and A15. Others can pay an extra $30 to $50 one way for a position from A1 to A15. Paying $15 to $25 one way for upgraded boarding 36 hours before the flight doesn’t guarantee A-list status, but will improve your boarding position. Children ages six or younger and a guardian may board before Group B. Carry-on policy: One personal item and one carry-on up to 22-by-16-by-10 inches free. Boarding Groups: Zones 1 to 4. Zone 1 passengers have purchased carry-on bags; Zone 3 fliers are toward the back of the plane; Zone 4 fliers are toward the front of the plane. What’s new: n/a Preboarding: Passengers with disabilities and those traveling with children under the age of 2. How to line-jump: Active military members board with Zone 2. Fliers can also purchase Shortcut Boarding for about $10 one way to get into Zone 2. Holders of the Spirit Airlines World Mastercard get Zone 2 boarding (annual fee $59). Carry-on policy: Passengers are allowed only one personal item. Fees for full-size carry-on bags depend on the route, but recently ran $27 at the time of booking, and $65 at the gate for a flight from Chicago to Las Vegas. Boarding Groups: Groups 1 through 5, that queue up through two boarding lanes. Group 1 through blue and all others through green. What’s new: The airline changed its boarding in September 2018 to two boarding lanes from five to ease congestion at the gates and shifted group definitions to make them more balanced. Preboarding: MileagePlus Premiere 1K customers, the highest frequent flier status; families traveling with children ages 2 and under; customers with disabilities; and active military members. How to line-jump: United Explorer MileagePlus credit card holders board in Group 2 (annual fee $95). Carry-on policy: One personal item and one carry-on up to 22-by-14-by-9 inches free for most fliers. When overhead bin space runs out, bags checked at the gate are free. Basic Economy fares are allowed a personal item but must pay to check a full-size carry-on.",The New York Times
2019,Zoom Video’s Stock Soared in Public Debut. So Did Zoom Technologies’.,"Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________ Shares of Zoom Video Communications soared more than 72 percent in the company’s trading debut last week, capping a roughly 1,700 percent rise in its value over the past two-plus years. Yet it wasn’t even the best performing stock named Zoom in the past month. Since late March, shares in Zoom Technologies, a so-called penny stock whose ticker symbol is “ZOOM,” have jumped nearly 27,000 percent. On March 21, a share of Zoom Technologies traded at less than a penny, although none traded hands that day, according to FactSet. The next day, Zoom Video filed paperwork for an initial public offering, and Zoom Technologies shares rose to 6 cents. The stock hit a high last Monday of $5.76 and finished Thursday at $2.70 with nearly one million shares trading hands. Zoom Technologies is hardly the first penny stock, typically defined as stocks that trade for less than $5 but often below a buck, to pop on news from a similarly named company. Here’s a quick look at a few notable instances. Tweeter, Twitter: In late 2014, shares of Tweeter Home Entertainment got caught up in the excitement surrounding Twitter’s initial public offering. The ticker symbol for the bankrupt electronics retailer was “TWTRQ,” just a letter off Twitter’s “TWTR.” On the day Twitter revealed its ticker, shares of Tweeter jumped as much as 1,800 percent. Snap: Snap Interactive had been making dating applications for social networks for years when Snapchat decided in late 2016 to rebrand itself as Snap ahead of its I.P.O. Snap Interactive sued for trademark infringement, seeking to block the name change. But in the weeks ahead of Snap’s I.P.O. in March 2017, shares of Snap Interactive soared as much as 120 percent and then gained 18 percent on the day Snap’s stock began trading. Snap Interactive changed its name to PeerStream last year. Nest: In early 2014, Google bought Nest Labs, the manufacturer of smart thermostats and smoke alarms, for $3.2 billion. Nestor had once sold automated traffic enforcement equipment to state and local governments. But the company had gone into receivership in 2009. All its assets had been sold, and by 2014, its stock, worth less than a penny, had been dormant for years. But its ticker symbol was “NEST.” And its stock jumped to a high of 10 cents a share before closing at 4 cents on news of the Net Labs deal.",The New York Times
2019,Zsela  Sings Moody Ballads for the Fashion and Art Set,"The 24-year-old singer and songwriter recently released her first single, “Noise.” Zsela Thompson Age: 24 Hometown: Brooklyn Now Lives: Cat-sitting at a friend’s one-bedroom apartment in Chinatown, after a three-month stint in Los Angeles. Claim to Fame: Zsela Thompson is a rising singer and songwriter of melodic, folksy ballads popular with the bicoastal art and fashion scene. She is still a relative unknown, but her songbird voice and breezy downtown style have won her high praise. Vogue described her voice as “transfixing,” likening her to Joni Mitchell and Joan Armatrading, and featured her as a “bold talent remaking fashion,” in a feature photographed by Ryan McGinley. Big Break: Ms. Thompson grew up singing, surrounded by an artistic family. (Her father is Marc Anthony Thompson, a funk and rock musician known as Chocolate Genius. Her mother, Kate Sterlin, is a fine art photographer, and her half sister is Tessa Thompson, an actress.) She got serious about her art after a friend sent her demos to Joanna Cohen, a music manager in New York who specializes in emerging talent. “I was in a dark place and had all these demos and didn’t know what to do with them,” Ms. Thompson said. One of the first people Ms. Cohen introduced her to was Daniel Aged, a musician and producer, who soon became a close friend and collaborator. Latest Project: In February, Ms. Thompson released her first single, “Noise,” a moody ballad that is part experimental pop and part bluesy R&B. She recently performed at the Frieze Los Angeles art fair and, earlier in April, at Joe’s Pub in New York. “It feels big for me, because it’s sentimental,” she said. “I used to go there as a kid. My dad used to play there all the time.” Next Thing: On May 13, she will headline a gala for Wide Rainbow, a nonprofit in Brooklyn that brings contemporary art to after-school programs. She is also working on her debut EP of five songs with Mr. Aged. “Daniel’s into making space for my voice,” she said. “It leaves a lot of room for my melodies and the lyrics to come through.” Avant-Garde Spaces: To echo the moodiness of her songs, Ms. Thompson likes to perform in offbeat places. In Los Angeles, she played at the Black Rabbit Rose, a speakeasy-style bar that offers dinner theater and burlesque shows. And in New York, she played at the Park Church Co-Op, a progressive church in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn.",The New York Times
2019,‘996’ Is China’s Version of Hustle Culture. Tech Workers Are Sick of It.,"Chinese programmers once embraced working 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week. But online, discontent is brewing. China’s richest internet moguls think their employees should work more. Jack Ma, a founder of the e-commerce titan Alibaba, called long work hours “a huge blessing.” Richard Liu, who runs the Alibaba rival JD.com, said people who frittered away their days “are no brothers of mine.” Rank-and-file tech workers in China, discouraged by a weakened job market and downbeat about their odds of joining the digital aristocracy, have other ideas. They are organizing online against what in China is called the “996” culture: 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week. For years, Chinese tech employees have worked hours that make Silicon Valley’s workaholics seem pampered. Now they are naming and shaming employers that demand late nights. Some programmers are even withholding their creations from companies that they think overemphasize 996. “Ten years ago, people rarely complained about 996,” said Li Shun, a former employee at the search giant Baidu who left to found an online medical start-up. “This industry was booming once, but it’s more of a normal industry now. There are no more giant financial returns. Expecting people to work a 996 schedule on their own like before isn’t realistic.” Unusually for China — where independent labor unions are banned and the government comes down hard on populist movements it doesn’t control — the movement is gaining traction. Mr. Ma softened his remarks. An industrywide conversation has begun. An open letter, sent on Monday to China’s Ministry of Human Resources and signed by 74 lawyers from around the country, urges the government to properly enforce labor laws. Even Chinese state media has called on employers to ease back. “Under the pressures of a slowing economy, many companies are faced with questions about their survival, and their anxiety is understandable,” a commentary in the People’s Daily, the Communist Party mouthpiece, said. “But the solution is not to make employees work as much overtime as possible.” Angst about 72-hour workweeks speaks to a deeper gloom in China’s digital industries. Not so long ago, 996 symbolized possibility for Chinese tech entrepreneurs. Their country had the vast market. And increasingly, it had the engineering talent. The secret ingredient, the one that supposedly set China’s companies apart from Silicon Valley’s, was the hustle. While China requires overtime pay, the laws are haphazardly enforced, and the tech industry usually insists workers are committing their time voluntarily. But hustle is harder to demand of workers in a bear market. Internet darlings have laid off employees. A torrent of venture investment in tech has slowed to a trickle. As China’s internet industry matures, giant companies like Alibaba and Tencent are looking more like monopolists whose world-swallowing dominance leaves little room for upstarts. In China, “there’s not a lot of hope for runners-up anymore,” said Max Zhou, a co-founder of a Beijing mobile software start-up called MetaApp. As a result, he said, smaller companies can no longer use a sense of grander purpose to motivate workers to sacrifice their personal lives. “Most companies don’t have a dream anymore,” Mr. Zhou said. “They can only try to fabricate something for their employees.” The 996 debate started last month with a simple post on GitHub, an online community where programmers around the world share code and software tools. An anonymous user posted under the screen name “996icu,” a reference to the place where such hours take engineers: the intensive care unit. The 996.ICU GitHub repository — basically a folder for a project’s files — has since been “starred” more than 230,000 times, indicating people’s level of interest. Hundreds of fed-up tech workers have contributed to the GitHub project. Others have assembled on messaging and social media apps, with little centralized coordination. The Chinese government is eternally fearful of spaces where mass discontent can simmer. It has long barred access to Facebook, Twitter and other global platforms. Years ago, China briefly blocked GitHub, too, but engineers protested and the site was unblocked. GitHub, which is owned by Microsoft, has a policy of posting any takedown requests it receives from governments. Nagi Zhuge, an engineer at a start-up in the southern province of Hunan, has lived the 996 life for the last two years. “My colleagues are too afraid to go home after work,” Mr. Zhuge said. “As a junior employee, I can’t be the first to leave.” He is now an active contributor to the GitHub project. Across the different groups, the basic strategy is to push, but not so hard that the Chinese government feels compelled to react. That means no strikes and no demonstrations. In one group on the messaging app Telegram, references to Marx and Lenin are forbidden. The philosophies of communism’s leading lights often run contrary to the way China is run today. The government cracked down against a labor rights movement in the tech hub of Shenzhen this year. Instead of sit-ins, the tech workers are harnessing the power of memes, stickers and T-shirts. Some have pushed for a holiday to celebrate beleaguered software engineers. Mr. Zhuge is rallying workers to mail paper copies of China’s labor law to Mr. Ma of Alibaba. “We’re expressing ourselves very gently, as programmers tend to do,” said Suji Yan, the founder of a start-up in Shanghai called Dimension. Even so, many people, in China and elsewhere, remain concerned that the movement will be silenced. A few weeks ago, some Chinese web browsers appeared to have restricted access to the GitHub repository. In response, Microsoft employees started a petition asking the company to decline any requests from the Chinese authorities to censor or remove the 996.ICU repository. “Most important for the 996.ICU movement is that GitHub is accessible in China,” the employees wrote in their petition. “We encourage Microsoft and GitHub to keep the 996.ICU GitHub repository uncensored and available to everyone.” The petition, which is also hosted on GitHub, has collected more than 150 public signatures and has been starred more than 4,000 times. Concerns about censorship also arose when Twitter users in the United States were blocked from posting links to the 996.ICU repository. The link was incorrectly flagged by Twitter’s spam prevention system, a Twitter spokeswoman said, but users are now able to post it. On GitHub, Chinese tech workers have drawn up a blacklist of the tech companies where the hours are longest. Among the offenders: Alibaba, JD.com, the smartphone maker Huawei and Bytedance, the social media giant behind the short-video platform TikTok. The list of humane “955” exemplars includes Amazon, Google and Microsoft, as well as the Chinese social website Douban. Written along the bottom of the 996.ICU group’s bright red home page: “Developers’ lives matter.” Alibaba said it had no comment on 996 beyond Mr. Ma’s social media posts, and JD.com had no comment beyond Mr. Liu’s post. Huawei, whose executives speak proudly of their hard-charging “wolf culture,” declined to comment. Bytedance did not respond to a request for comment. The GitHub repository includes information about job opportunities overseas. There is also a list of things people can do to support the movement. The last item on the list: “Go home at 6 p.m. without feeling sorry.” Kate Conger contributed reporting.",The New York Times
2019,‘A Very Curious Girl’: You Mess With Her. You Pay.,"Rewind “A Very Curious Girl” is a very farcical account of sexual revenge. A one-time staple of women’s film festivals that never quite became a classic, this first feature by the Argentine-French director Nelly Kaplan, originally released in the United States in 1970, is back in an excellent 2K digital restoration at the Quad Cinema. The movie, released in France as “La Fiancée du Pirate” (“The Pirate’s Fiancée”) is set in the fictional village of Tellier (an allusion to the Guy de Maupassant tale of prostitutes on holiday, adapted in Max Ophul’s “Le Plaisir”). Marie (Bernadette Lafont) is a grim-looking servant who, among other indignities, is sexual prey for the men in the village as well as for her female boss (Claire Maurier). After her mother — reviled as a Gypsy — is killed by a hit-and-run driver, Marie decides to charge the Tellier locals for the sexual favors hitherto taken from her. Self-liberated, her look changes. Having applied a cosmetic made from crushed berries and staged a pagan wake for her mother, Marie becomes magically irresistible. In a recent interview with the film journalist Joan Dupont, Kaplan described her protagonist as “a witch who doesn’t let herself be burned.” Indeed, Marie is a Circe who needn’t change her admirers into pigs: They already are. Marie confidently baffles and humiliates the townspeople at every turn, fleecing some, rejecting others and blackmailing them all. Her seductions and transactions are accompanied by a jaunty song “Moi, je me balance” (“Me, I’m Swinging”) written and sung by the celebrated cabaret performer Barbara (Monique Serf). “The bitch has cast a spell on them,” one clod complains of the smitten townsfolk. It’s a line that Kaplan might have heard in life. Born in Buenos Aires in 1931, she moved to Paris at age 22 where she was welcomed into André Breton’s circle of aging surrealists, took up with the venerable filmmaker Abel Gance, and directed a well-received documentary portrait of Pablo Picasso. “A Very Curious Girl” was her declaration of independence. Lafont, a new wave stalwart who made her screen debut in a short by Francois Truffaut, imbues her character with the implacability of a Brecht protagonist. In his generally favorable review, Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that she “plays Marie with a kind of sexless, intellectual wrath, which makes all the fuss about her legendary sensuality even funnier than it might be if she was a steamy teenager.” (According to Kaplan, Lafont “really didn’t get it, but she was great anyway.”) “A Very Curious Girl” is relentlessly anticlerical as well as anti-bourgeois. Yet as provocatively cartoonish as it is, the film feels closer to the Off Off Broadway spectacles staged by the Playhouse of the Ridiculous in the late 1960s. While very much of its time, “A Very Curious Girl” remains amazingly fresh after 50 years. Marie’s triumph is not just a victory for her sex and class but, given the explicitly xenophobic nature of the smug patriarchal order that she upends, a win for outsiders and outcasts of all varieties.",The New York Times
2019,"‘After We Hung Up, I Received a Simple Text: Just His First Name.’","METROPOLITAN DIARY Making plans to return a lost wallet, overheard in a Brooklyn bookstore and other reader tales of New York City in this week’s Metropolitan Diary. Dear Diary: I lost my wallet in Midtown early one morning. At around 1 p.m. that day, I got a call from a man who said he had found it. Although he didn’t speak English very well, he managed to tell me that he worked from 3 a.m. to noon delivering propane to coffee carts from Midtown to the financial district and that he hadn’t been able to call me until he got home to Queens. He apologized for opening my wallet to find my business card. He told me he would leave the wallet at a coffee cart on 50th Street and Sixth Avenue, where I would be able pick it up the next day any time after 3 a.m. I asked him to put it in a bag, so that it wasn’t obvious it was a wallet. Despite everything I said, he wouldn’t let me send him anything to thank him. I asked his name several times and he told me several times, but I couldn’t understand him. When I asked him to spell it, that didn’t work either. After we hung up, I received a simple text: just his first name. At 5:45 a.m. the next day I got a text with a photo of the cart where he had left the wallet (there were two carts on the block and he didn’t want me to be confused). When I got there, my wallet was in a plastic bag and inside the bag was a silver gift bag and a card with my name and his. Before I could call him, he called me to ask if I had picked up my wallet. Again, he refused to agree to let me do anything for him. He said he was happy I had gotten my wallet back. That was more than enough for him. — Alice Martell Dear Diary: I was browsing at a bookstore in Brooklyn when I overheard a comment by another customer. “This is supposed to be very interesting,” she said, picking up a book and showing it to a companion. There was a short pause. “But I don’t think I want to read anything interesting right now,” she said. — Vernon Vig Dear Diary: When my friend Sandy’s cousin died five years ago, Sandy kept some of her things. One day, I noticed that Sandy was wearing a pair of black leather gloves with pink stripes. I told her I liked them. She said they had belonged to her cousin, and then she gave them to me. I wore them for a few winters and then donated them to a local thrift shop. Recently, I met Sandy to go to a movie. She had on the same black gloves with pink stripes. I asked her where she had gotten them. “The Vintage Thrift shop,” she said. She had forgotten they once belonged to her. — Doris Weil Dear Diary: Born and raised in Queens, I brought my young family from California to New York to visit. When it was time to return, we got a cab to take us to the airport. It was warm out, so my 4-year-old was standing up in front of me, leaning on the cab door and looking out the open window. At one point, the cab picked up speed as it turned left off a southbound avenue onto a crosstown street. The cabby said another cab seemed to be following us. He said the driver of the other cab was waving in our direction and had an angry look on his face. Our cab continued on, swerving in and out of lanes in an effort to stay ahead of the other cab. We were perplexed and somewhat nervous. Had we annoyed the driver of the other cab in some way? After several blocks, we thought we were clear of the other cab, when suddenly it was right alongside us. The driver reached out his open window, grabbed the passenger door of our cab and slammed it shut. “I saw the door wasn’t shut and your son was leaning on it,” he said. “I didn’t want him falling out.” And then he was gone. — Kurt Pritz Dear Diary: Every Saturday afternoon, rain or shine, my friend Patty and I would go to the Sanders Theater in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn. It didn’t matter what was playing, “The Thing” or Abbott and Costello, we went anyway. We would see two features, a newsreel, cartoons and a serial in which a young lady was tied to the tracks with a train heading toward her. Come back next week and see what happens! Candy always accompanied us. I loved Chuckles, Turkish Taffy and Mason Mints. My dentist is grateful that I took these excursions. One afternoon, someone — a boy, I bet — threw bubble gum down from the balcony. It landed in my hair. My mother had to chop it out, leaving two inches of hair standing straight up. After the movie, we would stumble out into the sunshine, our eyes blinking to adjust to the bright light. — Barbara Kaiser Read all recent entries and our submissions guidelines.

You can sign up here to receive it each weekday. Today is Earth Day. To mark it, this morning’s newsletter will be shorter than usual, consisting simply of the most powerful paragraph I’ve read recently, which is also the final paragraph of Nathaniel Rich’s new book, “Losing Earth”: “Everything is changing about the natural world and everything must change about the way we conduct our lives. It is easy to complain that the problem is too vast, and each of us is too small. But there is one thing that each of us can do ourselves, in our homes, at our own pace — something easier than taking out the recycling or turning down the thermostat, and something more valuable. We can call the threats to our future what they are. We can call the villains villains, the heroes heroes, the victims victims and ourselves complicit. We can realize that all this talk about the fate of Earth has nothing to do with the planet’s tolerance for higher temperatures and everything to do with our species’ tolerance for self-delusion. And we can understand that when we speak about things like fuel-efficiency standards or gasoline taxes or methane flaring, we are speaking about nothing less than all we love and all we are.” If you are not a subscriber to this newsletter, you can subscribe here.

2019,‘Almost Famous’ Musical to Open in San Diego,"“Almost Famous,” Cameron Crowe’s semi-autobiographical film about an aspiring music journalist starring Billy Crudup and Kate Hudson, hit theaters nearly 20 years ago. Now, a musical based on Crowe’s Academy Award-winning screenplay is set to debut in the city where the story is based. This September, “Almost Famous” will open the 2019-20 season at the Old Globe in San Diego, directed by Jeremy Herrin (“Noises Off”) and featuring a book by Crowe. When Crowe was a teenager, he met Lester Bangs, a rock critic who is played by Philip Seymour Hoffman in the film. “As this experience started to be where we could actually open the play at the Old Globe, right across from where I used to live and within a one-mile radius from where I first met Lester and first fell in love with music,” Crowe said Friday, “It just felt like, O.K., this becomes a personal story that kind of goes back home to where it all began.” The show will begin previews on Sept. 13, with an official opening date of Sept. 27, and will follow a 15-year-old writer named William Miller, who embeds with an up-and-coming rock band in 1973 for Rolling Stone. Though much of the plot will likely follow that of the film, the musical will feature new songs by Tom Kitt, who won a Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 2010 for his score for the rock musical “Next to Normal.” The show will also incorporate classic songs. The film’s soundtrack included music by David Bowie, Led Zeppelin and Elton John. Although he wants to keep most of the music a surprise, Crowe, who said he had been asked by John whether his song “Tiny Dancer” would be used, said, “The answer, of course, is yes.” The show is being produced by the Old Globe, presented by special arrangement with Lia Vollack on behalf of Columbia Live Stage, Joey Parnes, Sue Wagner and John Johnson. The cast has not yet been announced.

[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] For years, Anna Sorokin dreamed of being someone else. A Russian immigrant with aspirations of becoming a member of Manhattan’s upper society, Ms. Sorokin hopped around Germany and Paris before finally coming to New York in 2014. But she arrived with a new identity: that of a wealthy German heiress with a trust fund worth 60 million euros. She came up with a new name, Anna Delvey, and lived under that identity as she bilked banks, hotels, restaurants and a private jet operator out of more than $200,000 — and aimed to get millions more, according to prosecutors. Following a monthlong trial, a jury in Manhattan on Thursday found Ms. Sorokin guilty of second-degree grand larceny, theft of services and one count of first-degree attempted grand larceny. She was found not guilty on other charges after being accused of providing falsified documents in an attempt to secure a $22 million bank loan, and of stealing some $60,000 for a lavish trip to Marrakesh, Morocco. Ms. Sorokin faces up to 15 years in prison on the second-degree grand larceny charge, and her sentencing is scheduled for May 9. Here are seven highlights from her trial: Todd Spodek, Ms. Sorokin’s attorney, started his opening statement by talking about Frank Sinatra’s recording of “New York, New York,” which includes the famous refrain “If I can make it there, I’ll make it anywhere.” Then, about a minute into his speech, Mr. Spodek introduced his client. He mentioned her “moxie” and commended her hustle. “Through her sheer ingenuity, she created the life that she wanted for herself,” he said. “Anna was not content with being a spectator, but wanted to be a participant. Anna didn’t wait for opportunities, Anna created opportunities. Now we can all relate to that. There’s a little bit of Anna in all of us.” Ms. Sorokin had a modest upbringing. Her father ran a heating and cooling business, and she did not attend fancy schools or have connections with Manhattan’s elite. But her doppelgänger, Anna Delvey, did. “They wanted to believe that she was a German heiress,” Mr. Spodek said of people his client duped. “And that’s what they got.” In a way, Mr. Spodek said, Ms. Sorokin and Mr. Sinatra had a lot in common. “Sinatra made a great new start here in New York, as did Ms. Sorokin,” he said. “They both created a golden opportunity.” In court, Ms. Sorokin at times appeared to still be playing the character of Anna Delvey. She often attended the trial decked in designer clothes picked out by the stylist Anastasia Walker. After wearing revealing outfits at the start of the trial, Ms. Sorokin dressed more modestly by the second week. “I will say obviously there are challenges to styling someone who’s currently incarcerated,” Ms. Walker told BuzzFeed News. Eventually, Mr. Spodek also tried to help select the outfits. Among options he brought her included a light-blue sleeveless dress from Ann Taylor and an indigo cashmere-blend sweater from Uniqlo. Such choices did not appease the fashion sensibilities of Ms. Sorokin, who broke into tears and refused to start proceedings. After several such meltdowns, the judge informed Ms. Sorokin that if she could not make do, she could wear the clothing provided by the Department of Correction. Eventually, Ms. Sorokin paired black slacks with a state-issued white turtleneck, sleeves cinched. Toward the end of the trial, Rachel Williams, a former close friend of Ms. Sorokin and a former photo editor at Vanity Fair, testified at length about the posh lifestyle they lived: lavish dinners, sauna treatments and personal trainers, all supposedly paid for by Ms. Sorokin. The two then decided to travel to Marrakesh. Ms. Sorokin had promised to pay for everything but always conveniently found an excuse to not pay for anything. In the end, Ms. Williams got stuck with a bill totaling more than $60,000 for dinners, shopping trips and an extravagant stay at a private villa. Ms. Sorokin paid her back only $5,000. “This is the most traumatic experience I’ve ever been through,” Ms. Williams told the jury through tears. “I wish I had never met Anna. If I could go back in time, I would. I wouldn’t wish this on anybody.” One juror, who gave her name only as Debby, explained in an interview why the jury had found Ms. Sorokin not guilty of fleecing Ms. Williams of some $60,000: “Anna did a lot of nice things for her and she accepted it, right down to the spa.” During that trip to Marrakesh, Ms. Williams testified, she and Ms. Sorokin ventured out to explore the city after spending time in their private villa — where they enjoyed a steam room and private pool. Ms. Sorokin went shopping on Ms. Williams’s dime, spending $1,314 on Moroccan-style dresses “because Anna just had her New York black clothing.” She added, “We tried to find spices that would look good in an Instagram photo, which we did, in the Jewish quarter.” A freelance videographer tagged along on the trip to shoot footage of the women. Ms. Sorokin explained that she wanted to make a documentary about the creation of her foundation and wanted to get accustomed to being on camera. Some of the most influential people conned by Ms. Sorokin were never asked to take the stand. Among those on the prosecution’s witness list who did not attend the trial: André Balazs, the hotelier of the Chiltern Firehouse in London, Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles and the Mercer in New York, met with Ms. Sorokin between 2015 and 2016 to discuss the supposed Anna Delvey Foundation. Roo Rogers, a businessman with a slew of start-ups and the son of the famed architect Richard Rogers, worked for Mr. Balazs’s food and beverage company and met with Ms. Sorokin to discuss the sale of drinks at the foundation, according to her attorney. Aby Rosen, a real estate developer tycoon and a co-founder of RFR Holding who is married to the New York socialite Samantha Boardman, met with Ms. Sorokin and approved the foundation’s lease at its desired 281 Park Avenue South location, according to Ms. Sorokin’s attorney. Kacy Duke, a celebrity fitness trainer, whom Ms. Sorokin hired for personal workout sessions for herself and Ms. Williams at a cost of $300 per session, also traveled with the women to Marrakesh. A few months after the trip, Ms. Duke staged an intervention to get to the bottom of Ms. Sorokin’s ruse. Considering that Ms. Sorokin was trying to swindle banks out of tens of millions of dollars, the charges for theft of services appeared minor by comparison. Three of the 10 charges she faced included avoiding payment at a slew of Manhattan hotels. The prosecutor, Catherine McCaw, said that at the Beekman Hotel in Lower Manhattan, Ms. Sorokin “had no money, she had no intention to pay, she had no ability to pay.” She added, “She continued to feast out of the minibar: Diet Cokes for $6.” At the W Hotel near the World Trade Center, she racked up a $679 bill for incidental expenses. “That’s an awful lot of M&M’s,” Ms. McCaw said, adding, “She emptied out the minibar and then asked the W Hotel to refill it.” The final charge for theft of services, at Knave, a restaurant inside of the Parker New York hotel south of Central Park, was for an unpaid bill of about $200 for a meal that included four glasses of wine, a fruit salad and two smoked-salmon sandwiches. Already, Netflix has bought the rights to one version of Ms. Sorokin’s story, which will be produced by Shonda Rhimes, the creator of “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Scandal.” Ms. Williams has also turned the experience into a book and a possible HBO show. She has made close to $100,000 on the deals so far, with the expectation of much more, according to her testimony. She notes that she has used the money to pay people back for loans incurred after the trip to Marrakesh. “There are real people with feelings involved,” Ms. Williams said of monetizing the experience. “I just wanted to write something that people could really relate to.”",The New York Times

2019,"Opinion | ‘As Native Americans, We Are in a Constant State of Mourning’","The return of ancestors and artifacts can become a form of restorative justice. Dr. Colwell is an anthropologist and museum curator in Denver. In the early 1920s, the director of the Bristol Museum in Britain received a package containing two human skulls. The donation came from Alfred Hutchins. He had left England seeking brighter horizons and by the late 1800s was living in Southern California. There he became an amateur archaeologist, excavating Native American graves on the Channel Islands. He offered the museum this collection, apparently in honor of his son, who perished during the First World War. Last week in a ceremony, Bristol Museum officials returned the remains to representatives of the Ti’at Society, a maritime organization of the Tongva, whose forebears lived on the four southern Channel Islands and across the Los Angeles basin for thousands of years. In recent years, the Tongva and their allies, including the Fowler Museum at U.C.L.A., have been working to track down the fate of looted Tongva bodies so that they may be reburied. This effort led the tribe across the Atlantic and to its first international repatriation. “As Native Americans, we are in a constant state of mourning,” Desiree Martinez, a Tongva member and professional archaeologist, said in an article in The Bristol News, “knowing that our ancestors’ graves have been disturbed and their remains and burial goods removed to sit on museum shelves, all over the world.” The return of these two Tongva ancestors could easily pass almost unnoticed. However, the repatriation is emblematic of a much larger movement of historical reckoning sweeping across the globe. Museums are reconsidering who is the rightful owner of the objects that fill displays and storerooms. For example, the Netherlands’ national museums have established guidelines for returning objects obtained without consent. In Germany, 16 states agreed in a joint resolution to repatriate items taken during the country’s colonial era. Scotland said it will soon deliver to Canada the stolen skulls of two Beothuk Indians. England’s Natural History Museum recently sent home 37 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ancestral remains to Australia. And that’s just in the first few months of 2019. As a museum curator and scholar of the repatriation movement, I am stunned by the pace of these unfolding events, which seemed unlikely not long ago. I now understand that the repatriation battles are not isolated to a few museums wrestling with their colonial legacies. These clashes are fueling a war over the rights of former colonial subjects and the future of museums. Some art dealers and curators have recently warned that this rapidly shifting landscape may, as the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle, put it, “eventually empty museums and galleries in Western countries.” But such dire predictions portray repatriation as a zero sum game. Museums should not see repatriation only for what is lost. They should also see what is gained. In the wake of European colonial explorations from the 1500s onward, museums were filled with curious, beautiful, mundane and wondrous objects. Many of these things were purchased or traded, obtained with the permission of the individual maker or community. Yet, many were also procured with the threat of violence, without consent and in ways that violated cultural traditions. Many were simply stolen. When archaeological science took off in the late 1800s, unknown thousands of graves were excavated. When the Western art world fell in love with “primitive” art, collectors and dealers often resorted to extremes to obtain ancient treasures. Indigenous peoples often tried their best to preserve their sacred objects and to protect the graves of their ancestors. But most communities were unable to stop the plunder. On the heels of the civil rights movement, Native Americans began to more publicly renounce museums for stealing their heritage. As a result, in 1990 Congress passed the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, which provides a process for lineal descendants and tribes to reclaim ancestral remains and certain kinds of cultural items from American museums and federal agencies. This law, although imperfect, has facilitated the return of some 1.7 million grave goods, 57,000 skeletons and 15,000 sacred and communally owned objects. As that law approached passage, we heard many of the same arguments we hear now, especially that repatriation will put museums out of business. Instead, in the years since, museums in the United States have thrived. Repatriation forced museum administrators and tribal leaders to sit down and talk, and the two sides realized how much they have in common. As a result, museums and tribes have worked to build new relationships based on mutual respect. Thirty years ago, few museums in the United States produced exhibitions in collaboration with Indigenous communities; today, few would design an exhibition without it. Repatriation will not end museums. Such gains are extended even further when the return of ancestors and artifacts becomes a form of restorative justice. Like the Truth and Reconciliation Commission following the abolishment of South Africa’s apartheid system, repatriation involves, as Desmond Tutu wrote, “the healing of breaches, the redressing of imbalances, the restoration of broken relationships.” Repatriation can turn museums from places of colonialism into mediating spaces that confront and then move beyond their own pasts. If my grandfather took something from your poor and powerless grandfather — and your community continues to suffer because of it — then I am presented with the chance to make things right. By my estimate, in the United States alone, it will take more than 200 years to consult with descendants on all of the Native American human remains in museums. Addressing the centuries of colonialism will take centuries of work. The recent months have illustrated that the repatriation wars are not ending anytime soon. We should welcome the fact that they are here.

2019,"‘As a Proud New Yorker Who Loves Giving Directions, I Decided to Step In’","METROPOLITAN DIARY Confident about which way to go, his first day at Western Electric and more reader tales of New York City in this week’s Metropolitan Diary. Dear Diary: I noticed a woman in front of my local supermarket asking a man for directions. I also noticed that he looked as baffled as she did. As a proud New Yorker who loves giving directions, I decided to step in. I’ve lived in the city long enough to be confident that I am usually correct. We were at 15th Street and Seventh Avenue, and the woman was asking how to get to an address on Seventh Avenue South. I told her she only needed to go south from where we were, that if she just kept walking Seventh Avenue would turn into Seventh Avenue South and she would find the address she was looking for. She thanked me, smiled and turned to set off. I told her it was my pleasure to help and gave her my standard, consistent, confident piece of advice: Just do as I advise and do not to ask anyone else for directions. She smiled. “Of course I trust you,” she said. “You’ve never lied to me before.” — Isolde Blum Dear Diary: Sat down Saturday afternoon and watched the ballgameMy team, the Mets, won 11-8After that I headed to the local hangout where they serve tea, coffee and pastriesSaw a woman I know who does appraisalsShe said she was buying a house in MaineTwo attractive young women were reading novelsMentioned to them the Joyce Carol Oates story “Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?”They said they never read itMaybe they should — Matthew Anish Dear Diary: After my husband died in hospice in 2013, I gathered his belongings. There weren’t many. I planned to donate them, but as I looked at his shoes, an expression popped into my mind: “No one can fill his shoes.” I had no idea what I was going to do with them. A man on the custodial staff saw me and pointed at the shoes. “Are they Top-Siders?” he asked enthusiastically. “Yes,” I said. “Are they size 10?” “Yes,” I said, a sound of surprise in my own voice. “May I have them?” “Yes,” I said emphatically. — Marcia Longman Dear Diary: It was 1982 and I was living in the Upper East Side. I left my apartment for work early on a Tuesday. When I got to the subway station, I saw that there were tons of commuters fighting to get down the stairs to the platform. It was obvious that the trains were not running properly. Even though I was on a limited budget, I decided to take a taxi to my office at Park Avenue and 39th Street. I was supposed to make a presentation at an early meeting, so I knew it was the right decision. It took some time, but I finally flagged down a cab. As we approached my destination, I began to searching my pocketbook for my wallet so I could pay the driver. When I found my wallet and opened it, I saw that I had only three singles. It wasn’t enough. I asked the driver to stop near a bank so I could get the cash I needed to pay him. “Oh don’t worry about it,” he said. “You just go and have a great day. Do you need money for coffee?” — Valerie Wallace Dear Diary: My wife and I moved to Manhattan from Ithaca, N.Y., in 1964. On our first night in our new apartment at 86th Street and First Avenue, a neighbor invited us for drinks. Our host was a native New Yorker and he told us all about how cosmopolitan New Yorkers were and how well they knew the city. The next morning, I was on the subway platform at 86th Street and Lexington Avenue waiting for an express train to take me to Fulton Street and Broadway and my job at the once-great, now long-gone Western Electric Company. It was my first trip on the subway and I was a bit nervous. I approached a man on the platform and asked if the express train went to Fulton and Broadway. “I don’t know,” he said in an accent I later learned was pure New York City. “I never go past 59th Street.” — Jack Buchanan Read all recent entries and our submissions guidelines.

2019,‘Avengers: Endgame’ Review: The Real Heroes Were the Friends We Made Along the Way,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “No amount of money ever bought a second of time,” one character says to another — I’m afraid I can’t be any more specific than that — somewhere around the middle of “Avengers: Endgame.” So true, so true, and also in context so completely not true. The intersecting axes of time and money are what this franchise is all about, and while I’m not an expert in studio math, I’d guess that a second of the movie, based on what Disney and Marvel Studios paid to make it, would buy a decent used car. There are roughly 10,860 of those — seconds, not cars — nestled in between the quiet, spooky opening and the last bit of end credits. Which means that whatever a ticket costs in your neighborhood, “Avengers: Endgame” might count as a bargain. At three hours and one minute, it’s shorter than “Titanic,” “The Godfather Part II” or Luchino Visconti’s “The Leopard.” And while the time doesn’t exactly fly, it doesn’t drag either. The two hours and forty minutes of “Infinity War” (also directed by Joe and Anthony Russo) felt infinitely longer. Settling scores, wrapping up loose ends and taking a victory lap — the main objects of the game this ostensibly last time around — generate some comic sparks as well as a few honest tears. And why not? We’ve lived with these characters and the actors playing them for more than a decade, and even when the party got hectic, stupid or crowded, there was no reason to complain about the guests. For the most part, it’s nice to see them again, and a little sad to say goodbye. [Read the screenwriters’ explanations for plot points. | What to read if you want more Avengers. | How the movie did in Week 2 at the box office.] Chris Hemsworth’s Thor, always kind of neurotic for a buff deity with a mighty hammer, has let himself go, turning into a fat Lebowski with mommy issues. War Machine (Don Cheadle), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) have more to do than previously. (I wish that were also true of Tessa Thompson’s Valkyrie.) The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) has made peace with his essential duality. Robert Downey Jr., looking handsomely grizzled, exercises his seniority with a light touch. He’s been around the longest — the first “Iron Man” was in 2008 — and combines the duties of unofficial chief superhero with those of master of ceremonies. It’s not all fun and games. A lot of heroes died at the end of “Infinity War,” and their loss weighs heavily on the survivors, perhaps especially on Nebula (Karen Gillan), whose father was responsible for the slaughter. Thanos’s deployment of the six Infinity Stones to wipe out half the life in the universe was unforgivable, of course — I can’t believe I just typed that — but it proves to have been helpful to the Russos, the screenwriters (Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) and the audience. We and they have a manageable dozen or so major characters to keep track of, which leaves room for some of the alternately lump-in-throat, tongue-in-cheek ensemble work that has always been the series’s most potent weapon. “The Avengers” cycle may require an escalating series of battles to save the universe from ultimate evil — each manifestation more ultimate than the last, with Thanos (Josh Brolin) as the ultimate ultimate of them all — but the engine that keeps it running is friendship. This isn’t the same as harmony. Going back to the earlier movies, Hulk and Thor have had their moments of friction, as have Iron Man and Captain America (Chris Evans). The personal and political bad blood between those two, most acute in “Captain America: Civil War,” continues to simmer, at least at first. But the mood over all is tender and comradely, touched by acute grief and the more subtle melancholy of what everyone seems to understand is the Last Big Adventure. About that adventure, I won’t say much, though it strikes me that the shape of the plot is less vulnerable to spoilage than the little winks and local surprises along the way. [Everything you need to know before “Endgame,” in two minutes] Those are the rewards for sitting through all those movies patiently waiting for the post-credit stingers, collecting Easter eggs while your friends were texting or your dad was napping and generally doing the unpaid labor of fandom for all these years. Was it worth it? In the aggregate, I have my doubts, but the chuckles and awws you’ll hear around you in the theater at certain moments attest to the happy sense of participation that lies at the heart of the modern fan experience. At its best — and “Endgame” is in some ways as good as it gets — the “Avengers” cosmos has been an expansive and inclusive place. That has proved to be good business. Disney and Marvel’s accomplishment will be duly inscribed in the annals of commerce, to be studied for many years to come. There has been variety — silly movies and somber ones; chapters that proclaim their topicality and episodes that embrace pure escapism — as well as consistency. Any single film can serve as a point of entry, and insider status is easy enough to obtain. There has never been anything difficult or challenging, which is a limitation as well as a selling point. None of the 22 films in this cycle are likely to be remembered as great works of cinema, because none have really tried. It’s fun to see the actors in these roles we know are capable of better, and also satisfying to appreciate the efforts of those who might not be. Some first-rate directors have taken up the banner and burnished the brand. Their past and future masterpieces will most likely be found elsewhere. Still, “Endgame” is a monument to adequacy, a fitting capstone to an enterprise that figured out how to be good enough for enough people enough of the time. Not that it’s really over, of course: Disney and Marvel are still working out new wrinkles in the time-money continuum. But the Russos do provide the sense of an ending, a chance to appreciate what has been done before the timelines reset and we all get back to work. The story, which involves time travel, allows for some greatest-hits nostalgic flourishes, and the denouement is like the encore at the big concert when all the musicians come out and link arms and sing something like “Will the Circle Be Unbroken.” You didn’t think it would get to you, but it does.

2019,‘Avengers: Endgame’ Shows Movie Theaters Can Still Be on Top of the World,"LOS ANGELES — Audiences have splintered into a million personalized subsets. Streaming services are sprouting like mushrooms. Attention spans are now measured in seconds. For those reasons and others — a decade of stagnant attendance, studios that only seem to make sequels of sequels (of sequels) — movie theaters are seen as a dying business. Why trudge to a theater when Netflix is available in your pocket anytime you want? Yet almost every multiplex on the planet was gridlocked over the weekend. “Avengers: Endgame” took in $1.2 billion worldwide, arriving as the No. 1 movie in at least 54 countries. The euphorically reviewed movie collected a record-breaking $350 million in the United States and Canada, zooming past “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” (2015), which had opening-weekend sales of $248 million, or about $270 million in today’s dollars. “It shows the power of theaters — the ability, even in a hyper-fragmented culture, to deliver that wildly big communal experience,” Megan Colligan, president of Imax Filmed Entertainment, said in an interview. [Read our review of “Avengers: Endgame.” | Catch up on all the M.C.U. movies in two minutes. | Analyze the character makeovers in “Endgame.”] It also shows that Hollywood is increasingly reliant on spectacle to jolt people away from Facebook, Fortnite, Hulu and Netflix and into movie theaters. All kinds of movies used to break through at the box office. In 1998, the top 10 grossing movies of the year included an Oscar-nominated war epic (“Saving Private Ryan”), three comedies, a couple of science-fiction extravaganzas (“Armageddon”), the comedic drama “Patch Adams” and a smattering of family films (“Dr. Doolittle”). Last year, there were no comedies and only one drama: “Bohemian Rhapsody,” which doubled as a musical. Big-budget fantasies and animated movies took up eight slots. When the industry’s new strategy works, it works big. Demand for “Avengers: Endgame” was so astronomical over the weekend that AMC Theaters, the largest multiplex operator in North America, added 5,000 last-minute showtimes in the United States, lifting its total number to more than 63,000. Nineteen AMC locations played the film around the clock. On Saturday alone, 2.3 million people turned up at AMC cinemas. “Young moviegoers will remember where they were when they saw ‘Endgame,’ who they saw it with and what it felt like,” John Fithian, president of the National Association of Theater Owners, wrote in an email. “That will pay off for years to come in the same way that moviegoers who grew up in the ’70s and ’80s still talk about the impact that ‘Star Wars’ had on them.” And there could be more to come. Disney’s “The Lion King,” a retelling of the animated musical using photo-realistic visual effects, arrives in July and is generating runaway advance interest. In December, Disney will release “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,” the final chapter in a nine-part saga. Also coming this year are giants like “Toy Story 4” (Disney), “The Secret Life of Pets 2” (Universal), “Spider-Man: Far From Home” (Sony) and “It: Chapter 2” (Warner Bros.). Even so, concerns about the health of theatrical business are unlikely to abate, at least behind closed doors in Hollywood. In some ways, “Avengers: Endgame” could add to them. People like Steven Spielberg worry that the film business is headed toward a bifurcated future where megamovies play in cinemas and everything else gets squeezed onto streaming-service screens. Given the film industry’s current trajectory, there could soon come a day when you can see popcorn movies like “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” in theaters but must watch more sober fare like “Lincoln” online — to take just two of Mr. Spielberg’s films as examples. To that end, there is heated debate in Hollywood over what constitutes a movie. Should the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences try to protect the big-screen experience by blocking films — like Netflix’s award-winning “Roma” — that are primarily distributed on the internet from competing for Oscars? Last week, members of the academy board debated what to do, ultimately deciding to keep weighing the options. Media analysts have also sounded alarms. Doug Creutz, a managing director at Cowen and Company, wrote in a report last month that “the market is concentrating into fewer, but bigger, successful films.” Mr. Creutz noted that the top 10 grossing movies last year accounted for 35 percent of total annual ticket sales. At the start of the decade, the contribution from the top 10 was about 27 percent. “Avengers: Endgame,” which cost roughly $350 million to make and $150 million to market worldwide, played in 4,662 theaters in North America over the weekend. In another show of Marvel’s dominance, the No. 2 movie of the weekend was “Captain Marvel,” which took in $8 million at 2,435 theaters in its eighth week, according to Comscore, which compiles box-office data. The weekend’s third-best performer, the horror movie “The Curse of La Llorona” (Warner), collected about $7.5 million from 3,372 theaters. Hollywood has long expected “Avengers: Endgame” to be a sensation. When tickets became available for presale on April 2, the demand crashed AMC servers. In addition to its own ads, which began running late last year, Disney secured promotional partnerships worth an additional $200 million. Ziploc started selling Avengers-themed sandwich bags; McDonald’s, teaming with Marvel for the first time, introduced 24 Avengers toys. “We wanted it to feel like an epic, important, seminal, can’t-miss event,” said Asad Ayaz, president of marketing at Walt Disney Studios. Mr. Ayaz and his lieutenants devised a strategy in which Disney spent massively on television ads around a few important moments (the day tickets went on presale, for instance) and then went completely dark for a week or more. “The idea was to stun and surprise people with new creative messaging and then leave them wanting more,” Mr. Ayaz said. The movie ended up defying all kinds of conventional wisdom — that sequels are not supposed to be critical darlings, that there is no center of the culture anymore, that marathon running times (three hours in this case) drive people away, that every studio has hits and misses. Marvel is now 22-0 when it comes to the box office. Alan Horn, chairman of Walt Disney Studios, called the results “monumental” and noted that Marvel had challenged “the notions of what is possible at the movie theater.” About 44 percent of the global total came from 3-D screenings, according to the technology company RealD. Disney said on Sunday morning that the movie set a record for the largest opening weekend in 44 overseas markets, with Imax theaters contributing an outsized portion of ticket sales, particularly in China. Ticket sales for “Avengers: Endgame” were assuredly helped by improvements that multiplex chains have introduced in recent years. For instance, after the subscription-based ticketing service MoviePass proved to be popular with millennials, AMC and other theater operators created their own subscription programs. Apps like Atom Tickets and Fandango have made buying tickets in advance more popular, which helps to create buzz and reduce the need to wait in line at box-office windows. But the movie, directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, arrived as a cultural and commercial thunderclap because of the way in which Kevin Feige, Marvel’s president, built the “Avengers” series to a storytelling climax. In the last installment, “Avengers: Infinity War,” a lantern-jawed villain named Thanos (Josh Brolin) snapped his fingers and turned half the creatures in the universe to dust, including a vast number of superheroes. “Avengers: Endgame” finds battered survivors like Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) joining together in one final attempt to restore order. “It is likely to be the last film with the original — and beloved — Avengers cast,” Mr. Creutz said. If so, plenty of people made sure they were there to see it. And they appear to have been satisfied: In CinemaScore exit polls, ticket buyers gave the film an A-plus.",The New York Times
2019,‘Avengers: Endgame’: Latest Trailer Is a Trip Down Marvel’s Memory Lane,"As the final trailer for “Avengers: Endgame” opens, S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) calls heroes “an old-fashioned notion.” But it’s one that still sells, as we’re reminded in this two-and-a-half-minute clip summarizing the 21 films that have led up to this installment. Starting with Robert Downey Jr.’s “Iron Man” in 2008, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has grown to include Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Captain Marvel (Brie Larson), the Guardians of the Galaxy and more. The trailer brings back memories, some more vivid than others. Remember when the Incredible Hulk got his own movie? The footage avoids showing Edward Norton, who originated the role before Mark Ruffalo took it over. Or when Robert Redford played the villain in “Captain America: The Winter Soldier”? That was weird. Breaking chronological order, the spot culminates with “Avengers: Infinity War” (which came out before “Ant-Man and the Wasp” and “Captain Marvel”). In it, Thanos (Josh Brolin) wiped out half the world’s population and a good chunk of the Avengers. But Captain America promises to do “whatever it takes” to get payback. “Avengers: Endgame” will officially hit theaters on April 26. An earlier version of this article misstated the timing of “Black Panther’s” release. It opened before “Avengers: Infinity War,” not after.",The New York Times
2019,‘Avengers: Endgame’: The Screenwriters Answer Every Question You Might Have,"This article contains spoilers for “Avengers: Endgame.” It’s over. With “Avengers: Endgame,” the two-movie story line that started with “Avengers: Infinity War” is finished, along with the 22-film cycle that represents the Marvel Cinematic Universe to date. And some of the heroes we’ve followed on this decade-long adventure are gone, too. In the three-hour span of “Endgame,” the Avengers confront and kill Thanos (Josh Brolin), who had used the Infinity Gauntlet to snap away half of all life in the universe. When the story resumes five years later, the Avengers are still left with their grief and remorse — until the unexpected return of Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) kicks off a race back through time to retrieve the Infinity Stones before Thanos could obtain them in the first place. Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) sacrifices her life; a colossal battle ensues; Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) dies; and Captain America (Chris Evans) finds a way to live the life he’d always wanted, reappearing as an old man to entrust his shield to the Falcon (Anthony Mackie). These and many other head-spinning developments in “Endgame” emerged from the imaginations of its screenwriters, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, who also wrote “Infinity War.” (Both films were directed by Joe and Anthony Russo.) Markus and McFeely have been friends and collaborators since the 1990s and also wrote all three “Captain America” movies as well as “Thor: The Dark World” (with Christopher L. Yost) and created the Marvel TV series “Agent Carter.” In a recent interview in their offices in Los Angeles, Markus and McFeely discussed the many choices and possibilities of “Endgame,” the roads not taken and the decisions behind who lived and who died. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. [Read our review of “Avengers: Endgame.” | Check out all the superhero makeovers. | Catch up on all the M.C.U. movies in two minutes.] How did you decide where the major events of “Infinity War” and “Endgame” would fall? CHRISTOPHER MARKUS The biggest point was probably the Snap. And we realized fairly early on that if we didn’t do it at the end of the first movie, the first movie wasn’t going to have an end. And if we did it too early in the first movie, it would be a bit of an anticlimax after you’ve killed half the universe to have them stumbling around for half an hour. STEPHEN McFEELY Another big plot point is when everyone comes back. So the question is, is it early in the second movie? Late in the second movie? You notice the players left on the board are the O.G. Avengers [Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye], and let’s give them their due. It meant that we were likely going to bring people back late. So that if you were a big fan of Doctor Strange or Black Panther or Bucky [the Winter Soldier] or Sam [the Falcon], you’re only going to get a little brief window on them. It can’t be all things to all people. How did you choose which characters would survive for “Endgame”? MARKUS We knew we wanted to see Cap and Tony dealing with the aftermath so that you could really see them suffer, quite frankly. And that’s why Cap and Natasha are relatively minimal in the first movie, because all they’d be doing is punching. We knew that they had a lot of story in the second movie, and there were other people who would have much more story in the first movie, like the Guardians. McFEELY Thor is strangely the one that gets two movies’ worth of story. MARKUS For a guy people once thought of as boring, he’s become very useful. “Endgame” sort of tricks you by having the heroes kill Thanos almost immediately, only to discover it doesn’t solve anything. Why was that important? McFEELY We always had this problem. The guy has the ultimate weapon. He can see it coming. It’s ridiculous. We were just banging our heads for weeks, and at some point, [the executive producer] Trinh Tran went, “Can’t we just kill him?” And we all went, “What happens if you just kill him? Why would you kill him? Why would he let you kill him?” MARKUS It reinforced Thanos’s agenda. He was done. Not to make him too Christ-like, but it was like, “If I’ve got to die, I can die now.” There’s a lot of bleakness and despair for roughly the first hour of the movie. Did that feel like a risk for a big-event picture? MARKUS It felt less risky once I saw the reaction to “Infinity War.” You never know how you’re going to hit people, emotionally. We’ve been sitting with these events for years. We no longer have an emotional reaction. And then you see people crying in the theater. We’ve got to honor that or it’s going to feel like we’re just jerking them around. McFEELY It was the part in test screenings where people were most uncomfortable. Because you are wallowing to a degree. There doesn’t seem to be any hope. In the end of Act II for most superhero movies, maybe they lose for five minutes. Here it’s for five years. That seemed important. And that theme of loss is continued when Scott Lang visits a memorial to the dead in San Francisco. McFEELY We used to have beats in the script where there are those in every city. Millions of names.MARKUS It’s that sense of collective trauma and the fact that if you weren’t killed, you wake up the next day — the trauma happened and I’m still here. How do we deal with this? That was the Stan Lee trick. Where’s the anxiety coming from? Now that they have Power X. How did you start to determine the trajectories for the heroes in “Endgame”? McFEELY Chris and I wrote a master document while we were shooting “Civil War,” and one of the things we were interested in exploring is, remember the What If comics? Well, this is our what if. If you lost, Thor becomes fat. Natasha becomes a shut-in. Steve becomes depressed. Tony gets on with his life. Hulk is a superhero. MARKUS Clint becomes a murdering maniac. When we were spitballing for “Endgame,” we started with, Thor’s on a mission of vengeance. And then we were like, he was on a mission of vengeance in the last movie. This is all this guy ever does! And fails, all the time. Let’s drive him into a wall and see what happens. McFEELY He just got drunk and fat. At least the Hulk is in a better place. MARKUS There was a time when Banner became Smart Hulk in the first movie. It was a lot of fun, but it came at the wrong moment. It was an up, right when everyone else was down. McFEELY It happened in Wakanda. His arc was designed like, I’m not getting along with the Hulk, the Hulk won’t come out. And then they compromise and become Smart Hulk. MARKUS We were like, but he’s Smart Hulk in the next movie. So that diner scene [in “Endgame”], was like, O.K., how do we smash right into that without scenes of him in a lab, gene-splicing? McFEELY Oh, I wrote scenes in a lab. Now it’s just him eating pancakes and I think it generally works. MARKUS The whole thing rides on Rudd going, “I’m so confused.” Though Ant-Man didn’t participate in “Infinity War,” we saw how the Snap affected him in the tag for “Ant-Man and the Wasp.” How did you decide to pay this off in “Endgame”?McFEELY In late 2015 they say, you’re writing the 19th movie [“Infinity War”] and the 22nd movie. So we chose to make lemonade. And that was a big moment — we figured out we can withhold Ant-Man because he’s in his own movie. And their movie is not affected until the tag, and that just gives us a place to go [in “Endgame”]. You can do this when you’re planning ahead this much. The tone is all weird, right? Because that’s a light, fun movie and then we just kill everybody in the tag. Hawkeye took arguably the darkest turn of any hero in this series. McFEELY He’s a good example of people who had much stronger stories after the Snap. What was the story to tell with Hawkeye in the first movie that was different than anybody else’s? Leaving his family to go fight again? Yeah, he did that in “Civil War.” The hope is that he’s killing bad people.MARKUS There was a time where we contemplated having that archery scene in the first movie, after the Snap. You snap, and then you pop up in Clint’s farm — what are we watching? — and that’s the first indication it had a wider effect. But he literally had not been in the movie prior to that point. It’s cool, but it’s going to blunt the brutality of what [Thanos] did.McFEELY Joe [Russo] said we’ll put that up front in the second one. Once you’d seen how successful “Black Panther” and “Captain Marvel” were, did you try to find more opportunities for the characters from those films? McFEELY There wasn’t a lot of time to adjust. It’s not like we could say, “Hurry, put Shuri in there.” We started [filming “Infinity War” and “Endgame”], and then “Black Panther” started, we’re still going. They finish. We’re still going. MARKUS “Panther” comes out. McFEELY When we’re doing the tests [before “Black Panther” opened], and Cap goes, “I know somewhere,” and then you cut to Wakanda, the audience goes, “Oh, that’s interesting.” But when you do those tests after the movie comes out, all you have to do is [makes drumming noises] and people freak out. Same issue with “Captain Marvel.” We shot [Brie Larson] before she shot her movie. She’s saying lines for a character 20 years after her origin story, which no one’s written yet. It’s just nuts. MARKUS She’s been in space nearly half her life. She has obligations. McFEELY Certainly, Captain Marvel is in [“Endgame”] a little less than you would have thought. But that’s not the story we’re trying to tell — it’s the original Avengers dealing with loss and coming to a conclusion, and she’s the new, fresh blood. Were there any Marvel characters you wanted for these movies that you couldn’t have? MARKUS We did try to put the Living Tribunal in the first movie. We wrote a scene in which he appeared during the Titan fight. And everyone was like, what? McFEELY Whoa. He’s got three heads. It would indicate a whole different level of architecture to the universe and I think that was too much to just throw in. MARKUS The idea’s still in [Marvel Studios President] Kevin [Feige]’s court. McFEELY Oh sure, we probably just spoiled it. MARKUS The Living Tribunal has his own streaming show. McFEELY It’s like “Judge Judy.” Early in “Endgame,” the movie jumps ahead five years. Was that inspired by some TV series that have also used this device? MARKUS That was what we bought ourselves by ending the last movie the way we did. We wanted it to be real and for a long time — both in movie time and in chronological time for the characters. You couldn’t end Natasha, Tony and Steve the way we do without knowing that they’ve done their time and this is taking them to the brink. McFEELY We talked about “Fargo” from the first season, where it just jumps a year. And you go, “Whaaaaat?” We hopefully get a similar reaction. MARKUS And when “Lost” had their flash forwards, you were like, how’d that happen? Where did the idea for the time-travel story line come from? McFEELY Kevin [Feige] at one point said, I would like to use the Time Stone, or use time as an element. It let us spend a few weeks seeing what’s the kookiest thing we could do with time and not break the movie. MARKUS We all sat there going, really? We’re going to do time travel? It was only when we were looking at who we had available, character-wise; we hadn’t used Ant-Man yet. And there really is, in people’s theory of the Quantum Realm, a time thing in the M.C.U., right now, available to us, with a character we haven’t used yet. We have a loophole that’s not cheating. It’s crucial to your film that in your formulation of time travel, changes to the past don’t alter our present. How did you decide this? MARKUS We looked at a lot of time-travel stories and went, it doesn’t work that way. McFEELY It was by necessity. If you have six MacGuffins and every time you go back it changes something, you’ve got Biff’s casino, exponentially. So we just couldn’t do that. We had physicists come in — more than one — who said, basically, “Back to the Future” is [wrong]. MARKUS Basically said what the Hulk says in that scene, which is, if you go to the past, then the present becomes your past and the past becomes your future. So there’s absolutely no reason it would change. Did you try any other approaches to the time-travel story? McFEELY In the first draft, we didn’t go back to the [original] “Avengers” movie. We went back to Asgard. But there’s a moment in the M.C.U., if you’re paying very close attention, where the Aether is there and the Tesseract is in the vault. In that iteration, we were interested in Tony going to Asgard. He had a stealth suit, so he was invisible, and he fought Heimdall, who could see him. MARKUS Thor had long scenes with Natalie Portman. And Morag [the planet where Peter Quill finds the Orb] was hugely complicated. McFEELY It was underwater! That was clever but it was just too big a set piece. What that didn’t do is allow for Thanos and his daughters to get on the trail at the right moment. So we went back to when Peter Quill was there. And we realized that when you can punch Quill in the face, it’s hilarious. I still think it’s hilarious. MARKUS There were entirely other trips taken. They went to the Triskelion at one point to get the [Tesseract], and then somebody was going to get into a car and drive to Doctor Strange’s house.McFEELY Just saying it out loud, it’s like, what are we doing? MARKUS It was when we were trying to avoid going to “Avengers” because it seemed pander-y.McFEELY We’re not always right. MARKUS The obvious ones seemed so obvious that it’s too obvious. McFEELY Eventually, Joe Russo went, why are we going to this movie when we can go to “Avengers?” Let’s make it work. Thor recovers his hammer, Mjolnir, by taking it from an earlier timeline. So that raises the question — McFEELY Does that screw that other Thor? MARKUS Is he killed by Dark Elves? McFEELY I think we’re leaning on, when you just take a baseball mitt, you didn’t ruin that kid’s life. When you took Mjolnir, we accept that that movie happened. Because time is irrefutable. MARKUS You can make any number of what ifs. The Dark Elves would have arrived, intending to get the Aether. It’s what they came for and it was no longer there. McFEELY So they build a paradise together. MARKUS They all got married. [laughter] There’s a surprise cameo, in the “Avengers” scene, from Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce. Did you prepare for other scenarios if Redford wasn’t available? McFEELY That was one where we thought, should it be Nick Fury? We also wrote a version for Maria Hill. That whole time, they’re announcing “Old Man With a Gun” as Redford’s last appearance on film. It’s the last time you’re going to see Robert Redford. And we’re going — [shoots conspiratorial look at Markus] [Laughter] How did Marvel feel when you told them you envisioned a massive battle royal with nearly every character from the franchise? MARKUS I think they knew it was coming. McFEELY It’s why it took so long. We shot for 200 days for two movies. MARKUS We wrote and shot an even much longer battle, with its own three-act structure. Were there scenes you wrote for this sequence that didn’t make it into the film? McFEELY It didn’t play well, but we had a scene in a trench where, for reasons, the battle got paused for about three minutes and now there’s 18 people all going, “What are we going to do?” “I’m going to do this.” “I’m going to do this.” Just bouncing around this completely fake, fraudulent scene. When you have that many people, it invariably is, one line, one line, one line. And that’s not a natural conversation. MARKUS It also required them to find enough shelter to have a conversation in the middle of the biggest battle. It wasn’t a polite World War I battle where you have a moment. How did you coordinate the moment where all the female Marvel heroes come together? McFEELY There was much conversation. Is that delightful or is it pandering? We went around and around on that. Ultimately we went, we like it too much. MARKUS Part of the fun of the “Avengers” movies has always been team-ups. Marvel has been amassing this huge roster of characters. You’ve got crazy aliens. You’ve got that many badass women. You’ve got three or four people in Iron Man suits. Were there other characters you could’ve had but didn’t use? MARKUS There were moments, as they brought everybody back, where we’re like, technically, Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer have [Ant-Man] suits. Do we bring them back? It became impossible to track the people we did bring back, but also, it’s just going to be an orgy. McFEELY Do you put Luke Cage in there? Did you consider using the heroes from the Netflix TV shows, like Daredevil or Jessica Jones? McFEELY We would have to introduce these five characters — or whatever many. We already are assuming people have seen a lot of the movies. Are we really going to assume they have bought a subscription to Netflix and watched those shows enough so that when they see them, they’re going to go “yay?” MARKUS It also screws up the timelines. You would have to assume that they all got snapped away, or otherwise they might have shown up earlier. I think the only character who has come from TV to the movies is Jarvis, James D’Arcy [from “Agent Carter”]. Could you have used any of the characters that Disney obtained from the Fox acquisition, like the X-Men or Fantastic Four? McFEELY Legally, not allowed to. MARKUS I guess it’s done now but it wasn’t done then. They still have an “X-Men” movie [“Dark Phoenix,” due in June]. You can’t reboot them before they’re done. “Sorry to completely screw you.” “Endgame” shares some unexpected parallels with “Game of Thrones,” which also recently ran episodes about its heroes preparing for a significant battle and then the battle itself. Why do you think these narratives are similar? Did you ever look at “Game of Thrones” for inspiration? MARKUS We’re in a high-stakes time and a jarring time in history, where you have to contemplate what you’re willing to do to improve the situation. Whether or not everyone’s speaking to that, or just good old-fashioned storytelling, I don’t know. McFEELY Marvel has been accused of being the most expensive television show there is, and there’s some truth to that. The genres are different, the tones are different, but it’s serialized storytelling.MARKUS We occasionally wonder, did we just make the world’s most expensive inside-baseball fan service? But then we go, the fans are actually the majority of people who come to this. It’s inside baseball, but everyone is following the baseball. That’s also why the Marvel characters have lasted this long. They’re weird. They have strange quirks. McFEELY The bland ones don’t last. MARKUS I remember “Game of Thrones” being a reference for the first movie. How far apart can you keep these strands, and for how long, and still feel like you’re telling a single narrative? “Game of Thrones” has people who are just meeting now! As much as people think the culture’s going down the drain, there seems to be an elevating of people’s estimating of the kind of narrative that will succeed in popular culture. McFEELY Whatever you think of this movie, it’s complicated. It is not another sequel. MARKUS And a lot of popular TV is complicated. “This Is Us” is complicated. “Simon & Simon” was not that complicated. Great as it was. But it does seem like there is an acceptance of more complicated forms of storytelling. Was the three-hour running time of “Endgame” ever in question? MARKUS There was an agreement within the whole group that we’re going to take our time; we’re not going to cut a half-hour of it so we can get one more screening in per day. McFEELY We couldn’t! Where are you going to cut a half-hour? There was not a sequence you could cut. MARKUS Look at some of the most popular movies of all time. They’re long as hell. When people want to see something, it doesn’t seem to get in their way. There’s some short, totally unsuccessful movies, too. Why does Natasha Romanoff have to die? McFEELY Her journey, in our minds, had come to an end if she could get the Avengers back. She comes from such an abusive, terrible, mind-control background, so when she gets to Vormir and she has a chance to get the family back, that’s a thing she would trade for. The toughest thing for us was we were always worried that people weren’t going to have time to be sad enough. The stakes are still out there and they haven’t solved the problem. But we lost a big character — a female character — how do we honor it? We have this male lens and it’s a lot of guys being sad that a woman died. MARKUS Tony gets a funeral. Natasha doesn’t. That’s partly because Tony’s this massive public figure and she’s been a cipher the whole time. It wasn’t necessarily honest to the character to give her a funeral. The biggest question about it is what Thor raises there on the dock. “We have the Infinity Stones. Why don’t we just bring her back?” McFEELY But that’s the everlasting exchange. You bring her back, you lose the stone. Was there a possible outcome where Clint Barton sacrifices himself instead of her? McFEELY There was, for sure. Jen Underdahl, our visual effects producer, read an outline or draft where Hawkeye goes over. And she goes, “Don’t you take this away from her.” I actually get emotional thinking about it. MARKUS And it was true, it was him taking the hit for her. It was melodramatic to have him die and not get his family back. And it is only right and proper that she’s done. And Tony Stark has to die as well? McFEELY Everyone knew this was going to be the end of Tony Stark. MARKUS I don’t think there were any mandates. If we had a good reason to not do it, certainly people would have entertained it. McFEELY The watchword was, end this chapter, and he started the chapter. MARKUS In a way, he has been the mirror of Steve Rogers the entire time. Steve is moving toward some sort of enlightened self-interest, and Tony’s moving to selflessness. They both get to their endpoints. Were there any other outcomes you considered for Tony? MARKUS No. Because we had the opportunity to give him the perfect retirement life, within the movie. McFEELY He got that already. MARKUS That’s the life he’s been striving for. Are he and Pepper going to get together? Yes. They got married, they had a kid, it was great. It’s a good death. It doesn’t feel like a tragedy. It feels like a heroic, finished life. And Cap was always going to be allowed his happy ending with Peggy Carter? McFEELY From the very first outline, we knew he was going to get his dance. On a separate subject, I started to lose my barometer on what was just fan service and what was good for the character. Because I think it’s good for the characters. But we also just gave you what you wanted. Is that good? I don’t know. But I’ll tell you, it’s satisfying. He’s postponed a life in order to fulfill his duty. That’s why I didn’t think we were ever going to kill him. Because that’s not the arc. The arc is, I finally get to put my shield down because I’ve earned that. MARKUS A hero without sacrifice, you’re not going to get the miles out of that person that you need to for these movies. That’s what makes them a hero, it’s not the powers. “Endgame” sets up Sam Wilson as the new Captain America. Is that a future Marvel film? Would you write that? MARKUS We really do just know what you know. They’re doing “The Eternals,” which is a property I know next to nothing about. We’ve been here, trying to set this contraption running. Were we to take another one on, you can’t increase the scope or the stakes from where we are at the moment. We’d have to shrink it back down, do an origin story. There are deep-bench characters where I’m like, if you roll that guy out, I couldn’t resist. There is a great Moon Knight movie to be made, but I don’t know what is. You’ve been writing these films and characters for more than a decade, and you never got bored of them — McFEELY Or fired. For sure. MARKUS We’ve come close to both. It’s a testament to the concept but also the people we’re working with. We’re not bumping up against this dictatorial level where it’s like, “I have some notes. I really want to see him fly a dragon — put the dragon in. I’m going to lunch.” McFEELY If we have an idea, people take it really seriously. They valued “Winter Soldier” and they saw how “Civil War” was coming together. They’d seen our process and us working with the [Russo] brothers, and they said, if Joss [Whedon] is not coming back — I don’t know that decision — it was clear that, unless they hated us, it was going to be this team. MARKUS But there also was a possibility, because [“Avengers: Age of Ultron”] made a little bit less than “Avengers” 1 — that we were taking on “Superman” 3 and 4. Maybe people were done with it. McFEELY The goal was not to advance it to the stratosphere. It was to just not screw it up. Is this your Marvel finale as well? MARKUS I don’t know how to follow it up, that’s the problem. I’m not quite old enough to retire. If “Endgame” has taught us anything, it’s that you should never retire. McFEELY Then they drag you out and kill you.",The New York Times
2019,‘Barry’: Bill Hader on That Intensely Surreal and Violent Episode,"This article contains spoilers about Season 2, Episode 5 of “Barry.” Bill Hader thought he might be pushing it too far with Sunday’s episode of the HBO comedy “Barry.” In it, his assassin and would-be actor character is locked in a series of prolonged, grotesque fight sequences, first with a martial-arts master and then with his daughter, a supernatural-seeming child who scampers on all fours, scurries up a tree and perches atop a house, gargoyle style. And that’s just for starters. The episode, named “ronny/lily” after that belligerent duo (played by Daniel Bernhardt and Jessie Giacomazzi), took the series into a territory more gruesome and surreal than ever — which is saying something. “We might have jumped the shark,” Hader said in an telephone interview last week. “If we did, well, who cares? It was rad.” During the conversation, Hader, who directed and co-wrote the episode, talked about how he first got the idea and the logistics of choreographing such surprisingly thoughtful violence. Here are edited excerpts. How did this episode come about? While we were shooting Season 1 last year, Wade Allen, our stunt coordinator, told me: “Hey, if you ever need a little girl to do stunts, I know this girl Jessie. Her parents are both stunt people, and she’s amazing. I just worked with her on a commercial, and she can do fights, and she’s a gymnast.” I was like, “That’s cool.” It stuck in my head, and I have a little notebook that I write things down in. I wrote out that idea — Barry fighting a little girl, and her running up a tree on top of a house. I just had these little images. Did you decide to direct the episode because of your vision for it? Yeah, I saw it very clearly, and I wrote it super specifically. It was very strange because usually, when we write episodes, it’s [the show’s other creator, Alec Berg], me and the writers in a room. But this is one where I came in and pitched it to all of them, and they were like, “That sounds crazy!” It was a weird thing I was cooking up privately that I told them about, and they were into it. How did you find Daniel Bernhardt? It was hard because in the script, Ronny was a short, fat, bald guy. He was this schlub, and it was this weird reveal that he was a taekwondo master. That proved incredibly hard to find. Most guys who are skilled like this are really good-looking like Daniel. He came in, and all the women in our casting office were like, “Can we please cast him?” What was it like working with Jessie Giacomazzi? She’s brilliant — so sweet and a really amazing actress. Her character thinks her father has been killed, and I didn’t want to lose sight of that. I said: “This is a very primal thing that you defend yourself and seek some sort of vengeance. Think of yourself as an animal.” We kept going between squirrel and tiger. She really understood the character. Barry wears a mask through much of the episode. Did that make it easier for you to use a stunt double for the fight scenes? Yeah, that was all by design. Barry, logically, doesn’t want to be seen, so he’d be wearing a mask, and that means we can go all out in the fight scenes. Because I was directing the episode, that helped to be behind the monitor and making sure the shots were right. Why did you decide to go with such long takes? Doesn’t that put pressure on performers? Yes, but my instinct, for some reason, was no music, and these long, panning shots to create a sense of tension. I asked our director of photography, Paula Huidobro, “How do we do this so it doesn’t look cool?” The camera is almost judging what’s happening. It’s coming from the point of view of: “Guys, what are you doing? Come on. Stop.” Were any of the stunts done with special effects? The only effect is the tree. She’s climbing up a green-screened rock-climbing wall, and she’s harnessed. But that is her jumping on the roof and scurrying up there. It gave me a heart attack every time we did that. After every take, I was like: “We’re good, right? The little girl doesn’t have to climb up on top of the roof anymore?” And Paula would be like: “Oh, the dolly was a little bit late. Can we go again, just to get it right?” And Jessie was always like, “Can we do it again?” She was having a blast, but I just felt so responsible. Why did you decide go with such a surreal tone for this episode? It just felt right. A lot of shows do that. My editor, Jeff Buchanan, said, “This kind of reminds me of the ‘Pine Barrens’ episode of ‘The Sopranos.’” “Atlanta” had that great “Teddy Perkins” episode last year where you’re just like, “What is this?” I thought of “Pine Barrens,” too. Is Lily going to be like the Russian in the woods, and we’ll never see her again? Maybe. I have no idea. It’s kind of a weird thing to let a loose thread happen. When I pitched it, everyone in the writers’ room said, “What happens to the little girl?” And I went: “I don’t know. She’s just out there.” They got a little creeped out. How do you feel now that you’ve pulled it off? It was so much fun. I’d always wanted to be a director since I was a kid. And the pilot for “Barry” was the first thing I ever directed. It was cool for me with this episode to at least try to take it up a notch. You’re always just trying to make it better. How do you top this? I don’t think of it in those terms. There will be some people who will dig this, and there will be some people who are like: “What’s going on with the acting class? I don’t care about any of this.” You can’t please everybody.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Be Natural’ Review: Rescuing Alice Guy Blaché, a Film Pioneer, From Oblivion","Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. At the beginning of Pamela B. Green’s lively and informative new documentary, a bevy of movie people — directors, actors, scholars and others — are asked if they know anything about Alice Guy Blaché, who is the subject of the film. A few of them do (Ava DuVernay, for one), but most admit that they have no clue. Viewers who are similarly ignorant shouldn’t feel bad, and in the best pedagogical spirit Green turns blank looks and sheepishly shrugged shoulders into a teaching moment. “Be Natural: The Untold Story of Alice Guy-Blaché” seeks both to help rescue Guy Blaché from oblivion and to explain how she got there in the first place. Alice Guy was born into a bourgeois French family in 1873. An interview conducted more than 90 years later reveals a woman very much of her era and class, with crisp diction, faultless grammar and a mildly ironical way of talking about even painful and contentious matters. Trained in stenography, Alice was hired, at 22, as an assistant to Léon Gaumont, who would soon become one of the founders of the French film industry. Guy (who married the British cameraman Herbert Blaché in 1907) merits that description as much as her boss. Often referred to as a pioneer — one of a handful of important women filmmakers active in cinema’s earliest days — she was more than that. Present at an early, private Paris showing of one of Louis and Auguste Lumière’s first shorts, Guy was among the first to explore the storytelling potential of the new medium. At the Gaumont studio, where she worked until 1906, she directed hundreds of fantasies, comedies, melodramas and historical films. After moving to the United States, she set up her own company, Solax Studios, continuing her prolific output in the burgeoning proto-Hollywood of Fort Lee, N.J. She was, in sum, a studio chief as well as a director and producer — a key figure in the emergence of two major national cinemas. The recovery of this reputation is central to Green’s project, and she builds on the work of historians and archivists, including Guy Blaché’s biographer, Alison McMahan. “Be Natural” is its own making-of documentary, following Green’s gumshoe efforts to track down letters and ledgers, artifacts and descendants. She enlists a specialist in facial recognition to determine whether a woman in an ancient moving picture is indeed Guy Blaché. She zigzags across Los Angeles in search of a lab that will digitize antique videotapes. She details her own cross-country and trans-Atlantic peregrinations as well as those undertaken by her heroine more than a century earlier. The result is occasionally a little frantic — animated segments sometimes bring the past to life and sometimes get in the way — and often tremendously moving. The interviews with Guy Blaché and with her daughter, Simone, bring a tender, complicated dimension of personality, and make it feel as if the dawn of movies is not so far away after all. The present-day celebrities, who seem to become instant experts after their initial confessions of cluelessness, add little beyond their own boldface names. (An exception is Jodie Foster, who provides voice-over narration and served as an executive producer.) The preservationists and film historians are the truly fascinating characters, and it would be good to learn even more about the work of rescue and recovery they do. “Be Natural” is inspiring because it is also appalling. The near-forgetting of Guy Blaché wasn’t just an accident of film history, though the fact that most of her work belongs to the years before World War I made it especially vulnerable to loss. Green notes that she is less well-known than contemporaries like Lois Weber and Dorothy Arzner, but those women were also written out of film history or pushed to its margins. Guy Blaché found America a more welcoming working environment than France. But in both countries the record of her achievements was erased. Her early Gaumont pictures were attributed to her male assistants, and their originality and quality went unrecognized, in spite of evidence of her influence on later auteurs like Sergei Eisenstein and Alfred Hitchcock. When it was remembered at all, Solax Studios was thought of as Herbert Blaché’s company. Green’s revision of that record is long overdue and just in time, given the present-day reckoning with Hollywood’s stubborn traditions of behind-the-scenes (and onscreen) sexism. Most intriguing are the clips the documentary gathers from Guy Blaché’s films. Many of them look less like old curiosities than lost classics, and their range — from the surreal slapstick of “The Drunken Mattress,” to the domestic melodrama of “Falling Leaves,” to the social satire of “Consequences of Feminism” — is astonishing. (Several have been issued by Kino Lorber in the indispensable “Pioneers: First Women Filmmakers” collection). By the end of “Be Natural,” you won’t only have a clear idea of who this remarkable woman was; you may well have acquired a new taste in old movies.

2019,"‘Billions’ Season 4, Episode 3: Hurts So Good","Billions “I used to try and pretend I was dreaming all of the pain, but don’t you kid yourself: Some things have to be endured. And that’s what makes the pleasures so sweet.” Whether as shorthand for their feelings, metaphors for their predicaments, or models for their aspired-to lifestyles, characters on “Billions” simply love dropping pop-culture quotes on one another. In fact this week’s episode, “Chickentown,” takes its name from a bowdlerized version of the famous “Forget it, Jake …” conclusion to “Chinatown,” referenced when Bobby Axelrod and Wags Wagner stop their mad-dog lieutenant Bill Stearn, known as Dollar Bill (Kelly AuCoin, delightfully amoral), from salvaging an insider-trading scheme by wiping out a poultry farm. (It’s a long story.) Still, to the best of my recollection, no one on this quotation-happy show has yet referenced Clive Barker’s sadomasochistic horror film “Hellraiser,” whose undead antagonist Frank Cotton I’ve quoted above. No, not even Chuck and Wendy Rhoades, who can at least attest to the veracity of Cotton’s claim about pleasure and pain as a sexual matter. Yet after watching “Chickentown” I want to set up a “Hellraiser” screening in Bobby Axelrod’s home theater just to make everyone wake up and smell the suffering. Axe, Chuck, Taylor Mason, even the lovably loathsome Dollar Bill — they all seem to require intense adversity to be at their best, whether they realize it or not. Of all the characters, Taylor is the most deeply embedded in the “or not” category. After three episodes of low-key warfare with Axe, who resents the younger hedge-fund wiz for breaking away from his firm last season, Taylor calls for a strikingly shot late-night waterfront meeting to broker a truce. Why waste so much time attacking and defending, the argument goes, when they can reach terms that allow Taylor Mason Capital to operate freely while allowing Axe Cap to invest in the company and reap the PR rewards on Wall Street? But take a look at how Taylor has spent the days leading up to the dramatic rendezvous. Bobby’s crack industrial-espionage team has exploited a cybersecurity weakness to uncover his rival’s trading patterns and positions. Knowing Taylor is a perfectionist, and that Taylor Mason Capital’s team of brainiac market-math “quants” is the pride of their firm, Axe launches an infuriatingly subtle scheme to make penny-ante trades simply to screw up their predicted results. To help stem the bleeding of this death by a thousand cuts, Taylor employs — and I’m quoting here, to capture the full awkwardness of the relationship — “Douglas Mason … yes, this is my … he’s my father.” At first, the gruff, slightly schlubby Douglas (Kevin Pollak) seems a world apart from his gender-nonbinary child, whom he relentlessly misgenders as “she.” But it turns out he, too, is a mathematical genius, though his trade was aerospace rather than the Street. Together, the Masons craft a new algorithm to make an end-run around Axe’s sabotage — or so they want him to believe. With the help of a surveillance photo procured by his dirty-deeds specialist Hall (Terry Kinney), Axe has a copy of the algo he spends a full day attempting to decipher before realizing it has a mistake. He knows his enemy well enough to know one thing: Taylor Mason doesn’t make mistakes. This isn’t an error. This is a message: We know you’re watching. Without Axe’s needling, Taylor’s defensive capabilities wouldn’t have received so spectacular a showcase, forcing Bobby to the bargaining table. Nor would Mr. Mason have spent enough time around his kid, now not only an adult but a bona fide Master of the Financial Universe, to relent from his alienating behavior. “You know I don’t think that ‘woke’ stuff is worthless or for idiots just because I’m no good at it, right?” he asks after their work is complete. “I know it matters.” Taylor, the coolest customer on the whole show, tears up in response. All it took was not one but two father figures’ relentless hammering away to achieve this moment of realization. This is not to say that enduring a parent who casually uses the incorrect pronouns in referring to a child they’re supposed to love and care for is some sort of ennobling sacrifice that’s worth the pain — far from it. But this circumstance shaped Taylor into a person whose “arousal template,” to borrow a phrase from last week’s episode, is proving doubters disastrously wrong. In that sense, mission accomplished. For Chuck, the pleasure-pain relationship is more literal than for anyone else on the show, but what’s true in his bedroom is true in the world at large. Indeed, his story line this week sees his personal and professional brands of reward and punishment merge like they rarely have before. Rhoades’s masochistic misadventure begins when his old colleague Lonnie Watley (Malachi Weir, whose professorial presence is unmistakable) warns him of an impending expose that will harm his chances in the attorney general’s race, involving a dropped case against a vape manufacturer whose CEO was a pal of Charles Rhoades, Sr. Chuck tries to stop the story at the source, but the editor rebuffs him. He attempts to scare the whistle-blowing star witness out of going on the record, but his former underling Kate Sacker (Condola Rashad, quietly ruthless) persuades him that a lucrative lawsuit against the vape company could be in the offing if he goes forward. The outfoxed and exposed Chuck finds that he and Wendy are personae non gratae at a fund-raiser they have to grin and bear their way through that night. Wracked by tension headaches, he figures out a way to make pain work for him, however. Earlier that day he’d gotten aroused by the simple sight of watching Wendy snap a rubber band during the course of a conversation. So he sneaks off to the men’s room, wraps a rubber band around his thigh like a Staples-brand cilice, and spends the rest of the awkward meet-and-greet surreptitiously snapping it through the leg of his trousers. Whatever gets you through the night! But it’s not until he reaches out to his enemy turned ally Bobby that Chuck’s head finally clears. (The Michael Bolton concert he and his dad took in didn’t seem to help matters, to be fair.) The lawman is not above admitting needs the moneyman’s help. “I don’t just mean money, though I do mean money,” he clarifies via a deft line reading by Paul Giamatti. Remember the schemes Axe had been leveraging against Taylor, designed to nibble around the margins rather than risk a frontal assault? Chuck wants him to do the same thing to his opponent in the A.G. race by hitting the coffers of his largest donors. The handshake deal that results — a quid pro quo, with Bobby’s quo to be named later — is enough for Chuck to throw his headache medicine away. It’s also a much-needed win for Axe. After all, he’d been forced into armistice with Taylor, for now anyway. And at the end of the black-comedy subplot that saw Dollar Bill nearly poison the food supply in order to get an edge on the agribusiness sector, he actually found himself saying “Sometimes you just gotta take a loss,” though the words caught in his throat like so much tainted chicken. Did enduring that pain make the pleasure of potentially having the future attorney general of New York in his pocket that much sweeter? Bet the farm on it. An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the character nicknamed Dollar Bill. He is Bill Stearn, not Stern. It also misstated the given name of the actor who plays him. He is Kelly AuCoin, not Terry.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Billions’ Season 4, Episode 4 Recap: Consent","Billions When “Billions” is at its best, as it certainly was tonight, recapping is a dicey proposition. Focus on one element and you inevitably give short shrift to another equally entertaining aspect. And more than any other show currently airing, “Billions” deploys a whole lot of very different ways to entertain you: a satire of extreme wealth and power as well as an alluring recreation of it; a financial and political thriller, tag-teamed with a comedy of manners; a parade of terrific character actors knocking around crisp, reference-heavy dialogue like a badminton shuttlecock; a sensitive and idiosyncratic depiction of a gender-nonbinary character, mixed with a humanizing and nonjudgmental depiction of sadomasochism within the context of a loving relationship. This week’s episode was all that and more, and it forced a dramatic shift upon the entire series. There’s no sense beating around the bush here. Faced with the certain exposure of his kinky sex life, Chuck Rhoades decides to risk sacrificing his wife’s reputation at the altar of his own ambition to become the attorney general, preemptively revealing that he is a sexual submissive to the world. On Election Day. And he wins. It’s a blockbuster moment for the series — and, perhaps, a central one. Keep in mind that the pilot episode opened with Chuck, stripped down and tied up, the same way that “Game of Thrones” began with zombies and White Walkers attacking normal humans. In both cases, an expanding cast and a few seasons of byzantine political machinations helped detract attention from what was lurking there all along. A big difference here, of course, is that Chuck Rhoades is no stoic, mute Night King. He’s Paul freakin’ Giamatti, and is there any actor more fun to listen to? His voice modulates with nearly every word of dialogue, as if he weren’t speaking each sentence so much as juggling it. It’s a great fit for a character who is not only constantly thinking but also must do so demonstratively, whether to intimidate his enemies, reassure his allies or simply please his own vanity. Watching him tell a roomful of reporters what he must do “in order to achieve sexual gratification,” seeming to re-evaluate how far to take his confession several times per sentence, is a consummate pleasure. The fallout is immediate: positive politically and disastrous personally. Chuck wins the election (I defy you to read the news for five minutes and then tell me this isn’t possible), and impresses the hell out of his increasingly close associate Bobby Axelrod, who promises his first wisecrack about Rhoades’s predilections will be his last. (“I doubt that,” Chuck deadpans.) To Bobby, at least, Chuck remains a man of his word. Making good on his promise last episode to perform a service for Axe postelection, Chuck freezes the assets of the Russian plutocrat and staunch Axelrod adversary Grigor Andolov. Bobby tells Grigor he can have it unfrozen only if he returns to his home country, never to return. Just in time, too: On a day when Bobby and company were prepared to make a killing by exploiting advance notice of a natural gas disaster, Andolov brute-force hacked Axe Cap’s entire internet and phone system. The awe with which the young, internet-native staff regard Bobby and Wags as they wheel and deal on burner cellphones, “Wolf of Wall Street”-style, and wind up doing nearly as well as they would have anyway is one of the night’s funniest moments. (Top honors go to Condola Rashad’s look of dumbfounded disbelief as Chuck’s former employee Kate Sacker when she learns what her old boss gets up to in bed.) Still, the Russian had to go in order for Bobby, his American counterpart, to truly thrive, and it’s Chuck who does the deed — despite Andolov’s attempt to exploit Chuck’s sexual adventurousness by promising him overseas exploits so extreme he dare not even mention them aloud. But someone has to lose to make all this winning possible, and that’s undoubtedly Wendy, whom Chuck humiliates on the grandest stage of them all. It’s not that she feels either of them should be ashamed of their sexual fetishes — “Billions” has always been resolute in maintaining that kink is not an indicator of personal or marital dysfunction, and for that it deserves enormous credit. On the contrary, Wendy knows that the consent Chuck gives her to hurt him is what makes their relationship work. But she emphatically did not consent to having their sex lives dragged into the spotlight, risking her professional relationships and embarrassing their children. The next thing she knows, she’s watching him out her as a dominatrix on the 5 o’clock news. As she’s done many times in the past, Maggie Siff underplays Wendy’s frustration and anger, which has the effect of making what comes through seem that much more intimidating and sincere. What Chuck has done to her is a grotesque violation, and his failure to act as if it were anything more than a spat that can be patched over is indicative of his deep moral shortcomings. Yet even in this episode, there are moments of human connection to savor. Taylor Mason’s dad, Douglas, visits with a business proposal that his brainiac offspring is visibly thrilled to realize is worth backing. “I’m gonna be in business with my … child,” Douglas says, respecting Taylor’s nonbinary status to their mutual joy. On a less wholesome but still sincere(ish) note, Bobby and his billionaire girlfriend, Rebecca, stage a takeover of a struggling convenience-store chain the way the rest of us might approach going to the laundromat; his purchase of his-and-hers Mercedes for $132,000 a pop is a grimly funny reminder of just how far removed from the rest of us these people are. Even Chuck has good within him. Take his final battle against the New York power broker Jack Foley, who’s the reason he has to out himself as a masochist. Foley knows the secret. He has passed it on to United States Attorney General Jock Jeffcoat, who hates Chuck even more than he does. And he tells Chuck he will not hesitate to expose him if that’s what it takes to keep that office clean. As Black Jack, the actor David Strathairn is marvelous here. Foley is sincerely worked up about this, his eyes teary, his voice wavering. Before our eyes, he melts through his kingmaker character’s sang-froid to reveal the idealism he still harbors in his heart, misguided though it may be. The favor is returned, so to speak, when Chuck learns from his lieutenant Karl Allard (the great Allan Havey) the reason Jack is playing hardball: He has terminal cancer, and this is his last stand. Even though he’s in a fight for his political life against the guy, Chuck is saddened by his enemy’s illness. Moments like these keep him a character worth rooting for, if only barely. I appreciate that there’s room for humanizing beats like these on a show this (appropriately) cynical about wealth and power. All other considerations about character development and realistic human behavior aside, it would be pretty boring if all anyone here ever cared about was winning.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Billions’ Season 4, Episode 5: Best Served Cold","Billions This week on “Billions,” revenge is the order of the day. All right, fine: Every week on “Billions,” revenge is the order of the day. But this episode is special even so. Written by Michael Russell Gunn and directed with gangster-movie brio by Matthew McLoota, the episode has Axe and Chuck conduct some of their most brutally total takedowns of their enemies yet. What, you thought dispatching Grigor Andolov and outfoxing Jack Foley and Jock Jeffcoat was going to keep these two happy? Don’t you remember that happiness is nothing more than a moment before you need more happiness? Longtime “Billions” watchers will remember that Bobby Axelrod made his fortune on 9/11, which he was lucky enough to have survived while many of his colleagues perished. Since then, he has funded the college tuition of the children of those who died in hopes of a sort of karmic offset. Now those children are adults, and many are successful in their own right. In this episode, we discover that one of their number, John Rice (Seth Gabel), has become a promising hedge-fund whiz himself … which is why Bobby is both baffled and insulted when the kid cashes him out of his firm. Wendy, who’s tickled to discover her employer has actual emotions, says that he is feeling like a father who has been rejected by his child, a dynamic she suggests is also at work in his relationship with Taylor Mason (whom he has instructed Chuck to put behind bars as quickly as possible). She tells Axe that a father figure, rather than a financial backer, was what John wanted all along. So Bobby does the most dad thing imaginable and takes John fishing, in a sequence of scenes with a very “Tony Soprano takes an underboss he suspects of treason for a one-way cruise on the ‘Stugotz’” vibe. It’s fun enough until the boat stalls in the middle of nowhere, and the local towing crew is too busy to bring them back to shore. As time passes and beer flows, John gets comfortable, drunk and angry enough to tell Axe he wanted him out not because of some father-son thing, but because, like his actual father before him, he thinks Bobby is scum. Things end a bit better for John than they do for certain Soprano family associates, but only slightly. Turns out the boat wasn’t stalled at all — Bobby had disabled it precisely so he could wheedle the truth out of this ingrate. And while they were incommunicado at sea, Axe had an interview published in which he bad-mouthed Rice’s hedge fund, damaging it irrevocably, while Wags led a crack team of Axe Cap’s most ruthless traders in systematically destroying whatever remained. (The central-casting sailor voice of the towing company? It was the hilariously awful lickspittle Ari Spyros, played by Stephen Kunken, reading from a script.) Vengeance, thy name is Axe. Chuck’s problem, meanwhile, is far more urgent than punishing some punk kid. The governor has been pressured by Rhoades’s enemy Jock Jeffcoat into curtailing the investigative power of the attorney general’s office he now occupies. Stymied, Chuck gets some advice from his indefatigable dad, who spends the episode either making shady deals to erect a waterfront high-rise or picking up Viagra from the pharmacy. (I’m sure there’s a metaphor in there.) During the latter outing, he advises his son not just to strike back, but to do it so definitively that his enemies will be too terrified to even think about crossing him again. But if Charles was expecting a surgical strike, what he got instead was a carpet bombing. Stepping to the lectern at the memorial service for Jack Foley, Chuck announces that he intends to honor the departed kingmaker’s good-government legacy by cleaning up Albany — starting right then and there. Suddenly the doors open, and an entire squad of lawmen begin pulling politicians from the pews. Outwardly, the genius of the move is its theatricality. But behind the scenes it’s driven by the painstaking politicking that girds all of Chuck’s big successes. First, he approaches a powerful assemblyman with evidence of his wrongdoing, securing his support in exchange for immunity. Then he brings this information to the governor. Chuck can either use the Assembly to have his powers restored, he tells him … or he can turn on the Assembly, handing the governor a major victory over corruption — that’s if the governor restores Chuck’s powers himself. It’s an offer the gobsmacked governor can’t refuse. Combine it with the spectacularly public show of force and … well, as a wise man once said, theatricality and deception are powerful agents to the uninitiated. All of this is well and good if you’re in the market for advice on how to crush your enemies. Most of us, however, could use some tips on issues that hit a bit closer to home. That’s where Wendy comes in. Surprisingly (to me anyway) she hasn’t simply kicked Chuck to the curb for outing them as sadomasochists. But staying in her marriage and getting on with her life are two very different things. It’s the latter she’s struggling with, hiding in her office with the lights out to avoid her colleagues’ knowing glances. Until, that is, she goes on the internet and begins facing the scandal head-on. It’s exactly as bad as she expected: lewd jokes, crude photoshops, lots of speculation as to the exact sounds Chuck makes when she’s giving him the business. “Like a stuck pig,” she explains to Axe, who emphatically does not want to know. Her reaction? Nothing, pretty much! “The thing is, as I read it, it stopped mattering,” she tells Bobby. “It stopped really being about me. It stopped having anything to do with me, because I don’t know these people, and they don’t know me.” It’s like the Bene Gesserit litany against fear; call it the Wendy Rhoades litany against trolls. This isn’t to minimize misogynist internet harassment, mind you. It’s just to say that given the means to sufficiently insulate oneself from critics, which a multimillionaire like Wendy Rhoades definitely has, they have only the power you give them. But this is “Billions,” folks: If you think this has a happy ending, you haven’t been playing attention. During the course of Wendy’s research, she discovered that while many of Axe Cap’s enemies were hooting and hollering over her plight, Taylor Mason, who spent the episode wooing the keepers of the New York Fire Department pension fund, was not among them. Bobby’s public enemy No. 1 shut down the mockery whenever it popped up and even reached out to Wendy to express support. What do she and Bobby make of this display of empathy? In a word, from Axe: “Lame!” Wendy didn’t take Taylor’s call before. But now that she knows there’s a weakness here that can be exploited? It’s time to reach out and crush someone.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Billions’ Season 4, Episode 6: Beat or Be Beaten","Billions Chuck Rhoades wants to be beaten. Needs it, in fact. He even asks his wife to take their kids out for the night so a professional dominatrix can come over and do what she is no longer willing to do herself. And when the domme does it, she does it hard. Bruises, welts, cuts, a shiner around the left eye: It’s bad enough that even though he has come out of the kink closet, he still has to pretend he has taken up jujitsu just to avoid further embarrassment. He’ll need the excuse, too, because he plans on doing this again and again and again. “Wendy,” he says, as she looks at his battered body in shock, “what I did tonight I cannot live without.” It’s funny that “Billions” has moved Chuck and Wendy’s sadomasochism to the forefront of the story. Even though a depiction of that aspect of their relationship opened the entire series, I don’t think I ever appreciated what an effective analogy it is for the behavior of, well, pretty much everyone on the show. No one here seems fulfilled unless they’re giving or taking a beating. In this week’s episode, the prime mover in that respect is Chuck, and not simply because of the physical beating he sustains. Having regained his crown as king of New York’s legal jungle, he is constantly seeking ways to destroy his foes before they come for his throat. Public enemy No. 1 in this respect is the United States attorney general, Jock Jeffcoat, who Chuck’s staff discovers has been making suspicious trips to the Cayman Islands. While they can uncover no further evidence that he is taking advantage of that haven for financial shenanigans, they do get a direct hit on his fellow cabinet member Todd Krakow (Danny Strong), the unctuous hedge funder turned treasury secretary. But just as Chuck returns from the Caymans with a crooked banker named Abington (played by the “Cosby Show” veteran Geoffrey Owens, always a welcome sight on the small screen), who is prepared to spill all he knows about Krakow’s conduct, Connerty and Sacker swoop in and whisk the witness away with F.B.I. backup. Of course, Chuck wanted Connerty to swipe the Krakow case, and in fact colluded with the garrulous and grasping Judge Adam DeGiulio (Rob Morrow) to help this happen. By taking the case, Connerty would sabotage his relationship with Jeffcoat, who would be virtually guaranteed to want to quash the investigation into his corrupt colleague. This is indeed what happens, but the result is the opposite of what Chuck had hoped. Connerty is crushed that he won’t be able to take out the treasury secretary, yes. But he and Jeffcoat both realize this was all the work of their common enemy, Chuck. Instead of dividing them, Rhoades’s ruse has brought them closer together. Bryan will likely need all the support he can get because amid all this maneuvering, he is also setting up a wiretap on Chuck and Charles Sr. Connerty believes, correctly, that Charles is doing dirty deeds to get a major land deal approved; he also believes, incorrectly, that Chuck is in on it. Will he find some other crime to prosecute — Chuck’s too-cosy relationship with Judge DeGiulio, perhaps — or will the whole thing blow up in his face? It’s tough to say. On this show it often pays to be paranoid. The question is, paranoid about what? Is it worse to overstep like Connerty, or to underestimate like many others? Wags, for example, is usually among the most cynical and suspicious characters of the bunch. But he is so blinded by his desire to look legit in the eyes of the city’s richest and most respectable financiers that he walks right into a gathering of their prestigious fraternity, in the full drag required of novices, without realizing his invitation was a setup by an old enemy. His promise of revenge is too profane for this publication even to paraphrase, but I’m quite sure it’s as sincere as it is hilarious. Wags’s boss, Bobby, also learns the hard way that he should have been more cautious. Turns out that during his brief hiatus from running his company, Taylor adjusted his contract with one of his proxy traders, Victor Mateo (Louis Cancelmi), to make their allegedly untraceable relationship a whole lot more traceable. Now Victor is in hot water for shady conduct with a research firm, and Axe could wind up boiling along with him. It’s “a Trojan Horse time bomb,” as Wags puts it. Bobby’s first attempt to defuse that time bomb is to ask Chuck to take over the case against Mateo and make it go away. But Rhoades realizes that all the heat on him from Connerty and Jeffcoat would only draw more attention to the matter, and begs off. So Axe is left with only one other option: buy the research firm to silence its chief executive, shut down Mateo’s firm to end its threat, and force Victor into what’s essentially indentured servitude, back with the grunts at Axe Cap. Axe has yet to make a meal of his top target, Taylor Mason, but not for lack of trying. At one point early in the episode, he and his black-ops guru, Hall, actually skulk around a rooftop across from one of Mason’s facilities, dressed in black and casing the joint like heroes in a Marvel-Netflix series. Taylor, of course, is aware of Axe’s vindictiveness; Doug Mason, the brainiac hedge-funder’s aerospace engineer father, has been made aware as well, and their joint business venture is closed up tight. Not tight enough, though. Under the guise of friendship, Wendy has resumed contact with Taylor — and begun combing through old therapy files, looking for a weakness to exploit. She finds one in Doug, whose failure has haunted his child for years. A not-so-chance meeting with Taylor’s right-hand man Mafee, whom Wendy is an old hand at manipulating, gives her enough info to determine which company the Masons are partnering with to make Doug’s dream a reality. Possibly venting the rage that she is prevented from taking out on her narcissistic husband, Wendy presents Axe with truly vicious plan: Instead of destroying Doug’s new venture himself, he can arrange things so that Taylor is the one who has to do the deed. The breach, and the damage to Taylor as a result, will be irreparable. So much of the pleasure of “Billions” lies in the skill with which its makers construct these byzantine schemes. But in the process of sorting through them, one can glide right by the seemingly less important moments that help make the show special. One is the return of Malin Akerman as Lara Axelrod, with whom Bobby finally cuts geographical ties. Another is the sight of Paul Giamatti with a safety pin through his nipple. And a thousand words could be written about Wags in drag. But in a way, this is fitting. A worldview in which life is all wins and losses, victories and defeats, giving a beating or taking one, requires so much scheming and scrambling that it’s easy to miss moments that matter.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Billions’ Season 4, Episode 7: Garbage People","Billions Wendy Rhoades really cares about her husband. In spite of his grasping ambition and her position in the crossfire during his now-ended war with her boss, and in spite of how Chuck outed them both as sadomasochists, she wants him to be happy. She hates that he has been made to suffer. But Wendy is suffering, too, which is one reason she wants to sell their home. When Chuck responded by divulging a story of emotional abuse from his childhood — in which the lesson from his mercurial father was that all women crave domination — Wendy was horrified, of course. She isn’t out to compound Chuck’s anguish by destabilizing his home. She is selling the house not to punish him, but to move beyond her own painful memories. And she’s probably doing it for his sake, as well. But Wendy’s thoughtfulness does not extend to everyone. Indeed, her mind can be a pretty dark place. One person she isn’t fooling is Mafee (a never-better Dan Soder), Bobby’s ex-employee who is now the lieutenant of his nemesis, Taylor Mason. He sees fully now that what was behind her smile wasn’t the benevolence of “some serene and wise teacher.” He screamed as much in full view of Bobby and everyone else at Axe Cap. “It hid a sick, vicious phony,” he shouts. “Now I know what you really are: a [expletive] monster.” As security halls the furious man away, in part to keep him and Dollar Bill from coming to blows, he closes out his tirade: “You’re a garbage person, Wendy! That’s what you are! That’s what you all are!” It was very, very difficult to come away from Sunday night’s ruthlessly cruel episode without drawing the same conclusion. For once, the plot of “Billions” was actually pretty simple to summarize: By faking a chance encounter with Mafee and renewing her therapeutically friendly relationship with Taylor, Wendy figured out in last week’s episode that the Mason family dynamic was its weak link. Turn Taylor against Doug, she surmised, and the whole edifice would collapse. So Bobby and Chuck this week formed a sort of bucket brigade of back stabbing, bribery and blackmail. Aided by a series of very funny cameos — the sight gag in which the towering Clancy Brown and the tiny Danny Strong stand at adjacent urinals is one for the ages — they induce the Bureau of Industry and Security Secretary (Chelcie Ross), a man known as Hard Bob, to shut down Doug’s aerospace project on national-security grounds. And all it took to persuade the secretary — an adult film enthusiast, of course (see: Hard Bob) — was the help of a few real-life porn stars: Lisa Ann, Cory Chase (Audrey Joyce Leon), and Rayveness (Gina-Raye Carter), adding three more cameos to the list. The choice left to Taylor was stark and simple: Mason Cap could stay committed to Doug’s project, mounting a quixotic challenge to the bureaucracy while hemorrhaging other clients who wanted no part of the battle; or it could pull the plug on the project, and on Doug, sending him packing with a check while selling his life’s work to the government. Taylor chose Plan B. Doug retreated in rage, furious that his dreams meant nothing to a child who had grown cold. Taylor was furious, too, taking his reaction as proof that he got back in touch only in hopes that his mega-rich and mega-smart kid could further his own ambitions. The firm is intact, but everyone involved is broken. It was pure disgust that moved the usually laid-back bro Mafee to storm into his old office and go berserk at the woman who helped manipulate the entire affair. Bobby being Bobby, he sees Mafee’s meltdown as a sign of success; the dinner party he throws after buying out his old pizzeria boss, Bruno, takes place later that night. That’s one way to process being a garbage person. But not everyone is so inured to her own garbage-ness. When the assembled merrymakers (including Axe’s estranged friend Freddie Aquafino, played by Noah Emmerich) bite into their slices, Wendy isn’t there. She has put her home on the market for real this time, complete with a freshly baked pie to, you guessed it, manipulate potential buyers. Chuck, who spends the episode embroiled in a cover-up over that gun permit he secured for a bigwig earlier in the season, is told by the real estate broker he can’t eat the pie. But he sure gets a mouthful of the symbolism. What does Wendy do instead of party? She runs through the night, compulsively, until Mafee’s words and her own guilt and pain catch up to her and she clutches a railing to cry. It’s awful to see this preternaturally composed and brilliant person break down. It’s also a tremendous payoff for the work Maggie Siff has done in creating Wendy’s aura: She may not have been invulnerable, but she always did come across as invincible. Not anymore. Directed by Laurie Collyer from a script by the series creators and showrunners Brian Koppelman and David Levien, Sunday’s episode showed the “Billions” crew at its worst. Often, we feel compelled to measure these characters by their best behavior, even when we know we shouldn’t — a testament to how well-drawn and well-acted these characters are. But this week challenged that good faith. Perhaps we shouldn’t be giving them so much benefit of the doubt after all. Right before Taylor finally saw through Wendy’s ruse and told her where to stick it, Wendy said that working for the “toxic, corrosive” Bobby was like working for “Shiva the Destroyer.” This was almost certainly an unconscious self-indictment. Like her boss and his minions, like her husband and his father, Wendy smiled, and smiled, and was a villain. She can’t outrun that. Can any of them?",The New York Times
2019,"Opinion | ‘Billy Budd,’ Tragically Charming the Boys for a Century","Melville’s novel and Britten’s opera are poignant reminders of the beauty and relevance of gay history. Mr. Belcher is an editor in the Hong Kong office of Opinion. Is “Billy Budd” the ultimate modern gay antihero who almost didn’t speak his name? This year marks the centennial of the random discovery of Herman Melville’s novella by a scholar who was researching a biography of the author, and for a century “Billy Budd” has been analyzed and theorized as the ultimate battle of innocence, envy, voyeurism and latent homosexuality. Or is it just a tragic tale of a ship full of lonely and smelly men who secretly lust after the doomed and unobtainable pretty boy? However it’s interpreted, a hundred years after its rebirth, Melville’s seafaring story is almost refreshing in its simplicity and shattering tragedy. In an era when the “Will & Grace” reboot constitutes a re-analysis of gay consciousness, the in-the-shadows subtleties of Melville’s tale are thrilling to ponder. And Benjamin Britten’s opera of “Billy Budd,” written more than 25 years after the novel was unearthed, returns to the Royal Opera in London this month in a new production that has mesmerized audiences in Madrid and Rome over the last few years. It’s a well-timed and well-oiled “Billy Budd,” directed by Deborah Warner with a keen sense of how delicate the story and its characters are. It shines — or, rather, softly refocuses — a light on the power of one man over the multitudes. It’s also sort of a homecoming since “Billy Budd” had its world premiere at the Royal in 1951 and remains one of the jewels in the crown of modern British opera, and also because it is quintessentially British. Melville wrote mostly of Americans on the high seas, most famously in “Moby-Dick,” but “Billy Budd” is about the English fighting the French during the Napoleonic wars, and Britten composed his work at a time when British modern opera was gaining global respect. Melville’s tale is streamlined and harsh in its tragedy. Billy, a merchant seaman forced to join the Royal Navy, lands on the warship Bellipotent in 1797 and instantly enters into an all-hands-on-deck bromance with his shipmates, except for John Claggart, the master at arms who resents and possibly lusts for Billy. Claggart, who you could say Melville describes as, well, easy to date, falsely accuses Billy of plotting a mutiny since he clearly has the admiration (or a somewhat more potent emotion) of the ship’s crewmen and seems to be galvanizing them in some way. When confronted by Claggart, in a moment of rage Billy lashes out and unintentionally kills him. Billy is court-martialed by a reluctant Captain Vere and sentenced to hang aboard the ship the next morning. The story’s final images of Billy marching to his execution — especially powerful in Britten’s opera amid haunting choral music from a cast of some 50 men — is perhaps the most poignant tragedy in Melville’s canon. We have this tale thanks to the Columbia professor Raymond M. Weaver, who discovered “Billy Budd” among Melville’s writings in 1919, 28 years after the author’s death, although Melville’s widow is thought to have done some editing and may have kept the novel secret. Fine-tuned and published in 1924, it was an instant classic on both sides of the Atlantic. But did Melville hide it intentionally? Although “Billy Budd” can be seen as another dreary tale of good-versus-evil masked as a tragic gay love story, its place in gay literary history is undeniable. The novel has long been thought of as Melville’s “coming out” book even though it lived in its own closet for nearly 30 years. But it is the opera “Billy Budd” and the 1962 film that sealed its place in gay history at a time when there was little such popular culture to hold onto. Consider the film: Noël Coward once said that Peter O’Toole was so pretty in “Lawrence of Arabia” that it could have been called “Florence of Arabia.” The same can be said of Terence Stamp in the film. He’s practically “Milly Budd.” The ship’s crewmen all fall in love with this Billy, and not necessarily in a sexual way. His beauty represents innocence and youth — perhaps even the hope of war’s end — on a ship full of clinically depressed seamen no doubt jaded by the Napoleonic wars and lousy food. The film, directed by Peter Ustinov (who also played Captain Vere), is a black-and-white postcard to male bonding, tension and loneliness. Billy’s story affects all of the characters because perhaps he represents the parts of them that have already died. And they must continue to face death and war after their beloved Billy has been taken from them. But “Billy Budd” the opera has long been seen as a true watershed moment in gay history. The tenor Peter Pears, Britten’s partner with whom he lived hidden in plain sight for decades, was the original Captain Vere. One of the writers of the libretto was E.M. Forster, no stranger to gay literature and the closet (read “Maurice,” intentionally published after his death, for stable boys climbing through young men’s bedroom windows). And the recent roster of opera stars who have played Billy is a beefcake roll call: Nathan Gunn, Rod Gilfry, Teddy Tahu Rhodes and Jacques Imbrailo, the dreamy South African baritone in the new Royal Opera production, which starts Tuesday and runs to May 10. There is also something refreshing about a chorus of men singing of their love for the doomed Billy, for whom they have pined during months at sea, as seen from the present-day perspective of Grindr hookups on shore leave. “Billy Budd” taps into male love that most men — gay, straight and all the blurred lines in between — often would rather avoid: how to express love over objectification, or affection that is deeper than a football slap on the shoulder or an “I love you, man!” moment after a couple of beers. Much has been written about the gay subtexts of Billy and his lusty shipmates, but as this production of “Billy Budd” proves, Melville’s hidden story haunts us to this day as the title character goes from the promise and power of youth to an unfairly doomed soul. It’s not just another one of the gay tragedies that defined so much of literature, theater and film in the 20th century. “Billy Budd” is grief acknowledged and deeply felt for a gay character — a rarity in the century after it was written. “Billy Budd” is not a dated piece of gay literature seen from an era where corporate sponsors turn Pride parades into beer stands. “Billy Budd” spawned a film and opera that took the story to new levels — and new audiences to analyze and interpret. Billy is not merely the gay character who dies at the end, but that blurred character between gay and straight that our world seems to be embracing more and more. He is, ultimately, the most modern and refreshing of gay characters: the pretty boy who got a bum rap and makes 50 guys weep openly when his exit music starts playing.

2019,‘Bitter Money’ and ‘Bitter Rice’: Migrant Workers Face Toil and Trouble,"No other filmmaker has been more immersed in the social upheavals of contemporary China than Wang Bing. Beginning with “Tie Xi Qu: West of the Tracks” (2003) a three-part, nine-hour look at the painful decline of a once-thriving industrial zone, the 52-year-old documentarian has consistently portrayed those dispossessed amid the changing landscape of his rapidly developing country. Dislocation is Wang’s great theme and the subject of “Bitter Money,” his 2016 portrait of young rural migrants who leave their villages for low-paying jobs in the booming garment factories of Huzhou. (The film, along with five of his other documentaries, is available on the new OVID.tv subscription streaming service.) Wang’s camera wanders among the lives of the men and women who have flocked to the sewing factories. Sensation precedes explanation. Using no narration in his fly-on-the-wall vérité, Wang resembles the American documentarian Frederick Wiseman. But where Wiseman explores institutions, Wang focuses on individuals. He follows them — into their workplaces and homes (often the same), recording their conversations and family relationships. Wang spent two years filming “Bitter Money,” maintaining that he shot 2,000 hours for this two-and-a-half-hour film. Working alone with a small digital video-camera customized with an autofocus lens, he seemingly blends into his subjects’ lives. Because he edits less and holds shots longer than more conventional documentarians, his films are akin to Warhol screen tests — full of revealing behavioral tics and transcendent empty moments. Wang’s presence is not exactly invisible but only occasionally addressed. “Time to sleep — you can film tomorrow,” one man tells him. One wonders if the existence of China’s extensive surveillance network has accustomed his subjects to this sort of attention. “Bitter Money” begins with a 15-year-old girl and her older cousin leaving Yunnan Province in southwestern China to find work in Huzhou. The quarter-hour or so that Wang devoted to their days-long journey on a crowded train is a film in its own right — a stolid pilgrimage into the future. The passengers seem to be in a state of suspended animation. Once in Huzhou, Wang finds other subjects at a workshop. In one sequence, he cuts from tailor to tailor, showing how the coats are made — but he is mainly observational. Wang does not flinch from recording a domestic quarrel in which the husband has to be restrained from attacking his wife. He devotes considerable camera time to the despair of an older, obviously intoxicated worker fingering a pair of scissors and vaguely harassing a female colleague as he delivers a rambling diatribe against their unseen boss. Working 12 hours a day, seven days a week, under unpleasant conditions, harsh lighting and intense time pressure, Wang’s subjects are essentially free agents hired by small entrepreneurs to fulfill a particular quota. In his book “Adam Smith in Beijing,” the sociologist Giovanni Arrighi describes these “hyper-exploited” young migrants as the “backbone of China’s export industries.” Given the monotony and deprivation of their lives, their economic uncertainty and the constant talk of money, the movie cannot be anything other than an indictment of China’s so-called socialist market economy. However local, “Bitter Money” is also universal. The spectacle of these men and women hunched over their sewing machines will not only resonate with those whose family histories include time working in a sweatshop, but anyone who reaps the benefit of inexpensive Chinese-manufactured clothing, which is to say, everyone. “Bitter Money” ends with a contemplation of the migrants’ alienated labor made material — the workshop’s output, bundled in plastic and forlornly waiting in the rain to be shipped overseas. That these products are intended for export reflects back on the movie. In a recent interview, Wang noted that because he refuses to submit his films for official approval, none have ever been shown commercially in China. WANG’S DESIRE to wrest a story out of daily existence and to acknowledge the struggle of making a living makes him heir to the Italian neorealist filmmakers of the 1940s and ’50s, including Giuseppe De Santis. His 1949 film “Bitter Rice,” available for streaming on the new subscription Criterion channel, is a fascinating example of neorealist pulp. It also concerns migrant workers. A story of the women, known as mondine, who harvest Italy’s rice crop, “Bitter Rice” begins like a documentary with a radio reporter outside the Turin train station, urgently describing the mondine’s annual migration to the rice paddies of the Po Valley. Their backbreaking work is amply acknowledged, but “Bitter Rice” is neorealism plus — a crime melodrama encompassing instances of theft, sabotage, rape, childbirth, references to abortion and multiple violent deaths, including one by suicide. It also features abundant pulchritude. When the movie opened in the United States in late 1950, The Los Angeles Times called it “something like a Hollywood women’s prison movie, only more so.” Following previous Italian hits “Open City” and “The Bicycle Thief” into the World Theater, a Times Square movie house specializing in imported films, “Bitter Rice” ran for months. The main attraction was the movie’s statuesque, sultry star Silvana Mangano as a teenage rice harvester introduced executing a solo boogie-woogie. Impulsive and naïve, she comes under the spell of a swaggering thief played by Vittorio Gassman, soon himself to achieve international recognition. “Bitter Rice” is an early example of globalist cinema. De Santis was a leftist whose sweeping panoramic shots of the hard-working and at times singing masses suggest Soviet celebrations of collective labor. He was also a fan of American movies; the two-fisted fight scenes are pure Hollywood. The movie’s frank sexuality, however, struck Americans as distinctly European. “Passion toils and tumbles through it like the wrestlers in a gas-house free-for-all, and torments of carnal hunger are boldly and rawly exposed,” the New York Times critic Bosley Crowther wrote in his enthusiastic review. This is undoubtedly why “Bitter Rice” — which, according to Time magazine, would gross nearly $8 million in the United States — was criticized by the American Legion as “a serious threat to Christian morality.” Linked by William Mooring, the film critic for the Catholic journal Tidings, to the international Communist conspiracy, it was briefly banned in Albany, but also nominated for an Academy Award.",The New York Times

The world presented in “Blowin’ Up,” Stephanie Wang-Breal’s vérité dive into a progressive courtroom in Queens, is an overwhelmingly female one. Presided over by the benevolent Judge Toko Serita, this haven for women accused of prostitution-related crimes (officially known as the Human Trafficking Intervention Court) swarms with female lawyers, counselors and, in the judge’s words, “a very understanding” assistant district attorney. Understanding is something of a watchword here, as are kindness, respect and a complete lack of condemnation. “How are you today?” a smiling Serita asks her anxious, primarily nonwhite defendants. Many are undocumented Asian immigrants who have been trafficked into the massage-parlor business and have had their passports confiscated. Working in partnership with organizations like Girls Educational and Mentoring Services, Serita offers counseling sessions followed by dismissal of charges. Punishment is never mentioned; instead, the focus is on education and assistance for those who want to leave the life. Not all of them can. Filming from 2015 to early 2017, Wang-Breal and her cinematographer, Erik Shirai, immerse us in the cheery bustle of the courtroom and the busy hallways outside. Discreetly eavesdropping on counseling sessions as clients divulge often heartbreaking personal details, the filmmakers eschew narration in favor of a more fragmented, naturalistic approach. This can be as frustrating as it is fascinating. Yet “Blowin’ Up” (the term is used to describe the act of leaving a pimp) suggests that, in a compassionate society, this is what justice would look like — a hopeful tone that’s ultimately tempered as the Trump presidency begins and ICE starts to apprehend clients. “It’s just too big,” one weary counselor says of the trafficking business that claims so many victims. “It’s too big.” When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Breakthrough’ Review: A Remarkable Story of Survival, Told Through a Religious Lens","Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. In January 2015, 14-year-old John Smith fell through the frozen surface of a lake in St. Charles, Mo., and remained submerged for 15 minutes. He had no pulse when emergency workers pulled him from the freezing water, or for nearly 45 minutes after; it was reportedly only after audible prayers by his mother, Joyce, that his heart finally started up again. And over the next several days, as his community vigorously prayed for him, the young man made a full, seemingly impossible recovery. Roxann Dawson’s faith-based film, “Breakthrough,” tells the story of John’s miraculous ordeal with an unassuming simplicity, focusing on the harrowing details of the case without an overreliance on proselytization. Though faith is ever-present — particularly through the devotion of Joyce (Chrissy Metz) and the town’s struggling young pastor (Topher Grace), who remain with John (Marcel Ruiz) every step of the way — the film also wisely dedicates plenty of screen time to the emergency workers and doctors struggling to bring the boy back to life. Here, religion is not in contention with medicine, but seems to work in tandem with it. The filmmaking may at times be direct and inelegant, but “Breakthrough” isn’t without nuance. Dawson (a TV veteran directing her first feature film) doesn’t sidestep the thorny issue of selective miracles — after returning to school, John wrestles with the fact that he was spared from death while many others aren’t. “Breakthrough” is more suggestive than evangelical, and its willingness to let the mystery of the young man’s survival linger enhances the film’s power.

Carmine Street Guitars, in its current Greenwich Village location since 1990, is one of the jewels of a fast-dissolving bohemian Manhattan. Rick Kelly, its proprietor and luthier, makes his electric guitars from resonant wood he’s snatched from older buildings around town. Several scenes in this warm and affectionate documentary depict him realizing a long-held dream: that of carving an ax out of a plank from McSorley’s Ale House. Working with the writer Len Blum, the director Ron Mann (“Comic Book Confidential”) sets the action over the course of a week in the life of the shop, giving the owner, his co-workers and various visitors (some famed in the world of music, others not) opportunities to talk craft and to philosophize about the values of community the shop embodies. While this approach yields results that are sometimes a little stilted, the movie is mostly as sweet as it is informative. Although one of the many luminaries in pictures on the wall of Kelly’s shop is Les Paul, the design Kelly favors for his own guitars derives from Leo Fender, specifically his spartan Telecaster. “Hard to beat a Tele,” the guitar giant Bill Frisell quietly enthuses as he prepares to play a Kelly design. Frisell’s subsequent rendition of “Surfer Girl” is persuasive. Kelly is shown quietly working with his friend and apprentice Cindy Hulej, who enhances Kelly’s designs with wood-burned art — she’s the one who places the McSorley’s logo on Kelly’s ale house-plank instrument. Midweek, Hulej sees that the building next door is up for sale. Soon after, a friendly real estate agent stops by to inquire about Kelly’s space.

2019,‘Catastrophic’ Delays at U.S.-Mexico Border Follow Redeployment of Agents,"CIUDAD JUÁREZ, Mexico — Near dawn on Friday, the line of trucks waiting to cross the border from Mexico into the United States stretched for more than three miles and wasn’t moving. Arturo Ornelas, a Mexican truck driver, was four places from the front, but his choice position had not come without sacrifice: He had joined the line at 8 a.m. Thursday and had spent the intervening 22 hours slouched in — or stretching his legs alongside — his truck, carrying a load of copper wire from a factory in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, to a warehouse in neighboring El Paso. But now his goal was finally, seemingly within reach, and he could see the twinkling lights of the American city through the nearby border fence, on the other side of the Puente Libre, or Free Bridge. “So close,” he muttered, “yet so far.” President Trump may have relented Thursday on his threat to close the southwest border of the United States in punishment for what he has said was Mexico’s failure to control illegal migration. But for a week now the border has, in effect, been partly closed because of American staffing shortages — costing businesses millions of dollars a day, according to industry officials, and causing painfully long delays for people and goods trying to legally cross the border. Last week, the Trump administration announced it was pulling 750 border agents from their normal assignments at specific ports of entry on the border, and reassigning them to help process the surge in migrants who have been crossing the border illegally and seeking asylum. The redeployments have caused slowdowns in inspections — for passenger and commercial traffic — at key crossings along the border, including between Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego; Nogales, Mexico, and Nogales, Ariz.; and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, and Laredo, Tex. The delays, which began on March 29, have been particularly severe for trucks delivering commercial goods from Mexico to the United States, with long waits fouling up production and delivery schedules on both sides of the border. According to the United States Chamber of Commerce, nearly $1.7 billion in goods and services flow across the border every day. Mexican trucking industry officials and other business leaders have reported millions of dollars a day in lost commerce and extra costs associated with the delays. Some companies in Mexico have been forced to slow or halt production as a result of the delivery delays, they said. Some firms have even resorted to shipping their products by air despite the significantly higher costs, Manuel Sotelo, a national vice president of the National Chamber of Freight Transportation in Mexico, said Friday. Business and labor leaders have warned that if the delays persist, they could lead to the cancellation of contracts and to widespread layoffs. Mr. Sotelo summed up the impact in one word: “Catastrophic.” The hardship has been particularly severe in Ciudad Juárez, a border city and major industrial center with more than 300 assembly plants covering a range of industries, including auto parts, cellphones, computers and household electronics. “In Danger, 280,000 Factory Jobs,” the front-page headline of El Diario, a newspaper in the city, announced on Friday. In a letter to President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico on Friday, the Ciudad Juárez chapter of the Business Coordinating Council estimated that late deliveries would cost Mexican firms $2.1 million in overtime per day. The council also estimated that delays for trucks crossing from Ciudad Juárez to El Paso had stretched to eight hours on average. But many truckers were reporting far longer waits. Mr. Sotelo, who owns a trucking company, said that on Wednesday he dispatched 15 tractor-trailers to one of the crossings between Ciudad Juárez and El Paso. When they arrived, at about 3:30 a.m., there were already 200 other trucks in line. Twelve of his trucks were able to cross, barely making the cutoff at 11 p.m. when the crossing closed for the night. The other three had to wait until the following day. Under normal circumstances, he said, a truck can cross the border here within two hours. Business leaders said the only other border crisis that approached this one in severity was provoked by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. “After that, we had waits of up to six hours during the following days,” Mr. Sotelo said. “Today we are three times worse.” Luis Aguirre Lang, president of Index, a national manufacturing and export industry group, accused Mr. Trump of taking the Mexican and American private sectors “hostage” to put political pressure on Mexico. “We are worried,” he said. The Trump administration has characterized its redeployment of agents as a necessary step in dealing with an urgent crisis, especially in the region around Ciudad Juárez and El Paso, which has been in the vortex of the illegal migration debate. The United States Border Patrol’s El Paso sector — which covers a 268-mile stretch of border through the two westernmost counties of Texas, including El Paso, and New Mexico — has seen a huge surge in unauthorized migrants trying to cross. This cause, and the resulting effects, came into sharp focus shortly after dawn on Friday for Héctor Núñez, a driver with a Mexican trucking company. He and his rig were in the middle of the three-mile line of trucks waiting to cross the Free Bridge into El Paso. He was killing time with a colleague outside their trucks, parked along a highway that runs along the Rio Grande, when suddenly they noticed something unfolding on the other side of the river, along the border fence. At a gap in the fence, more than two dozen migrants were sitting in a row in the dirt, with several Border Patrol officials standing over them. In recent weeks, undocumented migrants, often seeking asylum in the United States, have waded across the river, barely a trickle of septic water in this location, and presented themselves to the American authorities permanently guarding the gap. Mr. Núñez, 54, understood that this sort of unauthorized crossing between legal ports of entry was precisely what was contributing to the extraordinary delays he was enduring this week. But he doled out his criticisms widely. He blamed Mr. Trump for “choking us” with his brand of politics. He blamed his own president, Mr. López Obrador, for not doing enough to halt illegal migration through Mexico. And he blamed the migrants for using Mexico as a “trampoline” to the United States, illustrating his remark with a bunny hop. But he also said he could empathize with the migrants. “It’s a dream that everyone has,” he said. Mr. Núñez gestured toward El Paso. “My dream is one day to have a tractor-trailer on that side,” he said. “Some day I want to arrive in the United States and say, ‘I’m an American truck driver!’ That’s my dream.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Chasing Portraits’ Review: Seeking Art Lost During the Holocaust,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “Chasing Portraits” is about a search. Yet the most affecting parts of this documentary come with the realization that some things may never be found. Elizabeth Rynecki, here directing her first feature, grew up surrounded by paintings made by her great-grandfather Moshe Rynecki, who died in 1943 in a concentration camp. He produced about 800 pieces in his life, many of them scenes from his Jewish community in Poland. His works were scattered during the war; dozens are now in museums, others are in private collections. Ms. Rynecki has endeavored for years to catalog the art works, and this film follows her to Canada, Poland and Israel as she tracks down several of them and speaks with, or is rebuffed by, their current owners. Her investigations are interesting, especially when questions arise over possibly looted art. But as she encounters obstacles to learning more about Moshe and his paintings, the scenes turn increasingly poignant. Her interviewees’ memories are flawed or fading; stories are misremembered or withheld, or lost to the passage of time. She herself regrets not asking her grandparents more questions about their Holocaust experiences while they were alive. Her father has fewer qualms — he says that his painful past is best forgotten. “Chasing Portraits” is small and subtle, with some missed opportunities and occasionally inexpert filmmaking. But it’s not an insignificant effort, and Ms. Rynecki’s cause is admirable. “The survivors will one day all be gone. And the history will grow a bit fainter, a bit more difficult to see,” she says. For her family, though, there is a measure of solace. “The paintings are survivors, too. And they speak volumes of a world that once was.” When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.",The New York Times
2019,‘China’s Manhattan’ Borrowed Heavily. The People Have Yet to Arrive.,"A largely empty urban district struggling with billions of dollars in debt demonstrates the breakdown of the Chinese economic growth model. TIANJIN, China — At a port in Germany, 150 Steinway pianos are waiting to be shipped to this gateway city for the grand opening of the Juilliard School’s second campus. The air in Tianjin is so dry that the pianos will require climate-controlled rooms, helping to nearly double the cost of the state-of-the-art campus to $225 million. The extra money is not coming from Juilliard. The local government is footing the bill. And that could become a problem for officials struggling with debt after an epic spending spree to develop a new commercial center from scratch. Welcome to Yujiapu Financial District, which promotes itself as China’s Manhattan, but may better be seen as a monument to the breakdown of the Chinese growth model. Four-fifths of the office space stands empty. Construction on other buildings has stopped, leaving skeletons in the sky. A sprawling mall has few shoppers. Inside, a pet store has no animals. The businesses and residents that local officials had hoped to attract have yet to show up. Juilliard, which is expected to draw in students and their families, will open its doors next fall, a rare Western institution taking a chance on this district. Zhang Zhiyi works as a recruiter for an online education company in a nearby office building. The lonely landscape has translated into a good deal for commercial renters: New tenants get a full year rent-free. Deals abound, the 28-year-old said: “The other buildings aren’t really full, either.” Chinese local governments are swimming in debt. By official accounts, that debt totals $4.5 trillion. By unofficial estimates, it could be as large as $10 trillion. No one knows for sure because much of the borrowing for projects like the Tianjin Juilliard campus is rarely disclosed. China has long borrowed heavily to build and then counted on breakneck economic growth to pay it back. The script: Sell vast amounts of land to developers, borrow to subsidize construction, and jobs and new cities will result. It was a model that helped China build its skyscrapers and high-speed rail lines and ushered in an era of prosperity. But China is not growing as fast as it used to, and it is not clear that the “build it and they will come” model will save Yujiapu and other places with big debts. The national government now must find other ways to spur growth — without making the debt problem worse. “China’s economy has depended on building for the future, and there are considerable signs that they have overbuilt,” said Logan Wright, director of China research at Rhodium Group, a consulting firm, adding that debt and overcapacity could hold back growth. “That probably means much slower economic growth in the next decade compared to China’s recent path,” he said. Tianjin government officials did not respond to a request for comment. Tianjin, a coastal city just a short train ride from Beijing, had one of the highest growth rates in China. Its success made headlines, and local officials credited “Tianjin spirit, Tianjin speed and Tianjin benefits.” Then the economy slowed. And local officials in the Binhai New Area, a special economic zone of Tianjin that includes Yujiapu, admitted they overstated growth. They slashed $50 billion from its original figure for 2016, bringing economic output to $100 billion. Today, Tianjin is one of the slowest-growing regions of China and one of the most financially troubled. By the broadest measure of borrowing in China, called total social financing, Tianjin’s government, corporations and households owe more than $760 billion, according to an estimate by Rhodium Group. The annual interest owed by all borrowers in Tianjin totaled 12 times its annual nominal economic growth, Rhodium said, citing the most recent numbers. If Yujiapu really is the Manhattan of China, it has a way to go to catch up to the real thing. Its avenues, some nearly as wide as Broadway, are eerily quiet. Many buildings just a few blocks from the Tianjin Juilliard School remain unfinished. The finished ones are mostly empty. On one recent weekday visit, the door to the sales office for a hulking, unfinished residential building several blocks from the Juilliard campus blew open in the wind. No one was inside. Many of the six-lane roads in the city lack crosswalk lights, in part because they are not needed. Across the Hai River from Yujiapu is another ghostlike district, Xiangluowan, where the local government encouraged private Chinese developers to build on their own dime. They did, but no one came. Dozens of the buildings in this district are now collateral for huge overdue loans that are being held by local banks. For now, Tianjin can continue to borrow for projects like the Juilliard campus because it has a powerful patron in Beijing, said Victor Shih, an associate professor at the University of California, San Diego, and an expert on the Chinese economy. That official, He Lifeng, was once the No. 2 Communist Party official in Tianjin. Mr. He now heads the central government agency that approves all major development projects, meaning he can authorize banks to lend more money to Tianjin. “If the political will collapses for the Binhai area, then the bank loans will begin to dry up and the whole area is in trouble,” Mr. Shih said. Officials at the National Development and Reform Commission, the agency where Mr. He works, did not respond to a request for comment. Despite the empty buildings, the local government keeps borrowing. Last year, Tianjin and entities related to the local government raised $36 billion through new loans, according to data from the People’s Bank of China, the country’s central bank. Many residents believe Yujiapu’s problems have been overstated and try to cast its emptiness in a positive light. Mr. Zhang, who works for the online recruiter, said technology companies looking for alternatives to expensive places like Beijing and the southern city of Shenzhen could find Tianjin attractive. “Now, there are quite a lot of internet companies, including some e-commerce platforms,” he said, speculating that these companies could move into his building in the future. Michael Hart, a real estate consultant in Tianjin, said a resurgence of growth could save the city from its problems. “It’s like going to see a five-act play,” Mr. Hart said, referring to Yujiapu’s critics, “and you’re halfway through Act 1 and calling it a lousy play.” For Alexander Brose, the chief executive of the Tianjin Juilliard School, the district will soon benefit from the prestige of the Juilliard name to attract people. On a recent day, he toured the construction site, pointing to what he expected to see next year. Here, a 687-seat concert hall, he said. Over there, a recital space that can hold 299 people. And in the corner, a 250-seat black box theater. He paused, looking at the hundreds of construction workers welding, hammering and moving steel, and said, referring to the local government, “I think they are looking at this as a feather in the cap of this new project.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Christ Stopped at Eboli’: An Italian Saga Returns in Full,"Rewind Carlo Levi’s memoir, “Christ Stopped at Eboli,” was a literary sensation in post-Fascist Italy. First published in 1945, the book is Levi’s memorable account of life among impoverished Italian villagers in the 1930s. Three decades later, an immersive and engaging film adaptation directed by Francesco Rosi enshrined the book’s underlying neorealist credo — giving voice to the voiceless. Originally made for Italian television as a 220-minute mini-series, Rosi’s “Christ Stopped at Eboli” was shown in the United States in 1980 at approximately half its length and under the title “Eboli.” Considering the significance of the book and the stature of the director, the American theatrical premiere of the full version, now at Film Forum, is an event. Levi, a painter, doctor and man of letters in his native Turin, was forced into exile in the southern hinterlands as a punishment for his anti-Fascist activities. In the mid-1930s, as Italy prepared to invade Ethiopia, he was sent to a small town he calls Gagliano; his account of his yearlong stay there was written years later, in Florence, while he was hiding from the Gestapo. The book’s title comes from a local saying about Gagliano’s isolation: Eboli is the last station on the train from the north; not even Christ cared to venture this far south. “Christ Stopped at Eboli” was published the year World War II ended. At the same time, Roberto Rossellini’s “Rome, Open City” heralded a new naturalistic Italian cinema, and like that movie, Levi’s memoir was an international success. A front-page essay in The New York Times Book Review described it as sui generis, by turns “a diary, an album of sketches, a novelette, a sociological study and a political essay.” Rosi gives “Eboli” a more straightforward narrative, juxtaposing everyday fascism with Gagliano’s archaic ways, a populist historical pageant where modernity meets the medieval ages. The movie was shot on location in the region where the book is set. Levi (Gian Maria Volontè) finds himself in a starkly beautiful and backward place, a crumbling town of cavelike quarters. The superstitious peasants, largely played by local people, live with their animals and a host of unseen presences — skittish angels, the mischievous spirits of unbaptized infants and Mussolini, the godlike figure who addresses them on the radio. Soon after Levi’s sister (Lea Massari) comes from Turin to visit, encouraging him to be engaged with his new neighbors, the movie erupts with ideas. If the first half suggests the neorealist Rossellini of “Paisan” in showing the condition of life in Gagliano, the second half is closer in spirit to his TV biopics, like “Socrates,” in allowing the people to hold forth on their various philosophies. As Levi comes to understand the peasants’ way of thinking, the movie becomes a series of disquisitions — including a drunken priest’s Christmas Eve sermon opposing the Ethiopian war. Ironically, it’s this victory in Africa that frees Levi to return home under a general amnesty. A brief coda shows him back in Turin, pondering his experience. “This is a movie that repeatedly sends its audience back to the book on which it is modeled,” Janet Maslin wrote in her Times review of “Eboli.” That’s not necessarily bad, particularly if the book is as rich as Levi’s. But midway through, Rosi’s movie is fully its own thing — a 20th-century saga played out in a remote backwater and compressed into a single year.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Cobra Kai,’ YouTube’s ‘Karate Kid’ Update, Returns for Another Round","Ask a Showrunner When “Cobra Kai” debuted last year, it sounded like a one-off joke: a YouTube series catching up with the characters from the cornball-classic 1984 film “The Karate Kid.” Yet the series packed a surprising emotional punch as it traced how the original climactic showdown between the underdog Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) and the bully Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka), of the militaristic titular dojo, continues to influence their lives — and those of their children. The 10-episode first season knocked out critics, earning a rare 100 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Its earnest tone seemed all the more surprising given the lowbrow comic credits of the creators: Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg wrote the “Harold & Kumar” films, while Josh Heald penned “Hot Tub Time Machine” and its sequel. Ahead of Season 2’s debut on Wednesday, Hurwitz, Schlossberg and Heald waxed on and off with The Times. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. How did you come to revive “The Karate Kid” in the first place? JON HURWITZ The three of us have been friends for over 20 years. We were huge “Karate Kid” fans and bonded over it. We pitched our thoughts [to Overbrook Entertainment, which owned the rights] and got their blessing immediately. We sat down with William Zabka and convinced him, and then it was all about convincing Ralph Macchio. It was never designed to be a straight comedy. It was always meant to be more dramatic, and to give Johnny the “Better Call Saul” treatment. How did you flesh out a one-dimensional character like Johnny? And why did you make him a down-and-out, divorced father while Daniel is a hugely successful, happily married car dealer? JOSH HEALD We loved the idea there is this long-festering karate rivalry from high school that had landed both of these adults in different places: one atop the mountain and one down in the valley. The comedy comes from frustration, regret and revenge, and that bleeds into the next generation. We position Johnny as a relic, somebody who is stuck in his time and doesn’t get along with the millennial generation. Did you study the original films before you started writing the series? HAYDEN SCHLOSSBERG We were such huge fans of the original three movies, we didn’t have to, although we did anyway. The goal is never to consciously reference the movies when we’re writing. It’s to write the characters as they are today. Those movies are their pasts, so it’s an organic way to show footage from the original films when one of the characters is having a moment of regret. But it doesn’t feel like nostalgia for the sake of nostalgia. Are you primarily writing this show for “Karate Kid” fans? HEALD We’re always writing with a true respect, appreciation and reverence for the source material, and we know there are a lot of “Karate Kid” superfans out there who relate to this story. But we also wanted to write for a larger audience that doesn’t know “The Karate Kid Part III” intimately. What kind of feedback do you get from fans? HURWITZ We all hear a lot of stories from parents who are able to watch the show with their kids, which is new to us, since we came from the world of R-rated comedies. It’s been an entry point for a new generation to watch the original films. Do you consciously try to balance Daniel’s and Johnny’s stories with their kids’ stories? HURWITZ We don’t look at it in a binary way. These stories are interwoven through that initial rivalry between Johnny and Daniel. That said, it was crucial to us to create a whole new generation of characters that an audience is going to fall in love with the way we fell in love with Johnny and Daniel back in the day. Macchio and Zabka are co-executive producers on the show. How much input do they have? HEALD We’re really grateful to have them because they are so connected to these characters. Every day of their lives when they walk down the street, somebody shouts one of the phrases from the movies to them. It was a very delicate process of entering this relationship. They’re not in the writers’ room day to day, but we have a lot of discussions. Why did you decide to wait until the end of Season 1 to bring back Cobra Kai’s original sensei, the fearsome John Kreese (Martin Kove)? HEALD We didn’t want to put the whole buffet out there and say, “Let’s get everybody.” So it’s been a calculated approach in terms of when and if certain characters come back. We sat down with Martin before Season 1 and told him our plan, and thus began the hardest job he ever had, which was keeping that secret for nine months. We told him, “It’s going to be a real moment when you arrive that will change the shape of the show.” Any chance we’ll see more old characters return, like Daniel’s ex-girlfriend Ali, played by Elisabeth Shue? HEALD There’s always hope that any character from the movies may return in the series. We have love for all the actors from the movies. We have a lot of long-range plans for how and when certain characters would show up, but we can’t comment now. Bullying has changed since the ’80s. How are you dealing with that? SCHLOSSBERG In some ways, bullying is exactly the same and in other ways, it’s far worse because you have social media. What we wanted to do on the show is have moments that a young audience today can relate to but that also will stand the test of time. Our approach is not just showing how much bullying sucks, but also showing kids trying to do something about it. It’s not just through physical strength, but inner strength. Still, there are fight scenes in every episode. Do you worry about glorifying violence among high school kids? HURWITZ Part of our approach to the fight scenes is also the consequences afterward. We don’t just have a fight scene and then brush it aside and there’s no lasting effect. We explore the results of these fights — the emotional and physical impact. These fights aren’t just happening in a vacuum. They’re all part of a bigger story. Want exclusive “Thrones” interviews and news, as well as the internet’s best articles on that week’s episode? Sign up for our Season 8 newsletter here. The show features some wicked ’80s tunes. How important is the soundtrack? HURWITZ Music has always been a huge part of the “Karate Kid” franchise, starting with Bill Conti’s score, which is so memorable. But the needle drops are also fun because Johnny is still stuck in the ’80s. HEALD Ninety percent of the songs from Season 1 were on the pages of the script. We’re very passionate about the musical touchstones of the show. We’ve been very fortunate that we’ve been able to license almost every song we’ve asked for, with a couple of glaring exceptions that were way too expensive. Any you can mention? HEALD Those iconic bands you’ve really got to open up the pocketbooks for — the Guns ‘N’ Roses and Metallicas of the world. So REO Speedwagon is more affordable? HEALD They’re not cheap either, but you have to pick and choose. How long do you see this show running? SCHLOSSBERG We have an end in mind for the story we’re telling. In terms of how many seasons, we’ve mapped out a few years ahead. HURWITZ We can’t put a number on it, but we can say: fewer than “The Simpsons.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘Coronation Street,’ Long-Running British Soap, Introduces Its First Black Family","LONDON — “Coronation Street,” Britain’s (and the world’s) longest-running soap opera, which has chronicled working-class life near Manchester, England, since 1960, is introducing the first black family in the history of the series. “Say hello to the Bailey family,” the show’s producers said in an announcement on Saturday. “A brand-new family moving to Weatherfield in June this year!” they added, referring to the fictional town based on Salford, an industrial city about two miles west of the center of Manchester. The announcement did not address the family’s race or ethnicity, but the show’s network, ITV, said the black family would be the show’s first. To many observers, the addition, while welcome, came astonishingly late for a show, known as “Corrie,” that debuted in December 1960 and that has been watched by up to a third of the British public — including, reports say, Queen Elizabeth II. “How have the producers managed to get away with this for almost 60 years?” Matthew Xia, a theater director, told The Guardian, saying he was stunned it had taken so long for the show to reflect Manchester’s multicultural character. “It’s about time, a street right in the heart of Manchester and they’ve never had a black family live there,” one Twitter user, Carly Purland-Goodey, wrote on Saturday. For decades, the set where the show was filmed was in central Manchester. In the 1970s and ’80s, the show was broadcast in the United States, first on public television to a lukewarm reception, and then on cable. The show’s producer, Ian MacLeod, told ITV News that he did not know why the soap took so long to introduce a black family. “Manchester has a large proportion of black residents, so it did feel sort of overdue we did this and represented modern Manchester a bit more accurately,” Mr. MacLeod said. “Coronation Street” has had individual characters who are black or members of other racial and ethnic groups before. In 2013, a character of Pakistani origin appeared, followed shortly by members of his family, the Nazirs. (In 2016, Marc Anwar, who portrayed the father, Sharif Nazir, was fired over anti-India posts on Twitter.) The series, based on the residents of fictional Coronation Street, has been a British favorite for years alongside “EastEnders,” set in East London, and “Emmerdale,” set in Yorkshire. The story lines revolve around lives that viewers can easily identify with and have produced quotations and characters that are firmly engraved in British culture. The shows have given rise to some of the most popular television celebrities in the country, including Pat Phoenix, who played the glamorous Elsie Tanner on “Coronation Street,” and Barbara Windsor, who appeared as Peggy Mitchell, the protective pub owner in “EastEnders.” Both shows are so iconic that they appear in guides to British culture that applicants for citizenship have to study to take the test. “Coronation” was anointed the world’s longest-running TV soap when “As the World Turns” aired its last episode in 2010 on CBS, according to the Guinness World Records. In recent years, soap operas have seen a decline in viewership, according to a report published in 2018 by the Office of Communications, or Ofcom, Britain’s telecom regulator. In 2007, “EastEnders,” “Coronation Street” and “Emmerdale” averaged 8.7 million viewers among them. By 2017, that figure had dropped to 6.9 million, the report said. In contrast with the aspirational settings and improbable plots of American soaps, the British shows have lured viewers by portraying daily life with all its difficulties, such as joblessness, poverty and raising children as single parents. Still, their plot lines have been criticized for being nostalgic for a bygone era and tone-deaf to the changes in modern Britain. The addition of the new family to “Coronation Street” appeared to be an attempt to address those issues, especially with the character of James Bailey, the 19-year-old younger son played by Nathan Graham. A talented footballer, the character will face the challenges of coming out as gay to his family and teammates. The rest of the family includes the father, Edison, a builder, played by Trevor Michael Georges; the mother, Aggie, a pharmacy assistant, played by Lorna Laidlaw; and the older son, Michael, played by Ryan Russell. The new family will make its debut on the show in June.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | ‘Curious Eyes Never Run Dry’,"The government charged Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, not with publishing classified government information, but with stealing it, skirting — for now — critical First Amendment questions. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. The arrest in London of the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange ends one bizarre saga, but opens a legal drama that is likely to stretch over many years and could probe uncharted areas of press freedoms and national security in the United States in the digital era. There is good reason to be watchful as the case unfolds. Mr. Assange, a 47-year-old Australian, had spent almost seven years holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy, initially to avoid arrest by Swedish authorities in a sexual assault investigation that has since been dropped, then British charges of skipping bail. But extradition to the United States was what Mr. Assange really feared, and what the cat-and-mouse game was always about. It was in the United States that the materials posted on WikiLeaks created the greatest furor, first through the publication of a trove of classified documents supplied by an Army private, Chelsea Manning, and then by releasing material stolen from the computers of Hillary Clinton’s campaign. The Obama administration was wary of pursuing Mr. Assange because WikiLeaks was essentially involved in investigative work common to a free press. But the Trump administration saw Mr. Assange and WikiLeaks as targets as soon as it took office. (Mr. Trump loved WikiLeaks in 2016 when it was embarrassing top officials of the Clinton campaign.) Two years ago, as director of the C.I.A., Mike Pompeo labeled WikiLeaks “a nonstate hostile intelligence service” after it released a cache of C.I.A. hacking tools. Efforts got underway then to build a case against Mr. Assange. This was confirmed through an inadvertent mention in a federal court filing last November. Mr. Assange, meanwhile, managed to exhaust his welcome at the Ecuadorean Embassy, and on Thursday British police officers unceremoniously bundled the scraggly-bearded refugee off in a van. Soon after, Scotland Yard acknowledged that it was also acting on an American extradition warrant, after which a federal indictment was unsealed in the United States charging Mr. Assange with conspiring to hack a government computer. The single charge is straightforward: It alleges that Mr. Assange helped the Army private break into a government computer in 2010 to steal classified and sensitive documents. According to the indictment, when Ms. Manning told Mr. Assange that she had no more material to send him, he replied, “Curious eyes never run dry in my experience.” Ms. Manning served almost seven years of a 35-year sentence for the leak, and is now back in jail for refusing to testify before a grand jury investigating WikiLeaks. The still-unproven charge is far less contentious than had it been, as widely anticipated, for espionage-related crimes. That would have been a direct challenge to the distinction between a journalist exposing abuse of power through leaked materials — something traditional newspapers like The Times do all the time — and a foreign agent seeking to undermine the security of the United States through theft or subterfuge. These questions will arise in any event — starting with the extradition hearings, at which Mr. Assange’s lawyers are likely to argue that the American charges are politically motivated. And if Britain does extradite him, there is no certainty that the Trump administration, with its combative stance toward the press and its documented recent antipathy for Mr. Assange, will not throw more charges at him. The issues WikiLeaks raises are vitally important. The responsibilities, ethics and rules of journalism are fast changing in an era when terabytes of secret data can be dumped in a flash, and when hostile governments like Russia’s can burrow into foreign computers for compromising information and then launder it through other channels. The case of Mr. Assange, who got his start as a computer hacker, illuminates the conflict of freedom and harm in the new technologies, and could help draw a sharp line between legitimate journalism and dangerous cybercrime. Once in the United States, moreover, he could become a useful source on how Russia orchestrated its attacks on the Clinton campaign. The administration has begun well by charging Mr. Assange with an indisputable crime. But there is always a risk with this administration — one that labels the free press as “the enemy of the people” — that the prosecution of Mr. Assange could become an assault on the First Amendment and whistle-blowers. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some tips. And here’s our email: letters@nytimes.com. Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram. An earlier version of this editorial said that Julian Assange sought refuge in the Ecuadorean Embassy to avoid arrest on sex charges in Sweden that have since been dropped.

2019,‘Curse of La Llorona’ Is No. 1 as Box Office Braces for More ‘Avengers’,"With “Avengers: Endgame” positioned to wipe out any competitors come Friday, only a couple of studios dared to roll out new movies this weekend. It worked fairly well for both of them. Warner Bros.’s “The Curse of La Llorona,” the latest horror movie from some of the producers of the popular “Conjuring” series, topped the domestic box office with $26.5 million in ticket sales. That’s a solid start; the movie reportedly cost just $9 million to make. While it pales in comparison to the $53.5 million that “The Nun,” a recent “Conjuring” offshoot, made during its opening weekend in September, it is above the roughly $21 million opening weekend that analysts expected for “La Llorona.” Directed by Michael Chaves, “La Llorona” stars Linda Cardellini as Anna, a widow. The plot involves Anna and her two children, Chris (Roman Christou) and Sam (Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen), being haunted by La Llorona (Marisol Ramirez), a weeping woman based on a figure associated with Mexican folklore. In her review for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis called the movie “an enjoyably old-fashioned ghost story.” [Read our critic’s review of “The Curse of La Llorona.”] Warner Bros. also took the No. 2 spot with its lighthearted superhero movie “Shazam!,” which brought in $17.3 million during its third weekend. Its domestic gross is now $121.3 million. The other new movie this weekend was Fox’s faith-based “Breakthrough,” which landed in third place with $11.1 million. Based on a 2015 incident in which a Missouri teenager survived after being submerged for 15 minutes in a frozen lake, the movie stars Chrissy Metz as a mother who prays for her son (Marcel Ruiz) to make a seemingly impossible medical recovery. Disney’s “Captain Marvel,” in its seventh week, rose from sixth place last week up to fourth, earning another $9.1 million this weekend. The movie, which was the debut of Brie Larson’s superhero, now has a cumulative domestic total of $400 million — just in time for Larson to outpace herself as part of the “Avengers” ensemble this week.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Daddy, What Is a Curfew?’ Sri Lankans Face the Shattering of a Hard-Won Peace","COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — As Sri Lanka’s 26-year civil war was winding down in 2009, Ranil Thilakaratne’s wife, Anuradha, was pregnant with their first and only child. Colombo, the capital, still felt under siege by the separatist Tamil Tigers, who had pioneered suicide bombings as a weapon of war. During the war years, bus stations, airports, banks and houses of worship became frequent targets, and the cities became choked with barricades, security checkpoints and military presence. People were careful to avoid crowded or confined spaces. Though Mr. Thilakaratne was a film buff, the couple gave up going to the movies. Things were even more dire in the war zones, with shortages of food, electricity and other basic necessities. Death became an accepted part of life. Tens of thousands of civilians, military personnel and rebels were killed in the war and the survivors were left with deep emotional scars. The Thilakaratnes’ son, Santhush Nathan, is now 10, as old as the island nation’s hard-earned peace. During that decade they and their fellow citizens in the capital shed the life of barricades and checkpoints for a peacetime routine where security became an afterthought. The country opened its splendid beauty to millions of visitors each year from the East and the West. All of that has quickly deflated after the devastating bombings on Sunday that killed more than 350 people. Even if temporarily, Colombo has reverted suddenly to the wartime mentality — or even worse. Security forces now stand at every corner, making searches and deploying other measures that were rare even during those days of bloodshed, residents say. As the government warns that some bombers — members of a local militant group whom the Islamic State has described as its “fighters” — might still be unaccounted for, families are concerned about their every move. A curfew has been imposed. Mr. Thilakaratne was at an Easter service when he heard of the first of the bombings that day. It took him hours to accept the full extent of the carnage. The city’s upended reality kicked in only when his son, Santhush, asked him a question he struggled to answer: “Daddy, what is a curfew?” While for many older residents the security measures are a flashback to the country’s dark days of war, for a generation that came of age in the past decade they are entirely disorienting. “I have never experienced body checks before. When we came to work today we were thoroughly checked,” said Mohammed Imtisham, 18, a salesman in the city. “The feeling you get when they do it is not nice. It’s like they are treating us like criminals.” Mr. Imtisham said the city felt besieged in a way that he had never experienced before. “I have heard about curfews, but not experienced one,” he said. “This is a first. There is no freedom now. We have to go straight home after work. After everything settles, I hope we can go back to our normal lives.” In the final years of the long war, the attacks in Colombo decreased in numbers. The vast security presence made infiltration difficult, and the Sri Lankan military took the fight to the rebel strongholds. But even when the war ended, the siege mentality took time to recede. “The political challenge was to demonstrate to the people that things were becoming normal. They rolled back the physical presence, but they would have maintained the intelligence. The military symbolism was rolled back quickly,” said Dr. Harinda Vidanage, the director of the Colombo-based Bandaranaike Center for International Studies. Ten years later, residents have specific memories of the instances when they felt the war was, in fact, over, many connected to when barricades were removed from roads that an entire generation had not walked on, or walls were taken down around offices or gardens that few had managed to peek at. But the question many are asking now is whether Sri Lanka, over the years since, relaxed so much that it became complacent. Sarath Fonseka, a former army chief who led the last stage of the war, said the country was “in a carnival mode” in its aftermath — and the population deserved to relax. But the officials, too, got carried away. “Even the politicians and the military were also in this mode,” Mr. Fonseka said. “We didn’t act responsibly.” Dr. Vidanage said Sri Lanka’s security narrative in recent years was shaped so much by outside powers — like the rivalry between India and China — that the country took its eyes off how global extremism trends could be affecting local communities too. The attacks shattered that narrative, and would certainly usher in a new normal where physical security would be more present. “When you have hard intelligence reporting, when you have hard evidence from foreign intelligence and you are incapable of implementing security measures, that is a government crisis,” Dr. Vidanage said. “What is happening is a meltdown of governance.” For Mr. and Ms. Thilakaratne, as for many parents in Colombo, security calculations are now a consideration in everything they do. They were the kind of trusting couple who rarely kept tabs on each other, even when one would be out very late. But now they often call or message when they are apart, to make sure the other is safe. Ms. Thilakaratne has avoided going to her job at a private company since the bombing, working from home instead. When she had to stop at the office to pick up some papers, Mr. Thilakaratne agreed to it only if he could come along and wait outside. “At least I would be there with her if something happens,” he said. Some of the most heartbreaking stories of the recent carnage were those of separation. Chandrani Fernando lost her husband, a carpenter named Diluk, in one of the blasts on Sunday. The couple, along with their 9-year-old daughter, often took seaside holidays and visited Ms. Fernando’s old village. During the Easter service at St. Sebastian’s church in Negombo, Diluk was standing behind his wife and daughter when a bomber detonated explosives at the church.

I would have been happier if he took us with him.” Mr. Thilakaratne, who said nine people he knew were killed in two of the churches, runs a free phone counseling service for the mentally distressed. The day after the bombing was the toughest day so far, he said, with some families calling the counseling line for information on loved ones who were still missing. The line received about 150 calls, more than the daily average of 80 to 100. The volunteer staff was crushed, Mr. Thilakaratne said.

2019,"‘Daddy, What Is a Curfew?’ Sri Lankans Face the Shattering of a Hard-Won Peace","COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — As Sri Lanka’s 26-year civil war was winding down in 2009, Ranil Thilakaratne’s wife, Anuradha, was pregnant with their first and only child. Colombo, the capital, still felt under siege by the separatist Tamil Tigers, who had pioneered suicide bombings as a weapon of war. During the war years, bus stations, airports, banks and houses of worship became frequent targets, and the cities became choked with barricades, security checkpoints and military presence. People were careful to avoid crowded or confined spaces. Though Mr. Thilakaratne was a film buff, the couple gave up going to the movies. Things were even more dire in the war zones, with shortages of food, electricity and other basic necessities. Death became an accepted part of life. Tens of thousands of civilians, military personnel and rebels were killed in the war and the survivors were left with deep emotional scars. The Thilakaratnes’ son, Santhush Nathan, is now 10, as old as the island nation’s hard-earned peace. During that decade they and their fellow citizens in the capital shed the life of barricades and checkpoints for a peacetime routine where security became an afterthought. The country opened its splendid beauty to millions of visitors each year from the East and the West. All of that has quickly deflated after the devastating bombings on Sunday that killed more than 350 people. Even if temporarily, Colombo has reverted suddenly to the wartime mentality — or even worse. Security forces now stand at every corner, making searches and deploying other measures that were rare even during those days of bloodshed, residents say. As the government warns that some bombers — members of a local militant group whom the Islamic State has described as its “fighters” — might still be unaccounted for, families are concerned about their every move. A curfew has been imposed. Mr. Thilakaratne was at an Easter service when he heard of the first of the bombings that day. It took him hours to accept the full extent of the carnage. The city’s upended reality kicked in only when his son, Santhush, asked him a question he struggled to answer: “Daddy, what is a curfew?” While for many older residents the security measures are a flashback to the country’s dark days of war, for a generation that came of age in the past decade they are entirely disorienting. “I have never experienced body checks before. When we came to work today we were thoroughly checked,” said Mohammed Imtisham, 18, a salesman in the city. “The feeling you get when they do it is not nice. It’s like they are treating us like criminals.” Mr. Imtisham said the city felt besieged in a way that he had never experienced before. “I have heard about curfews, but not experienced one,” he said. “This is a first. There is no freedom now. We have to go straight home after work. After everything settles, I hope we can go back to our normal lives.” In the final years of the long war, the attacks in Colombo decreased in numbers. The vast security presence made infiltration difficult, and the Sri Lankan military took the fight to the rebel strongholds. But even when the war ended, the siege mentality took time to recede. “The political challenge was to demonstrate to the people that things were becoming normal. They rolled back the physical presence, but they would have maintained the intelligence. The military symbolism was rolled back quickly,” said Dr. Harinda Vidanage, the director of the Colombo-based Bandaranaike Center for International Studies. Ten years later, residents have specific memories of the instances when they felt the war was, in fact, over, many connected to when barricades were removed from roads that an entire generation had not walked on, or walls were taken down around offices or gardens that few had managed to peek at. But the question many are asking now is whether Sri Lanka, over the years since, relaxed so much that it became complacent. Sarath Fonseka, a former army chief who led the last stage of the war, said the country was “in a carnival mode” in its aftermath — and the population deserved to relax. But the officials, too, got carried away. “Even the politicians and the military were also in this mode,” Mr. Fonseka said. “We didn’t act responsibly.” Dr. Vidanage said Sri Lanka’s security narrative in recent years was shaped so much by outside powers — like the rivalry between India and China — that the country took its eyes off how global extremism trends could be affecting local communities too. The attacks shattered that narrative, and would certainly usher in a new normal where physical security would be more present. “When you have hard intelligence reporting, when you have hard evidence from foreign intelligence and you are incapable of implementing security measures, that is a government crisis,” Dr. Vidanage said. “What is happening is a meltdown of governance.” For Mr. and Ms. Thilakaratne, as for many parents in Colombo, security calculations are now a consideration in everything they do. They were the kind of trusting couple who rarely kept tabs on each other, even when one would be out very late. But now they often call or message when they are apart, to make sure the other is safe. Ms. Thilakaratne has avoided going to her job at a private company since the bombing, working from home instead. When she had to stop at the office to pick up some papers, Mr. Thilakaratne agreed to it only if he could come along and wait outside. “At least I would be there with her if something happens,” he said. Some of the most heartbreaking stories of the recent carnage were those of separation. Chandrani Fernando lost her husband, a carpenter named Diluk, in one of the blasts on Sunday. The couple, along with their 9-year-old daughter, often took seaside holidays and visited Ms. Fernando’s old village. During the Easter service at St. Sebastian’s church in Negombo, Diluk was standing behind his wife and daughter when a bomber detonated explosives at the church. Only two family members survived. “We were just the three of us, but we were so happy,” Ms. Fernando said, weeping. “I am all alone now. I would have been happier if he took us with him.” Mr. Thilakaratne, who said nine people he knew were killed in two of the churches, runs a free phone counseling service for the mentally distressed.

2019,‘Debris Was Flying All Over’: 9 Dead as Storms Spread From Texas to Northeast,"FRANKLIN, Tex. — As a powerful tornado bore down on Saturday, Victor Henry pulled his wife and children into the hallway of their home. “It started lifting us up, and my son grabbed my shoulder and said, ‘Daddy,’ and I said, ‘Hold on,’” Mr. Henry, 49, recalled on Monday. The tornado tore off the roof of the house and ripped out the center. “Debris was flying all over,” Mr. Henry recalled. “After it was over and everything, we kind of got up and, of course, we walked out into what we thought was the living room. Instead, we were really standing outside, because there were no walls.” The tornado that destroyed the Henrys’ home slammed through the heart of a residential area near the small downtown of Franklin, Tex., about 125 miles south of Dallas, leaving blocks of rubble in its wake. It destroyed 55 homes, a church, four businesses, a duplex and part of the local housing authority building, the authorities said. Some people had to be pulled out of damaged dwellings. The tornado was part of a storm system that swept across the country over the weekend, killing at least nine people, including three children, and leaving a trail of damaged homes, splintered trees and power outages from Texas to the Northeast. “It has been five or six years since we’ve seen tornadoes of that magnitude at this time of year,” said Scott Overpeck, a senior meteorologist with the National Weather Service in southeast Texas. The service said the storm that hit Franklin had winds of at least 136 miles per hour; Mayor Molly Hedrick said it caused at least $3.8 million in damage. Rodney Green, 44, was inside his three-bedroom trailer home with his wife, Shayla, and their six children when the storm hit on Saturday with a torrent of rain and hail that starting blasting the windows. “The next thing I noticed, the trailer house was rocking and rocking,” Mr. Green said, recalling how he and several of the children sought shelter in the bathroom. Then, he said, a tree struck the house. The trailer was uprooted from its base, tumbling across the road and slamming into nearby parked vehicles, before striking a tree and ripping apart. The family was thrown more than 40 feet and landed in an empty lot, Mr. Green said. “When my eyes opened up, I said, ‘I can’t believe I’m still alive.’ It’s something you never want to go through.” In all, at least 17 tornadoes blew through Texas, Mississippi, Alabama and Ohio over the weekend. The storms also dumped snow on parts of the Midwest and deluged the Northeast with heavy rain before moving out to sea on Monday. Four people died in Texas, two in Louisiana, and one each in Mississippi, Alabama and Virginia. Two children were killed when a pine tree fell onto their family car during a severe thunderstorm Saturday on a back road in East Texas, near Pollok, about 150 miles southeast of Dallas. The children, Dilynn Creel, 8, and his brother, Jace, 3, were with their parents, who were returning home to what they thought would be safety, said Kirsten Redd, a family friend. “They were less than 200 yards from their home,” she said on Monday. “A tree fell in front of them and blocked their path. They were going to back up the road a little bit when a second tree fell, on the back of their car.” Ms. Redd’s son, a second-grade student, had been Dilynn’s friend since they were toddlers. “He was full of smiles, and his smile just lit up a room. His brother was just a spit and image of him,” Ms. Redd said. “There’s a video of Dilynn from Friday for the school’s field day. He was warming up for his egg-on-a-spoon race. He won several different ribbons.” The large storm system also caused flash floods in Louisiana, where a 13-year-old drowned in a drainage canal that filled with water in Bawcomville, near Monroe. Another person died when a car was submerged in floodwaters in Calhoun. Heavy rains and storms raked Mississippi into the night Saturday as the storms moved east. They damaged a roof of a hotel in New Albany, and Mississippi State University’s 21,000 students huddled in basements and hallways as a tornado neared the campus in Starkville. A university spokesman, Sid Salter, said some debris, possibly carried by the tornado, was found on campus, but no injuries were reported and no buildings were damaged. In Ohio, a tornado touched down about 5 p.m. on Sunday in Shelby, a town of 10,000 about 90 miles southwest of Cleveland. About a half-dozen homes were damaged, and at least six people were injured. The storm system also brought high winds to much of the Eastern United States on Sunday, from Ohio to Pennsylvania and from New York south to the Florida Panhandle. In Stafford, Va., a 78-year-old woman was killed when a tree fell on her home early Monday. The same system caused some late-season snow, ranging from four to six inches, in Northern Illinois, southwestern Wisconsin and parts of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. By Monday morning, the last vestiges of the heavy rainstorms had moved through Boston, and most of the severe weather was pushing off the East Coast. Early morning showers and thunderstorms with brief wind gusts greeted 32,500 Boston Marathon participants on race day. Back in Franklin, in a strange epilogue, the storm also unleashed a hive of bees that swarmed through the destroyed homes on Monday morning. Mr. Henry was stung on his upper right eyelid, and a bee got stuck in Ms. Henry’s hair, stinging her scalp.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Dogman’ Review: In Italy, a Man-Eat-Man World","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The worlds that the director Matteo Garrone creates onscreen sometimes seem as far out and darkly mysterious as an alternate universe. Best known for “Gomorrah,” a blistering story about a people under siege by the Neapolitan mafia, Garrone looks at an Italy that is dramatically at odds with its touristic image, its charming hill towns and bourgeois niceties. In the satirical “Reality” (2013), a fishmonger loses himself in his desperation to become a reality-TV star, an aspiration that Garrone suggests speaks to Silvio Berlusconi’s Italy, where life often appears to imitate scandalous spectacle. “Dogman,” Garrone’s latest, again takes on Italy and its enduring discontents, this time in a coastal town that appears as if it hasn’t fully recovered — but from what: war, the economy, organized crime, the government? That question lingers each time the camera holds on the story’s principal setting, a depopulated stretch of beach flanked by squat anonymous buildings, many seemingly derelict. In the sandy center are the remains of what looks like an abandoned amusement park, including a swing set and a ride ornamented with a dragon, a proud emblem of better or maybe just busier days. Not far from the swings and the dragon is a tiny shop with a large “Dogman” sign where Marcello (Marcello Fonte) patiently waits in his smock, ready to serve. Somewhat improbably, this slight, smiling, simple man ekes out a living as a dog groomer. The town may be dramatically unpeopled, but everyone seems to have mutts and the means to keep them coifed. And, as his endearments attest — his favorite is “sweetheart” — Marcello loves his work and his furry clients, his compatriots and his daughter. He has found his place here, and when he sits down to eat at a trattoria, where men garrulously greet each other over heaping plates, it is as if he were nestling into an embrace. Like the few other pinpricks of light scattered throughout the movie, the trattoria is a vestige of a resilient communal spirit that has survived despite conspicuous neglect and abuse. Something has been gnawing on the bones of this place, and it isn’t long before Garrone introduces a possible suspect, Simone (Edoardo Pesce). A former boxer who still keeps his fists up, Simone is the local bully. He doesn’t seem to have a job beyond an occasional heist; his only apparent interest is brutalizing anyone who gets in his way. For some reason, he tends to gravitate to Marcello, or at least to the snorts of cocaine that the little man eagerly procures for him. It’s a worrisome relationship — something has got to give — and Garrone teases this volcanic threat for much of the movie. Simone is a brute, a monster with bared teeth. But much like the slavering, ferocious-looking dog that enters barking in the opening shot, and which Marcello gently soothes into submission, Simone seems containable. And for a long while, Marcello manages to keep him and his violence in check. Mostly, he just goes along with Simone’s persistent demands, an acquiescence that shapes the episodic narrative as Marcello unhappily takes the wheel during a robbery, tags along to a dance club and reluctantly joins Simone on a cocaine run. Garrone likes big, bold, graphically precise images that grab the eye and do the work that’s often done by dialogue in other movies. The snarling dog announces Simone, who in turn embodies an unchecked malignancy. Simone, it’s clear, is terrible. Yet there’s nothing that he does, including beating others to a pulp, that is as horrific as the scene in which Marcello sits with neighborhood men who discuss having Simone assassinated. One has recently been assaulted by him; others soon will be. Seated at their usual trattoria table, the men seem so calm, sober. And as they discuss their problem and a potential remedy, you see how easily rationalized violence turns a group into a mob. Social realism in a symbolist key, “Dogman” is at times more pleasurable to look at than to experience, because it’s so deterministic and because there’s so little ordinary feeling beyond Marcello’s uncomplicated love for his daughter, neighbors and dogs. Garrone is a virtuoso of pain and terror, which can be overwhelming, despite the flourishes of comedy. He also likes to go loud, and he consistently pushes into hyperbole, as when he comically emphasizes the difference between Marcello’s size and a much larger dog he grooms. The contrast is funny. But what makes the image linger isn’t how it fits into the movie’s controlling metaphor but the everyday gentleness of one creature tending to another.

2019,"‘Dr. Seuss’s Garden’ Yields a Deep-Sea Discovery, but It Already Faces Threats","Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter. Researchers announced on Tuesday that they had found two new species of cold-water coral in undersea canyons off New England, a discovery that highlighted concerns about the effects of global warming on the world’s oceans. The corals were found about 150 miles southeast of Boston in the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, a vast area of undersea mountains and valleys that was designated a monument by President Barack Obama in 2016. “There’s a lot of predictions right now that suggests this area of the Atlantic, the northwest Atlantic, is going to heat up three times faster than any other part of the Atlantic,” said Timothy Shank, a deep-sea biologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute who led the expedition. Warming waters can kill coral, the same way extreme heat can kill humans. They can also reduce the level of nutrients in the water that corals need to survive. Concern about rising temperatures is partly why Mr. Obama made the area a marine monument, the first in the Atlantic. His declaration immediately banned mineral and oil extraction inside the monument area and called for phasing out fishing over a seven-year period in an effort to ease pressure on the ecosystem. But in 2017, a coalition of New England fishing groups filed a lawsuit against the designation. “Our lawsuit argues that the monument designation is unlawful,” said Jonathan Wood, the attorney representing the fishing groups. It says that the Antiquities Act, which gives presidents the authority to create national monuments, does not apply at sea. A judge in Federal District Court for the District of Columbia rejected that argument. The ruling is under appeal. There have been signs, however, that the Trump administration is considering withdrawing the monument status, a move that would make the court battle irrelevant. In 2018, the Interior Department accidentally made public emails that included drafts of presidential proclamations overturning the Obama-era designation. Cold-water corals are notoriously slow to grow. Dr. Shank once sampled one that stood four feet tall. “We dated it and it was over 4,000 years old,” he said. The canyons are much deeper than a human can dive, so Dr. Shank’s team, which included researchers from the University of Connecticut and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, used underwater drones and a submersible vehicle provided by the exploration group OceanX. Peter J. Auster, a research professor emeritus of marine sciences at the University of Connecticut who toured the seamounts on an unrelated expedition, said the experience was “like a stroll through Dr. Seuss’s garden.” “Between the corals their size and their shapes and the fish that live there, it’s a pretty otherworldly experience,” he said.

2019,"‘Epic’ China Trade Deal Near Completion, Trump Says, but Haggling Continues","President Trump stopped short of announcing a final trade deal with China on Thursday, saying in an Oval Office meeting with the Chinese delegation that it may take another four weeks or more to secure an “epic” trade agreement. Negotiators had originally aimed to secure a deal this week during a visit from Liu He, the Chinese vice premier and special trade envoy, and announce a presidential summit meeting between Mr. Trump and Xi Jinping of China. But after more than a year of tit-for-tat tariffs, on-and-off negotiations and threats of additional punishment, the United States and China continue to haggle over some remaining issues, including how many of the American tariffs on Chinese goods will be removed, and when. “We’re talking intellectual property protection and theft. We’re talking about certain tariffs,” Mr. Trump said, referring to issues that remain unresolved. People familiar with the negotiations had said that the president was poised to announce a summit meeting with China. But those plans spurred a backlash among some of the president’s trade advisers, who argued that announcing a meeting before the deal was struck would weaken the United States’ hand and give it less leverage to force changes it is seeking. In remarks at the White House, Mr. Trump said that the deal was “very complete” and that the two sides had “agreed to far more than we have left to agree to.” “I think I can say some of the toughest things have been agreed to,” he continued. But he said there would be no summit meeting until a final deal was made. “If we have a deal then we’ll have a summit,” the president said. The date and location of a summit meeting have also proved controversial. The United States had initially proposed holding one at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump’s Florida resort, but China has been pushing for an official state visit in Washington or a neutral location in a third country, people familiar with the matter said. Lawmakers had publicly fretted about announcing a summit meeting before the deal was inked, suggesting that Mr. Trump was surrendering his leverage in his eagerness to sign an agreement. Both Republicans and Democrats have urged Mr. Trump to hold out for a tough deal to combat Chinese practices that American businesses have long seen as problematic, including the coerced transfer of foreign technology as a condition of doing business in the country and the ample government subsidies for Chinese firms. “Last week @POTUS told us he would not sign a ‘good’ trade deal with #China he would only sign a ‘great’ one,” Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said in a Twitter post on Thursday morning. “I believe him. But to be a ‘great’ deal it must allow us to do in China what they can do in US & it must have real enforcement mechanisms.” The United States has pressed China to make commitments on purchasing American goods, opening markets to foreign business and increasing protections for foreign intellectual property in a bid to rebalance an economic relationship that Mr. Trump says is unfair for American workers. It remains to be seen how sweeping and significant any agreement will be, and whether it will achieve the lofty promises Mr. Trump has made about resetting the economic relationship with Beijing. But the White House is also facing pressure to resolve the trade war, which has begun to hurt American farming, manufacturing and other sectors, and caused wild swings on Wall Street. Industries including automaking, technology manufacturing and farming have anxiously awaited reduced tariffs and details of a new agreement, which will have huge implications for their businesses. The president’s tariffs have been successful at bringing the Chinese to the negotiating table, and his advisers have insisted they will not squander an opportunity to press China for substantial economic reforms that past administrations were unable to secure. Still, the Chinese have balked at making any reforms that could be viewed as infringing on their sovereignty or undercutting the Communist Party’s control of the economy. “If you and I are making a deal, and you have to drag me kicking and screaming the whole way, what are the odds the deal is going to hold?” asked Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. “I don’t find that the slightest bit convincing.” American negotiators have pushed for an enforcement mechanism that would allow tariffs on Chinese goods to snap back if China violated the terms of the deal, and that would forbid China to retaliate. But Chinese negotiators have resisted such an idea, describing it as a potential infringement on their sovereignty. Myron Brilliant, the executive vice president and head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said foreign stakeholders would be scrutinizing the deal to see whether it contained a strong enforcement mechanism that would hold the Chinese accountable to their obligations. “That is what would separate this agreement from previous agreements,” he said. The two sides spent the past two months drawing up more than 120 pages of an agreement covering issues including forced technology transfer and cybertheft, intellectual property rights, currency and nontariff barriers to trade. The Trump administration has also pressed China to commit to hundreds of billions in purchases of American products, including agricultural products, energy and airplanes. The administration has been eager to front-load China’s purchases of American products to help bolster farm country and other important constituencies and try to bring down the bilateral trade deficit before the 2020 election. Mr. Trump’s advisers would prefer to keep the tariffs in place as long as possible, an arrangement the Chinese oppose. In recent weeks, Beijing has introduced a steady drumbeat of other reforms intended to please American constituencies and win Mr. Trump’s favor. China has resumed purchases of American soybeans and announced it would reclassify fentanyl, which has fueled the American opioid epidemic, as a controlled substance. Beijing also approved a sweeping rewrite of a foreign investment law that may help foreign companies avoid unequal treatment. And it approved a request by JPMorgan Chase to establish a majority owned and controlled securities brokerage firm in the country and floated the idea of expanding access for foreign cloud computing companies. China experts have cautioned that the long-running economic stresses between the countries are unlikely to be entirely put to rest with this round of negotiations. “The negotiations, no matter what anybody says, will not end at the end of this phase,” said David Lampton, a fellow at Stanford University’s Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies. “We’ve got decades of painful negotiating with China ahead.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Extreme Pollen’ Blankets North Carolina in a Sneeze-Inducing Yellow Haze,"Spring can feel like the end of the world for allergy sufferers, but in North Carolina this week, it looked that way, too. And it has a name to match: “Pollenpocalypse.” Massive clouds of sneeze-inducing pollen overtook North Carolina this week, tinting the skies yellow and covering cars, streets and ponds in a fine powder that left footprints on the carpets of unsuspecting residents and made allergy sufferers want to hibernate in a panic room until summer. Pine tree pollen erupts across the state each spring, but Jeremy Gilchrist, a photographer in Durham, N.C., said he had never before seen the thick yellow-green haze that filled the air on Monday. “It was very weird,” he said. A former meteorologist, Mr. Gilchrist captured photos of the cloud’s immense scope with a drone. On Facebook, he called it #Pollmageddon. While the end-times jokes are social media gold, the freaky natural wonders are drawing attention to what meteorologists say will be a brutal allergy season, and could be an indication of things to come. Climate change is contributing to longer and more severe allergy seasons, according to a recent study published in Lancet Planetary Health, which found that pollen loads and durations have been increasing on three continents over the past two decades as average temperatures have risen. This year, high pollen counts are sweeping much of the country, from New England through the South and across to California. Tulsa, Okla., ranks No. 1 in pollen severity this week, according to The Weather Channel, followed by towns in Texas, New Jersey and North Carolina. In New York City, pollen counts are forecast to be in the higher ranges for the next five days. Forecasters predict the worst is yet to come: Rain and snow during the fall and winter kept the ground moist, an ideal environment for trees — and a perfect storm of misery for the estimated 20 percent of Americans allergic to pollen. “We’re seeing extreme pollen levels,” said Alan Reppert, a meteorologist in State College, Pa., who warned that while the tree pollen season may peak early this year, the summer grass and fall ragweed seasons could also be severe.",The New York Times
2019,‘Family’ Review: Better Living Through Childcare,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “Family,” Laura Steinel’s lightweight first feature, relies on audiences buying into the old chestnut that difficult women would be happier (or just easier to be around) if forced to care for a child. In this version, the woman is a tactless workaholic who needs to connect with her feelings; just don’t expect those to entail an even greater appreciation for her job. Kate (Taylor Schilling) excels as a vaguely high-powered executive at a New Jersey hedge fund. Socially, though, she’s a dud, alienating co-workers by saying exactly what she thinks. So when the brother she barely knows (Eric Edelstein) asks her to babysit her 11-year-old niece, Maddie (Bryn Vale), you can probably write the rest yourself — even if you neglect to pointlessly throw the clown-painted music fans known as Juggalos into the mix. A brisk trot through Maddie’s problems follows. She’s bullied by mean girls and chafes against gender expectations, preferring karate to the ballet class her mother insists on. Predictably, Kate’s bungling interventions and newly acquired empathy cause her work to suffer, a mere trifle when the prize is reconnection with her estranged father. (I just wish that his drug dependencies didn’t seem to suggest that Kate’s workaholism was inherited addictive behavior, rather than a completely legitimate preference.) Thoroughly good-natured and with a handful of decent jokes (like Kate McKinnon as a vulpine suburban mom), “Family” would be more interesting if, instead of trying to rewire Kate, it just admitted that her harsh honesty and benign neglect were more beneficial to Maddie than her mother’s anxious hovering. But that would mean conceding that Kate was just fine as she was. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.",The New York Times
2019,‘Fast Color’ Review: Can a Gifted Family Save a Parched World?,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “Fast Color” is many things — a dreamlike dystopian drama; a warm celebration of family and female power; a teasing hint of superhero-origin story — none of which fully explains its gentle grip on our attention. What it is not, is speedy, with a narrative that moves carefully, even languidly, and visuals so beautifully patient that we have time to memorize their texture and import. Special effects are all the more so for being used sparingly, and the movie’s few characters feel no need to be constantly explaining themselves. For fairly long stretches, there are no major incidents — which is not the same as saying that nothing happens. Set in a near-future America parched and wilting from eight years of drought, the movie drops us into a car beside an anxiously fleeing Ruth (a perfectly fraught Gugu Mbatha-Raw), a recovering addict whose sudden seizures can ignite earthquakes. The vibrations alert the G-men on her trail, drawing them too late to the dingy motel where she had stopped to rest and dress the mysterious wounds on her wrists. Her destination is a remote farmhouse where her mother, Bo (Lorraine Toussaint, wonderful) is caring for Ruth’s small daughter, Lila (Saniyya Sidney), who barely remembers her. All three can see the colors suggested by the title, though their rainbow-hued significance remains shrouded, and all three can use their minds to disintegrate objects then restore them, good as new. (The utility of this becomes clear later, underscoring the movie’s pacifist message.) These uncanny abilities, which Ruth has struggled to control and Lila is refining at a rapid pace, have been passed down for generations and kept the family in seclusion. Feared and hunted by the authorities, the women are shielded only by a kindly local sheriff (David Strathairn) whose investment in their safety is clearly personal. Moody and strange, “Fast Color” has a solemnity that haunts almost every frame. Shot in New Mexico, Michael Fimognari’s images are wide and graceful, with skies that stretch the edges of the screen and desert landscapes of deep, sweeping barrenness. The movie’s visual boldness is fine compensation for the occasional patches of weak dialogue and rudimentary plotting, the finesse of the camera work a constant pleasure. When Bo pulverizes a lighted cigarette into a smoky swirl of glowing tobacco flakes before delicately reassembling them, the sight is entrancingly magical, its simplicity in keeping with Rob Simonsen’s perfectly calibrated score. A small, intimate story that hints at much bigger things, “Fast Color” sometimes feels like a prologue, an appetizer for a meal that may or may not appear. The screenplay (by the director, Julia Hart, and her husband, Jordan Horowitz) is unfussy and focused, its gentle ecological warnings woven through a modest tale of familial destiny. Rewarding despite its restraint, the movie has an elasticity that pushes the imagination in any number of directions, offering an expressive allegory for a lineage of powerful black women whose strength, unleashed, could literally shake the earth. “This is only the beginning,” Bo promises.

2019,‘Fosse/Verdon’ Is Full of Broadway Legends. Here’s Who’s Who.,"What good is it sitting alone in your room when there’s an episode of “Fosse/Verdon” on? Pretty good. This limited series, which starts Tuesday on FX, spins and arches its way through the relationship, professional and excruciatingly personal, between Bob Fosse and Gwen Verdon. Fosse was a dancer, choreographer, director and filmmaker, who would win nine Tony Awards. Verdon, who married him in 1960 and continued to work with him after they separated in 1971, was the greatest comic dancer Broadway ever fell for and won four Tonys of her own. Created by some more big Broadway names — Thomas Kail and Lin-Manuel Miranda, of “Hamilton,” are executive producers, Steven Levenson, who wrote the book for “Dear Evan Hansen,” is the showrunner — the series assumes a thorough knowledge of midcentury Broadway and beyond. Here’s a cheat sheet to who’s who and what’s what. Who’s got the pain? Most everyone. George Abbott (Byron Jennings) Savvy and patrician, the director and producer Abbott, gave a young Fosse, his first job as a Broadway choreographer, hiring him for “The Pajama Game” and then later for “Damn Yankees.” His ability to make bad shows good and good ones better was known as the “Abbott touch.” Paddy Chayefsky (Norbert Leo Butz) A television writer, novelist and three-time Oscar winner (an adaptation of his screenplay for “Network” is on Broadway now), Chayefsky became Fosse’s closest friend. Making good on a deal they struck when Fosse underwent heart surgery, Fosse tap danced at Chayefsky’s funeral. Jack Cole (Christopher Tocco) A nightclub choreographer and dance coach, Cole met a young Verdon when she reviewed his troupe’s performance and pleaded with him to take her on. He did. With him, she made her Broadway debut in the 1950 show “Alive and Kicking.” Shirley MacLaine (Laura Osnes) Though Verdon had created the title role in “Sweet Charity,” the studios wanted a name so MacLaine, who had appeared in the Fosse-choreographed “The Pajama Game,” replaced her in the film version. Joan McCracken (Susan Misner) Fosse’s second wife (his first was the dancer Mary Ann Niles), McCracken entered the marriage as the bigger Broadway star. Like Verdon, she was a comedy dancer. She appeared in the original “Oklahoma!.” Complications from diabetes stalled her career. Liza Minnelli (Kelli Barrett) Minnelli was already a star when Fosse convinced her to star in the film version of “Cabaret.” With green nail polish and mile-long eyelashes, her Sally Bowles helped Minnelli become a fashion icon. Cy Feuer (Paul Reiser) A savvy Broadway hitmaker, Feuer produced the likes of “Guys and Dolls.” Feuer’s “Can-Can,” a Cole Porter musical, was the show that first made Verdon a star. Later, Feuer took a chance on Fosse, greenlighting him for the film “Cabaret,” though they often fought during shooting. Hal Prince (Evan Handler) Fosse’s friend, collaborator and sometime rival, Prince is a vaunted Broadway director and producer. (A tribute, “Prince of Broadway,” ran in 2015.) He directed several shows that Fosse choreographed and later hired Fosse and Verdon’s daughter, Nicole Fosse, for “Phantom of the Opera.” Ann Reinking (Margaret Qualley) A forceful and impossibly leggy dancer, Reinking met Fosse during “Pippin” and became his romantic partner through most of the ’70s. After his death, she became, with Verdon, the primary exporter of his style. She choreographed the 1996 revival of “Chicago” and co-directed and helped to choreograph the Broadway revue “Fosse.” Chita Rivera (Bianca Marroquin) A blistering Broadway dancer, Rivera appeared in the London company of “Sweet Charity” and then alongside MacLaine in the movie version. Impish and imperious, she later starred in “Chicago,” playing the infamous Velma Kelly alongside Verdon’s Roxie Hart. Neil (Nate Corddry) and Joan Simon (Aya Cash) When Fosse ran into trouble with “Sweet Charity,” he persuaded Simon, already a celebrated comedy playwright, to write the book. Simon and his wife, Joan, a former modern dancer, became key members of Fosse and Verdon’s social circle. ‘Damn Yankees’ (1955) Fosse’s follow-up to “The Pajama Game,” this musical introduced him to Verdon, already a Broadway star, who played the temptress Lola. Both took home Tonys and in the film version, Fosse appeared alongside Verdon in “Who’s Got the Pain.” ‘New Girl in Town’ (1957) and ‘Redhead’ (1959) The Fosse/Verdon collaborations least known and least often revived, the first is a musical comedy version of Eugene O’Neill’s “Anna Christie” and the second, a murder mystery set in Victorian London, is about a sheltered girl who runs a wax museum. Each won Verdon a Tony. ‘Sweet Charity’ (1966) A whimsical adaptation of Federico Fellini’s “Nights of Cabiria,” the Cy Coleman and Dorothy Fields musical follows a dance hall girl, Charity Hope Valentine, on a fitful search for love and enlightenment. It gave us standards like “Big Spender” and “If My Friends Could See Me Now.” ‘Pippin’ (1972) This musical from Stephen Schwartz (“Godspell,” “The Magic Show”) is a parable of self-discovery, based, in the slackest sense, on the emperor Charlemagne and his son. Fosse dialed up the themes of sex and death and emphasized the show’s metatheatricality, with Ben Vereen as the Leading Player. ‘Chicago’ (1975) Adapted from Maurine Dallas Watkins’s play about two acquitted murderesses, this was a musical ahead of its time. Its cynicism left critics cold and despite star turns by Verdon and Rivera, it took home no Tonys. But the 1996 revival is still running. ‘Sweet Charity’ (1969) Fosse made his film directing debut with this movie, which starred MacLaine, Rivera and John McMartin, plus Sammy Davis Jr. as the cool-cat leader of a religious sect. Though Verdon had been replaced, she came along to assist with the choreography. Early reviews were promising, but it sputtered at the box office. ‘Cabaret’ (1972) Though “Sweet Charity” had flopped, Fosse convinced Feuer that he should film Kander and Ebb’s show, which Prince had directed for Broadway. Shooting on location in Munich and West Berlin, Fosse cut the extradiegetic numbers, adding in “Mein Herr” and “Maybe This Time.” Verdon again assisted, at one point flying back to New York to procure a gorilla costume. ‘Lenny’ (1974) For Fosse’s first nonmusical film, he chose an adaptation of Julian Barry’s stage play about the life of Lenny Bruce. Photographed in black and white, it intercuts stage performances, flashbacks and interviews with Bruce’s mother, agent and former wife. Fosse and the film’s star, Dustin Hoffman (Brandon Uranowitz in “Fosse/ Verdon”), often clashed during filming. ‘All That Jazz’ (1979) A singular movie musical, lacerating, indulgent and sometimes surreal, it starred Roy Scheider as a Fosse-esque choreographer, with Leland Palmer in the Verdon role and Ann Reinking more or less playing herself. The movie concluded with “Bye, Bye, Love” an ecstatic and utterly bananas production number featuring Vereen. An earlier version of this article misidentified one of the writers of the musical “Sweet Charity.” She was Dorothy Fields, not Dorothy Michaels. It also misidentified the release date of “Chicago,” which opened in 1975, not 1976. It also described in error the chronology of several Stephen Schwartz works. “Pippin” opened before “The Magic Show,” not after.",The New York Times

2019,‘Game of Thrones’ Cast on Why the Starks Need Family Therapy,"This article contains spoilers for the Season 8 premiere of “Game of Thrones.” After several seasons scattered all over Westeros and Essos, the surviving members of House Stark are finally gathered in one place: back home at Winterfell. And they’re not alone: Any and all who want to fight for Team Living are joining them. That has the convenient effect of reconnecting characters who haven’t seen one another in ages, some of whom parted under prickly circumstances. [Read a review of the Season 8 premiere of “Game of Thrones”] The reunions were many: Arya and Jon, possibly the most lovable Stark siblings; Arya and Gendry, who lost touch because of Melisandre’s seduction scheme; Sansa and Tyrion, who last locked eyes at Joffrey’s wedding-murder; Arya and the Hound, who ended their strange partnership with a request for death. (Request denied!) And of course there’s Bran and Jaime, who last saw each other through a fateful window. Very briefly. We talked to the actors Maisie Williams (Arya), Sophie Turner (Sansa) and Isaac Hempstead Wright (Bran) about what their characters might be feeling as “Game of Thrones” rounds the homestretch. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. It’s reunion time for the Starks and their guests, and some of this can only be awkward … MAISIE WILLIAMS Did Sansa and Tyrion ever file for that divorce? SOPHIE TURNER It should have been an annulment, really. But no, they never filed for a divorce or an annulment, so I guess they technically are still married! I don’t think it’s as awkward as people would say because Sansa has been through so many rocky relationships that her relationship with Tyrion actually seems pretty sweet, in retrospect. It would be nice for her to see a familiar face, especially someone who treated her well and respected her. I think that would be nice for her. What about Arya and Gendry? Would that be awkward? Or would it be fun and frolics? WILLIAMS I think it would be kind of strange! I don’t know if Arya and Gendry have a lot in common anymore. And Arya’s never really been very good at communicating verbally how she feels on the inside anyway, and so any sort of reunion is … I mean, the one with Sansa in Season 7 couldn’t have been any more awkward! If it hadn’t been for the redeeming hug at the end, it would have just been really [expletive] icy. So yeah, I think in terms of Arya meeting characters this season, I think for her, it’s really odd! It’s weird for her to be reminded of the girl that she was, you know, and how she last felt when she was with certain characters, because I feel like she’s sort of severed that part of herself. It must be tricky to re-encounter someone you left for dead, or someone who tried to kill you. How does Bran feel about Jaime Lannister? Does he understand now what happened between them? Would he hold a grudge? ISAAC HEMPSTEAD WRIGHT It had to happen, I reckon. It’s given him incredible abilities, which made him far more significant than he could have ever dreamed of being, had he not had the power. It’s kind of a neat idea: Why does he have the Sight? Did he have to fall to get the Sight? But he certainly doesn’t hold grudges. He kind of transcends all the petty quarrels of most of the other characters. Those petty quarrels still need to be resolved, though. What would a Stark family therapy session look like? TURNER Oh, god! That would be really intense. WILLIAMS They each would have to hold the talking stick, and you can only speak when you have that. TURNER I think it would be very intense. I think there would be lots of tears. But ultimately, I think it’s what they all need. WILLIAMS Don’t you think Bran would be, like, a really good therapist? Because he knows everything? HEMPSTEAD WRIGHT If someone says, “Look this up for me, Bran,” he’s your guy. But the Three-Eyed Raven doesn’t think in terms of emotions. He just thinks in terms of what’s destiny. He’s sort of the keeper of time and history. He doesn’t see things in terms of “Oh, that’s personally upsetting to me” or “Well, that’s personally upsetting to them.” It’s just “This had to happen” or “This doesn’t have to happen.” And he got quite a zen, removed approach to it all. TURNER He would be like [imitates Bran], “You … need to talk to her.” And that would be it. Yeah. Bran should be the therapist. WILLIAMS And then we could be like, “How are you feeling, Bran?” TURNER And he would be like [imitates Bran], “I am well, thank you. I am the Three-Eyed Raven.” How much is Bran still Bran, and how much is he the Three-Eyed Raven? HEMPSTEAD WRIGHT The thing is, it’s hard to know, because there aren’t any exact definitions of what the Three-Eyed Raven is and how that all works. I think when he’s surrounded by his family, he’s probably a little bit more Bran than when he’s not surrounded by them, because that’s bringing back the small part of him that is Bran Stark. But I wouldn’t even say that he necessarily has a huge allegiance to the Starks anymore. It’s like Bran Stark is just a very small part of the Three-Eyed Raven entity as a whole now. As I understand it, the Three-Eyed Raven is kind of like a chi, like a psychic energy that is manifesting itself in Bran. He can see that there’s a lot of friction and tension that is not necessary, not when they’re all trying to stop the dead from taking over the living. The Bran-is-the-Night-King theory continues to persist … HEMPSTEAD WRIGHT [Laughs] I wish I could help you there. Want exclusive “Thrones” interviews and news, as well as the internet’s best articles on that week’s episode? Sign up for our Season 8 newsletter here. There is a story that Old Nan tells about him in the books, that he was a distant Stark ancestor. HEMPSTEAD WRIGHT Really? The Night’s King, as far as I can remember, is a slightly different thing in the books. He’s an old commander of the Night’s Watch who disappeared and set up with a White Walker. Well, Benjen was both a Stark and a member of the Night’s Watch. It’s possible to be both. HEMPSTEAD WRIGHT Ah! See, I thought he was a Targaryen. Maybe I misread that somewhere. I’ve also seen theories that Samwell Tarly is George R.R. Martin. All these weird theories will suddenly come true, and we’d be there going, “I told you so!”",The New York Times
2019,‘Game of Thrones’ Changed TV. Let Us Count the Ways.,"It is a show whose budgets and scale were once unthinkable for television — and now it’s become the gold standard. In the eight years since “Game of Thrones” went on the air, the television industry has been upended. We can thank Netflix for that. Consider that in the streaming era, the number of scripted shows airing in the United States has shot up 86 percent, from 266 in 2011 to 495 last year. Yet amid this glut no series has had more influence or created more industrywide envy than “Thrones,” which begins its final season on HBO on April 14. Everyone wants its awards: “Thrones” has won more Emmys than any other dramatic series ever (including best drama three times). Everyone wants its reach: It’s the most popular show in HBO’s history and one of the most watched shows of the last decade (when including digital viewership, its most recent season averaged more than 30 million viewers an episode). Everyone wants its scale and scope: The series was one of the most influential in an era where television budgets for dramas have ballooned from $3 million an episode to, in some cases, $10 million or more. Everyone wants its boldness: “Thrones” famously killed off the face of the show, Sean Bean, before its first season was over and has repeatedly redefined assumptions about what’s possible on TV, both tonally (sexposition, shocking violence) and technically (dragons, sweeping battle scenes). “We used to have a different experience for movies and the television business,” said Gary Newman, the recently departed co-chairman of the Fox Television Group. “Now you can feel it melding. I give ‘Thrones’ a lot of credit for that.” And everyone, including newer outlets like Hulu and Apple, have been looking for the next “Thrones,” a series that can define a network, and help convince people to hand over $10 or $15 a month for subscriptions. Three years after “Thrones” debuted, Netflix ordered its own high budget epic series “Marco Polo” about the Mongol empire (which was a flop). Amazon bought the TV rights to make a “Lord of the Rings” series and spent north of $200 million to do so (and still needs a script). Apple has a big-budget fantasy drama starring Jason Momoa and Alfre Woodard about what happens when to humanity after everyone goes blind (which still needs a premiere date). There have been lots of mixed results so far. “It has made everyone say, ‘O.K., where is our ‘Game of Thrones’? Which is the exact wrong way to find your next ‘Game of Thrones,’” said Casey Bloys, the president of programming at HBO. “Just to set out and say ‘Well we’re going to make our next “Game of Thrones,” we’re going to do a real giant show with a huge budget,’ well that doesn’t allow for all the other things that have to go right for a show to really resonate with a viewer.” Which is why HBO has been, as Bloys put it, “deliberate” in finding its “Thrones” successor from the universe of George R.R. Martin’s books. HBO will shoot a pilot for a “Thrones” prequel, created by Martin and Jane Goldman, in June. Still, “Thrones” has helped open up a big fantasy universe for the network. In the coming months, it will air an adaptation of the controversial epic “His Dark Materials.” Likewise, “Leftovers” co-creator Damon Lindelof is creating an adaptation of the comic books “Watchmen.” And HBO has other science fiction series coming from J.J. Abrams and the “Avengers” director Joss Whedon. If such big-ticket genre series were once unthinkable for the network that made “The Sopranos” and “Sex and the City,” well, little of television looks the way it did eight years ago. “Thrones” began in April 2011 on HBO, just a few weeks after Netflix gave a David Fincher-directed drama “House of Cards” a straight-to-series order. Today, Netflix makes more original programs than any studio or network and has spurred the dizzying spike in the number of television series made. It will spend at least $10 billion on content this year. “Thrones,” which had a budget that started at $5 million an episode but ballooned to as much as $15 million an episode in the final season, helped create the current era of enormous spending, even for shows without CGI dragons, White Walkers and direwolves. For instance, Apple committed to two seasons of a morning TV show dramedy starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston that the company has allocated $240 million to make. At the time, Apple made the pledge even though the show had no script. “‘Thrones’ certainly accelerated it, raising production value to an incredible place,” Mr. Newman said. “That used to be reserved just for HBO and that’s clearly no longer the case,” he continued. “Netflix and Amazon and now even the broadcast networks and the big cable networks like an FX, TNT are doing it. They’re all realizing they have to raise their game with things that feel more epic and with greater scope to compete with what HBO and other premium services are doing.” Bloys might think that an emphasis on bigness — big budgets, big productions — is the wrong lesson to take from the success of “Thrones.” But he does allow that it was a significant part of the formula. “‘Thrones’ was the first show that demonstrated you could produce a show with real cinematic scope,” Bloys said. “That you could think bigger — both in terms of character and drama and in special effects. That it would work, that taking shots and spending real money and putting it on the screen would pay off.” Now all someone has to do is find the next “Thrones.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘Game of Thrones’ Fans Are Thrilled, Confused and Setting the Internet on Fire","Did you think you were going to get some work done? Not today! The third of the six final episodes of HBO’s “Game of Thrones” on Sunday night featured an epic battle that moved the series and cultural phenomenon closer to its inevitable end. Fans had high expectations going into the episode, “The Long Night.” Who would live? (And who would not?) Would the Night King, absent from the season’s first two episodes, finally appear? Would the citizens of Winterfell actually be safe in the crypts with all those corpses waiting to reanimate? As soon as the nearly 90-minute battle sequence began to unfold, viewers turned by the thousands to the communal water cooler we call social media, where they shared memes, thoughts, spoilers, praise and grievances in thousands of posts on Twitter, Reddit, Instagram and YouTube. And as dawn arrived on the first workday of the week, many were searching Google for answers. The New York Times recap called the episode “a masterpiece of tension and release, goose bumps and heartbreak, grandiosity and intimacy.” By noon on Monday, at least seven of the top 100 podcast episodes on iTunes were devoted to discussing the show, with many of the hosts making the same, enthusiastic points seen elsewhere online. “I can sum it up in three words,” said Ser Matt, a host of “Bend the Knee: A Song of Ice and Fire Podcast”: “Worth the wait.” But not everyone was so taken. Alan Sepinwall, of Rolling Stone, wrote in a review that he found much of the episode “narratively unsatisfying” and argued that “too many characters were protected by plot armor.” “The night is dark and full of terrors,” the Red Priestess, Melisandre, once said. And the night was most definitely dark. The show has often faced lighthearted complaints about its lighting. There is no electricity in Westeros, after all. The epic Battle of Winterfell took place in the dark of night, on an open field and in darkened castle hallways, which made discerning what was happening, and who it was happening to, difficult at times. Writing for Slate, Matthew Dessem defended the decision to film a low-light battle, while explaining the poor viewing experience as a structural failing. “It’s a perfect storm: Every recent advance in television technology seems to have been designed specifically to make ‘The Long Night’ difficult to make out,” he wrote. James Poniewozik, the chief television critic for The Times, argued that while confusion on screen can serve a purpose, it was an odd choice for last night’s episode. “The squint-to-see-them images were chaotic even when we were clearly meant to take in information: Who just died? Which dragon bit which?” he wrote. Sunday’s episode was far from the only one that featured such dark scenes. In 2017, Robert McLachlan, a cinematographer who worked on the show, told Insider that he felt that it had been getting darker over the years, driven by the crew’s desire for a “naturalistic” feel. “We want to make these sets and locations feel as if they’re absolutely not lit by us, but only by mother nature or some candles or what have you, so that it feels more naturalistic albeit enhanced in some cases,” he said. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Maisie Williams, the actress who plays Arya Stark, said she was unconvinced when she first read about the scene in which she killed the Night King. But as the episode came together she had a change of heart. “It all comes down to this one very moment,” she said. “It’s also unexpected and that’s what this show does. … I get it.” Fans of the show seemed to agree, generally pleased that she was the one who saved her brother, Winterfell and perhaps all of Westeros. To start, viewers wanted clarity on how, exactly, Arya was able to make her way from the castle to come out of nowhere to defeat the Night King, a bit of misdirection in the story that led to a satisfying surprise for viewers. Some wondered why the Night King was so obsessed with killing Bran in the first place, an idea that had only been explained in the previous episode, “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.” “He wants to erase this world, and I am its memory,” Bran said, in explaining the plan to use himself as bait. And then there were questions about why certain characters died the way they did. Also hanging out there: Why wasn’t the Night King burned by dragon fire? What, exactly, was the plan supposed to be with the dragons? Come to think of it, what sort of battle strategy involves sending your cavalry in first, instead of using your aerial support? Did no one — Tyrion? Sam? — think for a second that a crypt full of corpses would be a dangerous place to shelter when the White Walkers come calling? “Hands down one of the best character performances in any show I’ve watched over the years,” one user wrote in what was one of the most popular recent posts on the “Game of Thrones” subreddit on Monday. Fans of the show are trained to see their favorite characters die (R.I.P. Ned Stark). Notably, the battle saw the deaths of Ser Jorah and Lyanna Mormont (and therefore what remained of House Mormont). But some fans complained and joked about the lack of other big deaths, arguing that the show had set expectations too high before Sunday’s episode. With three episodes down and three to go, a number of major (and minor) characters are still alive, despite an episode that showed many of them fighting for their lives: Brienne of Tarth, Jaime Lannister, Tyrion Lannister, Tormund Giantsbane, Gendry, Podrick, and all the remaining Stark children. But others defended the choice.",The New York Times
2019,‘Game of Thrones’ Is Ending. But You Can Still Visit Westeros.,"As the spiritual and production home of HBO’s sprawling fantasy drama, Northern Ireland has been transformed by the show. We take you there. CUSHENDUN, Northern Ireland — The many marvels dotting the dramatic Antrim Coast of Northern Ireland include a cluster of eerily beautiful caves in this tidy village, around 45 miles north of Belfast. Formed by 400 million years of shifting red stone and the surging slate-blue Irish Sea, the caves inspire awed reflection upon the raw power of nature and the irresistible imprint of time, among other musings on the mystic. A voice whispered into my ear: “That’s where Melisandre gave birth to the shadow monster.” So it was — I knew it was around there somewhere, as did the dozens of “Game of Thrones” fans surrounding me, feverishly snapping selfies before returning to their tour bus in a nearby parking lot. The voice belonged to my own guide, Flip Robinson, a 6-foot-8, magnificently bearded man who previously parlayed his stature into a gig as a stand-in for behemoth characters like Hodor and the Mountain. He waved to a colleague as she led her group away as suddenly as it had arrived, and off toward Braavos or the Iron Islands or some other “Thrones” location down the road. Since debuting as an expensive curiosity in 2011, “Game of Thrones” has gone on to become one of the world’s most influential pop culture franchises, leaving a dragon-size footprint on everything it touches. Nowhere is that dynamic more visible and tangible than the production’s former home, which, as the series kicks off its final season on HBO on April 14, is poised to serve as the keeper of the “Thrones” flame. “Game of Thrones” has filmed all over the globe, including in Croatia, Spain, Morocco, Iceland and Malta, and other locations have become synonymous with the show, for better and worse. But as the home of not only the production, in Belfast’s Titanic Studios, but also Westeros itself, Northern Ireland has been transformed in fact and figment. As the series altered the TV landscape, it also altered actual landscapes: For millions of viewers all over the world, this country has been redefined and remade in the show’s image. In the process, Belfast’s filmmaking industry has gone from a sleepy endeavor to a powerhouse. “‘Game of Thrones’ changed everything,” said Richard Williams, the chief executive of Northern Ireland Screen, which promotes film and television production in the country. “We are relevant — it is basically night and day.” The region has also built a tourism economy on the back of the show, especially on the coast, which provided much of the outdoor scenery. This majestic stretch of landscape and its famously scenic Causeway Coastal Route is now crisscrossed with motor coaches bearing “Thrones” pilgrims. Elsewhere, spots like the Castle Ward estate, near Strangford, site of the original Winterfell, have seen crowds swell with thousands of fans each year. All told, “Thrones” has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars into the region. But the financial benefit might actually pale compared with a more existential one in a place that for decades was known internationally mostly for sectarian violence. “Twenty years ago, you would have been here writing about the Troubles, not a TV show,” Gary Hawthorne, one of my drivers, told me during my visit. Robinson said, “Fake violence has helped bring us back from the real violence.” Part of the outsize impact “Thrones” has had on Northern Ireland comes from the size of the production relative to the size of the place, which was a main reason it was such an ideal home base. At 5,460 square miles, the country is a bit larger than Connecticut (with just over half as many residents, at around 1.9 million). But within that area is an astounding array of scenery that is particularly suited to a medieval fantasy saga. “We had 63 locations in 10 years, every single one of them within and hour and a half of Belfast,” said Robert Boake, the supervising location manager in Northern Ireland. This became apparent on the afternoon I spent driving with Robinson along the causeway, a twisting roadway that hugs the U-shaped glens of the coast, the Irish Sea on one side and villages and vertiginous green hillsides, strewn with sheep, on the other. In mere hours, we spanned Westeros and beyond, moving from the Wall and Castle Black (Magheramorne quarry), to the stairs where Arya crawled out of the Braavos canal (Carnlough Harbor) to the rocky shoreline in Pyke (Ballintoy) where the Greyjoys did nutty Greyjoy stuff. We also closed the shadow-baby loop, strolling around the Stormlands meadow (near Murlough Bay) where Renly made camp until Melisandre’s monster got ahold of him. Occasionally we stopped to walk around and by turns get lashed with rain, pummeled by wind and caressed by crystalline sunshine. (“In Northern Ireland, you get four seasons in one day,” Robinson told me, which I eventually came to realize is a national slogan.) At Fair Head outside Ballycastle, we parked in a muddy lot, dropped a few pounds in the honor box and walked uphill through a horizontal downpour. About 20 minutes later, the rain was gone and the sun dried our faces as gale-force gusts threatened to blow us over the edge of a sheer cliff dropping hundreds of feet to the rocky coast. We’d arrived at Dragonstone, or the dazzling headland the Targaryen family stronghold was C.G.I.’d upon, anyway. To stand where the impossibly green meadow gives way to gray granite cliffs plummeting toward the sea, as you note the spot where Tyrion and Daenerys argued over strategy, where Jon Snow met Drogon, is to feel the frisson of an epic story meeting an epic landscape. This reciprocity between project and place extends beyond the countryside. Another reason the marriage between “Thrones” and the region has been happier than any on the show is that the production’s material needs — armor, medieval weapons, elaborate costumes and jewelry — meshed well with the area’s longstanding artisanal traditions. “We’re good at that stuff,” Williams said. Even when a fight was filmed in a place like Morocco, the spears were almost always built in Belfast. Fans who would like to try on a replica of Cersei’s crown can often do so at Steensons jewelers in Ballymena, because that’s where the original and other Westerosi finery were designed and made. (Though when I stopped in, I was told that the show had commandeered it for Season 8 — spoiler alert, I guess?) This may be one explanation for the general lack of resentment evident in other locations besieged by “Thrones” tourists, like Dubrovnik, the exterior home of King’s Landing, which has been almost totally overrun. “There are not many people in this country who haven’t been involved in some direct capacity,” Boake said. “Their brother made something for the show, or their sister was an extra, or their cousin worked on an episode.” As we drove along the coast, Robinson reminisced about his time as Hodor’s double, dodging White Walker stuntmen in the Three-Eyed Raven’s cave as he dragged Bran’s double toward a green screen, in one of the show’s most famous scenes. “Then Kristian Nairn held the door,” he said. “He did the easy bit.” Robinson, 52, was a former carpenter laid low by the global financial crisis, working as a tour guide when he applied to be a “Thrones” extra. Soon he was facing off with the likes of Lena Headey and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as a stand-in for the undead Mountain, a stint that became the hook for his Giant Tours, which takes small groups of “Thrones” fans up and down the coast. “It changed my life around,” he said. The show has done the same for the region’s movie industry. A few films had been shot in Belfast’s cavernous old ship painting hall, now part of Titanic Studios (so named because it’s near where the doomed ocean liner, the city’s other most famous export, was built). But since “Thrones” took up residence there, it has turbocharged the business, conferring the credibility that comes from hosting the most elaborate TV series in history and training a generation of crew and craftspeople. Belfast has since added another enormous studio complex, Belfast Harbour Studios, the current home of Syfy’s Superman prequel series “Krypton,” and postproduction houses like Yellowmoon, which worked on “Thrones,” have significantly expanded. Then there’s the measurable financial impact: Over eight seasons, “Game of Thrones” has spent more than $275 million in the region, according to Northern Ireland Screen. Of course, two big questions hang over all the success. One involves how Brexit might affect the industry, though Williams notes that for the large-scale productions that are Belfast’s bread and butter, significantly more production spending comes from the United States than the European Union. The other: What happens now that “Thrones” is over? While everyone is cautiously optimistic that the planned “Thrones” prequel will go forward as a series, especially given the interest HBO’s new owner, AT&T, will have in extending such a lucrative franchise, they aren’t reliant upon it. “We’re getting calls every week,” Williams said. “I’m not in the slightest gloomy about our potential after ‘Game of Thrones,’” he added. “But at the same time, I would never want to diminish how unique a thing ‘Game of Thrones’ is.” The most common analogy holds that “Thrones” is to Northern Ireland what the “Lord of the Rings” movies were to New Zealand — a pop culture phenomenon that showcased a wondrous land for a global audience. But one difference is that “Thrones” has helped to redefine a city once known as one of the most dangerous places on earth. From the late 1960s to the late 1990s, the Troubles, which pit Protestant paramilitary groups loyal to the Crown against Catholic ones in favor of a unified, independent Ireland, claimed some 3,600 lives in bombings, sniper attacks and bloody street battles that ripped Belfast apart. Old divisions remain and have been infused with new anxiety by Brexit, because its unclear how it will affect the open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. But the show has helped “continue our peace process,” said Conleth Hill, better known to “Thrones” fans as the cunning Varys. As one of the few actors from Northern Ireland in the cast — he grew up and still lives in Ballycastle — Hill has observed the show’s impact from both inside and out. “Before the Troubles, there was loads of tourists coming through my town,” he said. “Now they’re coming again.” The swarms figure to increase when HBO turns several former “Thrones” sets across the region into immersive tourist attractions featuring costumes, weapons and other artifacts from the show. The first, the Game of Thrones Studio Tour at Linen Mill Studios in Banbridge, is slated to open in the spring of 2020. Tourism NI has aggressively courted Westeros set-jetters, creating a locations app and outfitting filming sites with information plaques for self-guided pilgrims, while keeping the many different “Thrones” tours from running afoul of HBO’s copyright lawyers. The show generates roughly $60 million per year in tourism income, said John McGrillen, the agency’s chief executive. The agency also promotes the link between the show and the region’s artisanal heritage with projects like the enormous “Game of Thrones” Tapestry, based on the Bayeux Tapestry in France; it uses Belfast’s world-famous linen-weaving expertise to depict the “Thrones” story. I saw it at the Ulster Museum, a few floors above an exhibition about the Troubles. The 217-foot-long tapestry recaps the entire tale, from King Robert’s arrival at Winterfell in the pilot to the zombie dragon Viserion demolishing the Wall in the Season 7 finale. (The artists will extend it to add the rest of the story after “Thrones” ends.) Much like the show itself, the tapestry is fundamentally bonkers but astounding in scale and execution, and a tremendous kick to experience. A still more immersive wallow in “Thrones”dom awaited me at Castle Ward, about an hour south of the city. The guide William Van der Kells greeted me in full Northern regalia: a black cloak and faux fur collar with a shiny gauntlet on one hand, holding a large sword made of “the finest Valyrian rubber.” A longtime National Trust site, Castle Ward added a “Winterfell tour” after the show shot much of the first season on the property, and promptly brought in more than 25,000 additional visitors a year. The Stark castle was based around the 1610 tower house, the same one Bran climbed to discover Jaime and Cersei in flagrante twincestus. We shot arrows on the spot in the courtyard the Stark children did in one of the first scenes of the series, a few yards from where Tyrion smacked Joffrey in one of the show’s most GIF-able moments. Then we drove through a driving rain to other locations on the property, like the tree where Robb Stark and Talisa fatefully tied the knot, before taking cover beneath an old castle near the site of Walder Frey’s (digitally projected) one, where it all ended badly. “Around here you get all four seasons in a day,” Van der Kells said. By then, I was wearing the cloak and snapping my own selfies to send to my daughter. The only shadow monster in evidence was the storm cloud dumping rain on me. But as I peered through the gloom and fog at the choppy Strangford Lough, it occurred to me that while I’d come to see how “Game of Thrones” had redefined Northern Ireland, what struck me most was how Northern Ireland had defined it.",The New York Times
2019,‘Game of Thrones’ Returns to Record Ratings in Season 8 Premiere,"SANTA MONICA, Calif. — After a 20-month absence, “Game of Thrones” stormed back on Sunday night, setting a new ratings record. The season premiere of the show’s eighth — and final — season had 17.4 million viewers, including viewership through its digital channels, HBO said. The previous record for a single episode of the series was 16.9 million, for the seventh-season finale in August 2017. HBO had 11.8 million viewers watching it the old-fashioned way on regular television, according to Nielsen. That narrowly missed the record of 12.1 million who watched the seventh-season finale on television. When there are more television shows than ever and so many of them are watched on viewers’ own schedules, “Thrones” is one of the few hit series left that qualify as appointment viewing. After Sunday night’s premiere, all of Twitter’s top trending topics in the United States were “Thrones”-related. Still, many more people will be watching it in the days to come. Last season, HBO said an average of 32.8 million viewers watched “Thrones.” There are only five episodes left in the series, with four of the last five episodes with run times at around 80 minutes. Sunday’s episode was a relatively modest 54 minutes. HBO is in victory lap mode as it finally wraps up the most popular show in its network’s history. The network is exploring ways to expand the “Thrones” franchise. A prequel will begin filming next month, though HBO executives have been reluctant to use the word “franchise” in its future development plans for a “Thrones” universe, the way Disney has taken advantage of its “Star Wars” franchise. But it is also an anxious time for the premium cable channel. AT&T, which assumed full ownership of HBO in June, has signaled that it’s bringing great change to Warner Media, HBO’s parent. Richard Plepler, HBO’s longtime chief executive, stepped down in late February after he felt that he was losing the independence that he was accustomed to. Several other HBO executives have departed in the months since. Robert Greenblatt, the former chairman of NBC Entertainment, took over as chairman of Warner Media’s entertainment division in March. And HBO will also have to find a way to keep subscribers happy as “Thrones” signs off. The season will conclude its run on May 19.",The New York Times

2019,"‘Game of Thrones’ Season 8, Episode 1: Dragon Rides and Awkward Reunions","Game of Thrones On Sunday, we finally returned to an era-defining show, gone for years, that captivated the world with its high-stakes melodrama woven from familiar human fallibility. That show was “Downton Abbey.” Because in the long-awaited Season 8 premiere of “Game of Thrones,” from the grand royal arrival onward, Winterfell resembled nothing so much as that great Edwardian manse of swollen emotion. Charged reunions, new conflicts and old grudges played themselves out upstairs and downstairs, inside and out, between siblings and exes, old friends and in-laws, much of it rippling outward from a haughty noblewoman no one liked all that much. Granted, I don’t recall Lady Mary ever incinerating anyone’s brother, as Daenerys did to poor Dickon Tarly last season. And instead of the dowager countess’s bon mots, we got Bran, just sitting there creeping everybody out. Overall it was a somewhat soapy but generally very satisfying setup for the final run of “Game of Thrones,” as the sides coalesced for the wars to come. Jon and Dany’s coalition of the living currently includes nearly everyone not named or sleeping with Cersei. She heads up the King’s Landing faction, and this week welcomed a mysterious new man — Capt. Strickland, leader of the Golden Company — onto the team and Euron into her bed, while inviting more speculation about her purported pregnancy with the departed Jaime. Meanwhile, the White Walkers remained on the march up north, stopping occasionally for refreshments and ghoulish arts and crafts. (O.K. that part was less “soapy” than “ghastly and terrifying.”) [So, who is able to ride a dragon? | And what exactly is the Golden Company and where are those elephants?] Nearly everyone we like has now made it to Winterfell, although they don’t always like one another all that much. Sansa and Tyrion reminisced about their cheerless but technically continuing marriage. The Hound, Gendry and Arya negotiated their complicated triangle, with a smitten Gendry displaying all the game you’d expect from a guy who’s been solo-rowing and hiding in blacksmith forges for the past few years. Jorah came in praise of Sam’s heroic greyscale treatment, but Dany ruined it by admitting she had executed his father and brother. And all that was before the arrival of Jaime, who, at last count: once shoved Bran out a window; will be hated by Sansa and Arya (though he’d asked Brienne — also at Winterfell! — to help them); killed Dany’s ally Lady Olenna; tried to kill Dany; and by the way, made his name by killing her dad. The point is, Winterfell is a fraught place, tense with history and the clashes of strong personalities. For most of its run, “Game of Thrones” has been defined by bigness and a far-flung story structure. But as it returns for the final hurrah, it feels constrained and claustrophobic, as people hash out their differences and drop revelation bombs within tight shadowy shots. [Want exclusive “Game of Thrones” interviews and news, as well as the internet’s best articles on that week’s episode? Sign up for our Season 8 newsletter here.] The constricted, almost Alamo-esque confines reinforced both the narrative notion that humanity is about to make its last stand — ideally the occupants are less doomed this time — and the thematic one that sometimes profound or painful differences must be overcome in order to solve the really big challenges. On Sunday, most of those differences involved Daenerys, whose revelation to Sam, if the most painful, was hardly the only awkward result of the putative King in the North arriving in thrall to the Dragon Queen. Because beyond the pageantry of the royal procession and beyond the awe inspired by the first dragon anyone had ever seen (and then the second), the defining emotions were mistrust and resentment. From the narrow-eyed glares of the Northern commoners to Sansa’s side-eyed ones, Jon’s return to Winterfell was like that time you brought your outspoken new flame home for Thanksgiving, X a billion. Leave it to the always excellent Lady Mormont to say what everyone was thinking. “You left Winterfell a king and came back … I’m not sure what you are now,” she said. “A lord? Nothing at all?” P.R. has always been a blind spot for Jon — his stark moral rectitude (pun intended) makes him oblivious to the fact that selling the right thing is sometimes as important as doing the right thing. And sure enough, there he was on Sunday, sticking to the same “I’m doing this for your own good” script that literally got him killed awhile back. It was left to Tyrion, whose failure to coach Jon on his messaging in advance was only his latest advisory failing, to attempt damage control. But then he just said something else that will come back to haunt him. We have the greatest army ever and two full-grown dragons, he said. “And soon the Lannister army will ride north to join our cause.” (“I used to think you were the cleverest man alive,” Sansa told him later, speaking for all of us. Bring back the man who drinks and knows things!) In the smaller chambers, Jon was slightly more effective. He and Sansa resumed their bickering later before reaching a fragile détente, though Sansa remains circumspect. “Did you bend the knee to save the North?” she asked. “Or because you love her?” Jon’s reunion with Arya out by the weirwood tree was the nicest moment of the episode, the two outsiders of the Stark family coming together with more unguarded warmth than either had displayed toward anyone else, save perhaps their father Ned. (Have you ever used Needle, Jon wondered. “Once or twice,” she said.) It made up for the trademark awkwardness of Jon’s reunion with Bran, although somewhere in his three-eyed database Bran appears to have stumbled upon some self-awareness. “Look at you,” Jon told him. “You’re a man.” “Almost,” he replied. In general, it probably wasn’t the homecoming Jon was hoping for. It was all enough to make you want to retreat to the countryside with your lady. [Read: Sophie Turner, Maisie Williams and Isaac Hempstead Wright discuss Sunday’s reunions.] At one time there was fairly fervent fan speculation about who would ultimately ride the show’s three dragons. Dany predictably took to Drogon a couple seasons ago and then, in an upset, the Night King claimed Viserion in Season 7. That left Rhaegal, the dragon named for Jon’s father, though he didn’t realize it. (Yet.) Sure enough, Dany coaxed Jon aboard, and after a brief bit of Dragons Ed — the neck-scale equivalent of 10-and-2 being “whatever you can hold on to” — they were off. Soon Jon had Rhaegal fairly under control, and the couple was enjoying a loins-stirring ride through the North. It was all … fine. Look, I am not immune to the charms of new romance. That said, the whole sequence made me think about how many times I’ve told skeptical, fantasy-averse friends that “Game of Thrones” is not what they think it is. Because for a few minutes, as the strings swelled and two gloriously maned young royals frolicked on dragons above a wintry landscape, it totally was. It also might amount to a final moment of bliss for Jonerys because the big bomb was about to drop at Winterfell. If Sam had been feeling hesitant about revealing Jon’s true parentage to him, he was less so after he learned his new queen had torched his family. For his part, Jon seemed more upset about the besmirching of Ned’s honorable reputation than about the upending of his own ideas about himself, though he could be forgiven for a certain amount of compartmentalization. “I know it’s a lot to take,” Sam said in a hilarious bit of understatement, before driving the wedge that only figures to get wider and more painful over the next few weeks. “You gave up your crown to save your people — would she do the same?” We know the answer, and so does Jon. Perhaps Davos and Tyrion’s plan to package the candidates as a power couple will soothe brittle egos, although it seems unlikely — we’ve seen how well Tyrion’s plans work out these days. We’ll have to wait for next week, at least, to learn the ramifications for that, as well as to learn how he responds to Jaime’s revelation that Cersei was lying, of course, about helping out in the war against the dead. (I’m already looking forward to Sansa’s reaction.) Down in King’s Landing, Cersei was in peak Cersei form, drinking wine, conniving with Qyburn, meet-and-greeting new mercenaries and having bored sex with her bug-eyed suitor. Wait — drinking wine? You’ll recall she pointedly declined to imbibe when discussing her alleged pregnancy with both Jaime and Tyrion, but there she was, having a postcoital glass as she instructed Euron to collect his things and hit the bricks. So was that just stagecraft with her brothers? A Machiavellian tactic designed to inspire devotion in Jaime and credulity in Tyrion? Perhaps, though that was a rare bit of raw anguish we saw from Cersei after Euron crassly announced his own dad-goals. The only things she has ever demonstrably cared about was Jaime and her children. Was her pain triggered by the loss of Jaime? The loss of the unborn child? All or none of the above? One vote against its being Jaime was that she sicced Bronn on him. Bronn — whom we’re repeatedly told cares only about himself and his own enrichment, even as he’s done all sorts of heroic stuff for Jaime and Tyrion — is now officially on their collective tail. Cersei has requested that he use that infernal crossbow, the ultimate emblem of Lannister toxicity. (Or an instrument of “poetic justice,” if you’re Cersei.) The Brothers Lannister have other concerns these days, of course, and the crossbow-for-hire subplot is probably just a means to get Bronn to Winterfell with everyone else before the big White Walker clash. But there’s one person we know definitely won’t be there: Little Ned Umber. You might recall that we met Ned last season, when Sansa wanted to take castles away from him and another child, Alys Karstark, because their fathers sided with Ramsay in the Battle of the Bastards. Those castles, Last Hearth and Karhold, also happen to be the first the White Walkers would encounter after breaching the Wall. But Jon intervened, saying he wouldn’t punish children for the sins of their fathers. Turns out he did Ned no favors. Losing his house probably would have been preferable to being transformed into spin art of the damned. We first got reacquainted with the boy early on Sunday, when he told Sansa and Jon he needed more horses and wagons in order to get his people back to Winterfell. He no longer needs horses or wagons, having been turned into a flaming jump-scare machine at Last Hearth. “It’s a message from the Night King,” Beric Dondarrion said. That message would seem to be, get all your melodrama out of the way now. Because your real problems have only just begun. • Euron wanted to keep Yara around to talk to because he was surrounded by mutes. (You might recall him explaining to his brother Balon, before he killed him, that he cut out the tongues of his crew because “I needed silence.”) But he’ll need to find someone else because Theon rescued Yara and was head-butted for his troubles. (Well, that and abandoning her to Euron last season.) As always, in a show with more than its fair share of crazy, the Greyjoys are in a special class. • That said, they link the various threads in interesting ways. Theon is headed back to Winterfell to join the Stark cause, a fitting culmination for his continuing redemption arc. More intriguing was Euron’s clear willingness to ditch Cersei if it suits him, and Yara’s plan to head home in case Daenerys needs “somewhere to retreat if they can’t hold the North, somewhere the dead can’t go.” Could be foreshadowing; could be nothing. • Fun fact: Sunday’s premiere was the first post-#MeToo episode of “Game of Thrones.” The show celebrated by plying Bronn with nude prostitutes. It was a “Thrones” throwback — the series has mostly abandoned the gateway gratuitous sex of early seasons — and perhaps one last kiss-off from a show that’s been known to tweak its scolders. (See also: the close-up of the venereally afflicted actor in Season 6, after complaints about insufficient male nudity.) • My colleague James Poniewozik wrote about how as “Game of Thrones” has gone on, it has become a “dragon-delivery device,” with character and narrative development becoming secondary to spectacle. A related quibble: The dragons themselves have become dad joke-delivery devices. See Drogon’s stink eye during Jon and Dany’s date, or Jon’s quip about how Rhaegal “completely ruined horses for me.” What does a dragon eat? Sansa wondered. “Anything it wants,” Dany says. And so on. It’s a small thing, but this show doesn’t wear corniness well. • “The last time we spoke was at Joffrey’s wedding, a miserable affair,” Tyrion told Sansa. “It had its moments,” she replied. See? That’s actually funny. • I’m looking forward to seeing how Jaime’s arrival shakes up things at Winterfell — we haven’t even mentioned the Jaime-Brienne-Tormund love triangle. (Tormund arrives next week.) I’m also glad the show seems to be dispensing with the reunions and revelations fairly quickly, rather than letting them hang over these last episodes, which have plenty else to sort out before this thing is done. • What about you? Was the return to Westeros everything you hoped it would be? Do Jon and Dany have any future at all? (“Nothing lasts,” Varys intoned portentously.) Are we positive Lady Mary never incinerated anyone’s brother? (She sexed a guy to death but there was no fire — maybe she’s saving it for the movie.) Please share your thoughts in the comments.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Game of Thrones’ Season 8, Episode 2 Recap: The Things We Do for Love","Game of Thrones “The things I do for love.” “Game of Thrones” essentially began with that quip, a romantic cliché given twisted new meaning by its context, as a cad shoved a child to his presumed death in order to protect his secret affair with his own twin sister. Plenty has happened since then. The child is now a cryptic wizard and the cad has been broken down and rebuilt — at times literally, in the case of his behanding — partly because a giant warrior maiden brought out his better self and partly because he was never really all that bad. (Given what we’ve learned about Jaime over the years, the cavalier way he defenestrated Bran way back then doesn’t really scan.) But Jaime’s past still precedes him, which meant that before he would be allowed to fight for the living, as he pledged on Sunday (and in the trailer), he would have to face up to it. This was most fraught with Daenerys, the daughter of the madman Jaime killed to secure his kingslaying reputation. It was most hilarious with Bran, who threw Jaime’s words back at him. “Everything I did, I did for my house and my family,” Jaime said at his mock trial. “The things we do for love,” Bran said. It was both an excellent callback and a fun way to mess with a guy who, again, once shoved him out a window. But Bran’s quip also suggested a theme for the episode, as people gathered all over Winterfell for a final bit of human tenderness before the terrible White Walker horns echoed across the wintry waste. [Read our interview with Florence and the Machine’s frontwoman, who sang the haunting end credits song.] Missandei and Grey Worm. Arya and the Hound. Arya and Gendry. Sam and Gilly. Sansa and Theon. The Lannister brothers hosted a drinking and knighting party by the fire, enlivened by Pod’s lovely voice and Tormund’s nutty giant stories. (Every party needs a Tormund. But only one.) As the motley group of mismatched, formerly antagonistic and wildly disparate folks from all over the Known World girded themselves for what might be, for many of them, their last night on earth, they sought strength and solace from one another. It made for some nice moments. Tyrion was fun again, even if Dany has grown as weary as the rest of us with his incompetent handing after Jaime confirmed that, of course, Cersei lied to everyone. But Tyrion rebounded to lead the proceedings by the fire and make fun jokes about his miserable family. At least Cersei won’t be the one to kill me, he told Jaime, though I wish Father was here to see his sons die for Winterfell. Brienne accepted her knighthood from Jaime with perhaps her first moment of unbridled joy. Sam handed his family sword to Jorah, restoring a piece of the disgraced nobleman’s soul in the process. Grey Worm and Missandei, the sweetest romance in this story, made hopeful postwar plans to ditch the racist villagers of the North. And while I bagged on Gendry’s game last week, after his fumbling flirting with Arya, I stand corrected. The only one not meeting the moment with a sort of ragged grace was Jon Snow, who kept darting out of rooms like a sweaty-palmed preteen in order to avoid his girlfriend. She finally cornered him in his brooding cave, a.k.a. the Winterfell crypt, and he let it all out. It went about as well as you’d expect. “If it were true,” Daenerys said through gritted teeth, “you’d have a claim to the Iron Throne.” True — also, your boyfriend’s your nephew. But the fact that throne claims are your first concern portends some real conflict even after the White Walker war, assuming you both make it out alive. Dany has done her best to fit into Winterfell, dealing with abundant awkwardness and making concessions, like agreeing to let Jaime stick around on Sunday. “I’m here because I love your brother,” she told Sansa later. But the one thing she won’t accept are any perceived threats to her ultimate supremacy. Two weeks in a row, she’s dangled threats over the mostly unimpressed Sansa. “If she doesn’t respect me …” Dany told Jon last week, letting our imaginations finish the sentence. On Sunday things seemed better until Sansa outlined the North’s general aversion to knee-bending. “We said we’d never bow to anyone else again,” Sansa said, and then Dany released her sisterly grip on her hand. So how will she deal with this revelation? We didn’t find out this week because the White Walkers blew their horn. But if Jon felt the need to avoid Dany before he dropped his genetic bombshell, next week he might want to make one of his trademark charges right through the wight army, and just keep running. But as all eyes turn toward next week’s battle, I was instead reminded of Season 1. Specifically I thought of Maester Aemon, speaking of secret Targaryens, and his speech to Jon outlining one of the main themes of “Game of Thrones”: the tension between loyalty and duty. You’ll recall that Jon wanted to abandon the Night’s Watch to join Robb’s war effort, but Aemon reminded him of his oath and shared his own tale of family tragedy. “Love is the death of duty,” he said. “We all do our duty when there’s no cost to it,” he added. But eventually “there comes a day when it is not easy, a day when he must choose.” A younger, more tempestuous Jon greeted this with angst, stricken by having to choose his vows over his blood. But does an even more wrenching decision await him in the next few weeks? The people at Winterfell, just by virtue of being there, have already made their choices. On the night before their date with the White Walkers, they wallowed in the cost of this duty, indulging in gallows humor and fellowship to distract from the undead hordes bearing down on the castle. If blind loyalty to one’s clan is what led to much of the death and destruction that defined the story, at least in the early days, loyalty to the larger human family is what has led them to make this final stand. In this last week before the big White Walker clash and the presumable carnage and loss of beloved characters it will entail, it was a reminder that the things we do for love can be heroic, too. • The Bran Plan amounts to turning him into a three-eyed Rat-L-Trap to lure in the Night King in order for Jon and the gang to kill him, and thus take out everyone he has turned into wights. (You’ll recall that was the key bit of intel gained from the otherwise foolish voyage north of the Wall last season.) Sounds good. What could go wrong? • That song Pod sang was called “Jenny of Oldstones,” a melancholy ballad to reflect the episode’s general sense of final shared moments and impending doom. The version heard over the titles was by Florence + the Machine — you might recall bands like the National (“The Rains of Castamere”) and the Hold Steady (“The Bear and the Maiden Fair”) doing similar recordings in earlier seasons. Sigur Ros also appeared as a beleaguered wedding band at Joffrey and Margaery’s interrupted nuptials. • Direwolf watch: Ghost made a two-second cameo Sunday night, as if to establish his presence for some larger future role. Hmmm … • Jaime did make amends with Bran, apologizing for the whole window thing. “I’m not that person anymore,” he said. “You still would be if you hadn’t pushed me out of that window,” Bran replied, which … I don’t know. Jaime has undergone a dramatic evolution, but it’s unclear how much of that was a core change as opposed to him acting on more compassionate impulses that were always there. We met him as the Kingslayer, the widely loathed villain, but another of the show’s favorite themes is the gap between history and reality — the story of what happened versus what actually happened. (Think of the story of Rhaegar and Lyanna, or the sword fight at the Tower of Joy.) We learned later that Jaime actually saved the realm from the fiery depredations of the Mad King. And it didn’t take long for him to start helping Brienne and, by extension, the Stark girls, based on a pledge to their dead mother. So was he really ever as bad as his Bran-shoving implied? • There were shades of Shireen in that little village girl who wanted to fight, charming Davos in the process. • Starting next Sunday, I imagine heroes will start dropping with some regularity. I can’t have been the only viewer playing a macabre mental game this week: Do these characters’ nice moments mean they’re about to die? This week’s candidates include the freshly knighted Brienne and Grey Worm, who’s already picking out condos for him and Missandei in Naath, pretty much guaranteeing that one or both won’t live long enough to sign the lease. • I guess you could throw Gendry in this category, too. And Theon. And … actually, I guess you could throw most people in it at this point. Who seems the most doomed to you next week? And whom are you pulling for the hardest?

2019,"‘Game of Thrones’ Season 8, Episode 3 Recap: An Epic Battle Presented at a Human Scale","Game of Thrones “Game of Thrones” has several outstanding battles under its belt, and the director Miguel Sapochnik delivered some of the best, with “Hardhome” and “Battle of the Bastards.” But even with that impressive track record, I was a little afraid that Sunday night’s enormous (and enormously hyped) Battle of Winterfell might finally be the clash that was too epic for its own good, in terms of stakes (life vs. death), personnel (everyone we like) and length (the episode clocked in at 1:22). Would we finally, in the grandest episode the show has ever attempted, get a fight that was just too large to render in a way that would both do justice to the conflict and also land with sufficient emotional impact? Not today. Sunday’s final clash was a masterpiece of tension and release, goose bumps and heartbreak, grandiosity and intimacy. It deftly mixed genres (horror, action, melodrama), shots and planes of action as it shifted from the chaos of the fighting in and around Winterfell, to the claustrophobic terror of the crypts, to the dragon dogfighting in the winter sky. [Read our ultimate guide to “Game of Thrones.”] Since C.G.I. became Hollywood’s default mode for depicting combat, onscreen battles have become progressively bigger, longer, more elaborate and, consequently, ever more fatiguing. Think of the hectic, numbing, city-destroying sequences that end every superhero movie. (I haven’t seen the new “Avengers,” so apologies to the Russo brothers if it managed to eschew that particular cliché.) “Game of Thrones” has mostly avoided this convention by making its battles collections of memorable, revealing moments rather than epic clashes that overwhelm with chaotic slashing, crashing and spurting. There is plenty of that, of course, but what you remember is Ygritte dying in Jon’s arms in the Battle of Castle Black, the Night King raising the dead at Hardhome, Bronn’s incredible sprint for the Scorpion during the Loot Train Attack (still a super dumb name). Similarly, when I look back on the Battle of Winterfell, I’ll think of the stirring scene when the Dothraki swords ignited in a wave of fire, only to extinguish one by one in the distance. I’ll remember Theon getting absolution, and Lyanna sacrificing herself to kill a zombie giant in a deeply symbolic if very sad moment, the smallest warrior felling the largest foe. (Wun-Wun, is that you?) Arya’s climactic dispatching of the Night King — saving Bran with the same dagger once intended to kill him — was genuinely surprising and thrillingly rendered. [Read more about the dagger’s complex history.] The death toll included demises predictable (Theon, Jorah) and less so (Melisandre!), but each was deeply felt and in service of individual purposes, one of the episode’s big themes. Jorah died the way he would have wanted, protecting his beloved Khaleesi. Beric saved Arya so she could save everyone else. And Edd bought it by becoming the first of several people to rescue Sam, who spent most of the episode on his back, screaming. It wasn’t flawless. I thought Rhaegal might have died, too, until he showed up in the trailer for next week’s episode. Over all, the dragon scenes were pretty hard to track, especially the air war. Thanks to the fact that the action was very dark, per usual, and the dragons hard to tell apart — some contrasting saddles would have been nice — I frequently couldn’t tell who was who and what exactly was going on. [Read more about what worked — and what didn’t — in a murky episode.] There was also a surprising abundance of heroes still standing at the end. I figured folks like Brienne, Podrick, Grey Worm, Tormund and maybe even Gilly, or some other notable person in the crypt, would have gone down this week. Considering the scale and relentlessness of the swarm — especially after the Night King did his signature reanimation move — they probably should have. (A certain amount of suspended disbelief is called for in epic battle scenes, but is the show just saving them for the next war? Or is its “no one is safe” edge truly gone for good?) But over all, despite the scale of the clash and the endless hype we’ve been hearing about the 55 nights of shoots that went into filming it, et cetera, the Battle of Winterfell actually exceeded expectations. It began with a lengthy tracking shot through the castle’s courtyard, following Sam and then Lyanna and finally Tyrion as people like Bran and Theon passed through, reinforcing the human connections before it all went off. It was a sign that the episode was going to 1.) embrace creative shotmaking, and 2.) be about people, not opposing sides. Throughout, Sapochnik and the show’s creators, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, who wrote the episode, skipped from character to character to shrink the churning battle down to human scale. The chaotic fog of war was well represented but so was fear and desperation — the Hound’s terror, Grey Worm’s heavy breathing — as the dead poured through and over every obstacle. Sapochnik reportedly watched “Lord of the Rings” war scenes to gauge when battle fatigue kicks in and looked for opportunities to pare away action so that the moments of violence and loss would feel more meaningful. That was evident in the episode’s pacing, which followed intense fighting sequences with quieter moments and clever transitions that illustrated the scope of the battle, as when the view shot upward after Lyanna’s death to join a dragon clash. Once the action moved inside, the episode turned into a horror movie, with Arya dodging the more bookish wights in the library before joining Beric and the Hound in the zombie-plagued hallways of Winterfell. The mechanics of horror and suspense picked up where the implacable battlefield onslaught left off, a sort of second-stage narrative rocket infusing the survival story with a new visceral kick. As for how Arya made it through said zombie-plagued hallways in order to save the day, er, night … your guess is as good as mine. I’ll also leave it to others to theorize about what the Night King’s flame retardancy might suggest about his lineage and whatnot, though I guess it doesn’t matter anymore anyway. But I’ll take the occasional loose end in exchange for a big, audacious episode that sticks the landing. From the beginning, “Game of Thrones” has promised a clash of ice and fire, and on Sunday that’s what we got — a story of life overcoming the forces of annihilation told at a scale and level of execution rarely seen on television or anywhere else. There have been plenty of times over the years that the show has left me cold. But not today. • Daenerys and Jon continue to suggest that neither is ready to rule anything, from a brainpower standpoint. She just sat there on a grounded Drogon until the wights swarmed him like undead fleas. Later Jon stood up and squared off against an actual zombie dragon, only to be saved by Arya. Nice job, Targaryens. • “Maybe we should have stayed married,” Tyrion told Sansa. “You were the best of them,” she said. Their reunion has been one of my favorite things about this season. • I know Sansa has been jerked around by plenty of royals in her day, but it seems petty when she can’t resist a Dragon Queen dig even in the bunker of death. She would have split up our marriage anyway, she quipped. Without the Dragon Queen we’d all be dead, Missandei clapped back. • Melisandre’s like a Zippo with a balky flint, but eventually she does the job. • R.I.P. Viserion, for real this time. • What happened to Ghost? He also shows up in next week’s trailer but where did he go on Sunday? • What did you think? Did enough people die? Will you miss the Night King? Where all did Bran’s ravens go anyway? (He was gone forever.) Please share your theories in the comments.",The New York Times
2019,‘Game of Thrones’ Season 8: Will Daenerys Turn? Will Dragons Fight? Is the Iron Throne Even the Point?,"After weeks of obsessive coverage — we’ve done our fair share — “Game of Thrones” begins its final season Sunday on HBO. Earlier this week, Jeremy Egner, The Times’s TV editor and “Thrones” recapper; Jennifer Vineyard, who writes The Times’s “Thrones” newsletter; and Sopan Deb, a sports reporter (and former culture reporter) for The Times, talked about the show and its final season in a conference call with Times subscribers. [Read our complete guide to “Game of Thrones” and sign up for our newsletter.] This discussion has been adapted and edited from that conversation. (Subscriber questions are in italics.) Audio of the entire discussion is available here. SOPAN DEB Based on the trailers, a lot of action in Season 8 seems to take place at Winterfell. What do you make of that? JEREMY EGNER Well if you remember, the show itself starts at Winterfell — it started with King Robert’s arrival to come take Ned to King’s Landing. So there’s a certain symmetry to Daenerys’s and Jon Snow’s arrival that you see in the trailer. JENNIFER VINEYARD It sets up a little bit of how the structure of the entire series works. A lot of things are going to be repeating themselves, and I think that will continue to play out. We’re coming full circle in some ways. EGNER One of the pleasures of the show over the past couple seasons has been seeing all these really far-flung people come together, and either meet one another for the first time, or be reunited for the first time in years. At Winterfell, reunions are going to be happening all over the place. Arya is there, and Gendry and the Hound could be there. Jaime seems to be on his way, and Bran, who he once shoved out of a window, is already there. Dany’s also going to be there — and by the way, Jaime killed Dany’s dad. Jon Snow is presumably going to learn from Bran and Sam about how he’s the rightful heir. And Sansa doesn’t seem to be all that in love with the idea of bending the knee to Dany. So it could be a soap opera of reunion and recrimination. [Read about 9 questions the final season must answer.] DEB Is there a story line that you’re particularly interested in? EGNER A big intriguing one I mentioned in an earlier season preview is: Will Dany break mad? I think it was Cersei who said “When a Targaryen is born, the gods flip a coin,” and obviously Dany’s father was murderous and insane. And we’ve seen both sides of that coin, so to speak, with Dany. She sees herself as a liberator, and she has tried to free and lift up the downtrodden, and she does seem to have a genuine concern for her people and her dragons. At the same time, we’ve also seen glimpses of cruelty, like when she torched the Tarlys. We also see the people around her like Tyrion and Varys — they’re still not entirely sure how that whole thing’s going to shake out. So you take that history, and then apply it to the context of her arriving as an interloper into Winterfell about to find out that her boyfriend is actually her nephew, and, by the way, has more of a claim on the throne than she does. I mean—— DEB Bad date. EGNER Yeah that’s hard on any new relationship, much less one that involves dragons. We’re all in love with the dragons, and I’m interested to hear your theories about how their story line will play out in Season 8. The Viserion situation definitely broke my heart. — Lara, New York VINEYARD There’s a huge history of the Targaryens using dragons to fight battles with each other. And the show’s sound designer mentioned at one point that she had planned the sound for Viserion, when he is screeching, to be very different from the sound of Drogon and Rhaegal, because she wanted there to be a distinction, should you ever hear them fight each other. She was planning ahead for that for a reason. EGNER It’s kind of like Chekhov’s Gun: You don’t have a zombie ice dragon in the first act if you’re not going to use it by the third. So I think there’s definitely going to be a clash between the dragons, and, again, I’m leaning toward Daenerys going the way of her father to a certain degree, in which case the dragons become weapons. In which case, you have to figure there’s a lot of people looking to bring them down. Long story short: I know you’re in love with them, but I don’t have high hopes for their future. But I’m happy to be proved wrong. [Read why “Game of Thrones” has become a “dragon-delivery device.”] DEB Let’s talk about some characters. When we first met Cersei in Season 1, she seemed, if not loving, at least very protective of her children. But by the time Jaime turned his back on her last season, it seemed like she had been consumed. Is there any humanity left in Cersei at this point? VINEYARD I think that strain has always been there with her; she just never had the ability to do certain things. She was always trying to rule through her husband, or through her children, and now she’s finally having a chance to do what she wanted to do in the first place. She’s never actually cared about people other than her own immediate family. She only cares about the acquisition of power and being able to do whatever she wants. So it’s not that she’s lost her humanity — this is just her chance to actually express what she’s always wanted to do. EGNER It’s the purest expression of who she is and her values. That said, she has been a caring mother in her own twisted way, and there is the mystery of whether or not she is pregnant. Because she said that last season, but she’s also very calculating and it was something to use as leverage with Jaime and Tyrion. So that’s one of the questions that this season is going to have to answer pretty quickly: whether or not that’s even a legitimate thing. [Read about how Northern Ireland has been remade in Westeros’s image.] DEB How much do we really know about the Night King? VINEYARD He likes long walks on the beach, red wine. EGNER I’m pretty sure he’s a Scorpio. VINEYARD The problem with the Night King is he doesn’t talk. So he doesn’t tell us much about what he wants, or what he’s trying to do, at least not verbally — we can try to infer some things by the weird art installations he likes to leave behind. He does seems to always be prepared. And I don’t know if it’s just because he’s a greenseer and he can see the future the way Bran can, but when Dany came to rescue the people behind the Wall, he was ready with the right kind of ice spears to take down a dragon. EGNER And chains. VINEYARD Yeah did he go shopping beforehand? EGNER There was a Pep Boys on the other side of the mountain. VINEYARD So we can infer that he has some sort of psychic ability, but beyond that we don’t know a lot about him. Do you have any thoughts on if any presumed dead characters will return to the show? My son was curious about Littlefinger. — Steven, New York EGNER That’s a theory that’s been going around, basically holding that it wasn’t Littlefinger who we saw get killed at the end of Season 7 — that he had perhaps paid off a Faceless Man to take his place and will be making a return appearance. That seems far-fetched to me but it’s gotten some traction, to the point that some gambling sites are including Littlefinger in their prop bets for who will eventually sit on the Iron Throne. VINEYARD It’s probably more likely that he didn’t do any of that, but Arya kept his face. Because if she ever wanted to sneak into, say, the Red Keep and get close to Cersei or someone in order to kill them, it might be helpful to not be herself. And Arya likes to hang onto faces, as we know. She’s got a whole bag of them. DEB As one does. VINEYARD It’s so much easier than having to run back to Braavos to get fresh ones. DEB Of course the big question people talk about is who’s going to end up on the Iron Throne in the end? But does that actually miss the point of the show? VINEYARD I think it does. Because I don’t think this is a story about who is the rightful king and who should be on the throne. The whole idea of the story, in a way, is to critique those kinds of fantasy tropes. You have things like, in “Lord of the Rings,” where Aragorn has the right bloodline, and he’s a good man, and therefore he should be the ruler of the realm. But that doesn’t necessarily mean he knows how to rule. A lot of these story lines are about characters learning how to rule. That’s what Dany’s experience in Meereen is about. That’s what Jon’s experience at the Night’s Watch is about. That these people have to actually learn how to do things before they can become a ruler, and even so, should bloodlines and prophecies even matter? Maybe they don’t, and maybe this country is on the verge of actually adopting something beyond an absolute monarchy. Maybe this story is basically about the turning point in how Westeros got rid of the monarchist agendas. I think it’s a drive toward democracy. EGNER It’s also a pretty explicit critique of tribalism. It’s driven by these cycles of revenge, these cycles of violence. It is house against house, somebody ends up with their head cut off and then that person’s offspring wants revenge on the other family, and so on. There’s a supposition that the show is about who ends up on the Iron Throne, but at the same time, the Iron Throne itself is this symbol of all of this terribly toxic violence. So I don’t think that really is the ultimate answer of this show. In fact, if I had to put money on it, I don’t think the Iron Throne itself will survive the show. I don’t think you can watch some of the awfulness we’ve watched over the past eight years, and then say, “O.K. Jon, now you get to sit in this thing that is the source of all of that strife and terribleness.” So I think the whole Iron Throne pursuit is almost a red herring, in a way. [Will “Game of Thrones” ever really be over? Unlikely.] VINEYARD Even that whole thing of calling Jon the true heir is kind of a red herring — the Targaryen line was removed because the Mad King was murdering people for no reason, and no monarch should have the ability. So their first move was just to put in another monarch, but I think eventually they’re going to start to realize that they need to have some other system of rule. What has Dany done with Meereen and Slaver’s Bay since she’s gone? Or now Dragon’s Bay? She left a council, or other people, to rule. And Tyrion’s been bringing this up to her, the whole question of succession. The Night’s Watch has a system, the Iron Islands has a system. There are other systems to rule that maybe they could start to consider, so it doesn’t have to necessarily be a king and a queen just perpetuating a system that is broken.",The New York Times
2019,‘Game of Thrones’ Studio Tour to Debut in 2020,"This month marks the beginning of the end for “Game of Thrones,” the globally popular HBO hit that will kick off its final season on April 14. But beginning next year, “Thrones” fans will be able to get their Westeros fix in person. HBO is turning one of the show’s former studios in Northern Ireland into a 110,000-square-foot tourist attraction. The Game of Thrones Studio Tour will be an interactive exhibition of the show’s sets, costumes, weapons and other props, and include exhibits that break down how the technically ambitious fantasy blockbuster was made. It will open in spring 2020. “It’s going to be an immersive experience where fans will feel like they are inside their favorite sets from the show,” said Jeff Peters, HBO’s vice president for licensing and retail. The tour will be at Linen Mill Studios in Banbridge, about 25 miles southwest of Belfast, where scenes in the castles Winterfell and Castle Black and several sea battles were shot. But it will include the actual sets and props from all over the “Thrones” universe, which will be rebuilt and restored for public consumption by the same construction crews and artists who worked on the show, Peters said. [Read more on how to rewatch the first seven seasons of “Game of Thrones.” (This article contains spoilers.)] The project, inspired by Warner Bros.’s Harry Potter studio tour outside London, will be the first of perhaps four former “Thrones” filming locations in Northern Ireland to be transformed into interactive fan experiences. The others have not been finalized, but possibilities include the still-standing sets for King’s Landing, in Belfast, where the production was based, and Castle Black and the Wall, in a quarry outside the city. The plan to create “Thrones” attractions was first publicized last fall, but details have been scarce. HBO was planning to formally announce the Game of Thrones Studio Tour on Wednesday morning. The show has previously spun off other real-world brand extensions, like the “Game of Thrones” Live Concert Experience, featuring the composer Ramin Djawadi and a touring exhibition of artifacts from the show. But the studio tour will offer the most in-depth “Game of Thrones” experience so far, allowing fans to walk through the same sets where the show’s stars like Lena Headey, Peter Dinklage and Emilia Clarke once inhabited the story. There are not currently plans to create similar attractions in the United States, but “it’s possible,” Peters said. “We get pitched all the time, and we’re open to a lot of different opportunities.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Game of Thrones’: 9 Questions for the Final Season,"When winter finally comes to the HBO epic with one last batch of episodes, it has a lot to answer for. In the Season 7 finale of “Game of Thrones,” Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen hooked up, Viserion demolished the Wall, Arya killed Littlefinger and Jaime finally left Cersei. By the end the show had boiled the roughly 9,000 subplots it introduced over seven seasons down to two: Jon and Dany’s coalition of the willing vs. Cersei and Euron the mad pirate. And the White Walkers vs. everyone. But things are far from settled. When “Game of Thrones” returns for its eighth and final season on April 14, here are a few of the questions it will need to answer: Don’t count on it. In the Season 8 premiere the new couple, last seen entwined in their love boat, arrives at Winterfell (as seen in the trailer). And who else is at Winterfell? Bran, who knows Jon is Dany’s nephew, and Samwell Tarly, who knows that this gives Jon a better claim on the Iron Throne than Dany. It’s enough to complicate any new romance. Another thing about Sam: His best friend Jon is now dating the same woman who torched his father and brother last season. So that should be fun. [Want exclusive “Game of Thrones” interviews and news, as well as the internet’s best articles on that week’s episode? Sign up for our Season 8 newsletter here.] Cersei spent so much time talking about her pregnancy, it started to seem unlikely. Dany spent so much time saying she couldn’t get pregnant, she started to seem pretty destined to get pregnant. Both would presumably be incest babies, because somehow we’ve all been tricked into obsessing over a big ol’ incest story. Long one of the sharpest operators in this story, Tyrion has made one bad decision after another since joining Team Targaryen. Is he just not cut out for revolutionary leadership? Or is his apparent love for Dany clouding his judgment? We saw him creeping outside Jon and Dany’s door as they consummated their affection. What problems could that lead to this season? He finally left Cersei as the snow fell on King’s Landing, and the trailer showed him in Northern garb and promising to “fight for the living.” But he will almost certainly have another date with his sister before this thing is over. Will she sway him to return? Or die by his (golden) hand? Few people of note died last season, presumably to leave room for plenty of slaughter this time around. Everyone’s fate is up for grabs. “Game of Thrones” is broadly about the evolution from a dynastic, tribal world defined by cycles of violence and revenge toward a more humanistic, cooperative one equipped to confront big existential challenges. So characters who have themselves become more enlightened over the course of the story (Jon, Sansa, maybe even Jaime) seem safer than those still nursing old grudges (Cersei, Arya, Dany). Dany tells everyone that she is not like her father, the Mad King. But she’s largely defined by her messianic streak, a quality that in its most extreme form can — much like Targaryens, we’re repeatedly reminded — go either way. And while she has shown plenty of compassion (freeing slaves, forgiving Jorah), she responds to slights with often shocking cruelty (crucifying masters in Meereen, locking her handmaiden Doreah in the vault, torching the Tarlys). So considering the revelations awaiting her in Winterfell, this thing could be a powder keg. Now that the Night King and friends have breached the Wall, they would seem to be the more pressing concern. Jon, at least, is focused on the White Walkers and seems to have convinced Dany’s camp and Sansa to go along with this plan. Jaime seems to be on board, too. Also, all we’ve heard in the run-up to the final season is about the 55 nights of shooting and the unprecedented scale of the White Walker clash, and according to HBO, the longest episode of the season is actually the third one. (One hour, 22 minutes!) So maybe Night King first, then Cersei. Of course, a persistent theory has the Night King being the one to win the whole thing, which is technically possible but seems too cynical for a story that, while dark and full of terrors, seems to be generally about moving into the light. I believe it was the maester Cleatus the Melancholy who first postulated in “Ice Magick and Dragon Fyre” that the heat generated by an adult dragon is honestly who in the seven hells could possibly know? The clash should be fun to watch, at any rate, until dragons start dying (or re-dying, in Viserion’s case). And then it will be sad, because the beasts didn’t ask to be born into this cruel and stupid world. It’s right there in the title: This show is about a pan-global contest to win ultimate power. But is it really though? Hasn’t everything we’ve learned over the past seven seasons — as this fevered pursuit has inspired all manner of butchery and abuse, and destroyed families and relationships, and empowered sadists, and turned the most magnificent creatures in the land into nuclear weapons and led at least one formerly decent man to literally burn his daughter alive (I’ll never forgive you HBO) — suggested that this contest is, in fact, irredeemably toxic? Vegas will give you odds on the various contenders (we had our own fun with this). But are we really supposed to root for one of this story’s heroes to eventually sit upon the symbol of all that is terrible? Given this show’s defining knack for upending expectations, the long-promised battle for control of the kingdom seems sure to veer from the usual “good guys meet bad guys, blow stuff up, suffer losses but prevail in the end” script. Wouldn’t the ultimate swerve for “Game of Thrones” be to blow up the throne itself? Maybe. Or maybe Jon and Dany will be the beloved king and queen, and Tyrion, Jaime and Arya will all get flowers and medals as in the ends of “Star Wars” or “Lord of the Rings” or any number of more conventional fantasy tales. Either way, game on.",The New York Times
2019,‘Game of Thrones’: Florence and the Machine’s Frontwoman on That Haunting Closing Song,"Only a handful of contemporary bands have furnished the end-credits music to “Game of Thrones” — the Hold Steady, for example, covered the Westerosi drinking song “The Bear and the Maiden Fair,” and the National covered the foreboding ballad “The Rains of Castamere.” In this week’s episode, it was Florence and the Machine, the last group who will ever do so, according to HBO. Which was fitting: The band was one of the first that the series’s showrunners, David Benioff and Dan Weiss, attempted to recruit. That was for Season 2 — an eternity in pop culture time — when they had wanted that band’s frontwoman, Florence Welch, to sing “The Rains of Castamere.” Florence and the Machine turned down the request at the time, but Benioff and Weiss never let go of the idea. “We’ve always been huge fans of Florence’s music,” they said in a joint statement. “So the opportunity to hear her otherworldly voice on our show was always at the forefront of our minds. We’re still pleasantly shocked that she agreed to sing ‘Jenny of Oldstones,’ and we’re in love with the result.” Perhaps it was an easier sell now that Welch, like so many millions of others, is a fan. During the episode, Podrick Payne (Daniel Portman) sings a portion of that tragic love ballad over a montage of various pairings — Sam and Gilly, Sansa and Theon, Arya and Gendry, Missandei and Grey Worm — and finishes as Dany approaches Jon, perhaps as foreshadowing. His version has an air of hopefulness. Welch’s, however, seems to capture more of the song’s inherent mysteries, even though, as she said in a phone interview, she had no idea while recording what would happen in the episode. Welch took a break from celebrating her grandfather’s 80th birthday in Galveston, Tex., to chat about the song and its possible meanings. (She joked that she was calling from Westeros.) Following are edited excerpts from that conversation. “Game of Thrones” licensed one of your songs (“Seven Devils”) for a trailer before, but this is the first time you’ve recorded something specifically for the show. Are you a fan? At what point did you get into “Game of Thrones”? I missed the first two seasons, and then I found it and watched as many as I could, all in one go. [Laughs] I was a binge watcher. I remember being like, “Oh, this is amazing. How have I not been watching this the whole time?” I’m happy to see them coming together now. All the families will have to stop fighting, because there’s something bigger at stake. I think that’s really interesting because it’s echoing what’s actually happening right now with the ecological crisis. I’m really interested to see where that goes. When did Season 2 come out? How many years ago was that? Season 2 was in 2012, so seven years. Wow. And now, watching that trailer now, seven years on, I was like, “Oh my god, that’s [expletive] huge.” Especially with how huge the show has gotten. I think a lot of those things that happened early on in my career, I didn’t realize how big they were. Any regrets about passing on a previous request from the show to record a version of “The Rains of Castamere”? Oh my god. [Expletive] Did I? I can’t remember. [Laughs] I think that was during my quote-unquote wild years. If I’m being super honest, there are a lot of things that are a bit blurry. I wasn’t as … involved, or, shall we say, as focused as I am now. But even in the blurry years, when there was a lot of chaos, I was still pretty wary about what I said yes to. I tend to be pretty cautious about what songs I sing. So I’m glad that they came back to me. I feel really touched to be on the last season, to be the last singer. And I’m grateful that I get to be a bit more present for it, to celebrate the ending of “Game of Thrones” in a clear place. What kind of direction did they give you with “Jenny of Oldstones”? They just had a simple, stripped back, lilting melody. The notes of it sounded like a Celtic folk song to me. I thought it was really beautiful. I love the idea of dancing with ghosts and never wanting to leave. That totally makes sense to me. I feel like I do that every night on stage. I worked with Thomas Bartlett on “High as Hope,” and he’s a piano genius. He helped formulate the chords, and then I kind of added my choir, my hellish soprano. We just tried to keep within the “Game of Thrones” world, to retain the ghostliness of it. This is a song that is shrouded in mystery in the books … Really? There’s a kind of sadness to it, and it sounded kind of haunted to me. I’m always really drawn to that kind of thing. What’s it about? We don’t really know much. Although he wrote more verses, George R.R. Martin included only one lyric in the text so far: “High in the halls of the kings who are gone, Jenny would dance with her ghosts.” It’s more that we keep hearing about the song, and about Jenny, who might have been a witch, or just friends with a witch or one of the Children of the Forest. A Targaryen prince abdicated his crown to marry Jenny, so it’s a love story but also a mysterious tragedy, since her prince died at Summerhall. Fans have various theories — that the song is about a prophecy, that it was written by Rhaegar Targaryen. In the show, they’ve had Jenny claiming to be a descendant of the Children of the Forest herself. So fans have been anticipating this one for a while. Wow! Oh my god, that’s perfect! To be honest, they keep such a tight ship on “Game of Thrones,” they didn’t tell us what the visual would be. We weren’t told what’s going to happen in the episode. We weren’t even told what the episode is called. It was all so top secret, so cloak-and-dagger! When I heard it, it evoked something quite strongly in me — you can kind of feel that there is a presence in that song, like something that had history. So I’m really glad it does have a rich history! It’s funny, they didn’t tell me any of this inside information. They just sent it to me, and I was like: “O.K.! I can do this.” Songs that people can resonate with emotionally, and that make people feel free to cry, I definitely like to make that kind of music, so they were probably like, “O.K., we’ll go to Florence.” Maybe they just wanted me to have my own take on it? Or maybe it would have been too much pressure, this huge weight of importance? I just hope I don’t disappoint the fans looking forward to this song. I’m kind of glad they didn’t give me a brief. I would have overthought it. How so? What I wanted to do with this song was keep it as sparse as possible. It does get a bit more rousing at the end, but I really wanted to retain the simplicity of the melody and the lyrics that they sent me, because I found them so moving. If I had known the history of the song, I would have been like, “[Expletive], we need fanfares, and you’re going to have to get a dragon on here somehow.” I might have — as I can do sometimes — overblown it. So I’m glad I didn’t know then, but I’m glad to know now. You want the beauty and the fragility in there as well. I would have made it too big, if I had known just how [expletive] big it is! There is a fantasy convention about magical songs — songs with magical effect. This might be one of them. The act of singing has a kind of magic to me. It’s a kind of channeling. When I’m singing, I feel very much at peace, like I’m connected to something bigger than myself. That you can take people to that place with you, that’s a kind of physical magic, because you’re transcending yourself but you’re also bringing everyone with you. One of the most magical things we do as humans is singing, especially singing together. I think that’s partly why I was always obsessed with choirs, groups of voices that could reach higher than our physical selves. So it is a kind of alchemy. It’s hard to explain, but there’s definitely a sort of ritual to it. Have you ever seen some of the suggestions out there that you could play Melisandre? Yes! I’m so on board to be Melisandre. She’s scary! I think I sometimes get mistaken for Sansa Stark as well. I thought you were going to go there. But I’ll take Melisandre. The witchiness, that’s definitely me. Although if I take my jewelry off, I don’t turn into an old lady. Or do I?",The New York Times
2019,‘Game of Thrones’: Grey Worm’s Fate Surprised Everyone but the Man Who Plays Him,"This article contains spoilers for Season 8, Episode 3 of “Game of Thrones.” “Game of Thrones” fans were fully prepared for Sunday night’s big battle: They had laid their bets about who would live and who would die and had braced themselves for the worst. Given the show’s dark and unforgiving history, many prognosticators assumed that any character leaving a loved one behind was doomed. Exhibit A seemed to be the Unsullied commander Grey Worm (Jacob Anderson) — or maybe even his translator girlfriend, Missandei (Nathalie Emmanuel). Last we had seen them, they were not only sharing a passionate kiss but also making plans for the future. That usually spells doom, doesn’t it? Grey Worm, however, has lived to fight another day. In a phone interview Monday, we spoke with Anderson about the Battle of Winterfell and what it means that his character lived to tell the tale. Following are edited excerpts. [Read our recap of Season 8, Episode 3 of “Game of Thrones.”] People are so happy that you’re not dead. Imagine that! I’d seen so many memes beforehand that Grey Worm was a shoo-in, he’s a definite death this week. And I was just laughing. But the show still manages to surprise people, no matter how they take things. I was just amazed by reading the script and thinking I sort of knew where they were going with it, and just being like: “Oh, wow. O.K., gosh, that’s surprising.” Even just the battle itself. “Oh, you guys are doing this in Episode 3? That’s brave.” I kept checking to make sure I was reading the right episode. It’s a little hard to track where Grey Worm is during some of the battle, because sometimes you have your helmet on, and all we have to go by is your heavy breathing. Other times, he didn’t have it on — presumably to help us identify him. Shouldn’t he have put it on at the soonest opportunity? And kept it on? I know! I thought I was going to pass out. I was on the verge of passing out most nights when we were shooting this. I think we did about 20 minutes straight of heavy breathing, especially towards the end. The heavy breathing did not help. I might be speaking out of turn, but there was a whole thing about the helmet. I called it Helmet-gate. There are loads of characters where I was like, “Why are you not wearing a helmet? It could really help you right now, in this situation.” There was a whole thing with continuity about whether my helmet was on or off, and how do you know if it’s Grey Worm or another Unsullied soldier? I made a suggestion that Grey Worm could have his own insignia on a commander’s helmet. The one difference that Grey Worm has is an insignia of the dragons eating themselves on his neck. The rest of the Unsullied don’t. It’s not the traditional Targaryen symbol. But it was too late in the game to build new helmets. So I share that complaint. We’re finished now; I can make complaints. [Laughs] Go ahead and complain! Or critique. Dany wasn’t following the original battle plan and improvises after the Dothraki get decimated. What did you make of that? She didn’t follow the plan exactly, but plans have to change when their enemy changes. I’m not going to take all the credit here, but if Grey Worm hadn’t had seen that the trenches were not getting lit from the arrows and helped Melisandre get there to light the trenches, then they’d have been in big trouble. Sometimes, you just have to improvise. That’s what Dany was doing with the dragons. They were sort of betting on the dragons being the thing that would ultimately take out the Night King, but then obviously that did not work! The plan had to change. In the fog of war, you never really know your enemy properly. There’s no way to know what they’re going to do. She did her best with what she had — if I had a dragon, I’d be on my dragon. I always just worry when they ride the dragons without saddles or safety precautions. That’s just me. And they should have a helmet as well! Everybody should have a helmet! I think the show just falls apart if you try to apply that kind of logic. But you do, because you believe in the characters. What did you think about the moment when Arya killed the Night King? I was surprised, but I like the way her story arc is set up in the show. The thing is, her last enemy is death. She has to face death. So to me, as a character moment, it seemed like there was a really beautiful poetry to that. She faced and conquered death. That’s what I’ve wanted for Arya since the beginning, really. Especially when you think about what happened to Ned, it’s been about having to face this thing that she’s terrified of and seen too much of, so that moment felt good. It felt really satisfying. In the episode when Missandei and Grey Worm got to talk about their future, there was a beat there that showed what it was like for them to be othered in the North. I was wondering if that came about because you two ever discussed race issues with the showrunners? Nathalie and I have definitely had that conversation since the beginning. We talked about how it must be strange for them, but also not strange. We’re both people of color in England, so we completely understand it. I’m probably saying something I shouldn’t, but a version of that scene has been scripted in previous seasons, and we even shot one, but it didn’t make it to air. But that scene of them discussing their place, and what they want, I was really glad that it made it into the show. It’s an important element. I know it’s not important to everyone, but to those who understand what it feels like — and I can speak to that because I’m one of those people — it felt really pertinent. I think the previous version that got cut had a different implication because it was funny. But narratively, this was the best time to do it, even though some people might think it could have come earlier. What was the previous scene that you shot like? I think it had something to do with Tyrion’s governance of Meereen, so Season 6? It was part of his perspective on slavery, completely based on something he didn’t understand, and they were having a little tussle about the bargain he made with the slave masters to reinstate slavery for seven years. And Grey Worm was fed up, and rightly so. Who is this guy who is willing to reinstate slavery? I’m not completely naïve. I know that there are people who wouldn’t fully understand, who don’t see the point of Missandei and Grey Worm. That relationship isn’t about the endgame. It’s not about the throne. It’s never been about that. It’s been about a greater purpose, and loyalty. Two people coming out of really extreme trauma and building lives for themselves and following someone they believe has their best interests at heart. I’m really proud that those characters represent something that’s not represented elsewhere on the show. There’s been a lot of talk about quote-unquote diversity and coming to terms with representation, and how important that is. I never questioned that I was Luke Skywalker when I watched “Star Wars” as a kid. I didn’t have to check my imagination. But it’s lovely when I feel represented. So I’m glad that Missandei and Grey Worm’s story holds that place in the show. And now, if they both live, they can go to Naath together, as Missandei suggested. That said, the last time we spoke, you were partial to Skagos, where you could hang out with the unicorns. [Laughs] I love that you remember I love unicorns. That makes me so happy. I want to be rich enough that, without being cruel, I could buy a horse, a white horse, and permanently attach a horn. A pearlescent horn. And then I could just be like, “Yeah, I have a unicorn.” But I don’t know how you do that without being cruel. And that would be more for me than the character. Grey Worm has no interest in unicorns. And Grey Worm’s got no interest in going back to the Summer Isles. I don’t think he has any particularly fond memories there. For him, I’m going to stick to Naath. Naath’s the mission. That’s what Missandei’s looking for. And he would like to just pack up and go with Missandei somewhere. What can they do on Naath? Throw a music festival? Naath doesn’t want the FYRE Festival. Naath doesn’t deserve that. If Ja Rule isn’t involved, we can talk. If all goes well, folks who would want to attend something on Naath would have to get through the Unsullied, or what’s left of them, so there wouldn’t be any funny business. That’s all I want for these two. I want them to be happy and chill out by the beach, because they’ve been through a lot.",The New York Times
2019,‘Game of Thrones’: Jaime and Brienne ... Free to Love at Last?,"This article contains spoilers for Season 8, Episode 2 of “Game of Thrones.” Jaime Lannister knew it wouldn’t be easy leaving King’s Landing to join Team Living at Winterfell. But he probably didn’t expect a very public interrogation about some of his actions that besmirched his honor: having killed Daenerys’s father, for one, and also having pushed an inquisitive little Stark boy out a window. Now that the children harmed by Jaime’s behavior were old enough to hold him accountable, the Kingslayer was in need of a friendly face. Tyrion need not apply. White Walker invasion aside, the events of Sunday night’s episode of “Game of Thrones” must have come as a relief for Jaime, then. With his life on the line, he had the very best character witness possible: Brienne of Tarth. And now that Jaime has broken up with his sister, the two were finally able to share a little happiness. [Read our recap of Season 8, Episode 2.] Knighting Brienne was perhaps the best way for Jaime to show his affection and respect for Brienne. It was also a very touching culmination to one of the series’s richest relationships — and just in time, before the world around them starts falling apart. Earlier this month, the actors Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime) and Gwendoline Christie (Brienne) spoke about the endlessly fascinating dynamic that animates their two characters. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. You two have such a great rapport as actors and as characters. Have you ever thought about what might have happened between Jaime and Brienne if they had met in happier times? GWENDOLINE CHRISTIE If they had met in happier times, he wouldn’t have spoken to her. And she would have just disregarded him. NIKOLAJ COSTER-WALDAU He would have talked to her! But she wouldn’t have spoken to him unless she was forced to. CHRISTIE Why would he speak to her when he spends all of his time insulting her? I don’t think he would have. And also, what strikes me as the reason why Brienne makes Jaime a likable character is —— COSTER-WALDAU Are you going to go back over something that I did wrong? CHRISTIE She transformed him from the stereotypical male and the kind of patriarchal perfect knight in shining armor —— COSTER-WALDAU This is exactly how the past nine years have been. CHRISTIE —— and deconstructs it. So I don’t believe he would have spoken to Brienne. COSTER-WALDAU Well, you’re entitled to your own opinion. CHRISTIE I appreciate that! Thank you. It’s only taken, what is it, seven or eight years for you to allow me to have my opinion? Rather than have you screaming in my face? COSTER-WALDAU You clearly don’t have a problem getting a word in. [Laughs.] CHRISTIE That’s how George R.R. Martin wrote it, that he’s the beauty and I’m the beast. And with that format, you actually see their complexities, and that’s what causes your intimate and loving relationship with the characters as opposed to it just being about gloss. Or Jaime is both beauty and beast, since he’s the one being transformed. COSTER-WALDAU No, you’re absolutely right. But also, that’s what’s interesting about Jaime. People would talk to me in Season 1 and say: “He’s such a disgusting guy! He’s a terrible man!” Yes, as far as having sex with his sister, morally, I wouldn’t … — but they’re clearly two consenting adults. I would understand if you were more upset that he tried to kill an innocent kid, pushing Bran out a window. From Jaime’s standpoint, there was no other way. He would do anything to protect the people he loves from this kid’s knowledge. But there are always consequences. Jaime has long been reviled for killing the Mad King. Not just for killing him, but for breaking his vow to protect him. People might be less upset if they understood why. COSTER-WALDAU I can understand why it’s hard for Jaime to talk about. Jaime’s always been ashamed of the fact that he did break his vow. It was his job to protect this guy. You would think that what he chose to do, to save the world, would be such an obvious thing, that it was the right thing to do. But still, in this world, it’s not. And he has to live with the fact. But Brienne understands. And he sees himself in her, in her dedication to others. She’s one of the few people he can trust. What do you think their lives would be like if the fighting ended, if the battles were won, and if they could actually retire and live their lives in peace? COSTER-WALDAU Well, I think that they’re both — I was going to say damaged people, but that’s wrong. They have history, and they carry that history with them, as we all do. Going into a relationship with someone who’s had a very long relationship with another woman, where they had three kids and lost those three kids in a very brutal way, and knowing that he has just left that woman, who is now pregnant with his baby … I mean, it’s not easy. It’s going to be complicated. Do you think Brienne would mind if Cersei were pregnant? CHRISTIE Yes! COSTER-WALDAU No! CHRISTIE She would. COSTER-WALDAU You think she would? CHRISTIE [Laughs.] COSTER-WALDAU Well, then yes, she would. CHRISTIE He had this intense sexual relationship with his sister, and then there’s this continuing relationship with Brienne. It’s a loaded relationship, and I don’t think it’s defined in either of their minds. But they know they enjoy seeing each other. COSTER-WALDAU They clearly like each other. CHRISTIE That’s not the way I’ve been playing it! [Laughs.] I think it actually hasn’t been overt. Nothing has been overt. If you take it from Season 2, when Jaime and Brienne first meet, through the duration of their history together, the changes in their dynamic — you watch it move from being repelled by each other, to respect, to being encouraged by each other, to possible attraction. COSTER-WALDAU And they’re not able to admit that to themselves. CHRISTIE No, that’s just you. [Laughs.] It’s a refreshing take on female sexuality, desire and love, where it is not about begging to be loved and therefore approved. There’s much more of an inner struggle. A deep conflict of not needing to be, not wanting to be and wanting to be. I’ve enjoyed that subversion of male-female relationships. Normally, it’s: “Please love me. Please adore me. Please be physically intimate with me.” Would Brienne even want them to do something like hold hands? COSTER-WALDAU Very clearly not! CHRISTIE Good luck with that! One of the more romantic moments was when Brienne tried to give back the sword Oathkeeper, and Jaime said it was hers — that it was always hers. CHRISTIE I think it’s shared ownership. A shared item. COSTER-WALDAU We don’t even have to share. We have two [Valyrian steel swords]. But if we did have to share, I’ll share with you. CHRISTIE Yeah, but that sword’s mine. You gave me that sword. COSTER-WALDAU Yeah, that’s yours. CHRISTIE O.K., I just wanted to make sure of that now, and not in a court of law. COSTER-WALDAU Absolutely. You can trust me.",The New York Times
2019,‘Game of Thrones’: So Who’s Able to Ride a Dragon?,"This article contains spoilers for the Season 8 premiere of “Game of Thrones.” Finally, Jon Snow on dragonback! Since last season, when he first held out his hand to pet Drogon (and didn’t die), fans have been wondering if Jon would ever claim a mount of his own. The dragon Rhaegal always seemed to be the best choice for him — and Kit Harington agrees. And now with both Drogon and Viserion spoken for, Rhaegal really was the only choice. [Read a review of the Season 8 premiere of “Game of Thrones”] But Dany may not realize the full import of going on a dragon-riding date with Jon. She didn’t share her dragon with him, as she did with those she rescued last season beyond the Wall. She gave it to him. And Rhaegal is now Jon’s for life. Let’s back up. There is actually a lot that Dany doesn’t know about dragons. After all, she grew up in an era when the beasts were thought to have died out, when there were no longer experienced dragonlords to teach her how to bond, ride or battle with them, as the Targaryens and many other noble families in Valyria once did. David Benioff, one of the showrunners, said in an “Inside the Episode” segment that “only Targaryens” can ride, which is a departure from the books and the show’s own history-and-lore segments. This could be a retroactive continuity change, or more likely, Benioff meant in the present show story line, since right before that he said, “No one’s ever ridden a dragon except for Dany,” and that doesn’t cancel out her ancestors. Still, the idea that dragon-riding is proof of a Targaryen bloodline persists, and how that plays out in “Game of Thrones” remains to be seen. Dany is lucky, though — she’s a natural. Jon clearly is not, probably because he hasn’t had the advantage of holding Rhaegal as an egg before it hatched, or knowing it all of its life. Dany had time to acclimate, to bond. And that bond is actually a form of imprinting, which enables Drogon to sense Dany’s distress in the fighting pits and come to her rescue. When Drogon is hit by a spear in the books, “Dany and Drogon screamed as one.” The bond between a dragon and dragon rider runs so deep, some say, that the dragon will share its human’s feelings (the dragons of one royal couple also mated) and can sense when its human dies. Dreamfyre, for example, sensed when its rider, Helaena, died, even though she was far away. Because of this bond, a dragon will accept only one rider, although it will accept a new one after the original rider dies. (None of these rules about bonding apply to Viserion, by the way, now that it’s a wight.) Maegor the Cruel had to wait until his father, Aegon, died before he could hope to claim Balerion the Black Dread. The child of a rider, however, does not automatically inherit a deceased parent’s dragon. It’s not like borrowing the family car. Queen Rhaenyra’s son Joffrey tried to ride Syrax, and although he was a familiar presence to his mother’s dragon, the great beast fought to be free of him, twisting in the air until he fell off and plunged to his death. Joffrey might not have died if he had used the traditional saddle, chains or steel-tipped whip, but he was in a hurry, and he didn’t. That’s another thing Dany didn’t realize — Jon might have had a slightly easier time if he had the proper tools. Or if Dany had taken him as a passenger first, letting him ride double with her before trying to ride solo on an untamed dragon. (She wouldn’t have been able to break in Rhaegal herself beforehand because a dragon won’t accept another dragon’s rider.) It could be that being Rhaegar’s son helps Jon here. But back to the “only Targaryens” can ride question, it’s a little more complicated than that in the books. Not all Targaryens are able to ride. And there is precedent to suggest the mythology about the Targaryens is just that — myth. (One that was advantageous for them to perpetuate, because it made them seem “closer to gods than the common run of men.”) Long ago, in a time when the Targaryens had more dragons than riders, they opened up the field to anyone willing to try winning over their own dragon. One of those who succeeded was a small, brown, bastard girl named Nettles, who figured out that feeding a dragon a freshly slaughtered sheep every morning was an excellent way to win its acceptance. Some argue that Nettles must have had Targaryen blood herself. Perhaps. But her example is also useful for those who don’t: If you’re friendly and persistent, dragons will consider you. Tyrion himself might have had a chance of this when he unchained Viserion and Rhaegal. Alas … As long as Dany and Jon stay on good terms, it shouldn’t be a problem for her that Rhaegal and Jon have bonded. But should Dany and Jon ever fall out — perhaps over an icky incest revelation? — this is one thing she can’t take back.",The New York Times
2019,‘Game of Thrones’: What Is the Golden Company? And Where Are Those Elephants?,"This article contains spoilers for the Season 8 premiere of “Game of Thrones.” When Cersei went shopping for a new ally, she found the biggest and best group of mercenaries she could buy with her latest loan from the Iron Bank: the Golden Company. Now that this elite private army has been ferried over from Essos on Euron Greyjoy’s fleet, was this a good purchase on Cersei’s part? Should Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow be worried? [Read a review of the Season 8 premiere of “Game of Thrones”] This isn’t the first time we’ve heard about the Golden Company in Westeros. Davos originally recommended that Stannis hire the mercenaries to beef up his armed forces. He probably thought of them first because of their stellar reputation, which he must have known would be useful in persuading his reluctant king. Unlike some sellsword companies, the Golden Company is said never to have broken a contract. Their motto: “Our word is good as gold.” And unlike some feudal armies, the Golden Company is composed of highly disciplined soldiers. What’s more, they don’t think of themselves as mercenaries: They are a brotherhood of exiles and the sons of exiles. Even if they’re based in Essos, they consider themselves (mostly) to be Westerosi. “It’s home they want, as much as gold,” as one character explains. Perhaps this is the logic Cersei relies upon to avoid the argument that she, too, is using a foreign army. As an example of the type of men the Golden Company attracts, Jorah Mormont revealed in Season 4 that as a disgraced knight in exile, he fought with them before signing up with Viserys and Dany. The Golden Company’s captain-general is Harry Strickland, who grew up in the Company, as did his father and grandfather after his great-grandfather signed up with the original outfit. That speaks to another distinguishing feature for this squad: They raise their sons to join them. It’s part of their heritage. The Golden Company was founded by a legitimized Targaryen bastard — Ser Aegor Rivers, known as Bittersteel — as a fighting force to support rebellions against the Iron Throne. Bittersteel’s dad, King Aegon IV, known as Aegon the Unworthy, had a whole litter of bastards that he legitimized on his deathbed a century ago. This led to a series of succession clashes known as the Blackfyre Rebellions, in which Aegor Rivers and the Golden Company supported the Blackfyre claims. This is why some see them as anti-Targaryen. In the books, Dany’s brother, Viserys, tried to hire them once, and got laughed off. This might not have been simply because Viserys was a Targaryen: Later, on the Company supports a separate Targaryen claim to the throne and invades Westeros after breaking a contract for the first time in order to do so. By Season 4, when Davos recommends them, the Golden Company has 10,000 men: 8,000 infantry, 1,000 archers and 1,000 cavalry. They also have two dozen war elephants. Their infantry are phalanx-style spearmen, like the Unsullied, but with more adaptability. Their archers have a variety of weapons and styles — crossbows, recurve-bows, longbows, and mounted archers. Together, they are a much better match than a Westerosi-trained army would be against the combined forces of an all-cavalry Dothraki and an 8,000-strong all-infantry Unsullied. Of course, they’re still susceptible to dragons. By the time Cersei hires the Company in Season 7, she says it has 20,000 men, indicating their numbers have grown. The elephants, however, are nowhere to be seen. Cersei is annoyed — fixated, even. “I wanted those elephants,” she says after sleeping with Euron. But it isn’t clear where they went. Perhaps it was simple logistics: The Golden Company aren’t seamen, and they aren’t equipped to travel overseas. Euron’s hastily-built fleet does well enough at transporting the soldiers, but dozens of elephants weigh a lot. Maybe his fleet simply didn’t have the right sized ships to carry them. (Captain Strickland was vague, saying that the elephants were simply “not well-suited to long sea voyages.”) But even without those great beasts, 20,000 men more than replenishes the Lannister soldiers lost during the loot-train attack. And Cersei is able to afford them because of gold stolen from Highgarden. Which is fitting: The men of the Golden Company like to wear their plunder — hence their name. They come resplendent with inlaid armor and golden arm rings (each ring signifies a year of service), wielding jeweled swords and decorating their tents with golden cloth. And pikes topped with gilded skulls. But Cersei should be careful: The Golden Company turns on patrons who don’t pay up on time. The Lannister promise — that they always pay their debts — won’t be enough with these guys. They once sacked the city of Qohor when a client didn’t honor a contract. Unlike most other mercenary companies we’ve seen, the Golden Company decides whom to back based not only on payment but also on whomever it thinks has the chances of claiming the throne. This is one army that could have a mind of its own.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Game of Thrones’: Who Is the Mad King, and Why Did Jaime Kill Him?","“I know what my father was, what he did,” Dany said back in Season 5 of “Game of Thrones.” “I know the Mad King earned his name.” Barristan Selmy was the first to fill in Dany on her grim family history, with Tyrion adding detail later on. In their candor about Dany’s cruel father, King Aerys II, they had hoped to curb her own destructive tendencies. But none of Dany’s advisers revealed to her just how intertwined the Lannisters were with her father’s story, and how much their friendship and falling-out shaped the Mad King’s reign. In other words, when Jaime stood before her in Sunday’s episode, his life potentially in the balance, he might have done well to fill her in on the details. Tywin Lannister, a royal page in his youth, became close friends with Aerys Targaryen long before he was crowned king, and he was a natural choice for hand of the king after Aerys’s coronation. (A post he held for nearly 20 years.) But the two men’s friendship also contained elements of rivalry. Aerys lusted after Joanna Lannister — Tywin’s cousin and wife — and his lewd comments soured his relationship with Tywin. Aerys became increasingly paranoid about his difficulty having children with his sister and wife, Queen Rhaella, who had a series of miscarriages and stillbirths. In raging frustration, Aerys confined Rhaella to her quarters, beheaded a wet nurse and tortured his mistress and her family to death. At the same time, Tywin was doing a fine job managing the realm, and he began getting public recognition for it — a development that served only to fuel Aerys’s paranoia. Remember the mute executioner Ilyn Payne? Aerys had his tongue torn out for allegedly saying that Tywin was the power behind the throne. Then the angry king began trying to curb his hand’s ambitions and sabotage his endeavors, even if it hurt the realm. [Read our recap of Season 8, Episode 2 of “Game of Thrones.”] And when Tywin proposed a marital match between his daughter, Cersei, and the crown prince, Rhaegar (the subject of Cersei’s woods witch inquiry), Aerys rejected it outright in order to humble Tywin, his “overmighty servant.” A servant’s daughter was not fit to marry royalty, he said. This professional jealousy turned deadly when Lord Denys of House Darklyn, noticing the tension between Aerys and Tywin, lured Aerys to Duskendale, knowing Tywin would advise against going — and that Aerys would go anyway, just to defy him. And so the king was captured and abused in the Duskendale dungeons for six months. In retaliation, Aerys wiped out the Darklyn family — torturing and killing even their distant kinsmen. The only survivor, Dontos, refers to this massacre when he gives Sansa a last “heirloom.” Aerys began imagining assassination plots everywhere, thinking that Tywin and Rhaegar were conspiring against him, even blaming them for what happened at Duskendale. He hired Varys to root out others he suspected of treason. Maybe some of the plots were real. Maybe the tournament at Harrenhal was just a pretext for Prince Rhaegar to discuss arranging a Great Council to remove his unstable father from the throne, as some suspected. If that was the case, Aerys helped make Rhaegar’s argument for him. When the king attended the tournament — his first public excursion since Duskendale — his subjects were shocked by his deterioration, both physical and mental. Aerys became convinced that a mystery knight was an enemy of the crown, and he ordered Rhaegar to find out the knight’s identity. All signs point to the knight’s having actually been Lyanna Stark, thus beginning Rhaegar and Lyanna’s doomed affair. But the need to remove Aerys from power had become more urgent by the Harrenhal tournament: Tywin, an important stabilizing force in the kingdom, had quit. And unbeknown to her father, Cersei had asked King Aerys to select Jaime as a knight for his Kingsguard so that her brother and lover could always be near, safe from the risk of political marriage. Cersei knew Tywin might be upset, but she underestimated the extent of her father’s fury when Aerys granted her request. Tywin interpreted Aerys’s selection as a way for the king to deprive him of his heir and hold a hostage against his loyalty, and this was the final straw. He resigned the handship and returned with Cersei to Casterly Rock (thwarting her plan). He kept trying to persuade Jaime to quit the Kingsguard ever after, deeming the position no more than a “glorified bodyguard.” This was the volatile environment Brandon Stark entered when he journeyed to King’s Landing to demand that Rhaegar release Lyanna. King Aerys arrested Brandon and his men on charges of conspiring against Rhaegar, then summoned their fathers to court and burned them alive. Still suspicious, Aerys decided that more of Lyanna’s men should die. He ordered Lord Jon Arryn to execute both of his wards — Lyanna’s other brother, Ned, and her betrothed, Robert Baratheon. Arryn responded by calling his banners. A group of outraged nobles rose in revolt. A teenage Jaime was alone at court; the other Kingsguard knights were dispatched either to fight with Rhaegar at the Trident or to guard Lyanna Stark at the Tower of Joy. Convinced that King’s Landing would be sacked, Aerys planned to burn it down, an act of retribution that would serve as his funeral pyre, allowing him to be reborn as a dragon. “The traitors want my city,” he said. “But I’ll give them naught but ashes.” Jaime learned the king and his pyromancers were placing caches of wildfire all around the city: beneath the Sept, in the hovels of Flea Bottom, at all seven gates and even in the cellars of the Red Keep itself. The king’s replacement hand objected to this wildfire plot, only to be burned alive for doing so. Aerys named the head pyromancer as his next hand. Burning people alive was becoming a sexual fetish for Aerys: It often spurred him to rape his queen afterward. Hearing Rhaella cry was worse for Jaime than the screaming of Aerys’s other wretched victims. Like all Kingsguard, Jaime was sworn to protect the queen. Wanting to protect her from the king, and not being able to, was something new and troubling. When Tywin finally joined the rebellion, he pretended to be Aerys’s ally one more time in order to gain entry to the city. And so, at the advice of Pycelle (always a Lannister stooge) but against the advice of Varys and Jaime, Aerys opened the gates and made possible the Sack of King’s Landing. Jaime begged the king to listen to reason: Surrender to his father, save lives. But Aerys would not yield; instead, he commanded Jaime to bring him Tywin’s head. But seeing the head pyromancer running off, Jaime chased him down and killed him before he could set off the wildfire. He then went back to kill Aerys before he could issue a royal command to anyone else. When Tywin’s men burst into the throne room, thinking they would kill the king themselves, they asked Jaime who should be the new king. Jaime wondered: Should it be Tywin? Or Robert Baratheon? Another Targaryen? He assumed the Targaryen children were safe; he had no idea that his father had sent the Mountain to kill the rest of the family he was sworn to protect. Jaime sat down on the throne to wait and see who would come to claim it. Or, as Dany puts it, Jaime “sat down on the Iron Throne and watched as his blood poured onto the floor.” And when Ned Stark walked in, Jaime didn’t explain. He became known, then, as the Kingslayer and one of the most reviled men in the realm. All he had done was try to save it from a man who tried to burn its entire capital — and everyone in it — to the ground.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Getting Worse, Not Better’: Illegal Pot Market Booming in California Despite Legalization","COSTA MESA, Calif. — In the forests of Northern California, raids by law enforcement officials continue to uncover illicit marijuana farms. In Southern California, hundreds of illegal delivery services and pot dispensaries, some of them registered as churches, serve a steady stream of customers. And in Mendocino County, north of San Francisco, the sheriff’s office recently raided an illegal cannabis production facility that was processing 500 pounds of marijuana a day. It’s been a little more than a year since California legalized marijuana — the largest such experiment in the United States — but law enforcement officials say the unlicensed, illegal market is still thriving and in some areas has even expanded. “There’s a lot of money to be made in the black market,” said Thomas D. Allman, the sheriff of Mendocino County, whose deputies seized cannabis oil worth more than $5 million in early April. Legalization, Sheriff Allman said, “certainly didn’t put cops out of work.” California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, has declared that illegal grows in Northern California “are getting worse, not better” and two months ago redeployed a contingent of National Guard troops stationed on the border with Mexico to go after illegal cannabis farms instead. Stepped-up enforcement comes with a certain measure of irony — legalization was meant to open a new chapter for the state, free from the legacy of heavy policing and incarceration for minor infractions. Instead, there are new calls for a crackdown on illegal selling. Conscious of the consequences that the war on drugs had on black and Latino communities, cities like Los Angeles today say they are wary of using criminal enforcement measures to police the illegal market and are unsure how to navigate this uncharted era. The struggles of the licensed pot market in California are distinct from the experience of other states that have legalized cannabis in recent years. Sales in Colorado, Oregon and Washington grew well above 50 percent for each of the first three years of legalization, although Oregon now also has a large glut of pot. But no other state has an illegal market on the scale of California’s, and those illicit sales are cannibalizing the revenue of licensed businesses and in some cases, experts say, forcing them out of business. Entrepreneurs in the industry, which spent decades evading the law, are now turning to the law to demand the prosecution of unlicensed pot businesses. “We are the taxpayers — no one else should be operating,” said Robert Taft Jr., whose licensed cannabis business in Orange County, south of Los Angeles, has seen sales drop in recent months. “This is starting to get ridiculous,” he said of the illegal pot shops, including nearby businesses that list themselves as churches and advertise marijuana as a kind of sacrament. “It’s almost like the state is setting itself up to lose.” California gives cities wide latitude to regulate cannabis, resulting in a confusing patchwork of regulation. Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Jose and San Diego have laws allowing cannabis businesses, but most smaller cities and towns in the state do not — 80 percent of California’s nearly 500 municipalities do not allow retail marijuana businesses. The ballot measure legalizing recreational marijuana passed in 2016 with 57 percent approval, but that relatively broad support has not translated to the local level. Cities like Compton or Laguna Beach decisively rejected allowing pot shops. Regulators cite this tepid embrace by California municipalities as one of many reasons for the state’s persistent and pervasive illegal market. Only 620 cannabis shops have been licensed in California so far. Colorado, with a population one-sixth the size of California, has 562 licensed recreational marijuana stores. But the more fundamental reason for the strength of the black market in California — and what sets the state apart from others — is the huge surplus of pot. Since medical marijuana was made legal in California more than two decades ago, the cannabis industry flourished with minimal oversight. Now many cannabis businesses are reluctant to go through the cumbersome and costly process to obtain the licenses that became mandatory last year. Of the roughly 14 million pounds of marijuana grown in California annually, only a fraction — less than 20 percent according to state estimates and a private research firm — is consumed in California. The rest seeps out across the country illicitly, through the mail, express delivery services, private vehicles and small aircraft that ply trafficking routes that have existed for decades. This illicit trade has been strengthened by the increasing popularity of vaping, cannabis-infused candies, tinctures and other derivative products. Vape cartridges are much easier to carry and conceal than bags of raw cannabis. And the monetary incentives of trafficking also remain powerful: The price of cannabis products in places like Illinois, New York or Connecticut are typically many times higher than in California. The state’s illicit cannabis exports appear to be increasing even now, well into California’s second year of legalization. New Frontier Data, a data research company that specializes in cannabis, calculates that high demand and more advanced growing techniques will contribute to approximately half a million pounds more illicit cannabis this year compared with 2018. The federal government still considers marijuana illegal and the Drug Enforcement Administration says it still investigates marijuana-related crimes. But a spokesman, Rusty Payne, said the agency has a bigger crisis to attend to. “We’ve got our hands full with the opioid epidemic to be honest,” Mr. Payne said. In wildland areas, seizures of illicit pot by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife more than doubled in 2018, the first year that recreational cannabis was legal. The department destroyed 1.6 million marijuana plants last year, up from 700,000 in 2017 and 800,000 the year before — all of them illegally grown. “There’s a subset of people who are just refusing to get into the process,” said Nathaniel Arnold, the department’s deputy chief of enforcement. The Bureau of Cannabis Control, the agency charged with regulating marijuana in the state, has received around 7,500 complaints, most of them about illegal operations, and has sent out more than 3,000 letters ordering illegal businesses to shut down. “It’s only a matter of time before we start making a dent in the illegal market,” said Alex Traverso, a spokesman for the agency, who acknowledged there were probably more illegal shops in Los Angeles alone than licensed shops in the entire state. Cat Packer, the executive director of the Department of Cannabis Regulation in Los Angeles, said that even when illicit businesses were shut down, they often soon reappeared. “It’s been a game of whack-a-mole in the city of Los Angeles,” she said. But Ms. Packer also said the city was mindful that criminal enforcement in the past had disproportionately targeted people of color. The city is seeking to find an effective enforcement policy that does not mimic the criminal interdiction policies of the past, Ms. Packer said. One strategy is to turn off water and power services to noncompliant businesses. “We can’t do Drug War 2.0,” she said. Mr. Taft, the cannabis entrepreneur, has sent 450 complaints to the Bureau of Cannabis Control and is unapologetic about his calls for an aggressive approach to illegal shops, which he says is the only way that California’s giant experiment will work. His dispensary pays a cumulative state and local tax rate of 32.25 percent. Unlicensed shops pay no tax. One of Mr. Taft’s biggest complaints is about Weedmaps, a phone app that allows users to locate marijuana businesses nearby, both licensed and illegal. In February last year, the Bureau of Cannabis Control sent a letter to Weedmaps saying the company was aiding and abetting illicit businesses and ordering it to “immediately cease all activity that violates state cannabis laws.” Weedmaps replied that it was a technology company and not under the jurisdiction of the bureau. More than a year later, the company still lists hundreds of unlicensed shops. Earlier this year, Mr. Taft resigned as a board member of the Santa Ana Cannabis Association because half the members, he said, were selling illegally and using legalization as a “shield.” “They are playing both sides of the market,” he said. On a recent weekday morning, Mr. Taft called the Bureau of Cannabis Control to lodge a complaint against his neighbor, a cannabis business that he said did not appear on the list of licensed businesses. “We are being pillaged by these people,” he said. “My lawyers are ready to launch rockets!”",The New York Times
2019,‘Girls of the Sun’ Review: Brave Women Enlisted in a Battle Against Subtlety,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “Girls of the Sun,” Eva Husson’s ripped-from-real-life drama about a battalion of Kurdish women fighting the Islamic State in northern Iraq, begins and ends in the swirling dust of the same explosion. One survivor, a French journalist named Mathilde (Emmanuelle Bercot), becomes our guide and occasional narrator as she embeds with the unit and records the women’s stories. Sporting a black eye patch (reminiscent of the British war correspondent Marie Colvin), Mathilde bonds with Bahar (the arresting Golshifteh Farahani), the unit’s commander. She, like all the women, is an escaped ISIS captive who has suffered unspeakable abuse; now their mission is to liberate Bahar’s hometown, where her son remains a hostage. Their unique advantage is the jihadists’ belief that any fighter killed by a woman will be denied entry into heaven. Inspired by a 2014 ISIS raid on Kurdish territory, “Girls of the Sun,” unlike the women who populate it, is weak and often corny. The story is inherently dramatic and the action scenes (sinuously photographed by Mattias Troelstrup) have real punch, but Husson is more interested in exalting her subjects than humanizing them. Inelegant construction and unsubtle, occasionally tub-thumping dialogue further drain the movie’s potency, as do Mathilde’s overripe musings on war and suffering. The granddaughter of a onetime captive Spanish Republican soldier, Husson says in the press notes that she wanted to explore collective trauma and “the notion of lost ideals.” Her good intentions, though, are the movie’s kryptonite; and as we watch flashbacks to Bahar’s happy prewar life, we see the seeds of another, better movie. In Farahani’s gorgeously expressive, silent-film-star face lies the ability to convey more than any amount of journalistic eloquence.

2019,‘Grass’ Review: Eavesdropping in the Coffee Shop With Hong Sang-soo,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. In the more than 30 years since he directed his first feature, the South Korean filmmaker Hong Sang-soo has refined his seemingly rudimentary style to the extent that it can deliver some surprisingly elaborate effects. In the opening shot of “Grass,” the director’s latest picture to reach the United States, a young woman with a backpack enters a coffee shop. The door closes behind her; on a bench outside the shop’s front, a middle-aged, unshaven man sits, and lights a cigarette. Hong cuts to inside the shop. In a medium shot, the young woman sits across from a young man at a table that’s up against a wall. They have an increasingly tense conversation. “I’m not doing so well,” the woman says. The camera does a slow zoom in on the man, who looks concerned; it swivels, deliberately, to the woman. They discuss, and then argue about, a friend who has committed suicide. The camera cuts to a medium close-up of a young woman, her long ponytail positioned over the side of her face, sitting before a laptop, writing. At first, the sight is bracing for the Hong maven: his pictures often feature writers as protagonists, but they’re almost never shown actually writing. The other effect of the cut is to suggest that the conversation between the young man and young woman is a product of this character’s imagination, that she is working on a short story or a screenplay. But no. She’s just another customer at the same coffee shop. By declining to show the shop’s interior in a wide establishing shot, the director casually creates a sense of dislocation that hangs over the rest of this short feature, whose title, as it happens, derives from the title of a popular Korean translation of Walt Whitman’s “Leaves of Grass.” The young woman writer, played by Kim Min-hee (a Hong regular since 2015), observes mostly melancholy people, old and young, who have arrived at turning points in their lives. She can be introverted to the point of defensiveness when confronted about her rather obvious eavesdropping. Not that her interlocutors are aggressive; they show a friendly diffidence, inviting her to drink with them after they bring bottles of soju into the place. She is less shy when it comes to her younger brother and his girlfriend, who get a relentless tongue-lashing from her in one of the few scenes that leave the coffee shop. This movie, like most of Hong’s others, doesn’t pass judgment on its largely passive protagonist. In fact, it suggests that observing the people that pass through one’s sight and hearing is an entirely valid mode of living. Despite the fact that she’s writing down what she’s witnessing, you believe her when she tells another character she has no intent to publish or “do” anything with what she types on her laptop. When the writer opts to just let things be, the movie is at its most content.

2019,‘Guava Island’ First Look: Childish Gambino’s Mystery Project With Rihanna Is Unveiled,"When Donald Glover and the director Hiro Murai collaborate on a new project, expectations are naturally sky high. After all, Murai has directed many of the key episodes of Glover’s Emmy-winning series, “Atlanta,” as well as the music video for “This Is America,” the Grammy-winning song Glover recorded as his musical alter ego, Childish Gambino. But with their first feature-length effort, “Guava Island,” you had the sense that Glover and Murai were trying to play down those expectations. The film, which comes in at a brisk 54 minutes, was shot in Cuba last year and kept under wraps until this week. That isn’t easy to do when your star is so famous and his love interest is played by Rihanna. [“Guava Island” was released after Donald Glover’s Coachella set as Childish Gambino.] And though any film festival in the world would have coveted Murai’s first feature, “Guava Island” instead debuted Thursday night at the Coachella campgrounds in California, where Glover will headline the site’s music festival as Childish Gambino. Shortly after his set concludes on Friday night, the film is to begin streaming on Amazon, starting Saturday at 12:01 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time. So what is this mystery project about? “Guava Island” is a music-driven fable that follows Deni (Glover), a happy-go-lucky singer who believes that music has the power to unite the squabbling citizens of his tiny island. He promises his girlfriend, Kofi (Rihanna), that he can write a song as beautiful as she is, though Kofi is skeptical. “No song is that beautiful,” she boasts. (Letitia Wright, a.k.a. Shuri in “Black Panther,” also appears, but she doesn’t have many lines.) The plot is slight: A shady island tycoon named Red (Nonso Anozie) tries to prevent Deni from putting on a music festival, reasoning that if people go see the young man perform that night, they’re liable to skip work at Red’s sweatshops the next day. And though Rihanna doesn’t have much to do as Glover’s girlfriend, the two at least share a spiky chemistry: Glover is eager to please, while Rihanna remains ever hard to impress. [Read the NYT review of “Guava Island.”] But the main attraction here is something that had been kept secret until Thursday night’s screening: Glover uses “Guava Island” to restage and remix some of his biggest recent songs. “America is a concept,” Deni tells his fellow workers before leading them in a rendition of “This Is America” that finds new context for many of the video’s familiar, unsettling dance moves. Other musical sequences are set to Childish Gambino songs like “Saturday” and “Summertime Magic,” which is repurposed as a beachside serenade for Rihanna. (Alas, she is a mere spectator instead of Glover’s duet partner.) Glover has said that “Guava Island” was inspired by films as disparate as “Purple Rain” and “City of God,” though it also shares a restless creative ambition with recent visual albums from Janelle Monáe and Beyoncé. Monáe will perform just before Glover on the Coachella stage Friday night, while Beyoncé dominated the festival last year with a career-spanning performance captured for her coming Netflix documentary “Homecoming.” For top-tier artists looking to make a grand statement, there remains no place like Coachella.

2019,‘Guava Island’ Review: Donald Glover’s Island Getaway Is a Casual Charmer,"Streaming Movie Review When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Even as details were finally released earlier this week about “Guava Island,” the secret project that Donald Glover debuted at Coachella in advance of its Amazon Prime premiere Saturday, there was some confusion as to what exactly it would be. It’s not a “visual album,” in the style of Beyoncé’s “Lemonade” or Janelle Monáe’s “Dirty Computer,” nor is it a feature-length jukebox narrative, à la “Purple Rain.” (It runs just shy of an hour.) But if we learned anything from Glover and the director Hiro Murai’s previous collaborations on the FX series “Atlanta,” it’s that they don’t mind if their work is difficult to classify — if anything, they seem to revel in it. Dubbed a “tropical thriller” by Amazon, “Guava Island” has the formal ingenuity and freewheeling tonality of “Atlanta,” but Glover and Murai are playing in a very different key here. If anything, it’s an expansion, musically and stylistically, of “This Is America,” the much-seen and much-discussed Murai-directed music video for Glover’s musical alter ego, Childish Gambino. (The song is remixed and restaged here.) But the overall approach is lighter and poppier, appropriate to the tropical setting. Glover’s co-star, Rihanna, narrates the opening sequence, an animated history of the island framed as a folk legend and bedtime story, with a dash of fairy tale: she explains how young Deni (Glover) would come to her window every night to sing to her, as if she were some kind of Caribbean Rapunzel. Now a struggling musician, Deni dreams of writing a song that will unite his people, though they seem a fairly close-knit community already — it’s the kind of place where everyone bids him a cheerful good morning as he hustles to the first of his many jobs, singing jingles on the radio. But it’s not all a fairy tale; the ruthless Red Cargo (Nonso Anozie, from “Game of Thrones”) rules the island with an iron fist, and machine gun-slinging men patrol his factory floors. The plot of “Guava Island” is as thin as the Judy Garland-Mickey Rooney musicals of its distant heritage: Deni has planned a secret all-night music festival (not unlike, say, a secret musical film), but its attendees would consequently not work on Sunday, which is deeply unacceptable to Red Cargo. He offers Deni $10,000 to cancel the event, explaining, “I’m in charge of the people of this island. I have to do what’s best for everyone.” No prizes for guessing whether the show goes on, though the consequences of that decision carry more weight than usual. Thus, it’s one of those stories where the musical numbers are “realistic” (kinda, sorta) because the protagonist is a musician, and Murai takes thankful pains to work the songs into the fabric of the narrative. Yet there’s not as much music as one might expect, considering the pedigrees of its stars. Aside from Deni’s radio songs, there are only a handful of musical numbers, most of them reworking existing Gambino tracks. (Rihanna, even more surprisingly, doesn’t sing at all.) But there’s real juice to those sequences, which include a lovely, beachside rendering of “Summertime Magic” and a concert performance of “Saturday” that manages to stage the kind of joy that’s spontaneously captured in the best concert documentaries, like “Wattstax” and “Dave Chappelle’s Block Party.” Onstage, Deni frames his event as “a celebration of life — I want everyone here to feel as free as you possibly can tonight,” and above all else, “Guava Island” is a paean to the pleasures of taking it easy. “We live in paradise,” Deni fumes, “but none of us have time or means to actually live here!” Glover has pinpointed “Purple Rain” and “City of God” as the film’s key influences, but it’s also filled with echoes of the 1973 Jimmy Cliff vehicle “The Harder They Come,” another story of an island musician’s brushes with the criminal underworld. The casually gorgeous, sun-soaked photography apes that film’s grainy, 16-millimeter aesthetic (the cinematographer is Christian Sprenger, who also shoots “Atlanta”), and delivers a timeless, throwback quality; if not set in the past, the picture is rooted in a world that’s stuck there, where no one has a smartphone and everyone still listens to the radio. The film’s primary shared attribute with “Atlanta” is its cockeyed, eccentric worldview, a matter-of-fact acceptance of everyday absurdity. (When Deni is kidnapped and taken to see Red Cargo, he’s sternly told to make a nametag.) That approach proves adaptable to the thriller elements, particularly considering Glover’s gift for reactive comedy — he can get a laugh with something as simple as a shifted gaze or even a dumbfounded deadpan. Rihanna, rather depressingly, has little more to do than to be “the girl”: inspire Deni with her beauty, worry about his safety, and (the oldest and moldiest of tropes) try to decide when and how to tell him she’s pregnant. It’s a dispiriting waste of such a fiery, complicated performer. But she and Glover have movie-star chemistry and charisma to burn, and Murai knows to lean into the glorious, off-the-cuff moment when she succumbs to her love’s pleas and dances, ever so briefly, alongside him. Letitia Wright, so frisky and engaging in “Black Panther,” likewise doesn’t get much to do, but the chillingly affable Anozie makes the most of his minimal screen time. “Guava Island” was made in Cuba, and a remote, location shoot with a chummy, insular crew could have resulted in an Adam Sandler-style throwaway, merely an excuse for a paid vacation in a sunny locale. But in this light, playful effort, the offhanded breeziness is a feature, not a bug. The script is by Glover’s brother Stephen, also of “Atlanta,” but the story is credited to both men and three more “Atlanta” writers. And that tracks; it feels very much like a movie a bunch of friends thought up late one night, perhaps while sharing a blunt, as a party was winding down. This is meant as a compliment.

2019,"‘Hail Satan?’ Review: Pitchforks, Black Clothes and Good Deeds","Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Before watching “Hail Satan?,” you might be surprised to learn that a group of self-described Satanists adopted a stretch of highway in Arizona and picked up litter with pitchforks. Or that others have collected socks for the needy. Or that their ranks — minions? — include not only disaffected rebels clad in black, but also a bowtie-wearing dork who looks like he could be Bill Nye’s understudy. Is such affability part of a sinister plot? It doesn’t seem that way. One point made in this wry and illuminating documentary from Penny Lane is that the group that calls itself the Satanic Temple is not composed of devil worshipers. It’s probably not even a religion, at least in the theistic sense. Its adherents have rallied around seven tenets that sound — well, pretty nice. These include striving “to act with compassion and empathy toward all creatures” and promoting beliefs that conform to a “scientific understanding of the world.” As the Scandinavian academic Jesper Aagaard Petersen explains in the film, Satanists were trolls before the contemporary sense of that word existed. The Satanic Temple, founded in 2013, is basically the Yes Men with an ethos, using humor and outrageous behavior to call attention to hypocrisy, particularly when it comes to incursions of religion into the public sphere. After all, if the Ten Commandments are an acceptable display at the State Capitol in Arkansas, then shouldn’t an eight-foot statue of the goat-headed deity Baphomet get equal play? The scene in which Lucien Greaves, the Satanic Temple’s co-founder, brings the design for that monument to a planning commission and soberly recites its dimensions (“the widest point is at the tips of the wings”) could make professional lampooners like Armando Iannucci and Christopher Guest jealous. To some extent, Lane has taken on a gimme of a subject. The group’s public stunts have resulted in ample news media coverage, and Lane deftly interweaves some of the funniest clips, like one of Greaves dryly resisting the questions of an incredulous-sounding Megyn Kelly. She also finds ways to lighten traditional documentary techniques. (An anonymous interviewee in silhouette wears giant ears and devil horns.) But Lane, a connoisseur of stranger-than-fiction weirdness (“Nuts!”) and found surreality (the archival documentary “Our Nixon” edited together amateur movies shot by associates of the president), takes the Satanic Temple seriously. She delves into the history of American religion in the 20th century (the proliferation of Ten Commandments monuments apparently came courtesy of Cecil B. DeMille) and the legacy of Satanic panics of the 1980s and ’90s, when many of the featured interviewees — including Greaves — were growing up. And as much as the temple’s rallies can be amusing, Lane clearly sees its members as earnest advocates for tolerance, progress and individual freedoms — and the group as just an ordinary emerging organization with growing pains. As the excommunicated head of Detroit’s chapter says toward the end, “It does feel a little bit satisfying to be fired from the Satanic Temple for being too extreme.” When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Hamilton’ Set Designer Goes Whimsical, Using Sotheby’s Galleries as a Stage","David Korins, a creative director and designer whose work includes the set design for “Hamilton,” had a challenge: designing an exhibition for Sotheby’s from the large, varied family collection held at the historic Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, England. He said he wondered, “How can I bring the experience of a really permanent, physically permanent place to New York City and give guests the feeling of what it’s like in the DNA of that experience?” The exhibition, “Treasures From Chatsworth,” will open to the public June 28 in New York in Sotheby’s newly renovated galleries. Admission will be free. Mr. Korins said his “aha moment” came last summer, when he was staying at Chatsworth, home to the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire, for several days as he was conceiving the exhibition. He had gotten up early and sat for a long time in one room. “I began to really let my eyes wander around the room, and not just the big beautiful pieces of art but the furniture and the corners of the room,” he said. He realized that he didn’t just want to make the artwork and objects part of the exhibition; he wanted to include the details of the house itself. In the form of blown-up 360-degree sculptures, Mr. Korins will magnify small details — table legs, moldings, chair feet, corners of rooms — and use them as vitrines and set pieces for the artworks and objects on display. [Check out our Culture Calendar here.] The exhibition will feature 45 artworks, decorative objects, pieces of jewelry, clothing and archive materials — all drawn from the Devonshire Collection, accumulated over about 500 years by the Cavendish family, and held at Chatsworth House. The large stately home made was made famous by its use in the 2005 film “Pride and Prejudice” as Mr. Darcy’s Pemberley. (Some believe that Jane Austen originally based Pemberley on Chatsworth.) Today, the house is partially open to the public but remains a private residence for the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire. Among the objects coming to the United States are a portrait by Rembrandt; two Canaletto paintings of Venice; a stunning veiled marble sculpture by Raffaele Monti; and two Lucian Freud portraits, of the 11th Duke of Devonshire and his wife, the Duchess. “The collection is really quite eclectic because different members of my family, different ancestors inevitably had different taste,” said the Peregrine Andrew Morny Cavendish, known as Stoker, the current Duke of Devonshire. “An interesting thing about the collection is that it’s a continuum. It’s not just one or two generations, but nearly 500 years of them.” He said that many things in the collection have gone through cycles of use and disuse, going out of fashion and coming into it again. He described a set of chairs by designer Joseph Walsh, which the family now uses most days in the dining room. One day, he said, “they’ll be put in a glass case.” The Duke of Devonshire said he’s thrilled by Mr. Korins’s imaginative design for the exhibition. “I think he has a brilliant way of getting across a grand space in a smaller space,” he said. “I think the architecture of this exhibition will focus attention on the works, and we’ll look at them in a different sort of way.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘He Nodded, Apparently Took the Sign Literally and Rushed Up the Steps’","METROPOLITAN DIARY Waiting to see a popular show, stopped for running a red light on a big day and more reader tales of New York City in this week’s Metropolitan Diary. Dear Diary: I was eager to see “The Lehman Trilogy” at the Park Avenue Armory, but I knew the only way to see one of the sold-out performances would be to line up for the rush tickets that went on sale at noon each day. I arrived at 67th Street and Park Avenue one morning at 7. One person was already there. Person No. 3 arrived at 8:45. The line grew quickly after that. At around 9 a.m., some armory employees brought out a bench, so at least we could sit. There were rumors that only 20 tickets were available and that each person who was waiting would be limited to two. A box-office employee eventually appeared and said that was not true. She didn’t say what was true. People kept coming to the front of the line to ask, “What time did you get here?” “Six o’clock,” my early bird friend would answer. At one point, a man hurrying up Park Avenue stopped. “What is this line for?” he asked. We pointed to the sign that had been put out at 9: “Rush Seats for ‘The Lehman Trilogy.’” He nodded, apparently took the sign literally and rushed up the steps, only to meander back down. I don’t know how many people actually got tickets, but the wait was definitely worth all 300 minutes. — Arlene Mark Dear Diary: I was taking the subway to my part-time job. There were very few other passengers riding the train. I noticed a young man get on with a huge black garbage bag stuffed to the breaking point. I didn’t pay him much attention until he started to work furiously at the knot at the top the bag. I wanted to know what was in it. When he finally spread the bag open at the top, I saw that it was full of Cheerios, which he began to eat. — Marcy Altimano Dear Diary: It was a hot, sticky morning last August, and I was sweating. I thought I could make the light at 35th Street and Seventh Avenue. I eased through the turn just as it changed. Then, blue lights, the quick burp of a siren. Oh, no. I pulled over and rolled down my window. “The light was red,” the police officer said. “Um…,” I replied. “Where you headed?” I spoke fast, completely stream of consciousness. “I’m on my way to Boston,” I said. “But when I packed my tuxedo this morning, I noticed that the pants were missing. I have to stop just down the block and rent a pair, so that at my son’s wedding tomorrow, I won’t be the only person not wearing pants.” I didn’t admit that I had had plenty of time to discover the problem. My son had been engaged for more than a year. The officer was quiet, but it definitely looked like he hadn’t heard that one before. He pulled a pamphlet from his pocket and handed it to me, something to do with safe driving. “Enjoy the wedding,” he said. — Donovan Moore Dear Diary: I headed off to my weekly ballroom dancing session. I had my dance shoes in a thin canvas bag on my shoulder. When I got to the session and took off my coat, there was no bag. When I got home, I searched my apartment, and I even went to the basement to look through the trash and recycling. One of the building’s custodians saw my distress — they were comfortable shoes! —- and helped with the search. No luck. I thanked my helper, resigned myself to the loss and went to bed. The next morning, I headed out again. It was a bright, beautiful day. And there, hanging on a fence, was the bag with my shoes. — Amabel James Dear Diary: I was visiting New York and had arranged to have drinks with an ex at Columbia. I had broken things off when he moved to New York from California a few years earlier but I was starting to regret it. A few drinks in, he told me he was seeing someone. We left the bar and walked toward 116th Street holding hands. I started sobbing in the rain outside the subway entrance. He kissed my cheeks sympathetically, and then he went off to work on a group project. As I sat on the No. 1 train on my way back to my friend’s apartment, I felt my heart break a bit. It really was over. An older man sitting across from me kindly reassured me, twice, that I would be O.K. He was right. I’m glad he didn’t leave me alone. — Emily Alpert Read all recent entries and our submissions guidelines. Reach us via email diary@nytimes.com or follow @NYTMetro on Twitter.

2019,‘Hellboy’ Review: What’s Big and Horned and Red All Over?,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Exuberantly British and quite possibly off its rocker, “Hellboy” is a crack pipe of a movie. Rebooting Guillermo del Toro’s 2004 and 2008 appropriations of Mike Mignola’s comic-book character — a rosacea-hued colossus with filed-down horns and do-gooder goals — the British director Neil Marshall turns all the dials to 11 and keeps them there. This aural and visual assault poses the question: Exactly how much stimulation do studios think audiences need? A great deal, apparently, as this new “Hellboy” (with David Harbour replacing the irreplaceable Ron Perlman as our knobheaded hero) tears through multiple countries, 16 centuries and a bevy of supernatural sources to save mankind from, among other things, a bunch of enraged giants. (The insane script, a bedlam of witches, fairies, Nazis and ectoplasm, is by Andrew Cosby.) In Hellboy’s way stands Milla Jovovich as a reconstituted sorceress (previously sliced-and-diced for our safety) and an array of imaginative weapons including electrified pigstickers, Excalibur and a proper English breakfast. No prizes for guessing which is the most deadly. Arthurian legend isn’t all that’s violated here, even if the closest we get to sex is a disgustingly viscous snog between Hellboy and a randy crone. (The special effects are often more gooey than ghoulish.) Marshall, a world away from the dank dread and crawling terror of his 2006 spelunking stunner, “The Descent,” directs like a dog at a squirrel convention, charging gleefully from one witlessly violent encounter to the next. Ian McShane, as Hellboy’s adoptive father, does what he can to calm the chaos, but the movie left me alternately baffled and battered. “The end is coming,” Hellboy’s dying friend says near the beginning, and I was already thinking, “Oh yes, please.” When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.",The New York Times
2019,‘Her Smell’ Review: The Road to Rock ’n’ Roll Transcendence Goes Through the Gutter,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Can you separate the artist from the art? Lately that dusty theoretical question has been revived in reference to certain problematic men. How do we respond when greatness and awfulness coexist, or when talent is used as an alibi for gross misbehavior? Usually by fighting among ourselves. “Her Smell,” Alex Ross Perry’s relentless new film, poses the problem in a different register, and not only because the difficult artist in question is a woman. The lead singer in an all-female trio called Something She, she goes by the name Becky Something. The nom de guerre (Becky is nothing if not combative) suggests both that self-invention is part of her creative program and that it remains incomplete. She used to be Rebecca Adamczyk (she’s played by Elisabeth Moss), and now she’s someone else. The artist, in other words, is the art. That’s just rock ’n’ roll canon, from Elvis (Presley or Costello) to Johnny Rotten and beyond. St. Vincent is a Becky Something, and so is Cardi B. On a more literal level, Becky’s resemblance to Courtney Love is unmistakable, even if it’s also deniable. Some details track very closely; others don’t. But in spite of that warped mirroring, and in spite of its familiar VH1 “Behind the Music” rise-fall-redemption structure, “Her Smell” is no musical biopic. It’s a train wreck in five acts, mostly unfolding offstage. We are behind the scenes in the aftermath of one concert and in the anxious run-up to two others. We are in a recording studio during an especially messy session and in the rambling country house where Becky takes refuge after everything falls apart. I say we are there because Perry’s camera is like a human presence: clammy, curious, caught between the urge to follow Becky everywhere and the impulse to run away from her. That summary isn’t in order, by the way, but disorder is Becky’s method and her muse. Which isn’t quite true of Perry, a highly disciplined filmmaker who has cast Moss in three of his last four features. The more unpleasant people are, the more rigorous his attention to them becomes. His collaborations with Moss (notably here and in “Queen of Earth”) are suites for fingernail and blackboard, unbearable and strangely beautiful. Moss strips away every shred of her charm to reveal her charisma in its rawest state, implicating Perry and the audience in a voyeurism that can feel almost holy. In rock ’n’ roll mythology, the road to transcendence often passes through the gutter, and “Her Smell” sets out a beggar’s banquet of abjection. Shot (by Sean Price Williams) in a blemish-enhancing palette of smudged makeup and unflattering light, the movie barely leaves its title to the imagination. Its images might induce olfactory hallucinations of spilled liquor, cigarettes, nervous sweat and vomit. And genius, too. Moss is deep in Becky’s skin, and Perry is steadfastly on her side. Not that he condones or forgives. She is gleefully cruel and monstrously inconsiderate to everyone around her, daring them to fight back or flee. Her bandmates, Marielle (Agyness Deyn) and Ali (Gayle Rankin), are old hands at sitting out her tantrums and deflecting her taunts. Her ex-husband (Dan Stevens) and her mother (Virginia Madsen) are indulgent and resentful by turns. The head of Something She’s record label (Eric Stoltz) alternates between playing the victim and enabling her forays into self-harm. What does she have to do to drive them away? Who will she hurt the most? Her young daughter? Ali and Marielle? The star-struck punk acolytes who haven’t yet developed antidotes to her toxicity? Herself? These questions are exhausting. But as terrifying and grinding as it can be — long scenes play out in what feels like real time against horror-movie soundscapes, dread dangling from the camera like a lens cap — Becky’s story is also tender and funny. The music and images ache with nostalgia for the ’90s and early 2000s, when the action takes place. The five chapters spread out over six years or so and are punctuated by home-video-style flashbacks to the band’s earlier glory days. Those clips capture them in the full, bratty ebullience of youth, acting out in ways that foreshadow the darker, heavier times to come. Perry is a rock ’n’ roll antiquarian for sure. The make-believe CD cases that pop up alongside the final credits look uncannily like real album covers, and other artifacts of the pre-iPod musical universe are equally right. But he also has a revisionist streak, an interest in reimagining the recent past rather than faithfully reconstructing it. The music scene in “Her Smell” is female-centric in a way that feels both pointed and matter of fact. There are male musicians around, but they are marginal figures, husbands and hangers-on, bystanders at the big show. Which isn’t only about Becky. She has a frenemy named Zelda (Amber Heard), a rival rocker who is Apollo to her Dionysus, or maybe David Bowie to her Iggy Pop. Something She is also entangled with a group called the Akergirls, a younger trio whose sisterly vibe seems like a generational rebuke to the dysfunction that defines Becky’s relationship with Ali and Marielle. (The Akergirls are played by Ashley Benson, Dylan Gelula and Cara Delevingne, who might make you hope for a sequel.) I don’t think Perry is trying to show that women in music can be just as reckless and vain as men, but rather that he’s trying to take such facile gender-based comparisons off the table to home in on Becky’s inner tensions and contradictions. For her part, Moss varies the volume and the tempo of her performance, calling forth cascades of profane invention and rills of whispery poetry, but she always stays in the same key, the key of Becky. Becky is a narcissist, an addict, a liar and an abuser. Still, even at her worst — and the movie is all about her worst — she shows the wit and unpredictability that make it hard for anyone to quit her. Some of that resides in her dazzling verbal dexterity. When she’s ranting, riffing and soliloquizing, a torrent of metaphor, allusion and alliteration spills from her mouth. It’s too much to take in, but it keeps you listening. Her lyrics are more jagged and austere. (The original songs were composed by Alicia Bognanno and Anika Pyle.) “I don’t want to quit/I just want to be in control of it,” Becky sings during the film’s quiet, rural sequence. The line sounds like it’s about substance abuse, and “Her Smell” is unsparing in its attention to the awful thrill of using and the tedium and terror of sobriety. But there is another layer of meaning there, at once plainer and more abstract. The “it” she wants to be in control of, the thing she would rather not quit, is her art. Her life, in other words.

2019,‘High Life’ Review: Robert Pattinson Is Lost in Space,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Every so often in “High Life,” the latest from the French director Claire Denis, there’s a shot of outer space. A cosmic whatsit, the story largely takes place in a black-velvet void with pinpricks of light. Earth is far away, long ago, a memory. Not all that much happens in this immensity, though sometimes a colorful gassy emanation floods the screen and something — a wrench, a body — floats into the great nothing. Inside a spaceship, by contrast, there’s plenty of action: bodily fluids, spasms of violence, the rising and setting of Robert Pattinson’s head. It is an amazing head, its pale skin stretched across bone that is as geometrically distinct as a Cubist portrait. Denis, who has a seductive visual style, spends a lot of time focused on Pattinson’s skull in “High Life,” which centers on his desultory character, Monte. He’s one of a small criminal crew of good-looking men and women (Mia Goth, Lars Eidinger and the musician André Benjamin are onboard, too) who years ago agreed to participate in a space mission to avoid the death penalty. Their journey ostensibly has something to do with the earth’s looming environmental catastrophe, but mostly plays out as an excuse for Denis to explore the farther, darker side of her imagination. Denis’s work can be intoxicating, filled with strong, attention-seizing, mind-bending images that resonate powerfully. At times, beauty seems to stand alone, untethered to meaning; at other times, it underlines a tangible idea or generates significance by proxy. Years after seeing her film “Nénette et Boni” (1996), I don’t remember much about the story. But its startling, playfully erotic, intensely palpable reveries remain embedded in my memory: the white bunny nestled between a woman’s feathery high-heel mules, the baker’s wife with a creamy, teasing bosom who leans over a display of luscious pastries. “High Life” has its share of striking images that sometimes fit together like puzzle pieces or just float into nothingness, similarly to that errant wrench. The story starts to take shape shortly after the birth of a girl, whose unexpected arrival disrupts the ship’s already fragile stability. Named Willow (and played in turn by Scarlett Lindsey and Jessie Ross), the baby is the first to survive the experimental interventions of Dibs (Juliette Binoche), the ship’s demented doctor. Wearing a long, heavy rope of braided hair, signaling the crew’s many years in space, Dibs has a criminal past, too, but she also has dominion over the other crew members, whom she medicates to keep docile. Dibs isn’t running things, not at first, but she might as well be. She dresses the crew members’ wounds and tends to the sick, offers unwelcome douching advice to another woman and provides unorthodox if perhaps welcome T.L.C. to a dying man. Her most significant and unusual duty, though, is collecting semen (donors are rewarded with pills) that she uses to impregnate the women. Dibs has her reasons, naturally, though they’re so unpersuasive that you have to wonder why Denis bothered, especially given that narrative logic isn’t much of interest to her. What interests Denis is everything else, including the disembodied exchange of bodily fluids between a man and a woman. A few other things interest her, including desire, sublimated and unleashed. As is often the case in Denis’s movies, “High Life” vibrates with low-key erotic energy that can feel exciting, a little dangerous. (She wrote it with Jean-Pol Fargeau.) One reason is the obvious seductive appeal of performers like Pattinson, Binoche and Benjamin, whose faces and bodies are alternately flooded with flattering light or eye-straining washes of red and blue. But Denis doesn’t just prettify her actors: She lingers on their forms, their skin, stressing texture that becomes tactile. When her camera pans across a downy arm, you see it but also remember — and feel — the downiness and pleasures of other arms, legs, faces. Things happen, some ridiculous and exasperating, others effectively and productively surprising (like Dibs’s desperate, lonely sexual writhing). Pattinson’s vivid presence and intimate voice-over help shape a movie that often feels on the verge of disintegrating. He keeps you watching, as do the images of reverberant, often haunting power and beauty, including a fecund garden in which kale, berries and gourds grow in bleak contrast to the ship’s laboratory fetuses. But too often the ideas here, visual and otherwise, feel haphazard — outer and inner space, Pattinson’s head, sexual taboo, apocalypse now or maybe then — more like material for a vision board than a fully realized vision.

2019,Opinion | ‘Hilarious Guys With Day Jobs’: The British Team That Makes Soccer Fun Again,"Sporting Watching the addictive weekly serial of the Hashtag United team is much more fun than following the Premier League. Mr. Elder is fan of real and reality-show soccer. On weekend mornings from August to May, thousands of American soccer fans stuffed into $90 replica uniforms gather at their nearest British or Irish pub to scream in unison at a television. It’s the popular way English soccer is consumed in America, and it was the closest I could get to the actual experience of England’s famous stadium atmosphere. But this season my viewing ritual transformed: Instead of a noisy pub, I now sit at home with headphones on in front of my laptop. Gone are the aromas of spilled beer and room-temperature breakfast sausage. The mood is considerably lighter: I laugh more and rage far less. That’s because I’m not watching the highest echelon of soccer — or anything close to it. I’m following something like the lowest professional echelon, via the weekly YouTube episodes of an irresistible team with a ridiculous name: Hashtag United. Last weekend I smiled and laughed as they celebrated clinching their league's championship — in the 10th division of English soccer and on a field called the Old Spotted Dog Ground. For this, they’ll be promoted to the dizzying heights of England’s ninth division next season. Hashtag United isn’t particularly easy to explain. It’s a three-year-old semipro soccer team from London’s suburbs that laboriously films their games, adds witty commentary, then posts episodes on YouTube — pregame banter, match highlights, locker-room talks, postgame interviews and all. Oh, and until this season, they played real games, but in an imaginary league. Hashtag United’s popularity beggars belief. Only two teams have more YouTube subscribers than the channels of Hashtag United and its founder put together: Real Madrid and Barcelona. Hashtag’s cyberspace fan base has enabled the team to embark on tours of Europe and the United States as part of those fictional league seasons, sponsored by entirely real companies like Coca-Cola. In August 2018, things got truly surreal: Hashtag United entered a real league — the 10th division of English soccer. Why would someone watch this when the world’s best soccer is more accessible than ever? Well, what’s more relatable than a bunch of hilarious guys with day jobs who play on a soccer team just for fun — sometimes running late to matches, requesting days off work or missing games to go on their honeymoon? Hashtag United is a polished, all-access look at a grass-roots English soccer team at a time when the top of the sport feels less authentic and equitable than ever, with its Lamborghini-collecting, tax-dodging, magnificently coifed stars who insouciantly hop from one megaclub to the next (many of which are owned by Russian oligarchs, Arab royalty or American businessmen). Hashtag’s players, preternaturally charming and telegenic, talk and joke directly into the camera. The games all feature cinéma vérité room scenes in which the coach Jay Devereux lays out strategy, hypes them up or roasts his players for underperforming. Celebrity guests and retired stars materialize for cameos. It’s an addictive, weekly serial of English soccer, viewed from the bottom. Hashtag United, for its refreshing dose of reality, is actually a case of life imitating art. Its 30-year-old creator, Spencer Owen — a former standup comedian who grew a large following on YouTube from humorous videos that offered tips for the enormously popular FIFA soccer video game — wanted to bring that video game experience to life. He created a world of soccer that mirrors video gameplay by inventing his own leagues, with point totals to reach each “season” in order to move up to the next “division.” Soon Hashtag was playing reserve teams, company teams or any team that didn’t mind playing the role of second fiddle. Every match was watched by tens or hundreds of thousands of viewers — largely 16- to 25-year-olds for whom the video-game homage intuitively makes sense or older, cynical Gen Xers like me who long for the authentic “Englishness” that drew them to the game before it got swallowed up by commercialism and who sit in front of a computer all day at work — again, like me. Their matches rack up 250,000 to 500,000 views (for comparison, just under half a million Americans watch the average Premier League match). Their popularity catches many adults — but especially Hashtag’s players — off guard. For example, at one Hashtag tournament, according to Seb Carmichael-Brown, the team’s commercial director, “we had Robert Pires, World Cup winner with France, come in to the dressing room with his children — to meet us.” Last summer, Hashtag leapt into the real-world Eastern Counties League Division One South and hired Mr. Devereux, an experienced manager who speaks in what sounds like a delightful, ear-tickling Essex accent, to lead them. Hashtag United are a decent team for their level, but their appeal has little to do with winning. While their professional treatment of pretend-league games felt like an elaborate, Andy Kaufman-style stunt, their leap into a real league, still presented with slick production values, now feels more like a tacit critique of modern sports. After all, these are unpaid players with normal real-world jobs who nonetheless get stopped for selfies on the street or at the supermarket, according to Mr. Carmichael-Brown. The backdrop to their journey is wet, windswept, nondescript fields around greater London, before sparse crowds and signage advertising local rental van companies or radiator dealers. It’s a reprieve from the overwrought, media-driven drama, tribalism and emotional toll that sports takes on a dedicated fan. Hashtag United’s ethos and its success remind us that sports can actually be enjoyed, rather than experienced as a weekly life-or-death ordeal or as a battlefield for a proxy culture war. But just as any escapist entertainment comes into sharpest relief when contrasted with what it’s an escape from, it seems unlikely you’ll ever see Hashtag United on the big screen at a bar. The small screen — your smartphone — suits them. Hashtag United is the ideal “second team” for its fans, all of whom watch the team the same way I do: alone, and all to ourselves. We each follow our first team of choice every week out of obligation, but we all follow Hashtag United just for fun. Adam Elder is a writer in San Diego.

2019,‘Hockey in Heaven’,"In a remote Himalayan town in northern India, a women’s ice hockey team comes together. CreditCreditHilary Swift for The New York Times LEH, India — More than 11,000 feet above sea level, a group of 30 women spread out and got to work around an open-air ice rink. Armed with shovels, brooms made from small branches, and hockey sticks, they cleared the surface of the New Rink after an overnight snowstorm. Billowing green nets, intended to keep the sun from melting the ice, hung heavy with white powder, sagging toward the surface of the rink. The women pushed and pulled at the fabric, using their sticks to thwack the net, hoping to dislodge its frosty burden. Once the snow was cleared, it was time for the national women’s ice hockey team of India to start what the players call “camp.” For 15 days, 20 national team players and 10 hopefuls trained in Leh, a remote Himalayan town of about 31,000 in the northernmost state of India. They were preparing for the Challenge Cup of Asia tournament, which was held in Abu Dhabi this week. They dream of playing in the Olympics, but that is a long way off. The Challenge Cup, the only international competition the team has ever entered, is for countries in the lowest division of the International Ice Hockey Federation. This year India was joined by the Philippines, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. According to the federation, there are 311 female ice hockey players in India, the world’s second most-populous country, which has only five indoor rinks and a sports culture dominated by cricket and field hockey. “Even our families are like, ‘What are you doing? Get a job,’” said Diskit Angmo, a 22-year-old at the camp. “Sometimes I get frustrated, sometimes I’m like, ‘What the hell?’ But then the passion comes up.” Most of the national team players are from Leh or other parts of the Ladakh region, which is sometimes called Little Tibet. Only one player — a goalie from Mumbai — comes from a large city. The players range in age from 15 to 29, and all but two are students. Camp has been a special experience for the team, which started competing in 2016. The players were also able to train for 20 days together in Kyrgyzstan ahead of the 2017 Challenge Cup. The rink where they practice every day is another example of their sport’s growth. It is one of two that opened last year. The players were used to skating on frozen rivers and ponds. When Adam Sherlip, a former men’s coach who helped the women’s team, first came to the area in 2009, there were only three ice rinks and there was very little interest in hockey, he said. Over the last decade, he has witnessed a transformation. Now, he said, “all people care about in winter is hockey. So many new rinks are being built every year.” There are hockey teams throughout Ladakh. The men’s national team, a mix of army and civilian players, is also based in Leh. A February tournament was organized by the police department and featured a women’s team from a school and another assembled by a local hotel. Harjinder Singh, the general secretary of the Ice Hockey Association of India, said the sport was “a magnet for youth to come together,” particularly in the winter months when all roads leading in and out of Leh are closed because of snow. There is only one way to get here: by air. At this year’s camp, the members of the women’s national team slept, ate and socialized together at a rented hostel on the outskirts of town. During their free time between morning practice and off-ice training, the women gathered around space heaters at the hostel, braiding one another’s hair, playing cards and napping. With 10 women per room, quarters were close. Music came from their three bedrooms. One song, “The Cha Cha Shuffle,” the team first heard months earlier in Canada. The women traveled there for a hockey festival organized by Hayley Wickenheiser, a four-time Olympic gold medalist. The players rubbed shoulders with Wayne Gretzky, Connor McDavid and Jujhar Khaira, the N.H.L.’s only current player of Indian descent. “Being an ice hockey player, it’s always a dream to come to Canada,” said Angmo, who wears No. 19 like her favorite N.H.L. player, Jonathan Toews of the Chicago Blackhawks. “I had to pinch myself when we saw Gretzky and McDavid. I kept on thinking, ‘This isn’t real.’” In 2017 Wickenheiser saw a YouTube video of the women playing hockey with the world’s tallest mountains looming above them. In January 2018 she traveled to Ladakh with Andrew Ference, a retired N.H.L. defenseman who is the league’s director of social impact. “It’s like playing hockey in heaven,” Wickenheiser said. The Canadians brought 100 bags of hockey gear, 25 of them coming from the National Hockey League Players’ Association. The women’s team relies on outside organizations and crowdsourcing for equipment and funding. Because ice hockey is not played in many parts of India, the government has not recognized it as an official national sport, and thus does not provide significant financial support. “We are in the infant stage right now,” said Rinchen Dolma, 28, a forward. None of the athletes, trainers or coaches on the team are compensated. The Ladakh Women’s Ice Hockey Foundation and the Ice Hockey Association of India paid for room and board at the hostel and for a 10-day coaching camp with 130 girls in an area outside Leh. Another foundation, run by Sherlip, got sideboards for the New Rink from a club in Austria. With so few indoor rinks, India’s hockey season is almost entirely dependent on the weather. Noor Jahan, 28, the team’s goalie, said the most important advancement would be getting a rink where players could train year-round. “Unless we have the best training facility, I don’t think that we will even win the Asian championships,” she said. “Forget about the Olympics.” Impassible roads in the winter affect the team’s diet; produce and fresh meat are hard to find. Until spring comes, the community — and the team — eats mainly lentils and rice. Skarma Lotus, a volunteer strength and conditioning coach, bemoaned not being able to introduce more protein into the player’s diets. “One egg is all that we can give to them,” he said. India hoped to win the Challenge Cup, but lost its first two games. The women ended their tournament by defeating Kuwait, 11-0, on Thursday. It was their third win ever in international competition. Jahan said that, for her, competing in the Olympics was “a dream too big to see at this moment.” Instead, the dream she sees is coaching an Olympic team in the future. “We are the first generation of ice hockey players,” Jahan said. “And like I always say, we are definitely not going to be the last ones playing.” Salim Valji contributed reporting from Montreal.",The New York Times

There is a perfectly logical reason for that, at least for me. I was not expecting this kind of theme, and shame on me. You would think that after nearly a decade of doing this, I would know to expect absolutely anything from the constructors and editors. And yet here we are. I finished and thought this was a very clever debut by Mr. Olsen, although it took me a while to figure out what to enter for the theme answers. I’ve provided a major hint in the Today’s Theme section for those who are solving online. 20A: The “Place to find a cluster of stars?” could be up in the sky, but in this puzzle, we’re thinking of a V.I.P. ROOM. 23A: Hi, kids! Many years ago, when your parents needed a break from the head banging rock ’n’ roll we listened to (now known as “Classic Rock, Which Is What We Call It When Our Parents Are Around, but Otherwise It Is ‘Music for Olds’”), they wandered off into a genre called New Age music (formerly known as “Music to Get High To”). Listening to New Age music was once thought to be a serious path to spiritual enlightenment and is now also parodied by people like JP Sears. One of the much listened-to artists of New Age was Enya, who has appeared in the New York Times Crossword a total of 118 times, although it feels like much more. Anyway, she recorded an album called “Watermark,” which was released in 1988 with the title song: There. Don’t you feel more relaxed already? 67A: I had AIR before NEO for “Con opener?” but appreciate the wordplay in this clue. 1D: Lyric writing pro tip: If you use the same word at the end of each verse, such as BRAVE in “The Star-Spangled Banner,” it is much easier to make sure that it rhymes. 3D: It made me happy to see HAPPY FACE make its New York Times Crossword debut. Thank you, Mr. Olsen. 12D: The “Butler of renown” is not a Jeeves-type of butler, but RHETT Butler. 19D: “It’s more than a fling” is not talking about a one-night stand, it’s talking about throwing or “flinging” things. If you throw or fling it even harder, you HEAVE it. 44D: TIL that the word HORST is not just a name, but also a geologic element. 49D: I'm not sure why this surprised me, but it did. JAPAN is the country with the greatest number of McDonald’s restaurants, other than the U.S. UPDATED: 53D: How did I forget this one? “Neat” is a verbalization, so the answer has to be a verbalization, and the answer is “NOICE.” What does NOICE mean, you ask? Well, if you watch the television series “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” Andy Samberg’s character, Jake, elongates the word “nice” that way and it has made its way into the lexicon. It’s also hilarious, because if you read it as two words, NO ICE, that’s also what a cocktail served “neat"" means. 62D: With the question mark, “Bottom line?” is not talking about a business statistic. It’s talking about the HEM of an item of clothing. Major hint: Use the rebus button, Luke. Trust me on this. Mr. Olsen suggests that we put on a HAPPY FACE (3D) in his puzzle, and he provides quite a bit of theme material to help bring out our smiles. If you’ve ever sent an email or texted, you are aware of the smiley face EMOTICON (35D), which consists of a COLON and HYPHEN (combined at 18A and symbolizing the EYES and the NOSE of the face), as well as an end PARENTHESIS at 61A, which symbolizes the smiling MOUTH. At the central Across entry, we have the actual EMOTICON itself, and the elements can also be used to complete the crossing Down entries. For example, where we have the EYES in the first square of 39A, the answer to the clue “Blot on a landscape” is [EYES]ORE. You can get the rest. It’s a great honor to make my New York Times crossword debut with a puzzle I had so much fun putting together! I’m a veterinarian who has been addicted to crossword puzzles for 30 years, ever since I picked up my first issue of GAMES magazine when I was 7. After getting some puzzles published in GAMES in college, I wanted to make a more serious effort to get my work into The New York Times. All of my early rejections thankfully came with some helpful feedback. Thanks to Will for giving this puzzle a thumbs up; to Dave, Lily and Mom for test solving; and especially to Nancy Salomon for some excellent mentorship during the constructing process. I decided it would be a novel idea to build a puzzle around an emoticon. I toyed with a few different ideas for working in a smiley face, such as fitting it into a single square rebus-fashion or placing it into a few themed entries to replace the word HAPPY. In the end, I decided to place the emoticon dead center and use the other theme entries to hint at the gimmick. It worked out nicely that EYES, NOSE, and MOUTH dovetailed into some decent Down rebus entries, and the fact that COLONHYPHEN / PARENTHESIS worked as symmetrical descriptors sealed the deal. A few of my original clues may have been too iffy for a Thursday, or for the difficulty of their crossings (“Rocky landing?” for PLYMOUTH; “Change for good?” for TIP JAR), and were changed accordingly, so I’ll have to keep that in mind going forward. Hope this was a fun solve, and I look forward to rolling out more puzzles in the near future! Almost finished solving but need a bit more help? We’ve got you covered. Warning: There be spoilers ahead, but subscribers can take a peek at the answer key. Trying to get back to the puzzle page? Right here. Your thoughts?",The New York Times
2019,‘Homecoming’ Documentary Comes With a Surprise: A Beyoncé Live Album,"When it comes to Beyoncé releases, there is usually an element of surprise. The singer — who perfected the secret album drop in 2013, and has since toyed with the tactic for releases like “Lemonade” and “Everything Is Love,” with her husband Jay-Z — did it again in the early morning hours Wednesday, one-upping the arrival of her own Netflix documentary, “Homecoming,” with a previously unannounced live-album version of the same concert. [Read our review of the Beyoncé documentary “Homecoming.”] Both the film and the album, also titled “Homecoming,” capture Beyoncé’s performance at last year’s Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, in which the singer — the first black woman to headline the event — was backed by dozens of dancers and an elaborate marching band for a set that nodded to the musical legacy of historically black colleges. “There’s not likely to be a more meaningful, absorbing, forceful and radical performance by an American musician this year, or any year soon,” the critic Jon Caramanica wrote of the show in The New York Times. “It was rich with history, potently political and visually grand. By turns uproarious, rowdy, and lush. A gobsmacking marvel of choreography and musical direction.” Now, the concert — which was live-streamed at the time and recreated for Coachella’s second weekend, but has existed only in bootleg form since — has been preserved for history in multiple mediums. The documentary, a Netflix exclusive billed as “a film by Beyoncé,” features footage from rehearsals and quieter backstage moments — “the emotional road from creative concept to cultural movement,” Netflix said. “Homecoming: The Live Album” is a more straightforward recreation of the concert that became known as Beychella. It breaks the more than two-hour performance into 40 tracks, many of which are packed with multiple musical references and sections of other songs. [5 things we learned from Beyoncé’s Coachella doc “Homecoming.”] Beyoncé’s set list, which varied slightly over the two Coachella performances, included solo hits like “Get Me Bodied,” “Baby Boy” and “Formation,” the Destiny’s Child songs “Say My Name” and “Soldier” (with her former group mates Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams) and various interludes with titles here such as “So Much Damn Swag” and “The Bzzzz Drumline.” She also included a rendition of the hymn “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” a song often referred to as the black national anthem. The album also includes an a cappella version of “Lift Every Voice and Sing” by Blue Ivy, Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s oldest daughter, and two bonus tracks: a new cover of “Before I Let Go,” the 1981 song by Maze featuring Frankie Beverly, which appears in the end credits of the documentary, and an alternate version of “I Been On.” While some recent Beyoncé releases have been available, at least for a time, only on Tidal, the streaming service owned by Jay-Z, the live album was released across all major streaming platforms, including Apple Music, Spotify and Google Play. Since Coachella, Beyoncé has been largely quiet professionally, though she toured with Jay-Z last summer, surprising fans with the nine-track collaborative effort “Everything Is Love” along the way. She has not announced a follow-up.",The New York Times
2019,‘I Cry Every Day’: Families of Soldiers Killed in Niger in 2017 Are Still Waiting for Answers,"SANTA CLAUS, Ga. — Arnold Wright figures he has been to at least 20 ceremonies to honor his son, a soldier who was killed in Niger 18 months ago. The funeral at the high school football stadium. A stop on the rostrum of the Georgia House of Representatives. A memorial at Fort Bragg, N.C. But Mr. Wright is still stuck in time, trapped between the events of Oct. 4, 2017, and coming to peace with the death of Staff Sgt. Dustin M. Wright and three other American soldiers whom insurgents ambushed in the brush of western Niger. [Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive stories about duty, conflict and consequence.] The military has not concluded its reckoning over its largest loss of life in combat in Africa since the 1993 “Black Hawk Down” debacle in Somalia. Its inability to settle questions of accountability and punishment have fueled fury and frustration at the highest levels of the Pentagon and left the families of the four dead soldiers to rely on news reports, rumors, back channels and one another to piece together how the Green Beret unit, Team 3212, came under fire. “I don’t really have closure because they haven’t really come clean,” Mr. Wright, himself a former soldier, said after a ceremony to dedicate a stretch of Highway 1 in Toombs County, Ga., to his son’s memory. “They’re procrastinating, thinking this is going to go away, and it’s not going to go away,” Mr. Wright said. “They need to put the full, correct story out.” American officials have spent the long stretch since the ambush conducting a sequence of reviews — including an investigation that last May found widespread problems with the mission in Niger — and facing internal turmoil over how to recognize valor and punish errors throughout the chain of command. But while those investigations and debates have played out, families said they had been left to question whether the military had offered them a complete account of the ambush and the decisions that led up to it. “It wasn’t just the length of time that it’s taken, it’s the major missing pieces even once we were briefed,” said Michelle Black, the widow of Staff Sgt. Bryan C. Black. “Now that it’s taken even longer, it just leaves you not trusting that you’ll ever hear the truth.” Hank Black, Sergeant Black’s father and a retired Marine major, said he had spoken to Sgt. La David Johnson’s wife in recent weeks to discuss plans for a new memorial, but he had not heard from Staff Sgt. Jeremiah W. Johnson’s parents. Neither family would comment for this article. On Thursday, the Pentagon’s inspector general cleared Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan of any wrongdoing in an ethics inquiry relates to his former employment at the military contractor Boeing. The internal inquiry had threatened to further delay his decisions on a new review of the punishments in connection with the Niger ambush. In an email on Friday, Lt. Col. Joe Buccino, a Pentagon spokesman, said Mr. Shanahan’s “goal here remains to culminate this review as thoroughly and expeditiously as possible and with the greatest measure of respect for the families.” The military’s account of the 2017 ambush has been halting and inconsistent, in public and in private, since the first days after the firefight, when American commanders benignly described the operation as a routine reconnaissance mission. In fact, the 11-member team, working far from base and lacking air support, was ambushed by more than 100 militants aligned with the Islamic State after superior officers changed its mission to one that carried far greater risks. The ambush — in which four Nigerien soldiers and an interpreter were also killed — and accusations that President Trump offered trite condolences to Sgt. La David Johnson’s widow cast a sudden spotlight on the United States’ operations in Niger, where about 800 American troops were stationed. The attack prompted the Pentagon to consider scaling back operations in western Africa even before last May, when the military released a summary of Africa Command’s investigation and revealed widespread problems at all levels of the doomed mission. But the investigation, the subject of a report that runs hundreds of pages and still has not been made public, did not resolve the misgivings that had come to surround the attack. A Special Operations Command inquiry led to the first wave of punishments in October over botched decisions that left Team 3212 vulnerable to the ambush. Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general who at the time was the defense secretary, quickly lashed out at his subordinates because the Army had focused its official ire on junior officers, allowing higher-ranking commanders to go unpunished. Late last month, Mr. Shanahan told Congress that he had ordered a new review of punishments linked to the episode so that he could “ensure, from top to bottom, the appropriate accountability.” Word of Mr. Shanahan’s new examination startled the dead soldiers’ relatives, who had not been told of another delay. Asked why the Pentagon had not notified the families of the review before Mr. Shanahan’s testimony, a Defense Department spokesman, Charles Summers, replied, “I don’t know,” and did not provide additional explanation. The Blacks and the Wrights have long harbored fears over an absence of accountability, especially among senior officers who oversaw operations in West Africa. In January 2018, roughly three months after the ambush, Maj. Gen. Roger L. Cloutier Jr., who was leading the investigation and was then Africa Command’s chief of staff, briefed the Black family about the circumstances of the attack. But General Cloutier, now the commanding general for United States Army Africa, left out that Team 3212’s leader, Capt. Mike Perozeni, had pushed back on the change in orders that ultimately led to the ambush. It was not until later, after an article in The New York Times, that the families had learned that Captain Perozeni had warned commanders that the team was ill equipped and was not provided with official intelligence for the operation. In an interview in Santa Claus, the south Georgia city where Sergeant Wright spent part of his childhood, Mr. Wright said he regretted that he had “unjustly” blamed Captain Perozeni for his son’s death. He lashed out later, though, at what he saw as deceit by military officials. “The reason it took so damn long was they had to try to fabricate something to try and appease us,” Mr. Wright said as he drove his son’s pickup truck, with Mr. Black in the back seat, to watch a state crew install a sign on Highway 1 in honor of Sergeant Wright. “Nobody could do anything to ease up our pain, but there was no need in growing our anger.” He added, “The only thing I ever said was, ‘Just tell me the damn truth’ — I knew it was a screwed-up mess or they wouldn’t be dead — and that was too hard for them.” Mr. Black, who has publicly defended Captain Perozeni, called the ceaseless string of inquiries “a festering wound” for the families. “We go through the initial grief and agony of all the loss, and then we’re waiting for answers,” Mr. Black said. “Since then, it’s just gone on, between who’s getting punished and who’s not getting punished, and they still haven’t put out what really happened.” Like the Wrights, the Blacks said that a transparent inquiry was crucial to preventing future tragedies. “I think for the families it was less about finding a responsible party and more about truth and the actions being taken to fix it,” said Ms. Black, Sergeant Black’s widow. “And that’s not at all what we got.” “And it’s a shame,” she added. Relatives who have not been as closely linked to the military’s inquiry said their anguish remains raw. “I’m 74 — I’m not going to get over this,” Elaine Trull, one of Sergeant Wright’s grandmothers, said after scores of people paid tribute to him at a garland-and-ribbon-decorated building at the corner of Candy Cane and Noel Streets in Santa Claus. “I cry every day.” Mr. Wright, whose family can trace its military lineage to the War of 1812, said he has good days and bad days as he grapples with his son’s death. There are frustrating ones, too, he said, so much so that he no longer thinks he can suggest an Army career to anyone. “That’s a result of me understanding that the current integrity level is not where it needs to be,” he said, his tone at once a mixture of firmness, flatness and sadness. But there is always pride in Sergeant Wright, his “baby” who became a Green Beret and who, some military officials believe, should be considered for the Medal of Honor. On Tuesday, after he watched several state workers prepare and lift the brown-and-white sign bearing Sergeant Wright’s name, Mr. Wright snapped a picture on his cellphone. Then he hurried to his son’s truck. He wanted to be the first person to drive past the sign. An earlier version of this article included comments from Hank Black, Staff Sgt. Bryan C. Black’s father, in which he misstated whom he had spoken to. While Mr. Black spoke with Sgt. La David Johnson’s wife, he did not speak with Staff Sgt. Jeremiah W. Johnson’s father.",The New York Times
2019,"‘I Decided to Keep Mum, and He Kept Sneaking Glances My Way’","METROPOLITAN DIARY A familiar face riding uptown, a private tour at the Museum of Natural History and more reader tales of New York City in this week’s Metropolitan Diary. Dear Diary: I was riding uptown on the Lexington Avenue line to Grand Central to catch the evening train home. At Fulton Street, a man got on and sat down next to me. I recognized his face immediately. We were both reading The Post and he kept glancing at me sideways. He clearly recognized me too, but he couldn’t figure out how or why. I decided to keep mum, and he kept sneaking glances my way. He got off at 33rd Street. As the doors were closing, I said loud enough for him to hear, “Notre Dame. Phys Ed. Freshman year!"" As the train headed north, he pointed a finger toward me. He had a huge grin on his face. — Tim Cormany Dear Diary: In the early 1960s, I had a summer job at Newsweek replacing a very competent secretary whose desk included an electric typewriter. I was a college student at the time, and my typing expertise was limited to a portable Smith Corona. I had to type copies of everything, and many of my attempts at correspondence ended up in the garbage. The typewriter was too fast, and I was too slow. My father said I would lose my job if each day ended with originals, copies and carbon paper filling up the trash can. So every Monday morning, I rode the Madison Avenue bus to work with my Smith Corona in hand, and every Friday I brought it back home. The correspondence was still imperfect but it was better, and I kept the job for a second summer. — Fran Hochman Dear Diary: On a recent trip from Florida to New York, my hometown, I spent an afternoon at the Museum of Natural History. I hadn’t been there in decades and I wanted to see the Northwest Coast Hall. I asked a tour guide standing near the hall to direct me. “Oh, I’m sorry,” she said. “That hall is closed for restoration.” When I mentioned that I hadn’t been to the museum in some time, she asked if I would like a get-reacquainted tour. It was just the two of us, and her broad range of knowledge and engaging personality impressed me. We visited the climate change exhibit, the Great Canoe, the blue whale, the fossil hall and Tyrannosaurus rex, and she provided personal anecdotes along with background information on each exhibit. That evening I attended Falstaff at the Met. As I settled into my seat before the performance began, I exchanged pleasantries with two women sitting to my right. “What have you been doing while you are here?” one of them asked. “I had a wonderful time at the Museum of Natural History earlier today,” I said. “Oh, really,” the woman exclaimed. “My friend and I are docents there.” “I had a wonderful guide there who gave me a personal tour,” I said. “She was terrific.” “Oh really? Who was it?” When I mentioned the name, both woman scoffed. “Oh, we don’t like her,” one said. “She just crams too much knowledge down your throat.” — Joseph P. Tully Dear Diary: I was a half-hour early for the Broadway show “Brooklyn Boy” starring Adam Arkin, so I went to the corner Starbucks. There was a poster advertising a free cookie with the purchase of a coffee. But when I got mine, the barista said my order didn’t qualify for the offer. I walked back to examine the poster. I was taken aback to see Adam Arkin was next in line. “Shouldn’t you be at the theater?” I blurted out. “Not unless they pay me overtime,” he said. “And I think they should give you the cookie.” — Jill Morrow Dear Diary: It’s 2:30 a.m. at Jimmy's Corner bar near Times Square. Despite the hour, the crowd is lively. The only quiet one in the place is Jimmy. A former prizefighter, he is drinking warm tea by the door, seeing all, saying little. Into this shrine to boxing walks a lone giant of a man, a mastiff among pugs. His head is bigger than any other two heads in the joint combined, and they all turn toward him for a moment. Jimmy raises an eyebrow. A stool is offered, and the big man sits down. He hunches over on his elbows, making him more or less everyone else’s height. Conversations, singing and laughter resume. The big fellow keeps to himself. He responds politely when spoken to, but does not engage in conversation. After a single beer, his head begins to nod. He pays, rises and leaves. The door closes behind him, and the room goes quiet again. A slight, bearded man in a trucker hat and flannel shirt who has been treading lightly for the past half-hour, whistles low. “That was one. big. guy,” he says. Jimmy winks. “You could’ve taken him,” he says. — Steve Gorka Read all recent entries and our submissions guidelines. Reach us via email diary@nytimes.com or follow @NYTMetro on Twitter.

2019,‘I Do Not Remember’: Trump Gave a Familiar Reply to the Special Counsel’s Queries,"White House Memo WASHINGTON — President Trump has boasted at various points that he has “one of the great memories of all time” or even “the world’s greatest memory.” But the world’s greatest memory failed him repeatedly when prosecutors asked him those classic questions from decades of presidential scandals — what did he know and when did he know it? Mr. Trump refused for more than a year to be interviewed by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and in the end agreed to respond to questions only in writing. Even then, with the help of his lawyers, the president found it difficult to summon details from his presidential campaign in 2016 that might shed light on what happened. More than 30 times, he told the prosecutors that he had no memory of what they were asking about, employing several formulations to make the same point. “I do not remember.” “I do not recall.” “I have no recollection.” “I have no independent recollection.” “I have no current recollection.” He did not remember learning about a Trump Tower meeting held in June 2016 by his son, son-in-law and campaign chairman with visiting Russians promising “dirt” on Hillary Clinton from the Russian government. He did not remember being told in advance of Russian hacking of Democratic emails before the stolen messages were posted online. He did not remember any particular conversations with Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser, during the last months of the campaign, much less discussions with him about WikiLeaks. He did not remember discussing a possible trip to Russia to promote a proposed tower project in Moscow. He did not remember an invitation from Russia’s deputy prime minister to attend an economic forum in St. Petersburg. A fuzzy memory is not exactly unusual for any president given how much they typically juggle, much less a 72-year-old president who is the oldest ever elected for the first time. But Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors considered his memory lapses unsatisfying and pressed Mr. Trump’s lawyer again for an in-person interview, to no avail. “The written responses, we informed counsel, ‘demonstrate the inadequacy of the written format, as we have had no opportunity to ask follow-up questions that would ensure complete answers and potentially refresh your client’s recollection or clarify the extent or nature of his lack of recollection,’” Mr. Mueller’s report said. Jay Sekulow, one of Mr. Trump’s private lawyers, defended his client’s answers on Friday. “The president responded to the questions,” he said. “They are answers, not speculations.” Lawyers often advise clients to avoid definitive answers if they are not sure about a question and to couch denials by saying they cannot recall an event lest contrary evidence emerge. A veteran of litigation, Mr. Trump rarely lacks for certainty in his public statements on camera, but has shown more caution when under oath. He said, “I don’t remember” 24 times during a 2012 deposition in a lawsuit involving his now-defunct Trump University and 35 times during another deposition related to the university suit three years later, not counting 10 more times in the two interviews that he said, “I don’t recall” or “Can’t remember.” (He eventually settled the legal claims for $25 million.) Prosecutors said such selective memory tended to make them suspicious. “It’s always a red flag when a witness appears to selectively forget the events most likely to be damning,” said Dwight C. Holton, who spent 14 years as a prosecutor, most recently as United States attorney in Oregon. “And when you have a witness who repeatedly and publicly thumps his chest about how great his memory is, then all of a sudden he has sudden massive memory loss — well, let’s just say that’s a target I’d like to cross-examine in front of a jury.” Barbara L. McQuade, a former United States attorney in Michigan, said the president’s answers “demonstrate why written answers are a poor substitute for an in-person interview.” During a face-to-face encounter, she said, prosecutors can refresh a witness’s memory by providing additional details or showing him documents. They can also come to a judgment based on body language. “I have not dealt with a witness who has claimed not to remember facts as many times as Trump did, but it is impossible to read a witness’s mind to know whether he is telling the truth,” she said. “Trump’s refusal to participate in an interview,” she added, “hampered Mueller’s investigation and contradicts” the assertion by Attorney General William P. Barr that the president had cooperated fully. But it may have saved him from a worse outcome. Mr. Mueller began asking Mr. Trump for an interview in December 2017 only to be put off for months. The president’s lawyers opposed the idea, worried that Mr. Trump, who has a documented history of making untrue assertions publicly, would testify falsely and walk into what they deemed a perjury trap. Bowing to the demands of the president’s lawyers, Mr. Mueller agreed to submit written questions, and only about contacts with Russia before Mr. Trump took office, not about potential obstruction of justice once he entered the White House. When the answers came back in November, they were so “incomplete or imprecise,” the report said, that Mr. Mueller complained to the president’s legal team about “the insufficiency of those responses.” The answers Mr. Trump provided sounded more like lawyer speak than the blunt-talking president’s usual colorful language. They included phrases like “named entities or individuals” and “tangible support” and “no meaningful relationship.” It may be hard to imagine Mr. Trump saying or writing this: “In the course of preparing to respond to your questions, I have become aware that the campaign documents already produced to you reflect the drafting, evolution and sources of information for the speech I expected to give ‘probably’ on the Monday following my June 7, 2016, comments.” But if his memory were hazy in many cases, it was crystal clear in at least one instance. Asked about a specific date that June, Mr. Trump noted that he had prevailed in Republican nomination contests in California, New Jersey, New Mexico, Montana and South Dakota that day. “I remember winning those primaries,” he wrote. After Mr. Mueller pressed again for an in-person interview in December, Mr. Trump’s lawyers refused again. The special counsel opted not to seek a subpoena to force the president to talk, unlike Ken Starr, the independent counsel who in 1998 subpoenaed President Bill Clinton and withdrew the order only after the president’s legal team agreed to live testimony. Mr. Mueller said he had chosen not to press the issue because he had already “made significant progress” and a court fight to enforce a subpoena against a sitting president, even if successful, could prolong the investigation. “We thus weighed the costs of potentially lengthy constitutional litigation, with resulting delay in finishing our investigation,” the report said, “against the anticipated benefits for our investigation and report.” Critics of Mr. Trump have questioned that decision, saying the special counsel should have held out for a formal interview. As it happened, by sticking to carefully scripted written answers, the president avoided any charge that he had misled investigators. That is an outcome neither he nor Mr. Mueller is likely to forget.",The New York Times
2019,"‘I Don’t Want to Die’: Asylum Seekers, Once in Limbo, Face Deportation Under Trump","[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] Indra Sihotang was desperate to stay in New York. Minutes from being deported to Indonesia, the 52-year-old father clung to a chair bolted to the floor at Kennedy International Airport, struggling against four immigration officers trying to tear him away. By the end of the confrontation, his face was bloody and bruised. But neither Mr. Sihotang, nor another immigrant in the officers’ custody who watched the incident unfold, was allowed onto the plane after the pilot raised security concerns. “I kept trying to explain to them that the conditions in my country are very bad now,” Mr. Sihotang said. “I was telling them, ‘I don’t want to die there.’” Mr. Sihotang had lost his fight to receive asylum in the United States a decade ago, a decision he did not appeal after he and thousands like him were granted a temporary reprieve from deportation by the Obama administration. Days after assuming office, President Trump revoked that protection, making Mr. Sihotang and thousands of other asylum seekers suddenly eligible for deportation, though many did not realize it. Even as Mr. Trump has sought in recent days to limit who can apply for asylum, and to expand indefinite detention for asylum seekers, his administration has with little public notice been carrying out a crackdown on people who asked for asylum, did not receive it and remained in the United States. The policy, which often involves seeking out immigrants who have been in the country for years in a legal gray area, shows how the Trump administration aims to reverse what it believes are the misguided policies of the Obama administration. Immigration agents have been especially active in New York City. Deportations of immigrants with no criminal convictions, including asylum seekers with years- or decades-old deportation orders, rose to 1,144 in the 2018 federal fiscal year from 313 in 2016, a 266 percent increase, according to a recent report from the city comptroller. That is the largest percentage increase of any Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in the country. The Trump administration said ICE agents are following the law in trying to return asylum seekers who have lost their cases on the merits and have no right to remain in the country. But as these people are caught in a deportation dragnet, they risk being sent to countries where the persecution threats they face are even greater than when they fled to the United States, asylum seekers and lawyers say. In the final years of the Obama administration, immigration judges were instructed to use prosecutorial discretion to grant some undocumented immigrants, such as asylum seekers who had lost their cases, the ability to stay and work in the United States legally as long as they regularly checked in with ICE. These enforcement policies were designed to focus ICE’s limited resources on deporting unauthorized immigrants who had criminal convictions, recently crossed the border or posed a threat to national security. Until Mr. Trump came into office, asylum seekers like Mr. Sihotang “had no reason to try to reopen their asylum case because they were permitted to stay and work in this country,” Amber Gracia, an immigration lawyer in Texas, said. “When the government suddenly seeks removal, these people are caught off guard.” She questioned why agents were focusing on deporting undocumented immigrants who had not broken the law, rather than focusing on violent criminals in the country illegally. ICE officials said that as long as there was a standing deportation order for an individual, there would be legal grounds to take that person into custody. “The U.S. government provides all those in removal proceedings with an opportunity to apply and be considered for relief from removal,” an ICE spokeswoman, Rachael Yong Yow, said in a statement. “If an immigration judge finds an individual ineligible for any form of relief, the judge will issue a final order of removal, which ICE carries out in accordance with applicable U.S. law.” She said she could not comment on specific cases. After losing his original asylum case five years ago, Mr. Sihotang lived and worked legally in New York City and watched as the persecution of Christians like him intensified in Indonesia. When he arrived for his biannual check-in with ICE — a condition of his reprieve — in summer 2017, he said he had thought that it would proceed like every other: He would update his home address, provide his work address and confirm that he had not been arrested or convicted of a crime. But this time, the ICE officer asked him to renew his passport and return to the ICE office. When he returned with the new passport, ICE took him into custody. Only when ICE drove him to Kennedy Airport four weeks later did Mr. Sihotang realized why the ICE officer had requested that he renew his passport: The plan was to put him on a commercial flight to Indonesia. “I was shocked,” Mr. Sihotang said. “I was thinking about my kids. I told them, ‘I’ve got four kids and my family. How will they survive without me?’” Months after the confrontation at the boarding gate last year, ICE again tried to deport Mr. Sihotang. But this time, as he sat in a van minutes away from the airport, an ICE officer received a call telling him to stop the deportation. A judge had determined Mr. Sihotang faced credible fears of persecution in Indonesia and reopened his asylum case, which remains unresolved. The asylum seeker who watched Mr. Sihotang’s first airport confrontation requested that he be identified only by his nickname, Neo, and that his home country not be named for fear of persecution. He was deported from New York weeks after that encounter, despite last-minute attempts to reopen his asylum case. “I didn’t do anything criminal,” Neo said, breaking into tears. “I didn’t do anything wrong, then suddenly they just sent me back.” One aspect of Neo’s asylum case, he and his lawyer said, was a medical condition he had developed for which he needed daily medication unavailable in his home country. When he boarded his deportation flight to East Asia, he said he had three weeks’ worth of the medication left. So, he said, he started to ration it: Take one pill. Skip a day. Take another. “I was worried I was going to die,” he said. His only hope was his lawyer in the United States, who had filed an appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals, the highest immigration court in the country. The board determines whether an asylum seeker’s claim has new merits and can issue an order preventing ICE from deporting an immigrant while that decision is made. Since Mr. Trump came into office, more immigrants are making requests to the board to temporarily prevent a deportation. But the denial rate for those requests has sharply increased, according to analysis by the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York. Steven Stafford, a spokesman for the Justice Department, said judges on the board “apply the law to the facts of the case before them.” When the board grants these requests, it is often only hours before an immigrant is scheduled to board a deportation flight, lawyers say. Some asylum seekers have even had their cases reopened after they have been deported. Last spring, Neo was brought back to the United States by ICE after the board agreed to reopen his asylum case. Still, not everyone is as lucky. Immigration lawyers pointed to the circumstances of a Bangladeshi man who requested that he be identified only by his given name, Mahbub, because of an unresolved asylum case. He was granted permission to stay in the United States until the board reconsidered his case. He had sought asylum on the grounds that he was being persecuted over his political affiliation. But the panel’s decision, which arrived in his lawyer’s inbox at 9 a.m., came four hours too late: At 5 a.m., he had been put on a flight to Bangladesh. When he arrived in the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, he said he called his mother who, distraught, told him that he could not come to their home. One of his friends in the opposition party, in which Mahbub was an activist, had been arrested in the months before his return. Fearing he faced the same fate, Mahbub, 36, said that he went into hiding. Months later, he paid a smuggler to help make his way to France, where he sought asylum. “I’m just happy I stayed alive,” Mahbub said.",The New York Times
2019,‘I Really Just Wanted the Comfort of My Husband’s Being There’,"METROPOLITAN DIARY Asking for flowers before having surgery, help hailing a cab on East Houston Street and more reader tales of New York City in this week’s Metropolitan Diary. Dear Diary: I was scheduled to have hip surgery. When the day came, off I went to NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. My husband phoned to say he would be there the minute I came out of surgery. “What shall I bring” he asked? “Please bring me blue hyacinths,” I said. I thought of the flowers the whole time I was being wheeled into the operating theater and while I was disappearing into the anesthetic. Later, I was in the recovery room. I heard what seemed like entire Beethoven symphonies in my head. I heard the nurses talking, but I wasn’t able to join the conversation. In my mind, I saw the blue hyacinths. When I regained full consciousness, I found that I really just wanted the comfort of my husband being there. After a while, he was at my bedside. I felt reassured and calm. He had brought daffodils. It didn’t matter. — Janet Nelson Dear Diary: This morning a child on the wayto school observed Manhattan’s buildingsas treats in a candy store.The Chrysler Building was peppermint.Would it fit in her pocket?St. Patrick’s Cathedral all orange.The sunlight on the New York Public Libraryshone bright, the windows looked like wild strawberry.Grand Central Terminal cinnamon. People were coming in and outof the Empire State Building —it smelled like a caramel square.Lincoln Center for the Performing Artswas a box of chocolate-covered cherries.The Metropolitan Museum of Artwas row upon row of bonbons.The Flatiron Building was sweet lemon.Cooper Union watermelon,One World Trade Center apricot,Yankee Stadium was full of root beer. The Brooklyn Bridge was a lollipop.Fifth Avenue was a pack of gum.Everyone loved Wall Street,before anyone sold their sharesit was all licorice sticks.The Plaza all gummy bears. — Ernest Slyman Dear Diary: I am an inveterate jogger. Once, when I was out for a run on a Wednesday night in 1979, I had a memorable meeting with a motorist in distress at the northbound 96th Street exit off the F.D.R. Drive. I had run up that way from my apartment in Stuyvesant Town on East 20th Street. I was about to turn around at 96th street and head back south when I saw a driver stopped at the side of the road in a way that suggested car trouble. It was my sister. She worked on the West Side then and commuted from Westchester County. Adding to the magic of the coincidence was that even though I have never been mechanically inclined, I was able to make a temporary repair that got her back on the road. The problem was a disconnected exhaust pipe. I asked my sister to give me her stockings. Then I shimmied under the car and used them to tie the pipe to the chassis. In about five minutes, we were on our way: she to Westchester, and me back to 20th Street. — John McMahon Dear Diary: Almost always, the first stop my wife and I make when we visit Manhattan from our home in Nebraska is Katz’s Deli on Houston Street. On our last trip, during summertime, East Houston Street was all torn up. Traffic was a mess. After having our usual wonderful lunch at Katz’s, I was trying to hail a cab, but the construction work was keeping them all away from the curb. As I stood on the corner waving my arms like a rube, one of the construction workers looked in my direction and started to laugh. My immediate reaction was anger. I thought he was enjoying my predicament. Then he turned, stepped into the slow-moving traffic and motioned the cars along until a cab appeared. Standing in front of it, he pointed toward me. It was clear he wasn’t going to let the cab continue on until my wife and I were in it. As we hustled into the back of the cab, I waved in his direction. I don’t think he saw me. He was already returning to his previous spot. — Charles Braithwaite Dear Diary: I was reading a biography of John Quincy Adams in the lounge at the Center for Fiction in Brooklyn while my wife was upstairs at her book club. It was peaceful, silent. I noticed a young man at a table a few feet away from me. He was drawing in a sketchbook. I began to sketch him sketching. By and by, he noticed the familiar look of a sketcher, and he began to sketch me sketching him sketching. For a few excellent minutes, we sketched each other. I noticed a young woman watching us. She seemed delighted. The silence was maintained. Eventually the young man and I showed each other our sketches and the young woman joined in. He was obviously very skilled, and it turned out that he was a professional illustrator. He then sketched the young woman, and she asked him to autograph the drawing. — Ira Jacobson Read all recent entries and our submissions guidelines.

2019,"‘I Trapped the Devil’ Review: Anxiety, Panic and Maybe Satan on a Holiday Visit","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. A couple find themselves caught in a Christmas nightmare in “I Trapped the Devil,” the promising horror debut by Josh Lobo. When Matt (AJ Bowen) and his wife, Karen (Susan Burke), visit his long-estranged brother Steve (Scott Poythress) for the holidays, they are unnerved by his reclusiveness and boarded-up windows. Their anxiety tips to panic when they hear the voice of a man begging to be released from behind a locked door in the basement. Steve claims the man is the devil himself, leaving his family caught between two possible monsters: either a demon downstairs or a madman upstairs. This is a stylish film, a single-set thriller that uses color, framing and sound to draw out the dread of captivity. The basement glows with diabolical scarlets, and Steve’s hostage speaks with a surprisingly soft voice that reverberates as if his vocal cords were made of metal. These flashes of hyperstylization enthrall, but Lobo does not extend this flair to his characters. They face down the gates of hell in ratty button-downs and jeans, their faces slipping away even when they aren’t shrouded in cellar shadows. Many horror films are built around the conceit of naïve, ordinary people caught in unimaginable circumstances. But great horror movies — including those that Lobo’s film recalls, like Bob Clark’s 1974 classic “Black Christmas” — find ways to make characters a part of the visual experience, using costume design, casting and more to raise simple archetypes to mythic proportions. By seesawing between bland normalcy and hellishness, Lobo denies his audience the immersive horror that his film’s best images promise.

2019,"‘I Want What My Male Colleague Has, and That Will Cost a Few Million Dollars’","Women at the Salk Institute say they faced a culture of marginalization and hostility. The numbers from other elite scientific institutions suggest they’re not alone. Beverly Emerson, Ph.D., who worked at the Salk Institute from 1986 to 2017.CreditCreditHolly Andres for The New York Times Northern San Diego County is a scientific mecca, home to some of the world’s leading biotech companies, renowned research institutions and a world-class university. But the Salk Institute for Biological Research, perched on a cliff above the Pacific Ocean in La Jolla, is distinguished even among its neighbors. Jonas Salk founded the institution in 1963 as a kind of second legacy, after the millions of lives saved with his polio vaccine. He envisioned it as a place where scientists would work in open, collaborative laboratories, free from university bureaucracies: They would be professors, supervising graduate students and postdocs, but with no teaching requirements. He recruited 10 of the top men in biology to join him, including Francis Crick, newly famous for discovering, with James Watson, DNA’s double helix. In a 1960 letter, Watson called the idea “Jonas’s utopia.” By 2017, the biochemist Beverly Emerson had worked in this utopia for 31 years. She was, at the time, onto an exciting idea — a novel approach to understanding tumor growth — but her 66th birthday was coming up, and with it her contract with Salk would expire. To renew it, the Institute required that she have enough grant money to cover half her salary. She didn’t. Emerson had pinned her hopes on a new funding initiative she was developing with the Salk’s president, Elizabeth Blackburn. So when she went to meet with Blackburn that fall, she thought it might be about their progress. Instead, she found Blackburn flanked by the Salk’s chief finance and science officers. “You and I have had long careers,” Emerson remembers Blackburn saying. She knew it was over. Emerson broke the news to her lab employees and turned to the work of shutting down experiments. On her final day, she took one last look around; she had spent 40 years going to a lab almost every day, and couldn’t imagine a life without one. The Salk made no announcement of her departure. It was Kathy Jones, another professor, who sent around an email letting colleagues know Emerson was leaving, and thanking her for her years of service. Emerson suspected funding wasn’t the only reason her tenure at the Salk ended so unceremoniously. Two months before that final meeting, she and Jones and Vicki Lundblad — three of the four women among the Institute’s 32 full professors — filed state gender-discrimination lawsuits against the Salk, claiming that an “old boys’ club” of senior faculty restricted their access to funds, laboratory resources and influence. Select male faculty, they said, effectively ran the Institute and were showered with private donations, while women were forced to fire essential staff and were shut out from power. At the time, women made up just 16 percent of the Salk’s senior faculty and 32 percent of assistant professors — a striking statistic, given that the biological sciences are one of the only scientific fields in which women earn more than half the doctoral degrees. This state of affairs wasn’t unique to the Salk: Women make up a similar share of senior faculty at similar research institutions, and just 28 percent of tenured biology professors at elite public universities. Jones started at the Institute on July 1, 1986, when she was 31. She was one of two new hires for the Salk’s regulatory biology department. The other was Emerson, who was still en route, driving cross-country with her mother, writing grant applications by the light of motel signs. On her first day, as Jones made her way through the Salk’s campus to meet with the president, she was dazzled by its grandeur. Two teak-accented buildings enclosed a marble courtyard, amid orange trees, terraced pools and a grand ocean view. But as she waited outside the president’s office, she says she had an encounter she would later think of often. A woman who introduced herself as Carolyn Stinson, the Institute’s director of program analysis, shook Jones’s hand and then blurted out a warning: “You need to understand that at the Salk Institute, women do not get the same pay as men,” Jones remembers her saying, “and they do not get anywhere near the same resources.” “I didn’t know her from anybody,” Jones recalls. “She just walked up and said that.” (Stinson could not be reached for comment.) But Jones didn’t give the warning much weight; her first thought, she told me, was, Well, it’s not going to be like this in 10 years. Her hiring itself felt like proof that the world had changed; any inequities would fade away as out-of-touch older scientists retired or died off. It had been two years since Suzanne Bourgeois, the wife of one of the Institute’s founders, started the regulatory biology department, which was located in the basement of one of the two Salk buildings. The only other professor in it was Pamela Mellon. Emerson and Jones didn’t take much notice that their all-woman department was cloistered in the basement, or that senior female faculty had relatively small labs. But Mellon, who was slightly older and further along in her career, noticed, and was concerned. The senior women, she recalls, “were secondary. They weren’t consulted. They weren’t invited into joint grants. They weren’t in the leadership.” She left the Salk for U.C. San Diego in 1991. “I could see even then that I was not going to be in the leadership,” she says. “That was not going to happen because of my gender.” [Read about public attacks on the work of social psychologist Amy Cuddy.] Jones and Emerson pitied the older women. But they imagined their own exceptional scientific work, and the changing culture around them, would ensure their bright futures. Early on, Jones worked to decipher how H.I.V. uses a specific protein to duplicate itself. By 1997, she felt sure she was on the verge of figuring it out. “I remember driving down the freeway, and thinking to myself, Don’t get in an accident, because then no one will know the answer to this!” she recalls. When she gave birth to her second child, she took her work with her to the hospital. The resulting paper, published in Cell in 1998, put her name on the map. By then, Bourgeois had retired, leaving Emerson and Jones alone in a department of two. They wanted to search for new hires; the administration, they say, suggested they instead shut down their department and join a different group. Inder Verma, a lauded cancer biologist, told them he’d decided to allow them to be part of his group, housed in the lab next door — a merger that would give him authority over their space. He’d asked if any other department would take them, they remember him saying, but “nobody wants you.” (Verma declined to be interviewed, but said he had no recollection of this conversation.) “Not the most attractive invitation,” Jones recalls. They said no. After that decision, the women say, the Salk reconfigured the building. Verma’s department took over space on their floor. “We were used to hearing insults toward women,” Emerson says, “but this really showed their power — and that we had no power.” It was a conflict over 200 square feet of laboratory space that once led some of the country’s leading universities to focus on the progress — or lack thereof — of women in science. On paper, Nancy Hopkins had a charmed career. As an undergraduate at Radcliffe College, she was handpicked by James Watson, of Watson and Crick, for mentorship. In 1973, she was hired as an assistant professor at M.I.T.’s Center for Cancer Research, and was quickly promoted to receive tenure. But in the early ’90s, when she began a new set of genetics experiments using zebra fish and requested an extra 200 square feet for aquariums, the faculty member in charge of facilities refused. Hopkins, then in her early 50s, had a feeling her lab was already smaller than those of her male peers. For a year, she fought for more space — a battle that culminated with her measuring the entire department. “I literally got a tape measure and measured every lab in the building,” she told me. She found that her space was 500 square feet smaller than the average male junior professor’s, and from 1,500 to 4,500 square feet smaller than her male fellow full professors’. The person in charge refused to look at her data. “Here I was measuring the goddamn laboratories,” she says, “and I brought him the measurements, and he wouldn’t even look at them.” She began to notice that other women seemed just as invisible as she felt, while men whose science didn’t seem any better were lauded as geniuses. But it was years before she named this problem in her mind; she thought of discrimination as something that ended when women were allowed to hold jobs like hers. “It’s hard to believe anyone could be that naïve, but I was,” she says. At the start of her career, her science seemed to speak for itself, and her talents were encouraged by great men in her field. Now that she considered herself their equal, she was confronted with all the ways they seemed to disagree. The question of whether women could, or should, be a part of the scientific profession was as old as the profession itself. According to Londa Schiebinger, a historian at Stanford, it was during the Enlightenment era in Europe, as science was transformed into a profession and universities and academies formed, that a fork in the road was reached, and women were formally excluded from Western science. Earlier, they’d been among its practitioners, but by 1911, Marie Curie was denied entry to the French national academy despite having shared a Nobel Prize. (The same year, she became the first person ever to win a second.) After a long debate, the academy concluded that it should “respect the immutable tradition against the election of women,” so as not to “break the unity of this elite body.” [Read about the secret history of women in coding.] Later in the 20th century, as Hopkins and other women were allowed into the “elite body” of academia for the first time, they found that cultural and structural barriers remained. Frustrated, Hopkins drafted a letter to Charles Vest, the president of M.I.T., calling for action. It was eventually signed, and added to, by 16 of the 17 tenured female faculty members in the School of Science (there were 194 tenured men), and became the basis for a 1999 M.I.T. report, written by Hopkins and other science faculty, documenting how women in the sciences had access to fewer resources than their male counterparts. Almost none of the junior female faculty, the report found, believed “that gender bias will impede their careers.” It was after receiving tenure that “many senior women faculty begin to feel marginalized, including those who felt well supported as junior faculty. They sense that they and their male colleagues may not be treated equally after all.” Hopkins’s report catalyzed significant change at M.I.T. Vest convened meetings with eight other universities, all of which committed to support female faculty, using policies — collecting equity and inclusion data, providing support for faculty with children — recommended in the report. Hopkins submitted a two-page grant application to support her zebra-fish research, and was offered $10 million — two million more than she needed. “Once you raise money that easily, that fast, guess what? Your research gets easier!” she says. “I got elected to the National Academy. I became, like, a real person.” But a few men in her department, she says, never spoke to her again. In 2005, she attended an invitation-only conference in Cambridge, where Lawrence Summers, Harvard’s president at the time, wondered aloud whether the scarcity of female scientists at elite universities might be a function of “intrinsic aptitude.” Hopkins immediately closed her computer and left the room. “I think what’s so painful about it is that we’re scientists and we’re supposed to be interested in the truth,” she says. “If it’s true, O.K., it’s true. But then show me the data. And this is a topic on which you cannot show me the data.” For Summers to ask the question “was not science,” she says. “It was not interesting.” The women in the Salk’s regulatory biology group had not believed that Inder Verma’s patronage was their only option. But when they began, with the Institute’s permission, recruiting for their department — inviting prospective hires to give talks on their research — Jones says most of the senior male faculty would not attend, making it impossible to get approval for a final decision. “Are you tired of your seminar series yet?” Jones says Verma asked her, after yet another interviewee had come and gone without his input. (Verma says he does not recall this conversation.) If anyone typified the male “rock star” scientists said to have held sway over the Salk, it was Verma. As of 2015, he was the Institute’s highest-paid scientist — and one of its most famous, known for developing the technique of retroviral gene therapy for cancer treatment. His reputation was important for fund-raising. Among biologists, the Salk was sometimes known as “Inder’s Institute.” Some current and former Salk employees identified Wylie Vale, Ron Evans, Stephen Heinemann and Rusty Gage as the men who, along with Verma, seemed to enjoy extraordinary resources and status (though only Verma was mentioned in the lawsuits). These men, titans in their fields, spoke often at faculty retreats, and on milestone birthdays would reign over symposia in their honor. Parties would be advertised via posters photoshopped to depict them as larger-than-life personas: Gage’s head on a muscled body beneath the text: “The Ultimate Gage Fighter”; Vale as a mafia don with a cigar hanging from his lips. Each researcher at the Institute is responsible for funding his or her own work, and grants and donations seemed especially easy for these men to access. As Salk presidents came and went, it became clear to Jones and Emerson where the real power lay. When Richard Murphy was brought on as president in 2000, he established, partly at the urging of senior female faculty, a committee to explore the status of women at the Salk and produce a report similar to M.I.T.’s. It concluded that while salaries and promotion rates were roughly equitable, the representation of women on the faculty was as at many similar institutions well below what it should be, compared with the applicant pool, and that women were being promoted more slowly than their male peers. The committee recommended several policy changes, including actively recruiting more women, and in 2004, the Salk hired Vicki Lundblad, a well-known biologist who studied telomeres. Murphy left the Salk in 2007 and was succeeded by William Brody, a radiologist who had been president of Johns Hopkins. Soon after he was hired, Emerson attended a faculty retreat where, she says, Verma asked if the new president wanted to say anything to the assembled faculty. Brody began by noting that many friends had asked why he took the job, as the Salk had a reputation for short-tenured presidents. His plan, he said, was simple: “I’m going to let the faculty run the Institute.” “I knew what that meant, and my hopes were sunk,” Emerson recalls. “The faculty does not mean the whole faculty.” (Brody denies that this happened.) The Institute’s new recruit, Lundblad, soon found herself hemmed in too. Karl Willert, a U.C.S.D. biologist and old friend, remembers how excited Lundblad had been to be in California, working at Salk. But he watched that enthusiasm slowly erode. “She became really upset about how things were run over there,” he says. “Everyone knows that Salk could get awarded 10- or a hundred-million-dollar donations or grants. I think she oftentimes felt like she wasn’t included in that and was sort of on the sidelines.” In 2014, according to Lundblad’s complaint, Brody called her into his office and told her that a group of senior faculty had decided she was “in a downward spiral,” and that “the field has passed her by.” This felt shockingly out of step with what she was hearing from her peers. Reviewers of an N.I.H. grant proposal a year earlier had described her as a “key player” and “established leader” in her field. (Through a lawyer, Brody denied this account, saying that any discussions he had about productivity were “only in terms of facts and metrics, not judgment.”) A few months later, Lundblad applied to hire a lab worker who was fully funded by a fellowship; her request was denied. She eventually got the decision reversed — but later that year, it happened again. Jones and Emerson were also having trouble staffing their labs. Emerson was told she was underfunded and asked to fire three of her five workers. In 2015, after Jones and one of her postdocs had spent five years identifying what seemed like a potential cancer treatment, she was pushed to fire the postdoc. “It was like being in ‘Lord of the Flies,’ but with this incredible Dilbert overlay,” Lundblad says. In 2015, one of Jones’s former postdocs came to visit and was shocked by the state of the lab: “It looks like you’re almost extinct,” she remarked. In 2014, Emerson was elected faculty chairwoman, only the second woman ever to hold the position. From this position of ostensible power, she asked the external relations office to diversify its matchmaking between scientists and donors. In a meeting, when she solicited input from the faculty on fund-raising, Brody, she says, told her to stop — she was just “confusing” the development office. According to her complaint, he reviewed a plan she presented on including more women in leadership and responded that “boys run committees and boys choose boys.” (Through his lawyer, Brody denies these comments as well.) Emerson found herself thinking back on the older women whom she and Jones once pitied. “Thirty-one years later, we are the ones that we saw through those young eyes,” she says. “Nothing’s changed. Even after a successful career.” Elizabeth Blackburn, a Nobel Laureate in physiology/medicine for her discovery of telomerase, had for years spoken out about issues facing female scientists at all levels. So when it was announced in 2015 that Brody was retiring and Blackburn would be the next Salk president — Emerson had sat on the hiring committee that helped select her — the women were sure this promised relief. Lundblad had done her postdoc in Blackburn’s molecular biology lab at Berkeley, and Emerson and Jones had known her for years. “All of us thought, Liz is coming — thank God this is over,” says Jones. Blackburn, they say, said she would work with them to secure funding. She initiated a strategic planning effort meant to lay the groundwork for the Salk’s next 50 years. The faculty was split into committees; the mandate for Emerson and Lundblad’s group included assessing the state of faculty culture and diversity. Working with four colleagues, they found that the Institute had hired 3.75 men for every woman since 2010, and that there was a gender-specific skew in lab size: senior women had three of the five smallest spaces on campus, despite raising twice as much N.I.H. funding per employee as men. “When I saw that report, I just felt physically ill,” Jones says. Lundblad says, “It’s not that they haven’t hired women, but they have failed to retain them, they’ve failed to hire enough, failed to promote. Salk has not provided a work environment that allows women faculty to flourish.” Emerson, in her complaint, says she expected the full findings to be presented to the board. Blackburn, in a statement, says that while she considered presenting the reports to trustees, their volume and early-draft nature meant they were summarized and discussed in later meetings: “Somewhere along the line,” Emerson says, “she probably learned how the place is run and had to run it that way.” In the spring of 2017, Jones and Lundblad both spoke at the annual faculty retreat, a sumptuous affair in Borrego Springs where faculty members present new research to their colleagues. It was only the second time in 14 years that Lundblad had presented anything, and Jones’s third time in 30. Afterward, Jones says, one of the junior faculty congratulated her, saying it was one of the best talks he’d heard at Salk. “It was very bittersweet,” Jones says. “I felt like, Oh, I missed this. I missed this excitement, this potential for collaboration with colleagues.” The two women drove home to San Diego together, wondering what to do next. When Lundblad got home, she looked at her husband and said, “I think —” He understood the look on her face and finished her sentence: “It’s time.” That summer, Jones and Lundblad both filed gender-discrimination lawsuits against the Salk. Emerson filed a week later. Salk responded swiftly to the first suits, with a statement in July 2017 that said Jones and Lundblad’s performances had “long remained within the bottom quartile of [their] peers,” that in the past 10 years they had “failed to publish a single paper in any of the most respected scientific publications (Cell, Nature and Science)” and that they had fallen short of the median 29 papers published per faculty member over the past decade. This statement prompted scientists across the country to rally to the women’s defense. To many, the use of Cell, Nature and Science as benchmarks of excellence was particularly galling. Some well-known scientists boycott those “prestige” journals to protest their perceived clubbiness and inflated status. Carol Greider, the telomere biologist who shared the Nobel Prize with Blackburn, defended Lundblad on Twitter, saying, “Contrary to Salk press release character smear, Vicki Lundblad is outstanding, creative LEADER in Telomere field.” Soon after, she drafted a letter titled “Not Just Salk,” signed by 37 prominent researchers, including two other Nobel Laureates, and published in the pages of Science. “The next generation of scientists is watching,” it said, “and many are choosing not to pursue a career in science, where they feel they will not have support.” Bias and discrimination can be hard to quantify, especially with a sample size of just three women, and the Salk mounted a case against the women’s claims. In a statement through an external communications firm, the Institute stressed that faculty are responsible for bringing in their own funding, and these women didn’t supply enough to support larger labs. It said that the plaintiffs’ salaries were on par with their peers, and that they were supplied with institutional funding to bridge gaps in resources. It also disputed the lab-size analysis, which was leaked to Science in 2017, describing it as an unfinalized draft “prepared in large part by the now-plaintiffs.” Former Salk employees generally agree the Institute is “clubby” and run by a few powerful men. But it’s a question, for some of the men, at least, whether gender is the most important criterion for entry. “To be perfectly honest, I didn’t see it affecting women more than men,” a former junior faculty member — a man who worked there for nine years — told me. (He requested anonymity to preserve working relationships at the Salk.) “It was just the way the Salk worked. There were a few people who had very good connections with the Salk office, and then other people were not put out in front of donors.” He, too, was forced to fire staff, he said, even though he knew one of his colleagues, who had the same amount of funding and many more employees, was not. “There was a general suspicion that a small number of people were benefiting a lot from certain donors or funding agencies,” another male former faculty member said. “I never felt discriminated against. I just felt like I wasn’t on the gravy train.” Emerson and the other women agree that the Salk hierarchy is inherently unfair, but say it’s not an accident that senior women are consistently found at the bottom. All the female former faculty members and research staff interviewed were in agreement on this. “It was especially unfair for women,” Mellon says. “There’s no question in my mind. We were made to feel on shaky ground to be there as scientists in the first place.” Holly Ingraham, now a professor of pharmacology at U.C. San Francisco, was a postdoc at the Salk when Emerson and Jones were hired. Years later, when she returned to visit, she was shocked to see their labs. “They were in the worst space that Salk had to offer,” she recalls. “So how did that decision get made?” When she heard news of the lawsuit, she wrote to Emerson that while “similar problems exist everywhere,” key figures at the Salk had “instilled a culture that consistently stacked the odds against women.” Blackburn stepped down from the Salk’s presidency in January 2018, five months after the suits were filed, and returned to her research at U.C.S.F. She is bound by a nondisparagement clause, but she did tell me that “the way we lose the talents of women because of all these things that go on in careers, it’s just extraordinary. It’s a very bad, bad thing to lose all that training and talent.” She added: “Often these situations which go on in a woman’s career — workplace situations — they don’t seem big. But I heard someone say a marvelous thing in this context: ‘A ton of feathers still weighs a ton.’ ” Doctoral programs have churned out female Ph.D.’s for decades — women have earned the majority of biosciences Ph.D.’s since 2009 — but they remain underrepresented on the faculties of top American universities. Hopkins, who continues to spend much of her time speaking about gender equity, says she’s stunned to see how few women wield real influence in science. “I think it’s hard for us even to recognize how little power women have at the top, where the big money resides, where the real power resides,” she says. Those who do make it into prestigious positions sometimes find that efforts at equity don’t include them. “I know a lot of men who sincerely promote gender-equality opportunities for women, but all their efforts are devoted toward younger women,” Emerson says — because it’s less costly. “But I want what my male colleague has, and that will cost a few million dollars.” Science is, in theory, a meritocracy, in which results should speak for themselves and buoy their authors to the top. The problem is that nobody knows the best way to measure the merits of a scientist’s work. Data-driven metrics have become increasingly popular: The “h-index,” for instance, was created in 2005 as a measure of an author’s overall number of publications and how often that work is cited. But citation practices vary widely even within disciplines, and citing yourself can artificially drive your number up. The h-index often becomes a measure of quantity, not quality. By some metrics, formal institutional decisions such as hiring at the junior levels, time to promotion and salaries are at or are approaching equity. Some reports have found grant and publication-review processes are largely gender neutral. But something is still holding women back, or driving them out. The number of women drops off at every increasing level of rank in academic science, but in biology, an especially large drop comes between earning Ph.D.’s and applying for tenure-track positions — a competitive bottleneck that frequently coincides with people starting families. Yet a growing body of research indicates that those women who do apply face barriers to inclusion. A famous 2012 experiment, in which equivalent résumés with male and female names were evaluated for lab manager jobs, found that the man was rated as more qualified and offered a higher salary. A 2017 Harvard Business Review analysis found that female postdocs were systematically undervalued for their work, taking a year longer to receive an N.I.H. grant than men with equivalent publication histories. And a 2018 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine found that up to 40 percent of female science students had been sexually harassed by faculty or staff. “We are going into a setting that we did not create, we did not define,” says Shirley Malcom, who directs education and human resources programs at the American Association for the Advancement of Science. “You can’t make the assumption that the same structures are going to be accommodating and supportive of different players.” Soon after her dismissal, in early 2018, sitting on her couch at home with the latest issues of Science and Nature on the coffee table, Beverly Emerson told me she was not done with science. She showed me the pipettes, painted with her initials, that she’d brought home from her lab. Later, a position at Oregon Health & Science University would let her continue to work on her projects. But she won’t be getting all the benefits of an elder stateswoman. Emeritus professors often stick around institutions for decades; some former researchers still drop into the Salk for lunch. Jones and Lundblad settled their suits in August 2018, about a year after filing. The details of the settlement are confidential, and both women are forbidden to make any further comments to the media. (All interviews for this story took place before the settlement.) But they both retained their employment at the Salk, and are expected to stay there for the foreseeable future. Emerson continued her suit alone for several more months, but in November 2018 she also settled. The Salk admitted no liability in connection with any of the settlements. Emerson hoped, she’d said, that the lawsuit would lead to better outcomes for the current generation of women. There are more now: Clodagh O’Shea was promoted to full professor in February 2018, the first woman to achieve that rank since Emerson in 1999. And the institute has hired others: Susan Kaech from Yale, and Kay Tye from M.I.T. Nearly everyone who has worked there — including the women who sued it — say the Salk Institute has lived up to its founders’ promise in many ways; the lack of bureaucracy facilitates real scientific breakthroughs. But the lawsuit’s claims suggest the lack of formal governance also made a push for equity impossible, and let a power structure formed in the ’60s survive to the present day. On April 21, 2018, Dan Lewis, the chairman of the Salk’s board, sent a notice to Salk employees announcing that Inder Verma had been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation of allegations of sexual assault. “Dr. Verma has made extraordinary contributions to scientific research,” he wrote, but “Salk will not condone any findings of inappropriate conduct in the workplace, regardless of one’s stature or influence.” The stories published soon after suggested otherwise. As reported by Meredith Wadman in Science that month, eight women, including Emerson and Mellon, accused Verma of sexual assault in a variety of professional situations: pinching the buttocks of a woman who had come to interview for a faculty position; forcibly kissing a young scientist in his lab in 1992; grabbing and kissing Emerson in the Salk library in 2001. The incidents spanned four decades, from 1976 to 2016. In the late 1980s, Mellon reported to the Salk’s human resources department that Verma had once grabbed her breasts at a faculty party, and didn’t let go until she kicked him in the shins. She was told she needed counseling, and, she told me, was asked not to share her claim with anyone later. In a statement, Verma wrote that he had “never inappropriately touched, nor have I made any sexually charged comments, to anyone affiliated with the Salk Institute,” and has since produced a statement of support signed by 56 former students and postdocs. In the same email announcing that the Salk would take these alleged claims seriously, Lewis announced that Rusty Gage, long one of the Institute’s stars, would be the next president. Verma resigned two months later. Anila Madiraju came to the Salk in 2015 as a postdoc, after completing her Ph.D. in cellular and molecular physiology at Yale. Since she was 13 — when she would tag along with her father, a cancer biologist, to his lab — her dream has been a career in academic science, and the Salk seemed like an institution that embodied scientific freedom and creativity. She says she has been treated well there, and her current adviser is one of many excellent male mentors she has had in her career so far. And yet at every stage in her career, the future has seemed less certain. “It’s hard already,” she says, “even before you throw gender into the mix.” She’s watched successful students fail to land tenure-track positions, or be hired as assistant professors only to struggle with funding. She’ll be applying for jobs in a year or two, but worries about a lack of opportunity, even considering alternate careers. When Science reported on the claims against Verma, she read the story three times. The younger generation at Salk, she says, seems committed to a fair playing field, and ready to work to create one. People are talking more about issues like discrimination and harassment. The Institute has created an Office of Equity and Inclusion, and Madiraju says she has noticed an effort to highlight the achievements of women staff and professors. “It makes you feel like, I do have a place here,” she says, “and that they are making it clear that the way science is being done — that the face of science — is changing.” Of course, in 1986, when Jones assured herself that things at the Salk would change with the departure of the old guard, Inder Verma was 39, only eight years older than she. While a 66-year-old Emerson was dismantling her life’s work, Verma gave three hourlong lectures on the occasion of his 70th birthday. Reading through the lawsuits and reports about the Salk was heartbreaking, Madiraju says. What shocked her most was the names of the women involved, names she had known for years. Her father knew Emerson and Lundblad’s work, and at his recommendation she had read their papers during her early years as a scientist. “You’re grasping wherever you can for role models,” she says, and these women’s work was considered groundbreaking. “What is the definition of a good scientist if people like Beverly Emerson and Lundblad are not good scientists in the eyes of Salk?” Mallory Pickett is a journalist in Los Angeles who writes about science, the environment and technology. She last wrote for the magazine about the visual-effects industry. An earlier version of a picture caption with this article identified incorrectly the institution where Beverly Emerson currently works. It is the Knight Cancer Institute at Oregon Health & Science University, not the Knight Cancer Research Institute at the University of Oregon Medical School.",The New York Times
2019,"Opinion | ‘If I Had Stayed in Venezuela, We Would Have Starved’","Venezuelans who fled to Colombia tell of harsh conditions, including the absence of food, electricity and hospitals with basic supplies. Opinion Columnist Venezuela is collapsing after years of catastrophic mismanagement, leaving millions hungry and sick. The repressive and incompetent government of President Nicolás Maduro urgently needs to be replaced — but ordinary Venezuelans tell the story much better than I can. Meet some of the Venezuelans I met along the Colombia-Venezuela border; their accounts are lightly edited for space. I’m sleeping in this park [in Riohacha, Colombia] with my son, Edi. He’s 3. He has a cleft palate, and there was just no way to get surgery for it in Venezuela. I’m hoping to get surgery for him here. I can’t work because I have to look after him, but I beg for food. At least I can get food here. I may be sleeping on the ground, but it’s better than over there in Venezuela. I used to support [former Venezuelan strongman Hugo] Chávez. But then under Maduro, everything became all screwed up. My baby was born five months ago in Maracaibo [a major city in Venezuela]. There was nothing in the hospital, not even a needle. It didn’t have electricity when I was there. My husband had to come to Colombia to buy everything for the birth — gloves, face mask, needles, sutures, anesthetic, diapers — and bring it to the hospital ahead of time. Then the baby caught pneumonia, and it just couldn’t be treated in Venezuela, so we came here to Colombia. Everybody in Maracaibo wants to leave. There are 14 of us living in this home. In one room, there are four on one bed, and five on the other. In the other room, four people sleep on the mattress, and one is in a hammock. The solution is to get the donkey out of there. Maduro, I mean. If he were to leave, I would run back to Venezuela right away. I don’t want to live here. My baby, Diogel, is 2 months old. He’s here because there was no birth control available. We tried. Even condoms were too expensive. Diogel was born in Maracaibo and then we came here [to Riohacha]. There’s nothing there. No food, no water, no electricity. If I had stayed in Venezuela, we would have starved. We sleep here in the park. [Working in a brothel] isn’t something that I thought that I would do. But here I have a roof over my head and they give me food. This is the best way for a girl from Venezuela to earn money to send to her family. I wire money back, and it’s the difference between my family eating or not eating. My mom knows what I do, and she helps hide it from the rest of the family. She doesn’t like it, and she’s afraid for my health and safety. Desperation is driving us to accept any job that we can find. Maduro is the biggest sinner of all. He has a lot more to confess to a priest than I do. We would go five or six days at a time without electricity, and that’s why we had to leave Venezuela. We buy food with debit cards [because inflation has rendered cash almost worthless], and when there’s no electricity the cards don’t work in the machines and you can’t buy anything. There were entire days I went without food. My 7-year-old, too. But thank God, my baby didn’t go hungry because I was still nursing. You know why I have this baby? For six years, I took birth control pills, and then they almost disappeared. So I could eat or I could buy my pills, but I couldn’t do both. And a condom costs as much as a kilo of rice. My dream is to get to the U.S. We’re dying to go to the U.S. I worked at the hospital morgue in Valencia, so I saw it all. There are more deaths now, especially of old people and of young kids. The refrigerated rooms weren’t working even before the blackouts, because of lack of maintenance. After a week, we couldn’t take the smell any more. We would have to get rid of them. Unclaimed bodies were buried in common graves. The hospital doesn’t have supplies, so it only does extremely urgent surgeries. Sometimes that doesn’t even include an appendectomy. The hospital does do emergency C-sections, but only if the patient provides a kit with all supplies — gloves, sutures, gowns and syringes. If the patient doesn’t supply the kit, she dies. Every day you see people dying unnecessarily. I left the hospital because I wasn’t getting paid enough to buy food. So I’m here. I sell medicines with my son, and between us we can send back about $60 per week for my family. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2019,‘If the Dancer Dances’ Review: An Inheritance in Motion,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. According to the new documentary “If the Dancer Dances,” even a medium like video — which is two-dimensional — could never capture dance movements as specific as Merce Cunningham’s. “History and preservation has to happen skin to skin, breath to breath, body to body,” the choreographer Stephen Petronio says toward the end of the film, a gratifyingly hands-on backstage chronicle of his company’s efforts to revive Cunningham’s “RainForest” in 2015. For Petronio, the endeavor demands doing right by a famous piece (with a set by Andy Warhol and costumes by Jasper Johns) and by Cunningham, an artist he considers a crucial influence. For the dancers, used to the kinetic motion of Petronio’s productions, it means learning a new and unintuitive way of moving, following precise directions from dancers who knew Cunningham, who died in 2009. Andrea Weber, the official stager from the Merce Cunningham Trust, is exacting in making sure everything looks just so. The film’s director, Maia Wechsler, is attuned enough to the details that even viewers without the faintest grasp of dance technique — picture my hand sheepishly raised — will gain a strong sense of what made Cunningham’s work groundbreaking. As Wechsler allows rehearsal scenes to play out at length, the perfectionism of dancer-to-dancer lessons becomes improbably poignant. The film shows that preserving choreography is difficult not only because muscle memories can’t be handed down like recipes, but because dancing in the present almost by definition means letting go of the past.

2019,"‘Infatuated’ With Columbine: Threats and Fear, 20 Years After a Massacre","DENVER — The 20th anniversary of the attack at Columbine High School was supposed to be marked with prayers and memorials. Instead, millions of parents, students and educators across Colorado awoke on Wednesday to news that an armed 18-year-old woman with an infatuation with the massacre had flown across the country to Colorado and that hundreds of schools had closed as a precaution as the authorities frantically searched for her. By day’s end, the woman, a Florida high school student identified as Sol Pais, was discovered dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound in the mountains west of Denver. [Here is what we know about Sol Pais.] Law enforcement officials said they had been worried by Ms. Pais’s determination: She bought a plane ticket, made the journey and bought a gun. John McDonald, the school safety executive director for Jefferson County Public Schools, which includes Columbine, called it a “pilgrimage.” To many parents, the school closings and the frenzied manhunt drove fears that Columbine still had the power to captivate would-be attackers and that the community would never be free from the massacre, which took place on April 20, 1999, and left 12 students and one teacher dead. “What does this mean for tomorrow and the next day?” asked Dana Gutwein, 34, who has a first grader and third grader in the Jefferson County Public Schools District, which includes Columbine. Ms. Gutwein was unsure whether she would immediately let her children go back to class when the hundreds of schools that had closed on Wednesday reopen. “I’ve felt like I’m on the verge of throwing up since this started,” she said. Across the Denver metro area, parents struggled to find the right words to explain the latest safety warnings to children who have grown up in an anxious era of lockdowns and active-shooter drills. At Columbine, students who were organizing a day of service to mark the 20-year anniversary saw their preparations eclipsed by emergency text messages from the school district, news alerts on their phones and dread. “This week our message was supposed to be about love and recommitment,” said Rachel Hill, 17, a senior at Columbine. “But now all the news surrounding Columbine is about fear.” Some parents said they told their children to play close to home on Wednesday. Others shook their heads at how a threat from one teenager could keep half a million students home from school and throw an entire city into panic. As the anniversary approaches, the threat and the fears have turned what was supposed to be a time of healing into a renewed source of trauma, said Urania Glassman, a clinical social worker and professor at Yeshiva University in New York. “You have somebody who wants to throw a grenade on that parade and so do harm again,” Dr. Glassman said. “It retraumatizes people who were present and survived, it retraumatizes the families and it retraumatizes the communities.” Even 20 years later, young people across America continue to be influenced by the symbology of the Columbine shooting and the students who carried it out, according to researchers and educators. Law enforcement officials said that Ms. Pais, a student at Miami Beach Senior High School, had been “infatuated” with the Columbine shooting and had made alarming social media posts and threatening statements to friends and family. On Monday, she flew from Miami to Denver and bought a pump-action shotgun and ammunition at a store in Littleton, not far from Columbine High School. Colorado tightened its background check laws in recent years, but it does not have a set waiting period before buying a gun. Ms. Pais’s parents in Surfside, Fla., reported her missing to local police on Monday. They provided investigators with information that helped them track her to Colorado, said Chief Julio Yero of the Surfside Police. Law enforcement officials issued warnings on Tuesday expressing concerns about Ms. Pais’s mental stability and saying that she was armed and “extremely dangerous.” They launched what they called a “massive manhunt.” Schools across suburban Denver, already anxious about the approaching anniversary of the shooting, locked all their doors and stepped up security. “We are used to threats certainly at Columbine,” said Mr. McDonald, the school safety director. “This one felt different.” Sheriff Jeff Shrader of Jefferson County, Colo., said it did not appear that Ms. Pais had any help from friends in the area, just a fascination with Columbine and the horrendous crime that took place there. At Miami Beach Senior High School, Katherin DeVargas Gil, a 17-year-old senior who took freshman Spanish and A.P. studio art with Ms. Pais this year, described her as “kind of in a corner.” Classmates said she was quiet and intelligent, but Ms. DeVargas Gil said a social media account with disturbing posts attributed to a Sol Pais had also made the rounds among her classmates. “We talked about it in our first-period class,” Ms. DeVargas Gil said. “I even texted my mom, crying, saying I don’t want to be here.” Brandon Bossard, a sophomore who had a second-period class with Ms. Pais, said she usually sat in chairs up against the classroom wall, alone. “I didn’t believe it. I didn’t understand it,” he said. “She’s so quiet. How could someone so quiet be like that?” WYOMING Neb. 25 Colorado 49 76 Area of detail Denver 70 jefferson COUNTY 50 miles 10 miles colorAdo Denver 70 103 25 Echo Lake Lodge Littleton Columbine High School Mt. Evans 10 miles colorAdo Denver 70 103 25 Echo Lake Lodge Littleton Columbine High School Mt. Evans By The New York Times An online journal that the authorities said they were investigating in connection with Ms. Pais read like a catalog of isolation, depression and anguish, illustrated with pictures of knives and guns. In a July 2018 entry, the journal writer described waking up every day feeling “lost, hopeless, angry, pissed off.” F.B.I. officials would not say on Wednesday whether they had determined if Ms. Pais was the author. It was a tactical team from the Clear Creek County sheriff’s department that found Ms. Pais’s body, near Echo Lake, according to the sheriff, Rick Albers. According to the sheriff, Ms. Pais had taken a rideshare to a lodge by the lake. At some point she had hiked about half a mile from the lodge, and then about 100 yards up a hill. She would have had to hike through snow to get there, somewhere between one and four feet deep, officials said. Clear Creek deputies found her by a stump, dead from a gunshot wound. She was in the same clothing the F.B.I. had reported her as wearing — boots, camouflage pants and a black shirt. She was also wearing a plaid jacket, and had a bag and a shotgun with her. Mr. Albers said that he did not know of any other guns found on her. For some of the youngest students at home on Wednesday, the episode was their first introduction to the Columbine shooting, and to its legacy of worry and tripwire responses to threats to schools. “It’s sad and scary,” said Jeff Desserich, a math teacher at a charter school in Denver, who spent the morning trying to explain to his daughters Anais, 8, and Elena, 6, why they would not be going to class. “I said, ‘There is a lady, she probably has some sort of mental health issue,’” he said. “And I talked a little about the sad events of Columbine.” Emily Fern, whose 5-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter go to school in Littleton, sat in bed on Wednesday morning debating whether to say anything at all to her children about why they were staying home. Her son, Hayden, loves Spider-Man and superheroes, so Ms. Fern decided to explain the threat in terms of “good guys” and “bad guys.” Before leaving for her job as a hair stylist, Ms. Fern, 38, said she told her babysitter not to go farther than the front lawn of their cul-de-sac on Wednesday, and to run inside, lock the doors and call 911 if she saw anything suspicious. “Just that feeling that she could be lurking in the neighborhoods,” Ms. Fern said of the threat. “You’re kind of looking everywhere.” In Jefferson County, officials were making contingency plans to reopen schools, even if that meant overcoming logistical hurdles like changes in transportation and food service. “We did not wish to have one person hold all of the schools in the front range of the whole state hostage,” said Jason Glass, the schools superintendent. Mr. Glass said even though those plans had not been implemented and schools would open on Thursday, they would be saved for the future. Mr. McDonald, the school safety director, said the system did not want to play into the fascination with Columbine. “We’re not a place to come visit if you’re not a student,” he said. “We’re not a tourist attraction. We’re not a place for you to come and gain inspiration.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Instant Dreams’ Review: Polaroid’s Too-Secret Ingredient,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. It isn’t often that one watches a film, particularly a documentary, and thinks, “I wish this was more conventional.” Yet that may be your experience of “Instant Dreams,” a picture directed by Willem Baptist about the end of the Polaroid camera and the “instant film” it used. Baptist’s film begins with full-frame images of bubbling, swirling color, reminding the viewer that photography used to be an analog, chemical process. “The digital dark ages took over our lives … the perfect formula was lost,” one of the film’s human subjects says in a voice-over that sounds ominous indeed. The last portion might be literally true: Edwin H. Land, who founded the Polaroid Corporation, invented the process for instant film but never shared it with anyone. When he died in 1991, the formula went with him. One of the personages here is Stephen Herchen, a former Polaroid scientist who is now working to replicate that “perfect formula.” Another subject is Christopher Bonanos, who wrote a book on Polaroid; in one scene, which could have come out of a Noah Baumbach movie, he demonstrates the camera to his writer and editor friends at a party. Then there’s Stefanie Schneider, a German photographer who is using her remaining instant film stock to make art stills in the American desert; a couple of her models philosophize nude in a bathtub the shooter has placed out of doors. It’s all a bit eyeroll-inducing. Baptist’s approach, treating his subjects like characters in a drama, is ultimately frustrating. What kind of corporation was Polaroid, exactly, that it entrusted its most crucial component to a single man? Answers to such questions are not forthcoming. A little more journalism and a little less impressionism might have been called for here.

2019,‘It Just Went Poof’: The Strange Aftermath of Virginia’s Cascade of Political Scandals,"RICHMOND, Va. — More than a dozen state lawmakers filed onto the stage, summoned by the smiling leader of their state: Ralph S. Northam, the governor of Virginia. On the governor’s right were a handful of House Democrats, who as a group in February said they were “no longer confident in the governor’s representation of Virginians,” after learning of a shocking racist photo on Mr. Northam’s medical-school yearbook page. On his left were mostly Republicans, including the speaker of the House, Delegate Kirk Cox, who’d declared that Mr. Northam’s “ability to lead and govern is permanently impaired.” Some on stage were members of the legislative black caucus, which called the yearbook photo “disgusting, reprehensible, and offensive” and “a complete betrayal.” Even so, as Mr. Northam took out a pen at the event last week and signed bills to overhaul the state’s foster care system, the lawmakers of both parties stood behind him, grinning and clapping. This is the strange, suspended state of Virginia politics, just two months after scandal after scandal seemed to be devouring the state’s government from the top down. In the space of a week in early February, the public was stunned by revelations about each of the three highest statewide elected officials, all Democrats: the racist photo in the governor’s yearbook; accusations of sexual assault against the lieutenant governor; and the attorney general’s appearance in blackface at a party in college. Protesters and news crews swarmed the Statehouse. Calls for resignations came from fellow Virginia Democrats, Republicans and even 2020 presidential candidates. And then? “It just went poof,” said Natalie Draper, a librarian sitting in the back of a coffeehouse last week in Richmond. “It’s like it never happened.” Virginians have various theories as to how this surreal normalcy set in. Some say the whole mess was so exhausting and embarrassing that by the time the legislature adjourned on Feb. 24, the outrage had burned itself out. Others point to polls that showed Virginia voters were considerably less hungry for resignations than their representatives were. Some political observers mused about more fundamental changes to the life span of scandal, describing President Trump’s approach to bad press as if it were a revolutionary medical breakthrough. “Don’t apologize, move on, and everybody will talk about something else next week,” is how Ben Tribbett, a Democratic strategist, described it. “Maybe we’ve been doing it wrong over the last 100 years.” For the Democrats, perhaps above all, there are the blunt political realities. Whatever may happen in the 2021 election for governor, every seat in the Republican-controlled Virginia General Assembly will be up this November, and Democrats have a chance to take back power in at least one chamber of the legislature. That will be hard enough now, given the bales of fodder Republicans now have for attack ads. But the idea of trying to raise money and hold rallies while spurning the three highest officeholders in the state came to be seen by many Democrats as just a needless handicap. Betsy Carr, a Democratic delegate, said shortly after stepping off the stage last week with Mr. Northam that voters “want to move on.” “They want positive things to happen, they’re concerned about the elections,” she said. That sort of hard pragmatism is common among Democratic figures these days. But it is not unanimous. Many younger people in the party, in particular, are frustrated by what they see as the leadership’s hurry to move on from the scandals rather than come to grips with them. “Winning is important,” said Taikein Cooper, the 30-year-old chairman of the Prince Edward County Democratic Party, “but we also have to have some morals.” In the immediate wake of the scandals, the governor all but disappeared, either avoiding public events or being explicitly disinvited from them. The gears of state government kept turning — bills were signed or vetoed, cabinet secretaries did their work — but Mr. Northam’s public resurfacing was slow, beginning with an appearance in early March at the third annual Public Safety Unmanned Aircraft Systems Conference. Still, it is only in recent days that his public schedule has approached normal — or at least, something that looks normal from the outside. “I think groups are struggling with, ‘What do we do? What do we do about inviting him? Do we want him the centerpiece of an announcement?’” said Mr. Cox, the House speaker, who spoke with Mr. Northam at the bill-signing for the first time since February. “It’s going to be pretty hard to say we’re just going to have a normal governorship for the next three years,” Mr. Cox said. Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, too, has been showing up at public events more often. But rather than trying to change the subject from the allegations against him, he dives right into them, even unprompted, as he did on the last day of the legislative session in a surprise speech comparing himself to a victim of lynching. Mark Herring, the attorney general, has taken questions from the public on a few occasions since his own blackface scandal broke. But when he talked recently with reporters in Washington, after a Supreme Court hearing on gerrymandering, no one asked him about the episode. Democrats fully acknowledge that there is unfinished business in all this. But they cite the lack of resolution as a reason to slow down on those immediate calls for resignations. “Most people wanted to give the governor time to sort out what had happened,” said State Senator Scott A. Surovell. “I think a lot of people question whether he’s in that picture, and they’re waiting for more information about who’s actually in it.” Initially, Mr. Northam apologized for appearing in the yearbook photo, which shows a man in blackface makeup standing next to someone wearing a Klan robe and hood. But since then, he has insisted that he is actually not either of the people in the picture, and he has pledged to get to the bottom of the matter. The mechanism for that appears to be an inquiry that began last month, conducted on behalf of Eastern Virginia Medical School by the law firm McGuireWoods. That investigation into the role of racism in the past and present culture of the school was also examining the circumstances of the infamous photo. No findings have been announced yet, and the investigation is expected to wrap up in the next few weeks. Still, Mr. Northam made another pledge around the time he announced that he was staying put: to focus for the rest of his term on addressing racial inequities in American life, a theme he now repeatedly emphasizes in speeches. The governor “welcomes the opportunity for future conversations” on improving racial equity, said a spokeswoman, Ofirah Yheskel, who pointed out various measures the governor has supported in recent weeks that reflect “his focus on the equity issues.” One of the chief barometers of Mr. Northam’s success on this front has become the opinion of the legislative black caucus, to which other Democrats have readily deferred since the scandals broke. Members of the caucus have laid out their priorities in meetings and conversations with the governor, and they say he has mostly abided. “He’s been trying hard, from what I can see,” said Delegate Lamont Bagby, the chairman of the caucus. “He’s stumbled on his own feet a couple times, I think he would agree to that.” But Mr. Bagby gave his approval to the governor’s choice of bills to veto and amendments to propose over the past few weeks, and he said he believed that long-delayed but badly needed conversations about race had begun. At a Baptist church in Richmond on a recent Sunday afternoon, Mr. Northam delivered brief remarks referring to lingering inequities at a ceremony in honor of Dorothy Height, a grande dame of the civil rights movement. He was followed at the pulpit by Mr. Fairfax — the first time they appeared in public together since the scandals erupted. The contrast was stark. Mr. Fairfax began with praise for Ms. Height’s “oratory around the issue of anti-lynching,” but it quickly became clear he was also talking about other matters. “She saw what was happening in this country, where people were being falsely accused,” Mr. Fairfax said. “They were not given due process. They were having their lives in so many ways impacted negatively, in some ways taken away, because people wanted not to get to the truth but ultimately wanted things changed in a negative way for nefarious reasons.” It was barely subtext, and he would revisit these themes more forthrightly two nights later at a Women’s History Month mixer in Hampton, Va., an event sponsored by the local chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. After the lieutenant governor gave a short speech on his fight against “fabricated claims and false allegations,” the crowd erupted in cheers of support. Like Mr. Northam, Mr. Fairfax has insisted on an investigation into the accusations against him. He contends that he is being accused of sexual assault and rape for encounters that were consensual. His demands for an investigation are echoed by fellow Democrats, as Mr. Northam’s are. But it remains unclear where exactly such an investigation is to come from. “If it’s proved in a court of law, something needs to be done, but we’re not there yet,” Ms. Carr, the lawmaker, said. Prosecutors in North Carolina and Massachusetts have been in contact with the two women who accused Mr. Fairfax — Vanessa Tyson and Meredith Watson — but there has been no public indication yet that a criminal investigation has been formally opened. Republican lawmakers announced plans for an investigative hearing, and both accusers have said repeatedly that they are willing to testify publicly as part of a bipartisan process, but Democratic lawmakers have balked, seeing such a hearing as a fruitless exercise prone to partisan grandstanding. At this point, there are few other obvious options. “We are actually engaged in initiating processes that will make the truth known,” Mr. Fairfax said at the event in Hampton, speaking over the live jazz music and pleas for him to join in group photos. He declined to elaborate further. On Sunday, a lawyer for Mr. Fairfax issued a news release saying that Mr. Fairfax had undergone polygraph examinations administered by a former F.B.I. agent, and that the results “demonstrated that Lt. Gov. Fairfax was telling the truth” in denying the allegations. A spokeswoman said these exams were separate from the “processes” that Mr. Fairfax had spoken of earlier. And so life goes on in Virginia, with the legislature coming back this week for a quick session and with the political jockeying getting underway before the primaries in June. Democratic lawmakers who are asked what may come next on the scandal front have no concrete answer; most say their constituents would rather hear about roadwork, school financing and health care. Those, after all, are matters that state politicians can actually change, as opposed to the things that apparently they cannot. “The calls for resignation have not been rescinded,” Delegate Jeff Bourne, a member of the legislative black caucus, said a few days before appearing with the governor at a bill-signing ceremony. “But I think it’s one of those things where we are operating in the current state of affairs. And the current state of affairs is that the governor and lieutenant governor are still there.”",The New York Times
2019,‘It’s Complete Chaos’: Storm Frees Gators in Rio Favela Where Officials Won’t Go,"The storm that swept through Rio de Janeiro this week left a wreck in its wake: A landslide swallowed homes, floodwaters rose up in hospitals and power lines collapsed as streets turned into roaring rivers. Then came the alligators — or, more precisely, their South American cousins, the caimans. The storm knocked down the walls of a caiman farm in a neighborhood, or favela, that is controlled, like others in Rio de Janeiro, by a heavily armed criminal paramilitary group. This made the local authorities reluctant to enter — and left the creatures, which can grow to be 11 feet long, to swim through the flooded streets, terrifying residents. The caiman farm stood in the Favela do Rola, in western Rio de Janeiro, one of several sections of the city to be flooded this week. It was unclear how many caimans were bred there, but photographs and videos of the creatures coursing through the floodwaters were shared by several people on social media. Rejane Guimarães, 38, who has lived in the Favela do Rola for 25 years, said she had spotted two caimans swimming in the murky waters around 10 a.m. Tuesday. She and her neighbors called local officials repeatedly, she said, asking them to remove the creatures. But the authorities did not even try to help, Ms. Guimarães said. They told her it was too dangerous to go into the neighborhood, she said. The city’s press office and environment department said Wednesday that although their officials had declined to enter the favela, they were talking with residents to assess the possibility of a joint rescue operation with the military police. The Rio de Janeiro Fire Department said that it sent a team to the area on Tuesday night, but that it had failed to find the caimans. Residents said they never saw the agents. For Ms. Guimarães, the caimans felt like the last drop of misfortune after a flood of it. The storm has left at least 10 people dead around the city, including two sisters whose house was swallowed by a landslide, and has caused untold damage to businesses and homes. At 3 a.m. Tuesday, after trying to rescue some belongings from the waters, Ms. Guimarães ran with her children to her mother’s house. She now fears that she could lose everything she owned in the flood, including her refrigerator, a television and a washing machine she bought only three months ago. Several people in her community did lose everything, and are sleeping in a local church, relying on donations to eat, Ms. Guimarães said. “It’s complete chaos here,” she said. “We are really scared, we don’t know how to defend ourselves. These wild animals are totally free now, they could attack us. We don’t know if they’re hungry, what their reaction will be if we see them.” She dismissed the government’s explanation for why officials did not enter the favela, saying that the mayor himself had been there this year, making promises to improve their lives. Others echoed her comments on social media, poking fun at the city officials’ excuse that the neighborhood was too dangerous to enter. “Only if the criminals are on boats,” a Facebook user named Vinícius Melo Abade wrote beneath a post on the floods. “Only if the crocodiles themselves are armed,” wrote another user, Aline Taylor. Ricardo Freitas, a local biologist who has been studying crocodilians in Rio de Janeiro State for 17 years, was not surprised by the existence of a caiman farm inside a favela. People illegally breed caimans across the city to sell to restaurants, he said. He also suggested that criminals sometimes use the animals to scare kidnapping victims, though there is no evidence that was the case in Favela da Rola. Mr. Freitas, who dedicates some of his time to rescuing caimans, said that the creatures do not prey on people, but could eat pets. He said there are around 8,000 broad-snouted caimans, the most common species in Rio, in the city’s western zone. “It sounds like movie stuff,” he said. “But it’s a surreal reality in Rio de Janeiro.”",The New York Times
2019,‘It’s Going to Be the Image of the Revolution’,"A smartphone snap from the Sudanese protests has gone viral. What is it about this picture that makes it so powerful? Every once in a while an image appears that so viscerally frames the human story in a time of social or political paroxysm that it becomes a symbol. Such was the case this week with a smartphone photo taken during a demonstration in Sudan against the repressive regime of President Omar al-Bashir, as the protests that have been going on intermittently since December reached a new intensity. In the picture, a woman in a white thoub and gold disc earrings stands on the roof of a car. She is caught in profile, mid-speech, one arm raised to the heavens, finger pointing upward, the other clutching her waist, amid a sea of heads and arms waving phones to record the moment. Posted on Twitter Tuesday by Lana H. Haroun, it had 50,000 likes by Wednesday morning and had taken on a life of its own. Though the speaker has since been identified as Alaa Salah, a 22-year-old student, some people have dubbed her the Sudanese Statue of Liberty, others simply “the woman in a white thoub.” Either way, her picture has had resonance far beyond its place of origin. “I’m pretty sure it’s going to be the image of the revolution,” said Hind Makki, a Sudanese-American anti-racism educator in Chicago who reposted the photo on all of her platforms. She wasn’t the only one who thought so. Part of its power, Ms. Makki argued, derived from the symbolism inherent in the shot, much of it contained in the visual shorthand of what Ms. Salah is wearing. Her earrings, which reflected the light, are, Ms. Makki said, traditional wedding jewelry meant to symbolize femininity. The choice of a white thoub, a garment no longer popular among young Sudanese (who associate it with an older generation), reflected a connection to mothers and grandmothers “who dressed like this during while they marched the streets demonstrating against previous military dictatorships.” The white thoub also has been, Ms. Makki said, a democratic garment, worn by secretaries and lawyers alike. And white was the color adopted by female student protesters, beginning in March, when many involved in a sit-in at Ahfad University for Women (AUW) wore white thoubs, inspiring others to show their support by wearing similar garments (and producing a hashtag). Since then, these women in white have often been called Kandakas, a reference to ancient Nubian queens, connecting their power to the power of the women who are now helping lead the protests. None of this could have escaped Ms. Salah, whose mother is a fashion designer who specializes in thoubs. And though, as Ms. Makki has pointed out, these references give white its own history in Sudan, it is also generally seen as the color of new beginnings, the color of American and British suffragists, and the color adopted most recently by the women of Congress, who wore white to the State of the Union address earlier this year to demonstrate their own solidarity and moment of change. “The response has been phenomenal,” said Ms. Makki of reaction to her posts. “It’s a little overwhelming.” It is also, however, dangerous; on Wednesday, after her identity became known, Ms. Salah wrote on Twitter that she had received death threats. “I will not bow down,” she wrote. “My voice can not be suppressed. Will hold Al-Bashir responsible if anything happens to me.” Similarly, Ms. Haroun posted a video noting she wanted to respond to all the people who had asked her how she felt about her photograph’s power. “Pray for Sudan,” she said. The reaction to Ms. Haroun’s picture puts it firmly in line with a series of images that have become synonymous with the historical moments they represent, including, most recently, the “woman in a sundress” who faced down the riot police in Baton Rouge, La., during the 2016 protests against the shooting of Alton Sterling; the “woman in a red dress” who turned her head away as Istanbul police tear-gassed protesters in 2013 during an anti-development demonstration; and the young man in shirt-sleeves facing the tanks that were rolling into Beijing’s Tiananmen Square in 1989. In each case, the images derive their power in part from the sheer quotidian nature of the individual, armored not in defensive gear or in depersonalizing military garb but in the clothes of the everyday. It’s one of the ways viewers connect to the figures in the frame; they feel immediate, and recognizable, because they are wearing recognizable colors and costumes. And it is no accident that such photographs are referred to by the garments involved. It’s not just how we identify the pictures, but how we identify with them. Indeed, though some comments on social media have expressed irritation about the fact that it took a photograph to capture the attention of the world and draw it to Sudan, Arthur Asseraf, a historian at Cambridge University in Britain, wrote of the reaction to Ms. Haroun’s picture: “this is incredibly frustrating. But it is also very useful. The images of these women is a huge strategic resource for these movements to grab attention. So go out and dress up! Use your phones! Seize the means of representation!” The effect is, as Susan Sontag wrote in her essay “On Photography,” “to democratize all experiences by translating them into images.” There’s a through-line linking one picture imprinted on the memory to the next, a shared sense of sisterhood and humanity, though they were taken across oceans, and time.",The New York Times
2019,‘It’s the Grannies!’ New Voices Rise Against Austria’s Populists,"VIENNA — They are fixtures at the antigovernment protests every Thursday night in the Austrian capital, older women wearing hand-knit hats in purples, reds and blues. They like to march between the shouting students and the masked anti-fascists, waving to onlookers and hoping to catch someone’s eye long enough to exchange a smile. “It’s the Grannies,” shouted a voice from a third-story window as the demonstration wound its way through Vienna’s Fifth District last month. “Look! The Grannies!” They are the Grannies Against the Right, dozens of women from a generation that watched their mothers suffer the fallout of World War II and helped create democracy in Austria. Now, freed from the burdens of raising their families and working to support them, they are galvanizing protests against Austria’s shift to the right under the conservative-nationalist government of Chancellor Sebastian Kurz. They are even aiming to form an international “resistance” against the right wing and extremists across Europe and beyond, the Grannies declared at an annual meeting last month. “We are angry about their policies,” said Monika Salzer, 71 and a grandmother of three. She founded the group on Facebook in November 2017 amid concern over the return of a far-right party to government. Last year, she registered the Grannies as an official organization in Austria, and it now counts 300 members, with branches across Austria and Germany and thousands of followers over social media. The Grannies’ list of grievances is long: cuts to women’s programs; discrimination against women, who receive no pension compensation for time taken off to raise children; the demonization of refugees and minorities in general; and an overall lack of empathy in the political discourse. “They want to destroy everything we have built up over the past 50 years,” Ms. Salzer said of Mr. Kurz’s coalition of conservatives and the far-right Freedom Party, which is part of the government for the second time in 20 years. The last time the Freedom Party joined the government, in 2000, howls of protest went up across Europe and tens of thousands of Austrians took to the streets. The reaction after Mr. Kurz’s government was sworn in during December 2017 was more muted. The regular Thursday demonstrations began only in October, by which time the Grannies were organized. The Grannies haven’t missed a march since, but with the political opposition weakened for the moment, the protests have had limited influence, said Martin Dolezal, a political scientist at the University of Salzburg. “The Grannies have received a lot of attention because of their age — they stand out in the largely younger crowd and they are well connected,” Mr. Dolezal said. “But I wouldn’t overemphasize their influence.” Still, precisely because of their age, their presence serves as a reminder of past horrors born of intolerance and of the democratic gains that the Grannies want to preserve. Although their numbers fluctuate from demonstration to demonstration, depending largely on whether they are needed to help care for their grandchildren, the Grannies have become a recognized political force. For Irene Haider, who joined with the group for a demonstration on International Women’s Day last month, the Grannies’ age made them not just unusual, but also important. “It’s great that older women are making their political voice heard,” said Ms. Haider, 48. Without having to be asked, she took one of a dozen white signs stashed in a shopping cart brought to each demonstration. That spirit of openness defines the group, which despite its name, welcomes anyone, regardless of gender or age, who supports its opposition to discrimination and far-right ideology. Nonpartisanship is important. “We don’t want a seat in Parliament, we don’t want to become chancellor,” said Susanne Scholl, 69, a former correspondent with the national broadcaster ORF who is expecting her first grandchild this year. “We want the social, democratic principles of our country that we were raised in to exist for our children and grandchildren.” At its general meeting last month, the group established a European-wide branch, with an eye toward elections for the European Parliament in May, and changed its name into English for broader appeal. The Grannies also addressed one of the problems that has shadowed them since the beginning: a misunderstanding among some members about their mission. “We had to make clear we are not a handicraft or knitting club,” Ms. Scholl said. This, despite adopting the suggestion that the Grannies take over the cat-eared “pussy hat” beanies that had become the signature fashion item of the 2017 women’s marches in the United States. But not just in pink. “We decided that we needed brighter colors,” Ms. Salzer said, laughing. “At our age, we are beyond pink.” Heinz-Christian Strache, the Freedom Party leader and Mr. Kurz’s deputy, gave the group an inadvertent lift at a political rally this year in the town of Ried. Wearing lederhosen and gripping a mug of beer, he extolled the government’s success in making the country less attractive to asylum-seekers and unraveling some of the benefits that flourished under center-left governments. He also took a swipe at the demonstrators. “On Thursday again we’ll see these so-called Thursday demos, along with the Grannies, the Grannies Against the Right,” he told the crowd. “They can march around the ring as long as they want, until they are so dizzy — dizzier then they already are — that they fall down.” Ms. Salzer and Ms. Scholl were delighted. “Everyone is talking about us,” Ms. Salzer said. “Even the vice chancellor.” At a march down one of Vienna’s main shopping streets on International Women’s Day, about 15 of the Grannies took their place in the center of the demonstrators. They waved to two women watching from the sidewalk, then pulled a couple of “Grannies Against the Right” signs from the shopping cart and asked them to join. Laughing, Ebru Uzun, 26, and Sabine Schwaighofer, 49, accepted, and joined the group for the march. “It sends an important signal to the conservatives,” said Ms. Uzun, 26. “Everyone has a granny; they play a role in connecting a family, they are there for everyone.” Ms. Schwaighofer nodded in agreement, saying, “Grannies are unifiers, and even though society wants to see them as apolitical, they are succeeding in making themselves into a political force.”",The New York Times
2019,‘J.T. LeRoy’ Review: Unpeeling the Layers of an All-American Hoax,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Despite all the articles and exposés, the tell-all books and documentary investigations, it still isn’t clear why anyone bought into the hoax known as JT LeRoy. Perhaps you remember him, the teenage boy turned cross-dressing prostitute who survived a horrific childhood (poverty, abuse, addiction) to become an acclaimed writer. Or perhaps you remember her: Laura Albert, the woman who invented Jeremiah Terminator LeRoy — giving him voice on the page and on the phone — and who turned her fantasy into a cult figure, chart-topping memoirist and reclusive, tantalizing elusive object of desire. It’s hard to know if anyone would remember JT LeRoy much less Albert if so many celebrities hadn’t fallen for this fiction, bestowing their love and legitimacy on a fraud. These starry types pop up in “J.T. LeRoy,” a diverting account of the hoax told largely from the point of view of Savannah Knoop (Kristen Stewart), who, coaxed and coached by Albert (Laura Dern), pretended to be JT. Stepping into the role of the dewy grit-lit sensation, Knoop became the boy in the Warholian wig and sunglasses hanging out with Courtney Love (she pops up here) and nuzzling with Asia Argento, who turned LeRoy-Albert’s 2001 book “The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things” into a truly terrible movie. The story of Albert, Knoop and JT — and their starry pals — is told in “Author: The JT LeRoy Story,” a nonfiction movie from 2016 that plays like a feature-length advertisement for Albert and her post-hoax rehabilitation. That documentary isn’t especially revelatory about why the ruse worked. Mostly, it solidifies Albert as an heir to that 19th-century American archetype, the confidence man, the smooth-talking dissembler who takes advantage of the credulous to sell faith, politics, whatever. Since then, fictionally embellished or wholly fantastical memoirs (among them James Frey’s “A Million Little Pieces”) have offered another outlet for their cons, scams ready-made for celebrity, pillory and talk-show apologies. “J.T. LeRoy” is a tougher, better movie than “Author” and generally comes off as more honest. Directed by Justin Kelly, who wrote the script with Knoop, it focuses on Savannah’s role in the fraud, peeling back the details — physical, psychological — in a masquerade that rather astonishingly lasted some half-dozen years. Anchored by its two excellent leads, the movie is sympathetic and, for the most part, unsentimental. In this telling, the young Savannah is an eager-to-please naïf who falls first for Laura’s smooth talk and then for the mounting pleasures that playing this fictional creation delivers, including a relationship with an actress-director wittily played by Diane Kruger. Savannah-JT isn’t remotely believable as a teenage boy but does have beauty and mystery. At first, Kelly seems to be puckishly nodding to “Author.” Both toss in an epigram about the truth right at the top: “Author” quotes Federico Fellini, while “J.T. LeRoy” cites Oscar Wilde. Soon, Kelly establishes his own angle and approach, underscoring Savannah’s earnestness and Laura’s disingenuousness as the story jumps around San Francisco and then moves farther afield as the JT show goes big and then bigger. Stewart seems too worldly to be playing the innocent portrayed here. But her gift for showing you a character’s interior states, for feelings that delicately brush the skin, gives Savannah a vulnerability that becomes an expressive counterpoint to Laura’s grandiosity and wounded narcissism. Few actors inhabit the space between charming and monstrous as brilliantly as Dern does. The JT LeRoy fiction started unraveling in the mid-2000s as journalists chased down suspicions and inconsistencies. In his New York magazine story “Who Is the Real JT LeRoy?,” the writer Stephen Beachy suggested that the answer was Albert. He also wondered about its significance. “Does it matter if ‘JT LeRoy’ never lived in a squat, if he never tricked on Polk Street, never was a lot lizard, isn’t from West Virginia?” Beachy wrote. “Does it matter if he is, more or less, a 39-year-old mother named Laura Albert, originally from Brooklyn? Where’s the harm?” It’s a question that “J.T. LeRoy” suggests is at least worth asking, even about a farce as transparently, laughably absurd as this one.

2019,‘Jane Doe Ponytail’: Her Life Ended in N.Y. Now Her Brother’s Bringing Her Home.,"After a woman fell to her death during a raid on a Queens massage parlor, her brother conducted his own investigation. He’s now returning to China with her ashes. [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] A long-limbed man carrying a black bag moved with purpose through the morning bustle of Flushing, Queens. He walked into the hush of the Chun Fook funeral home and down the marble steps to where the paperwork of death is handled. An employee in black led him into the privacy provided by a wooden screen. On a table draped with a gold cloth sat a small white box, and behind it, a framed portrait of the man’s sister and only sibling, Song Yang. In late November 2017, she either jumped or fell from a fourth-floor window as the police were banging on her door to arrest her, once again, for prostitution. She landed hard on 40th Road, a truncated street known for restaurants, illegal massage parlors and women on its sidewalks calling out “Massage? Massage?” Song Yang was 38. Her brother and mother, Song Hai and Shi Yumei, rushed from their remote home in northeastern China to unfamiliar Flushing, where they spent the next 15 months. Distrustful of the police account, Mr. Song, 36, began his own investigation into her death, distributing information-wanted posters, swapping tips with reporters and interrogating his sister’s sex-work colleagues. He became convinced that the police had thrown his sister from the window, and that the authorities were engaged in a cover-up. It did not matter that surveillance video demonstrated otherwise, or that an inquiry by the Queens district attorney’s office found no evidence of police misconduct. Bitter suspicion infused his grief. But Mr. Song’s investigation had stalled. Money had run out. Visas had expired. And a wife and 5-year-old son were waiting. It was time to return to China. Time to bring his sister home. The funeral home employee, Kevin Liu, opened the box. He explained to Mr. Song that the certificate of cremation — needed for customs — was inside, along with a sealed bag containing Song Yang’s ashes. Mr. Song raised the delicate matter of payment for more than a year’s rental of storage space — about $600. But the funeral home was well aware of the family’s woes. Whenever the brother and mother visited Song Yang’s remains, the mother was known to weep without pause. Mr. Liu settled on $200. Then, at Mr. Song’s request, he wrapped the box in a cloth of red, the color meant to convey wishes for safe passage of the soul. Mr. Song removed a black backpack from his bag, and the two men carefully placed the box and the portrait inside. Mr. Liu helped to strap the bag to Mr. Song’s back, shook his hand, and said, “Yilu shunfeng.” Have a safe journey. We spent most of 2018 following the Flushing travails of Mr. Song and Ms. Shi, as they inhabited the absence of their loved one, Song Yang. Then, in October, The New York Times published “The Case of Jane Doe Ponytail,” our lengthy account of her death and its aftermath. Now, in late March, her brother and mother had to tend to last-minute matters before ending their American journey — including the collection from the funeral home. Carrying the remains of his sister on his back, Mr. Song crossed Northern Boulevard and headed south on Main Street. So many times he had walked this street, searching for clues, sorting out matters in his head. Past the Confucius Manning Pharmacy. The Rainbow women’s clothing store. The landmark Episcopal church, St. George’s, where his grieving mother had found solace. Its members had given her a sense of purpose by enlisting her to volunteer at a weekly food pantry. A construction worker in a hard hat leaned against the church’s gray stone wall, smoking a cigarette. He personified the ongoing transformation of Flushing into an oasis of glass towers. Mr. Song walked through the man’s blue-white exhalations. He crossed the busy intersection at Roosevelt Avenue, where he had once grabbed his sister’s “boss”: an elusive, square-headed man known as Lao Li. Song Yang had paid him as much as $400 a night for a 40th Road apartment and the illusion of protection. Their tense encounter had attracted a crowd, as Mr. Song waved down a police car and insisted that this “boss” be arrested. Explaining that things do not work that way in the United States, the police had allowed Lao Li to scurry away, leaving Mr. Song confused and angry. He continued on, deaf to the street songs of immigrants. A woman hawking beauty treatments. A man promoting tax services. A peddler selling Chinese-language books, including “F.B.I. Mind Reading — U.S. Federal Agents Teach You to See Through People.” Mr. Song turned right on 40th Road. He walked along the sidewalk on the south side, where his sister had once called out to men. Song Yang had come with her much-older husband to Flushing in 2013, after an economic downturn in Saipan forced them to close the two restaurants they owned. With her husband unable to work, she had scrambled to find a job. Before long, she was offering sex for money on 40th Road, a dangerously vulnerable job. She was beaten, robbed and sexually assaulted. She was also arrested a couple of times, which she feared might thwart her chance to secure legal residence in the United States. Arrested again in late September 2017, Song Yang became despondent. “I’ve fallen so low I can’t be saved,” she wrote in a WeChat message to a lawyer trying to help her. “Without purpose, without direction, what meaning is there to keep on living?” On the night of Nov. 25, she fell prey to another sting, this time by a team of 10 police officers who had nicknamed her “Jane Doe Ponytail.” She escorted an undercover officer up to her fourth-floor apartment in the tired building at 135-32 and offered him sex for $80, but he demurred and left. Almost immediately she saw, on a surveillance monitor in the apartment, the images of police officers ascending the stairs. Song Yang hurried to a small balcony overlooking 40th Road. She hit the pavement a few feet from the undercover officer, just as he was exiting the building. Now her brother was looking up at the balcony from the exact spot where she had fallen. He entered the building and climbed the tile steps leading to her old apartment, where another massage operation called Heaven on 4th had opened shortly after her death. But renovation work blocked the stairwell, and a sign in Chinese on the window of the first-floor restaurant explained what was happening. FOR RENT Third floor, fourth floor Suitable for all kinds of offices Price negotiable Things had changed along 40th Road. For one thing, the police were targeting johns, in keeping with a stated policy to focus less on the employees of illicit massage parlors and more on their owners and customers. The police also began enforcing nuisance-abatement laws. One of the first operations had targeted a massage parlor in a building across the street from 135-32 — one run by Song Yang’s old “boss,” Lao Li. The authorities had padlocked its doors and plastered its windows with “CLOSED By Court Order” and “RESTRAINING ORDER” signs. Finally, a task force of several city agencies — including the police, fire and buildings departments — began focusing on property and business owners, zeroing in, for example, on apartments with illegal subdivisions and faulty plumbing fixtures. In addition, the news coverage that followed Song Yang’s death — including the account in The Times — had increased the political pressure to address the sex business along 40th Road. City Councilman Peter Koo, who had long received complaints about women overtly soliciting sex on the street, began calling landlords to put them on notice. No more renting to illegal businesses, Mr. Koo said he had warned them. And make sure your tenants do not sublease space to shadowy operations. One recent afternoon, a woman who calls herself DongDong, and who often wears a pink bomber jacket, emerged from a 40th Road restaurant carrying takeout. “We’ve all split up,” she said in Mandarin. “We can’t stand on the street anymore.” Later that night, though, DongDong was lingering, mostly alone, outside her old haunt. She and other women now connect with customers after midnight, and then lead them to locations on other Flushing streets. The 40th Road cacophony includes the ping of basketballs in the playground at one end, and a fruit stand’s chatter at the other. But, at least for now, you rarely hear the once-ubiquitous “Massage? Massage?” Mr. Song continued to carry his backpack south on Main Street, ignoring a man under the Long Island Rail Road trestle who was selling patches sure to relieve pain. He turned right on 41st Avenue — passing a nine-story structure that wasn’t there when he arrived in Flushing 15 months ago — and entered a squat building of subdivided apartments where kitchens and bathrooms are communal. His mother, Shi Yumei, was waiting in the 12-by-12-foot room they share. Its window looks out at the back of two oversized Chinese characters that advertise the senior center downstairs. “Happiness,” the characters say. On the nightstand sat pill bottles and cigarette lighters. On the mother’s bed, one of her daughter’s beloved teddy bears. And, in the corner, eight overstuffed pieces of luggage, a few containing some of the belongings left by Song Yang. The mother and brother were leaving that night for John F. Kennedy International Airport. It would take them a full day of travel to return home to China’s northeastern province of Liaoning, where the family plans to bury Song Yang on a mountainside. Ms. Shi, 66, sat bent on her bed. She is a much frailer woman than when she first arrived more than a year ago. Several months ago she required hip-replacement surgery after tripping or being knocked down on Main Street. She began talking of her gratitude to the United States. But the face of her son, sitting across from her, darkened with every word of praise for a government that he believed had caused and covered up his sister’s death. Suddenly, he threw a suitcase lock in anger. It hit a wall and clattered to the floor. “All that’s left of my sister are her ashes in a box,” he said. He listed other sorrows.

2019,‘Jeopardy!’ Phenom James Holzhauer Smashes Through $1 Million Mark,"For more than two weeks, a professional sports gambler from Las Vegas has been dominating “Jeopardy!” with a calculated strategy, an affinity for risk-taking and a deft buzzer hand. The contestant, James Holzhauer, 34, surpassed $1 million in total earnings on Tuesday, becoming the second contestant to do so in “Jeopardy!” history and continuing his record-breaking streak. Holzhauer won $118,816 in the game that aired on Tuesday, having capped off his winnings by correctly answering this Final Jeopardy clue: “On May 1, 1869, these two men met at the White House, four years and three weeks after a more historic meeting between them.” (Can you guess? The answer is at the end of this article.) On the show’s hall of fame, which documents the highest single-game winnings, Holzhauer now claims the top seven spots. Holzhauer’s earnings of $1.06 million so far amount to less than half of the $2.52 million that the game-show legend Ken Jennings took home in 2004. But Jennings amassed that prize over 74 games, while Holzhauer took only 14 games to reach his total. Holzhauer’s strategy boils down to this: Go for the high-value clues first, hunt for the Daily Doubles and, when he finds them, bet everything he has. “I’m going to get the Daily Double right a lot more often than I’m not going to,” he said in an interview with ESPN on Monday. “I want to maximize that bet.” Holzhauer has a trademark hand motion for his all-in bets: he pushes both hands forward like he’s moving all of his poker chips to the middle of the table. There’s always a risk that those bets will explode in his face. In the ESPN interview, Holzhauer recalled a game last week during which he bet $8,400 on a Daily Double clue and ended up losing it all. (He flubbed one about the Tour de France.) But he made a point of not letting that shake his confidence. “When I had $7,200 on the next Daily Double, I knew it was the right play to go all in again, and so I just did it,” he told ESPN. “Not everyone’s going to be able to come in with that game plan,” he added, “and fewer still will be able to execute it.” Before Holzhauer first buzzed in on April 4, the single-game record was held by the contestant Roger Craig, who won $77,000 in a 2010 episode. Holzhauer first broke that high on April 9 when he amassed $110,914 in one game. Last week, he even surpassed that, with a $131,127 win. He will be going for his 15th win on Wednesday. (Episodes are recorded in advance, but players are told not to publicly discuss results of games that have not aired.) Part of how Holzhauer rakes in cash early on is by choosing the $1,000 clues toward the beginning of the game. Instead of watching his pile of cash rise incrementally with the easier $200 questions, he aims for the bottom of the board, opening up the potential to significantly increase his total if he lands on the coveted Daily Double. Of course, strategy alone is not enough to guarantee “Jeopardy!” domination. For some contestants, speed at hitting the buzzer sets them apart. In practicing his buzzer game before the competition, Holzhauer told ESPN, he relied on the e-book “Secrets of the Buzzer” by Fritz Holznagel, a repeat “Jeopardy!” winner. (In case any aspiring contestants are reading, the book’s introduction advises: “The buzzer is your friend. It is not a venomous rattlesnake, a downed power line or a horrifying object cursed by the ghosts of Howard Carter, King Tut and 1922.”) As for the sources of his knowledge, Holzhauer has said that an underrated strategy is reading children’s books, which he said are more effective than adult books because they cater to readers who might not be naturally interested in the subject matter. Jennings, the reigning “Jeopardy!” champion when it comes to total earnings, has only had positive words to say about the contestant who could soon unseat him. Jennings told the magazine Wired that he’s “mystified” that no one has beaten his record yet. On Twitter, Jennings joked that more people should appreciate his “sensible” wagers, which were small in comparison to Holzhauer’s gambles. Others have speculated on social media that Holzhauer’s winning streak is stretching the game show’s budget. In response to that concern, a “Jeopardy!” spokeswoman said, “Contestant winnings are budgeted for every season and James’ winnings are no different.” Holzhauer may seem like a cool, calculated strategist (some have compared him to a robot), but in each episode he shows his softer side by paying tribute to his loved ones during the game. His first record total, $110,914, resulted from a calculated Final Jeopardy bet to match his daughter’s birth date: Nov. 9, 2014. And he has written the sentimental notes at the bottom of his answers on Final Jeopardy, once saying hello to his niece and nephew and another time dedicating the game to his late grandmother. During Monday’s Final Jeopardy, Holzhauer’s 13th show, he gave a shout-out to three friends, saying that he had exhausted his family members. “You realize,” the host Alex Trebek replied, “if you keep winning, you’re going to run out of family and friends to acknowledge.” (The answer to Tuesday’s Final Jeopardy: “Who are Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee?”) An earlier version of this article misstated the amount of the lowest-value clues on the “Jeopardy!” game. They are worth $200, not $100.

2019,‘Kalank’ Review: A Bollywood Love Story in the Shadow of Partition,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. In “Kalank,” a lavish Bollywood melodrama, people talk in mysterious ways. “Some relationships are like debt,” the hero says, gazing into the heroine’s dark eyes. “They cannot be redeemed. They must be repaid.” So brava to the heroine, Roop (Alia Bhatt), who finally gets around to asking him, “Why can you never speak plainly?” For Abhishek Varman, the writer-director, the plain would seem to be the enemy of the good. Everything here is extravagant: the swirling camera moves; the hundreds of color-coordinated dancing extras with stomping heels and jingling ankle bracelets; and the sets, which are some of the most eye-popping this side of Cecil B. DeMille. The story, too, is maximalist. Set in 1945, the movie takes place near Lahore, with Partition looming. The hero, Zafar (Varun Dhawan) — a Romeo in a league of his own, a song tells us — is a Muslim, who harbors resentments because his parents abandoned him as a child. When not dancing down the street singing (“who cares about riches?”), or riding wild bulls, Zafar, a blacksmith, hammers metal into swords, his gym-toned torso gleaming. Zafar falls for Roop, but she’s married to Dev, who also has another, more beloved wife. (She’s dying, so she picked a successor.) The unhappy Roop becomes a reporter at the newspaper Dev owns; Zafar becomes her guide to the colorful doings of the disreputable part of town. In Mr. Varman’s hands, that neighborhood is as lush as any reputable one, its clean lanes opening into grand havelis with dancing girls inside and lotus-clogged waterways out back. This kind of fantasy-spectacle is Mr. Varman’s forte, not storytelling. When the singing and dancing and action stop, which is less often than you might think, so does “Kalank.” Dialogue scenes can be static, stand-and-deliver affairs. And Mr. Varman leaves the actors at sea; when the script calls for character complexity, the result usually reads as incoherence. Partition, here, is mostly just a looming backdrop. But you still may wonder about the movie’s politics. “Kalank” takes place near Lahore, in what was northwest India and is now Pakistan, so the Hindus, not the Muslims, are the film’s threatened minority. And the disruptive element is a group of Muslims whose anger Zafar has stoked, though for reasons that have nothing to do with politics or religion. That’s because, in good Bollywood fashion, the personal is mythical more than political — and even the political is mythical. Zafar, though an orphan, isn’t parentless. His mother is a famous Muslim courtesan and singer, his father a Hindu. Roop is a Hindu, too, as is Zafar’s half brother, with whom he unwittingly bonds as fireworks burst in the background. In sum, Zafar is an Indian fellow — who contains multitudes of contradictions. Is there a place for him in the about-to-be Pakistan? In India? In a different movie, these might be burning questions.

2019,‘Knock Down the House’ Review: Running to Win Hearts and Minds and Votes,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The big draw of the exuberant documentary “Knock Down the House” — about four women who ran for Congress in 2018 — is Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York. The former bartender turned first-time congresswoman is the most high-profile member of the freshman class of 2019 and scarcely needs an introduction. Her social media presence alone shows why she has crossed over into pop celebrity, whether she’s tweet-storming or live-streaming on Instagram while eating popcorn, talking about staying grounded and assembling Ikea furniture: “Boom! I did it.” The director Rachel Lears has said in interviews that after the 2016 presidential election she reached out to the progressive groups Brand New Congress and Justice Democrats, which ran unknowns (or what one organizer in the documentary describes as “non-career politicians”) in the 2018 midterms. From this pool, Lears chose four female Democratic candidates — Ocasio-Cortez, Cori Bush, Paula Jean Swearengin and Amy Vilela — each with an appealing back story, a seemingly unbeatable opponent and a progressive platform. (Lears and her husband, Robin Blotnick, wrote and produced “Knock Down the House”; she served as its cinematographer while he took on the role of editor.) The women’s stories emerge piecemeal in “Knock Down the House,” which follows them on the campaign trail up to election night and, in one case, beyond. Some are more sharply delineated — what makes them run and why — than others. Vilela, who ran in the Democratic primary in Nevada, seems the most personally invested, having been driven into politics by an agonizing family tragedy that she speaks about with raw, heart-heavy candor. Both Bush (from Missouri) and Swearengin (West Virginia) largely appear fed up with the establishment Democrats representing their districts. “We’re coming out of the belly of the beast kicking and screaming,” Swearengin says. Ocasio-Cortez quickly, and unsurprisingly, emerges as the focus. She’s a ready-made camera presence: sharp, young, emphatic and a tremendous, blazingly confident public speaker. Nothing seems to throw her off her game, whether she’s smiling at passers-by oblivious to her campaign leafleting or vigorously cleaning the clock of her very surprised-looking opponent, Joe Crowley, who had been in office since 1999. By the 2018 midterms, Crowley — who had originally been put on the ballot by his predecessor, Thomas J. Manton — was the fourth ranking House Democrat. He never saw Ocasio-Cortez coming; few did, other than these filmmakers. Because of Lears’s early access to the candidates, she and her camera seem to have been in the war rooms right from the start. Quickly and efficiently, and with the aid of some concise onscreen text and talking-head interviews, she sketches in how Brand New Congress and Justice Democrats operated. A lot of this is fascinating but could be clearer; it’s hazy how the groups coordinated their efforts in 2018, how they actually run candidates and what running someone fully entails. There are atmospheric back-room scenes with the candidates and their teams, but who hired whom? The timeline jumps around a bit, not always helpfully. Ocasio-Cortez is already running when the movie opens on her delivering an amusing gender analysis while putting on makeup. Soon, the movie cuts to Kentucky nine months earlier where a group of young people with laptops (one ornamented with a “Bernie for U.S. President” bumper sticker) are discussing an unnamed potential candidate. There’s talk and a call for a vote: “All those in favor of moving her to the next round, raise your hand.” Cut to Corbin Trent, of the Justice Democrats, who says that the “biggest shared goal” of his group and Brand New Congress is “removing the corrupting influence of money in politics.” These two organizations, Trent continues, are offering an alternative path to Congress, one free of lobbyists and special-interest groups. “Right now our Congress is 81 percent men,” Trent says. “It’s mostly white men, it’s mostly millionaires, it’s mostly lawyers.” This peek at outsider organizations is fascinating and could easily be spun into a separate documentary, as could the story of Jo-Ann Floyd-Whitehead, a community organizer who in 2008, with her husband, helped Barack Obama win the Democratic primary. “The Whiteheads are legendary,” says Ocasio-Cortez as people pore over her petition to get on the 2018 primary ballot. “This is the war room for every insurgent campaign in Queens.” This particular insurgency, of course, was part of a larger national shift that “Knock Down the House” (and the Bernie Sanders stickers and T-shirts) makes clear was only partly in reaction to the Trump presidency. Lears doesn’t dig into that shift as deeply as she could (this is the rare time that you yearn for a movie to be longer), but it’s there as the candidates push forward and their races and the documentary both develop great urgency. These women are running for office — while driving, walking, talking and walking some more — to win hearts and minds and votes. Often, it feels as if they’re running for their lives. They are also, as Ocasio-Cortez says forcefully, “running to win.” When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.",The New York Times
2019,‘Like a JDate for the Dead’,"Fiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. KADDISH.COM By Nathan Englander There are reportedly no atheists in a foxhole, but do any exist beside the grave of a beloved, devout father? Jewish law requires the Kaddish prayer to be recited at three services daily, for the 11 months following a parent’s death, in order to elevate the deceased’s soul. That’s a problem for Larry, a believer in neither prayer nor the soul. When we meet Larry — the hero of Nathan Englander’s third novel, “Kaddish.com,” and a defector from his Brooklyn family’s Orthodox Judaism — he is sitting shiva for his father. After the long days spent observing the prescribed mourning rituals, Larry lies awake, contemplating the fate of his father’s soul, with only internet porn for company, earning him a place in the lineup of Jewish male literary heroes who defile the sacred. Englander’s trademark humor is on display, but most striking and moving about “Kaddish.com” is the unabashed sweetness of a son’s longing for a father, “who saw his true nature, loving Larry for exactly who he was.” What haunts Larry isn’t guilt but love. The internet can, of course, outsource all needs, not just the carnal, and with a few clicks, Larry discovers a website that for a fee will match dead relatives with pious students who will recite the prayers thrice daily on their behalf — “a JDate for the dead.” While this mercenary transaction might seem like the kind of fantastical plot twist that Englander, with his eye for irony, might invent, Jewish law does allow an emissary to be thus hired. “Don’t spread it around, but it really is — halachically — the same,” one of the book’s many rabbis says. In this novel brimming with Talmudic references and biblical allusions, Jewish legal principles and Yiddish-inflected dialogue, Englander mines the tension between the letter and spirit of the law. “Kaddish.com” reads like a modern-day Hasidic tale in which religious characters are bedeviled by the challenges of upholding God’s word in an all too human world. Years after his father’s death, Larry repents, going back to his Hebrew name, Shaul — or Shuli, as he’s called — and becoming a teacher. Migrations between the secular and religious form an emotional cornerstone in many of Englander’s short stories, and as in Kafka and Roth (whose influences are felt in Englander’s work) the possibility of radical transformation is a given. After all, if a man can wake up a beetle or a breast, why can’t believers and nonbelievers metamorphize into each other? “Kaddish.com” shares the fablelike tone of Englander’s stories, yet here Larry’s transformation leaves you wanting more of the slow psychological process of change, not just the ensuing complications. Little of Larry’s ornery personality peeks through the surface of an overly naïve Shuli, not even those bedrock traits that the most thorough of conversions can’t smooth away. [ “You know when I left Israel? When I wasn’t willing to die there anymore.” Read our interview with Nathan Englander. ] What Shuli carries from the past is regret for his failure to recite Kaddish. And now he’s trapped by the same legalism that freed him. Believing his birthright must be reclaimed, he returns to the now-forbidden internet and discovers in it a paradoxical beauty that in Englander’s hands feels sublime: “All the world’s understanding transformed into waves of light and sound, to modulated impulse and frequency, everyone’s deepest desires broadcast in an ever-expanding and invisible net.” With help from one of his computer-savvy students, Shuli finds an address for the owner of the Kaddish website, and journeys to Jerusalem to find him. Is he a benighted fool embarking on a quixotic quest, or a devoted son fulfilling a religious obligation? In this tender, wry and entertaining novel, Englander nimbly juggles these possibilities, creating an endearing hero who stumbles through a world in which the holy and profane are intertwined.",The New York Times
2019,‘Little Woods’ Review: Life Is Thicker Than Blood,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The actress Tessa Thompson emotionally expands “Little Woods,” turning a small movie into something more than its textured parts. She plays Ollie, short for Oleander, a daughter in mourning for a mother who has recently died. Junk clutters the yard of the modest North Dakota house they shared; inside it’s clean and homey, though scattered with the evidence of a brutal illness. Ollie still sleeps on the floor of her mother’s room, clinging to a past — and a caretaker identity — that threatens to become a prison. Much of the story takes place while Ollie is striving to set her life right. Shortly after the elliptical opener — a time-blurring grabber of a scene that soon finds her racing away from an oncoming truck — the movie settles into the difficult now. Ollie is barely squeezing out a living selling coffee and food to oil workers, which isn’t enough to deal with the foreclosure notice on her door. She’s estranged from her sister, Deb (a miscast Lily James), who has a young boy and troubles of her own. (Ollie was adopted, a detail that’s casually shared.) The sturdiest presence in Ollie’s life is her probation officer (Lance Reddick), a benevolent paternal figure who’s an overly neat script contrivance. The writer-director Nia DaCosta, making her feature debut, efficiently sets the bleak scene with striking landscapes, a wandering camera and desaturated palette. She also sticks in one too many pretty faces, which stand out amid the area’s ominous desolation, its industrial sites and penumbral rooms, bare trees and gray skies. (The movie was mostly shot in Texas.) These faces can be distracting and would be more so without Ollie, a focal point that holds the center amid the warring personalities, escalating drama and larger injustices. Here, in a region burbling with oil, people grapple with predatory banks as well as inadequate health care that once led Ollie to smuggle drugs from Canada. DaCosta is better at setting scenes than digging into them. She’s mapped out a realistic, coherent world, complete with casual race relations and everyday complications that get busier once Ollie and Deb reconcile. Deb opens the story further, as does her volcanic ex (James Badge Dale) and a threatening dealer (Luke Kirby). Each sister gets story time, but only Ollie’s consistently holds you, including during the tale’s quotidian lulls. Thompson’s soft, open face — which tenses into watchfulness that can border on panic — conveys much about Ollie, her decency and burdens. Thompson lets you see her character’s struggle, even when the movie simplifies its tough ethical questions. If some of this sounds familiar it’s because “Little Woods” owes a debt to Debra Granik’s 2010 drama “Winter’s Bone,” which is a fine model. Each movie pivots on a young resilient woman on a journey (inner and outer) that takes her over occasionally forsaken locales while hauling heavy personal baggage, including needy relatives and drug-driven traumas. “Winter’s Bone” is often best remembered as Jennifer Lawrence’s breakthrough. But what resonates most strongly is Granik’s worldview. She has a feeling for hard people partly shaped by often-unforgiving circumstances, yet she never succumbs to meanness in her telling, an ethic that DaCosta also shares here. Both “Little Woods” and “Winter’s Bone” exist on a continuum with other regional, independent movies about essentially alone women who navigate a world not altogether of their making, whether they’re scratching out a legal living or breaking the law. Part of what ties together these sometimes very different movies (like Victor Nunez’s “Ruby in Paradise” and Courtney Hunt’s “Frozen River”) is that by complicating the idea of who gets to be the hero of the story, they also complicate the idea of female sovereignty. In “Little Woods,” men cling to the edges, sometimes viciously and impotently, yet without overwhelming the movie. They’re part of Ollie’s life, but they are also not its point.

2019,‘Little’ Review: Too Much Caution and Not Enough Regina Hall,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “Little” is about what happens when an adult woman (Regina Hall) is punished for her bullying, vainglorious ways by turning into her 13-year-old self (Marsai Martin). As the premise for a comedy, this kind of body switch is just about foolproof. “Big,” “13 Going on 30,” the several variations on the “Freaky Friday” theme — it’s almost always fun to watch grown-up souls inhabiting immature physiques, and vice versa. And so it is here, even if this go-round leaves a lot of potential hilarity on the table. One unfortunate byproduct of the way the conceit is handled here is that Hall vanishes for most of the movie. She plays Jordan Sanders, a one-time middle-school nerd who is now the founder, C.E.O. and horrible boss of an Atlanta tech company. Jordan terrorizes all her employees — banning carbs from the office; yelling at everyone; singling out some for verbal or physical humiliation — but reserves her worst for her assistant, April (Issa Rae). Rae, the creator and star of “Insecure” on HBO, plays a version of Issa Dee, her character on that series. Sputtering and high-strung, April tiptoes up to the edge of self-assertion, and then falls backward into a familiar pit of shame, self-doubt and frustration. Jordan is the opposite, and Hall makes her less a monster than a winner enjoying her victory a little too much. “Little,” directed by Tina Gordon from a screenplay she wrote with Tracy Oliver, disapproves of her behavior, but can’t resist admiring her as well. Not just because she prospered in spite of youthful obstacles, but also because she’s funnier, smarter and more charismatic than the people around her. She’s Regina Hall, in other words, fresh from her performance as the best boss in the world in “Support the Girls.” Her gleeful alpha act here feels like fair compensation for the nonsense she had to put up with in that film. But as I said, she evaporates too soon. Not that the arrival of Martin in her place is cause for disappointment. If you’ve seen this amazing young actress as the scary twin on “black-ish,” you know to be afraid, and her impersonation of a self-confident 38-year-old woman coping with the insult of being treated like a middle-school student is flawless. The same can’t be said for “Little” itself, I’m afraid. Like many big-screen comedies these days, it errs on the side of caution rather than outrageousness. The few instances of racially conscious humor are about style rather than power, and there are other zones of contemporary experience where the movie chooses not to go. There’s nothing wrong with that, necessarily — jokes don’t always need to be abrasive or topical — except that the movie isn’t quite silly enough either. Once April takes on child-care duties, there are a handful of slapstick set pieces (she and young Jordan tangle in the school parking lot, perform impromptu Mary J. Blige karaoke in a fancy restaurant, ogle a hot eighth-grade teacher played by Justin Hartley) but never the full zaniness that the actors deserve. And the inevitable sentimental journey into lesson-learning gets lost in swamps of well-meaning equivocation. Young Jordan befriends a trio of middle-school misfits, and teaches them about either the joys of hard-won wealth or the importance of being true to yourself, or something. In turn, she comes to grasp the importance of being nice as well as rich and powerful. Meanwhile April gains self-confidence. But not too much of it. Or something. But if the story is a mess, the performers — as is also customary in movie comedy — save the day and the protect the investment. They are helped enormously by the costume designer (Danielle Hollowell), who concocts outfits that look like sleek diva-wear on Hall, dress-up clothes on Martin and trying-way-too-hard ensembles on Rae. All three women look terrific as well as ridiculous. Which may be part of the problem. “Little” is overly protective of its characters and its audience; it’s soothing rather than sharp. That’s most likely because of an anxious concern for grown-up sensitivities. Smart 13-year-olds are likely to roll their eyes as well as laugh.

2019,‘Long Day’s Journey Into Night’ Review: A Mesmerizing Chain of Associations,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Midnight movies are no longer the attraction they were back in the late ’70s and early ’80s. This sometimes seems like a shame. “Long Day’s Journey Into Night,” the second feature by the Chinese director Bi Gan (whose 2016 debut “Kaili Blues” made an impression in art houses the world over), would make exemplary late-night communal viewing. Very often, and particularly in its second half, watching it feels like dreaming with your eyes open. This is not just because of the imagery, which, in the first half, is heavy with depictions of water — raining on windshields and inside musty rooms, rippling in puddles, trickling in a tear down a character’s cheek. The narrative that engulfs the movie’s male protagonist Luo Hongwu (Huang Jue) is replete with elements of film noir. There’s a photo with a phone number on the back, hidden behind the back plate of a wall clock. There’s a mysterious woman in a green dress (Tang Wei, of “Lust, Caution”) who frequently asks for a light for her cigarettes. There’s a past filled with secrets. “I might never have gone back to Kaili had my father not died,” Luo says in voice-over early in the film. If that’s not an invitation to a dark, fatalistic journey, I don’t know what is. However, Bi Gan’s film elides actual plot elements far more than it articulates them. It’s almost as if the point is to compel the viewer to ask, “Am I missing something?” You are — and you aren’t. The movie’s second half, presented in often-startling 3-D, pulls together many of the peculiar threads dropped in prior scenes. But not in a conventional fashion. This cinematic journey is all about subterranean associations. The movie’s English-language title derives from Eugene O’Neill’s play, but almost nothing in it has a direct relation to O’Neill’s modes of content or dramaturgy. (Its Mandarin Chinese title translates to “Last Evenings on Earth,” the name of a novel by Roberto Bolaño, and it’s the same deal there.) But both halves of the movie are virtual compendiums of references to the filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky. Visual allusions to “Ivan’s Childhood,” “Andrei Rublev” and “Stalker” are carried off beautifully, but do little more than affirm Bi Gan’s aesthetic principles — or, to put it more colloquially, give you a look inside his head. Not since David Lynch’s “Inland Empire” has a filmmaker in such proximity to what we can call the independent mainstream undertaken quite as radical a challenge to linear narrative. And the achievement is all the more awe-inspiring given that the movie’s second half, a 3-D film-within-a-film (of sorts; it could just be Luo’s dream of one) is contained within what seems to be a single continuous shot of nearly an hour in length. What could be more linear than that? And yet its various components defy logical arrangement both as viewed and in retrospect. What they build up to is even more seductive than anything that led up to it — a moment of breathtaking romanticism that’s as intoxicating as it is unexpected.

2019,‘Mary Magdalene’ Review: A Revision in Need of Revision,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. In much of popular culture, Mary Magdalene is portrayed as a temptress who found piety after Jesus delivered her from a stoning. This new movie, directed by Garth Davis from a script by Helen Edmundson and Philippa Goslett, is a revisionist depiction that lines up with recent historical scholarship about her, calling her an “apostle of the apostles.” Unfortunately, it’s a confused and frequently enervating effort. The Mary of this picture is slight, pale, quiet and modest. Rooney Mara, the lead actress, conveys these four qualities seemingly without trying. We first see Mary working a field, then providing midwife services. She is a valued member of her Judaea community, but she has an unsatisfied spiritual yearning that others find alienating. Then along comes Jesus, played by Joaquin Phoenix. Phoenix is a remarkable actor, especially good at containing stressed-out intensities. But some states seem beyond his grasp. Beatitude would appear to be one of them. When he goes for it, he projects a spaced-out air that’s a little cult-leaderish. Which may be his point — not that the movie actually presents a wholly consistent perspective. The script often stresses the political struggles of Jesus’s time, and posits the apostles Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Judas (Tahar Rahim) as, besides seekers of the kingdom of heaven, determined anti-Roman activists. In this narrative, Mary is the only follower who truly “gets” Jesus. But because the movie is so apprehensive about the subject of Christ’s supposed divinity, the ultimate gist of what she alone understands never comes across. “Mary Magdalene” dutifully telegraphs the nobility and compassion of its title character while remaining noncommittal about everything else in its path.

2019,‘Master Z: Ip Man Legacy’ Review: A Martial Arts Master Roams Free,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The 2010 movie “Ip Man,” starring the charismatic and ferociously skillful Donnie Yen, put a little spring in the step of the martial arts picture, both artistically and commercially. Hence, there have been a whole lot of “Ip Man” movies since. Some feature Yen, some don’t. This one has him on board as a producer only, and it’s a lively, fun one. Ip Man himself was a real martial arts master of the Wing Chun style who trained Bruce Lee, among others. This movie’s lead character, Cheung Tin-chi, is based on an actual person who was so thoroughly fictionalized in “Ip Man 3” (2016) that here he can roam free in a made-up story set in a fanciful period Hong Kong. Played with quiet charisma and notably high cheekbones by Max Zhang, Cheung has renounced fighting and runs a small grocery while looking after his young son. (That he’s a single dad is practically a given in this genre.) After running afoul of an opium den proprietor, he’s back to jumping and kicking and smashing. He is soon up against a gang leader who’s trying to go legit (Michelle Yeoh, in fine fettle) and a Western restaurateur with a secret (Dave Bautista, acquitting himself well), among others. Directed by Yuen Woo-ping, the 74-year-old stunt and choreography master who brought his fight mojo to “The Matrix,” “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” and both volumes of “Kill Bill,” “Master Z” does a lot of things you hope it will — mainly in serving up inventive fight sequences. It also doesn’t do a few things that you hope it won’t, like serve up Cheung’s young son as a life-endangered prop.

For Now.,"Strategies UnitedHealth Group has been a stock market darling for much of the past decade, dependably churning out earnings increases and rewarding shareholders with staggering returns. Its latest quarterly report, issued on Tuesday, was superb, as expected. Earnings per share jumped 24 percent. Based on the news about the diversified health service company’s fundamental businesses, you might have expected its stock price to rise. Nope. UnitedHealth’s share price dropped 4 percent that day and almost 2 percent the next. And, along with much of the health care sector, it has been on a downward trend for the past few months. What’s wrong with the stock? It has nothing to do with the company’s short-term profit outlook, which is splendid. But like other health care companies, UnitedHealth is confronting a major political problem: the ascendance of “Medicare for All” as a lodestar for the Democratic Party. Medicare for All isn’t a new idea. It may be defined, basically, as universal health insurance under a single government-run, taxpayer-financed plan. It would certainly alter, and probably limit, the role of private health insurance companies like UnitedHealth. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has supported the idea for years. But it wasn’t much of an issue for investors because it never went anywhere in Congress. Now, however, Mr. Sanders is the front-runner among the announced aspirants for the Democratic presidential nomination. What’s more, he appears to have moved the entire political conversation into territory that is exceedingly uncomfortable for health care companies. When he introduced a new version of his Medicare for All legislation in the Senate on April 10, the stock market noticed that his co-sponsors included at least four Senate Democrats who are also running for president: Kirstin Gillibrand of New York, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California. It’s far too early to divine whether Medicare for All — particularly a version that bans or severely limits private insurance — has even a modest chance of coming into existence after the 2020 election. Even now, amid all the hoopla, the odds may not be propitious. The current Democratic leaders in Congress — Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, and Nancy Pelosi of California, the House speaker — have not supported it. President Trump and Republican leaders in Congress have been demanding a smaller government role in health care, not a larger one. And the giant health care companies, which have enormous wealth and influence, are, for the most part, committed to blocking the idea. But that hasn’t stopped the stock market from acting as though Medicare for All were just around the corner. In a note to clients on Wednesday, Stephen Tanal, a Goldman Sachs analyst, said that fear of government intervention would probably weigh on health care share prices “perhaps until the presidential election itself.” Because many of the companies’ current business models are solid, he added: “It seems likely to us that the trough should occur well before the November 2020 election — assuming, of course, that the market likes the ‘signposts’ that occur between now and then — specifically, in this case, the ‘spot’ probability of single-payer policy that would actually ban the sale of private health insurance.” For the moment, though, as Democratic candidates embrace Medicare for All, the stock market is shunning health insurance companies like UnitedHealth, Anthem, Centene, Cigna and Humana. Hospital groups like Tenet Healthcare and HCA Healthcare have been caught in the downturn, too, under the assumption that their revenue could be squeezed if the federal government is the country’s “single payer.” Comments by David Wichmann, UnitedHealth’s chief executive, during an earnings call on Tuesday, appear to have focused market attention on the issue, which made matters worse. He began his prepared remarks to Wall Street analysts with a direct attack on Medicare for All. “The wholesale disruption of American health care being discussed in some of these proposals would surely jeopardize the relationship people have with their doctors, destabilize the nation’s health system, and limit the ability of clinicians to practice medicine at their best,” he said. “And the inherent cost burden would surely have a severe impact on the economy and jobs, all without fundamentally increasing access to care.” After his remarks, the company’s shares plunged, and the decline spread to other companies. Data from Bespoke Investment Group shows that the damage to health care stocks became much more acute on Tuesday and Wednesday. On those days, according to Bespoke, the health care sector, dominated by UnitedHealth, underperformed the S&P 500 by its widest margin since April 2009. Investors’ aversion to health care stocks was far greater than it was for any other market sector, using a common measure: the degree to which its share price has dropped below its 50-day moving average. The difference, or spread, between the market’s aversion to health care stocks, the most-hated sector, and its attraction to financial services, the most-loved, was extraordinarily wide. The polarization was greater than it has been for 99.93 percent of all trading days in the American stock market since the start of 1990, Bespoke found. When such extremes in market sentiment have occurred in the past, the depressed sector has rarely bounced back quickly, Paul Hickey, a Bespoke founder, said in an interview. “When momentum is this extreme, it often takes some time to recover,” he said. A Bloomberg article compared the rout in health care stocks to the “‘Dark Days’ of the Financial Crisis,” when, in addition to the crisis afflicting the overall stock market, the sector grappled with uncertainty over what, eventually, became the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare. But as I’ve written, the Affordable Care Act turned out to be a boon for managed care companies, which profited handsomely despite continuing to gripe about the government’s expanded role. In the 10 years through March, for example, UnitedHealth’s shares returned 1,345 percent, including dividends, dwarfing the 376 percent total return for the S&P 500. UnitedHealth trailed Apple’s total return of 1,593 percent and Amazon’s, 2,649 percent, but it was far better than Google (now a unit of Alphabet) at 596 percent. At some point, stocks that fly that high simply drop in value. For health care stocks, this may just be one of those times. But if profits for major health care companies remain strong, as expected, their share prices could begin to stabilize. And if the presidential cycle starts to shift in their favor, they could resume their path upward. It’s even possible that many health care companies, which already do extensive government business, could find ways of prospering under some version of Medicare for All, especially one that reserves a substantial role for private companies. It has been an awful stretch for health care stocks. But it would be foolish to underestimate the companies’ ability to adapt under duress and to ultimately profit, no matter who is in power.",The New York Times
2019,‘Memory Boxes’ Offer Poignant Reminders of Afghan Lives Lost to Violence,"Kabul Dispatch KABUL, Afghanistan — A brother’s sandals. A flag of Afghanistan. A daughter’s favorite toy. These are some of the remnants of lives lost to violence. The prosaic belongings, collected in handmade wooden containers, are displayed in the frigid basement of a house in Kabul. They are the possessions of the dead, lovingly preserved by family members of Afghans killed during the past 40 years of conflict. An exhibition of these everyday items — from scarves and robes to teacups and poems — seeks to memorialize a tiny fraction of the hundreds of thousands of civilians who have died violently since 1979 in Afghanistan, a country that rarely pauses to remember its victims. Each so-called memory box includes a narrative composed by loved ones about the life lost, making each tragedy personal. “We want the story written by the victims themselves,” said Hadi Marifat, director of the Afghanistan Center for Memory and Dialogue, where the exhibition, which opened in February, is housed. [For more stories about the experiences and costs of war, sign up for the weekly At War newsletter.] Countless Afghan families have been shattered by violence, but the civilian dead are often forgotten and forsaken by everyone but their closest relatives, even as combatants — warlords, commanders, fighters — are lionized as martyrs in billboards and posters. An exhibition label suggested these civilian victims have endured a “double catastrophe” — a violent death, followed by public erasure. For victims’ families, the memory boxes are expressions of both grief and healing. One of the 36 boxes on display belongs to Kabal Shah, whose brother was killed by a suicide bomber in 2016. The ambulance driver who delivered the body to Mr. Shah asked for the new sneakers the dead man wore that day. In his grief, Mr. Shah obliged. He regretted that decision when he was first asked to build a memory box. But he had saved his brother’s favorite sandals, and that proved good enough. “I wanted to make sure that my brother’s memory is preserved,” Mr. Shah said. “I want people to see what happened to my country — who we have lost and how painful it is.” Another box contained a letter smuggled from prison in 1979 inside a hollow toothpaste tube, written in tiny script on cigarette pack paper: “I am still alive.” The prisoner who wrote it, Dawood Sharif, was executed a month later. A pink toy dressing table cherished by an 8-year-old girl, Saima, was inside another box. She was killed by a suicide bomber in Kabul in 2015. Her father, Mohammad Musa, wrote of his efforts to locate her remains. A nearby box featured a shirt and belt that belonged to Hikmatullah, 28, and Asadullah, 15, brothers killed in 2016 by a suicide bomber at a social justice rally in Kabul. Their mother, Maryam Shafayee, wrote that she had begged her sons not to attend, but gave them a bag of dried fruit to sustain them. She received the bag, unopened, after her sons’ bodies were recovered. “I always wish I had been killed with them,” Ms. Shafayee wrote. The memory boxes are displayed in glass cases in an unheated, subterranean expanse under harsh lights, subjecting visitors to physical discomfort as they read family members’ heartbreaking accounts. Above the displays are photographs of the dead. A written timeline snakes across whitewashed walls — a chronicle of misery that catalogs four distinct eras of violence, from the Soviet invasion in 1979, through the civil wars that followed, to the grinding coalition war against the Taliban, now in its 18th year. Embedded in the timeline are the names of 8,450 people who lost their lives to suicide bombers, assassins, weapons of war and unknown gunmen. That figure is a small fraction of the total victims of violence spanning 40 years. Over the past decade alone, 32,000 Afghan civilians have died, according to the United Nations. The nameless victims of mass killings are also commemorated at the exhibition. A map of Afghanistan shaped from dried mud and clay is dotted with tiny pins representing 19 confirmed mass graves — red flags for those from the communist era and black for the mujahedeen and Taliban periods. In the exhibition, there is also a tower built from scorched robes, scarves, shoes and backpacks — residue recovered from several bomb attacks that indiscriminately targeted civilians. “You can still smell the dried blood,” said Fatima Alavy, who works at the center. The center received funding from the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission. Sima Samar, the director of the commission and a medical doctor, has her own story of violence to tell. She said her husband, Abdul Ghafoor Sultani, was kidnapped in 1979 by agents of the Soviet-backed government at the time. She never saw him again. The couple’s son vowed at age 5 to avenge his father’s death, Dr. Samar said. The boy cut the eyes out of newspaper photographs of government officials he blamed for his father’s kidnapping. Her adult son no longer seeks vengeance, Dr. Samar said. But she said she feared the country would never recover as long as Afghans seek conflict and retribution rather than healing and reconciliation. “Everyone is so focused on fighting and trying to stay safe that the victims are ignored,” Dr. Samar said. “They deserve respect and acknowledgment for their suffering.” Inside the exhibition room, Nilofar Bayat, 26, described the rocket attack that struck her home in 1994, killing her brother, Assad Bayat, 13, and leaving her at age 2 with permanent spinal cord damage. Most of her brother’s possessions were damaged, she said, but she recovered his school notebook for her memory box. “I want people to see the person I lost — to know who he was,” Ms. Bayat said. “I have never forgotten what happened. I don’t want anyone else to forget, either.” A few feet way, Sima Dawlatshahi, 65, spoke of her husband and son, killed 32 years apart. Her husband, Mohammad Yunos, was kidnapped in 1984 and never seen again. Ms. Dawlatshahi said she was pregnant at the time with the couple’s son, Ahmad Sharif. In 2016, Ahmad died at 32 in a suicide bombing. His wife was pregnant with the couple’s daughter, Ms. Dawlatshahi said. She sobbed as she described selecting possessions for her memory box. Soon those listening to her were weeping, too. Through her tears, Ms. Dawlatshahi spoke of the lasting legacy of her husband and son, now enshrined in her memory box, which includes her husband’s favorite books and her son’s birth certificate. “If people see this box and know of their goodness, my heart will be at peace,” she said.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Missing Link’ Review: Lovely Animation, but Lacking Inspiration","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. It’s fitting that “Missing Link,” which concerns a lovable creature a step behind on the evolutionary ladder, has been made with stop-motion animation, the painstaking process by which models and puppets are photographed to create the illusion of movement. In form and content, it’s a movie about fighting obsolescence. The perfection of the computer animation would simply be wrong. All hail Laika, then, for making a movie in which it’s a pleasure to ponder the sharpened contours of a pointy schnoz or the tufts of an animal’s fur, which, in the case of Mr. Link (voiced by Zach Galifianakis), as the gentle simian man comes to be known, resembles hair-colored plumage. The imagery is not nearly as eccentric or demented as that in Laika’s “Coraline,” probably the studio’s high-water mark. But even so, the sculpting gives the characters a tactility that lines of coding have not yet matched, and the jerkiness of the movement — only slight in this case — affords the film a warm, organic feel. The evident care put into the film’s design has not, alas, been matched with similar inventiveness in storytelling. Directed by Chris Butler (“ParaNorman,” with Sam Fell), “Missing Link” is a throwback in more ways than one, with a plot that tips its hat to Victorian literature, frontier town westerns and a 1930s creation, Shangri-La. Sir Lionel Frost (voiced by Hugh Jackman) is a quixotic adventurer who longs for acceptance from a stuffy British geographical society. In the opening sequence, he and a put-upon assistant try to capture evidence of the Loch Ness monster. Frost makes the mistake of relying on one of those newfangled photographic cameras. Never mind, though, for a letter soon summons him on a new expedition to Washington State, where he encounters the talking Mr. Link, who wants to track down his surviving relatives. There are funny running jokes involving the eight-foot Mr. Link’s proportions — a poor fit for a barstool, a train and a plaid suit — and his habit of taking all of Frost’s pronouncements literally. Over the course of their travels they team up with Adelina Fortnight (Zoe Saldana), the brassy widow of one of Frost’s colleagues, and are pursued by an assassin (Timothy Olyphant), hired to kill Frost by his rival (Stephen Fry). The setup is satisfactory. The payoff is somewhat less so, especially once the film begins dealing in platitudes about friendship and the action moves to the Himalayas. The icy land of lost yetis proves, visually, a lot less exciting than the more intricately art-directed details of human civilization. (Emma Thompson, as the queen of that hidden enclave, gets in a few biting lines.) What’s missing from the movie, for all its technical skill, is simply inspiration — that extra touch of wit or imagination that might elevate it from a pleasant diversion to a rare sighting.

2019,"‘Monkey, Rat and Pig DNA’: How Misinformation Is Driving the Measles Outbreak Among Ultra-Orthodox Jews","Handbooks distributed in some Jewish communities in New York, as well as messages on hotlines, contradict the scientific consensus that vaccines are safe and highly effective. [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] “The Vaccine Safety Handbook” appears innocuous, a slick magazine for parents who want to raise healthy children. But tucked inside its 40 pages are false warnings that vaccines cause autism and contain cells from aborted human fetuses. “It is our belief that there is no greater threat to public health than vaccines,” the publication concludes, contradicting the scientific consensus that vaccines are generally safe and highly effective. The handbook, created by a group called Parents Educating and Advocating for Children’s Health, or Peach, is targeted at ultra-Orthodox Jews, whose expanding and insular communities are at the epicenter of one of the largest measles outbreaks in the United States in decades. On Tuesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a public health emergency in parts of Brooklyn in an effort to contain the spread of measles in ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods there. He said unvaccinated individuals would be required to receive the measles vaccine — or be subjected to a fine — as the city escalated its campaign to stem the outbreak. Peach’s handbook — with letters signed by rabbis and sections like “Halachic Points of Interest” — has become one of the main vehicles for misinformation among ultra-Orthodox groups, including Hasidim. Its message is being shared on hotlines and in group text messages. “Vaccines contain monkey, rat and pig DNA as well as cow-serum blood, all of which are forbidden for consumption according to kosher dietary law,” Moishe Kahan, a contributing editor for Peach magazine, said in an email. Vaccines are often grown in a broth of animal cells, but the final product is highly purified. Most prominent ultra-Orthodox rabbis agree that vaccines are kosher, and urge observant Jews to be immunized. Still, from enclaves in suburban Rockland County to the bustling streets of Brooklyn’s Borough Park neighborhood, fliers tell the Hasidim to be skeptical of immunizations. On a recent Sunday evening, a four-hour conference call promoted to ultra-Orthodox families — with call-in numbers for a variety of countries — offered advice from speakers who were presented as experts in vaccine science. The anti-vaccine movement goes beyond the confines of the ultra-Orthodox community. There are thriving and growing pockets of vaccine opponents across the country that span ideological boundaries: In Washington State, some liberal communities shun vaccinations while conservative populations in Texas also oppose them. In New York’s ultra-Orthodox community, the anti-vaccine movement has no clear public leader. Jewish leaders have said its message has spread through grass-roots activism and has found a foothold largely because many Hasidim have limited access to the internet or rigorous scientific research. By some estimates, there are approximately 300,000 ultra-Orthodox Jews in New York; most live in Brooklyn’s Williamsburg and Borough Park neighborhoods and in Rockland County. The majority of ultra-Orthodox Jews emphatically say they would never go against the advice of doctors, and health officials say most Hasidim are vaccinated. “I don’t understand anyone that doesn’t vaccinate,” Abe Kornbluh said as he stood at the front of Bleu, his restaurant on 13th Avenue in Borough Park. But there have been dozens of sick children whose parents have hidden their measles diagnoses from the public. And as public officials have scrambled to curtail the highly contagious disease, groups like Peach, whose members are mostly anonymous and are supported by national anti-vaccine organizations, have only intensified their messaging. Many of the vaccine skeptics cloak their rhetoric with scientific language, as did the speakers on the recent conference call. The call, which was advertised on fliers and accessible to anyone with the call-in number, told participants its goal was to “create an intelligent discussion about what we are putting into our children.” It featured speakers who were rabbis, doctors and lawyers, all of whom touted postgraduate degrees as they downplayed the dangers of measles and questioned the efficacy of vaccines. A Hasidic mother who lives in Rockland County and participated in the call told The New York Times that none of her three children were vaccinated, and all of them recently had measles. The woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, said that she did not report the cases to doctors and that the children recovered in a matter of days. “The body is not a machine,” she said. “The body is something that reacts to toxins in certain ways. I’ve heard firsthand of cases of SIDS after children getting a vaccine,” she added, referring to sudden infant death syndrome. Many studies have concluded that vaccines do not cause SIDS. The measles outbreak began in New York in October, after ultra-Orthodox Jews had returned from Israel where they were celebrating Sukkot, a Jewish harvest festival. They had prayed at the Western Wall, eaten in sukkahs and vacationed in the warm weather. But Israel was in the midst of a monthslong outbreak, and health officials have said that several unvaccinated children came home with the virus. As doctors confirmed the first cases in New York, health officials and Jewish leaders rushed to stop the spread of the disease, which the United States had declared eradicated in 2000. Fliers that emphasized the importance of vaccinations were dispersed. Health experts organized meetings with Jewish pediatricians, and thousands of doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (M.M.R.) vaccine were dispensed. The majority of ultra-Orthodox rabbis said they, too, urged vaccination, citing religious scripture about protecting one’s health and the health of others. But all of that has not been enough to persuade vaccine skeptics. Yosef Rapaport, a Hasidic journalist in Borough Park who has written about the importance of vaccination, said parents who do not want to immunize their children will seek rabbinical counsel that aligns with their views. “You make up your mind and then try to find the interpretation in the Talmud,” he said. “You can always find some rabbi who will express doubt.” Dr. Aaron Glatt, an infectious disease specialist who is also an ordained rabbi on Long Island, says he has explicitly pushed back on misinformation about the dangers of vaccines. He has emphasized to his patients and congregants that measles is spread by the unvaccinated and can be deadly, especially for infants under 6 months old and people with compromised immune systems, who cannot get vaccines. “Unfortunately, we are not immune to anti-vax people,” Dr. Glatt said. “They’re found in every community, in every religion, and unfortunately, they’re vocal.” Dr. Yakov Kiffel, a pediatrician in Monsey in Rockland County, said that he has both vaccinated children and treated about a half-dozen patients with measles since the fall. He said the majority of the sick were under 6 months old — the age at which a child can be given the first dose of the M.M.R. vaccine — and members of families that said they vaccinate. More than 400 measles cases have been confirmed in New York since October, and the majority of them have been among Hasidim. In the past week, according to the Centers for Disease Control, there were 60 new cases reported in New York City. Nine new cases were confirmed in Rockland County, which last month took the extraordinary step of barring children who were not vaccinated against measles from public places. A judge ruled against the order on Friday, temporarily lifting the ban. In the city, officials have prohibited unvaccinated children from attending schools in certain ZIP codes, predominantly in Williamsburg and Borough Park — an effort that has met mixed success. Some Hasidim have said that longstanding tension between members of the ultra-Orthodox community and the government have made them wary of officials’ efforts to contain the outbreak. The past persecution of the Jewish people is still a factor, they said. And more recently, quarrels with secular leaders over a circumcision ritual that has transmitted fatal herpes infections to infants and the government’s oversight of ultra-Orthodox Jewish private schools known as yeshivas have only soured relations. Some Hasidic parents also blame the absence of science education in yeshivas. “The lack of a comprehensive secular education has raised a generation of some parents who do not appreciate modern science and do not have trust in the health system,” said Dov Bleich, a Hasidic father of two who lives in Monsey and emphasized that most rabbis are supportive of vaccines. “It’s leaving them vulnerable to the anti-vaccine crusade.” Blima Marcus, a nurse practitioner at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, is one of the many health care providers trying to counter that crusade. Ms. Marcus, the former president of the Orthodox Jewish Nurses Association, said her work began last fall after a relative included her in a text message with nearly 40 ultra-Orthodox mothers in Lakewood, N.J. The majority of the women had not vaccinated their children, she said, but many began to reconsider that decision once she presented them with facts. But Ms. Marcus acknowledged that her efforts are too limited to have a significant impact on the outbreak. On Friday, rabbis met in Brooklyn to consider a proposal that would require all Hasidim to be vaccinated in order to attend synagogues and yeshivas. After the meeting, anti-vaccine organizers sent a robocall to Hasidic homes, urging people to persuade their rabbis not to support the measure. Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the co-inventor of a rotavirus vaccine, said people often do not understand the severity of diseases that have been eradicated by vaccines. “Vaccines have been a victim of their own success,” Dr. Offit said. “What upsets me is we haven’t learned from history,” he added. “What history teaches us is that measles is a killer, and vaccines can eliminate this killer, but now because of our ignorance we have to see children suffer.” Still, opponents of vaccination ardently maintain that diseases like measles are not dangerous. “The adverse events from getting measles, they’re very, very, very low,” Dr. Lawrence Palevsky, a pediatrician in New York, said on the recent conference call. There have been no reported deaths in New York State linked to the recent outbreak. But measles killed 110,000 people globally in 2017, according to the World Health Organization. In New York, people like Shoshana Bernstein, a Hasidic mother in Monsey, worry about the potentially deadly consequences of listening to anti-vaccine proponents like Dr. Palevsky. “A basic Jewish tenet that every Jewish child is raised on, is love your friend like yourself,” Ms. Bernstein said. “This is woven into the very fabric of who we are, which is why the current situation is extremely frustrating because it is the complete opposite of our essence as Jewish people.” Follow Tyler Pager on Twitter: @tylerpager.",The New York Times
2019,‘Naples in Veils’: A Morgue Doctor Is Obsessed. The Movie Is Lifeless.,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. It’s clear why filmmakers can’t resist the allure of Alfred Hitchcock even if they inevitably fall short of him. But his imitators rarely come up with movies as pointless as “Naples in Veils,” which tips its hat vigorously toward the master’s motifs — the lost-and-found doubling of “Vertigo,” the repressed trauma of “Marnie,” possibly even Salvador Dalí’s eye design from “Spellbound” — only to wind up as a tedious muddle. Adriana (Giovanna Mezzogiorno), a pathologist in Naples who is shy with men, has a one-night stand with Andrea (Alessandro Borghi), a much younger diver. The sex is rendered with a level of detail that seems more suited to a Euro-art remake of “Fifty Shades of Grey” than a Hitchcock riff — but then again, it’s supposed to become an obsession for Adriana. They make plans to meet at a museum the next day, except Andrea doesn’t show up. Or rather, he has shown up dead in a nearby dumpster, something Adriana learns soon after starting an autopsy on his corpse. But then she spots him, alive, in a subway station. And in her garden. And did we mention that her mother apparently went crazy? Promising ideas are in place; even using as a backdrop a city as rich in history and steeped in Catholicism as Naples might have appealed to Hitch. But the director, Ferzan Ozpetek, hasn’t found a way to bring his borrowed themes together with style, momentum or suspense. Visually and musically, “Naples in Veils” does little to conjure a sensation of passion or delirium. All that’s left, in this case, is a self-nullifying plot.

2019,‘No One Feels Safe Here’: Life in Alabama’s Prisons,"Four men inside diagnose a hellscape the Department of Justice called cruel and unusual. On April 2, the Department of Justice issued a horrifying report on Alabama’s prisons, with graphic accounts of prisoners who were tortured, burned, raped, sodomized, stabbed and murdered in largely unsupervised dorms. (In hundreds of reports of sexual abuse, for example, the investigators did not find a single instance of a guard intervening. Officers are so outnumbered, the report said, that they stay in a secure area rather than patrol.) The report underscored the conditions depicted in more than 2,000 photographs, sent to The New York Times, of violent incidents and contraband inside St. Clair prison northeast of Birmingham. Not only are the prisons bad, the Department of Justice report said, but Alabama has known for years that they are bad, and has made only marginal attempts to improve them. It is not that the prisoners are particularly violent, but that the prisons are understaffed and overcrowded, with some holding two or three times the number of people they were designed for. They are also, the report said, lousy with corruption and rife with drugs, cellphones and large, sharp knives, which many prisoners consider necessary for self-protection. In 2017, inspectors found that not a single building had a working fire alarm. [Read more about the Department of Justice’s findings of “flagrant disregard” for the rights of people in Alabama prisons.] In a matter of days, the Alabama Department of Corrections, now under threat of a federal lawsuit, plans to unveil a new strategic plan. Since the report was issued, three correction officers have been attacked and at least one prisoner has been stabbed. We asked three men sentenced to life without parole — two for murder and one for robbery — and one serving a 28-year sentence for murder to tell us what it was like inside. Together they have served more than 100 years. They asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution. In their letters, which were handwritten because in Alabama, prisoners do not have access to email, they focused on the root causes of the mayhem and expressed skepticism that the department could restore a culture of integrity on its own. Here are excerpts, condensed for length and clarity: While it’s easy to understand and champion the Alabama Department of Corrections’ mandate to protect the public from us, it seems people have a harder time accepting that they have an equally important mandate to protect us from each other. And when they habitually fail to do so because of a fatal combination of indifference and incompetence, that becomes criminal. No one feels safe here. Not the inmates, nor the officers. No one feels safe here when supervisors up to the warden level stand behind the fence of the barricaded, secure area and tell inmates who have fled there looking for protection that they need to go get a knife. No one feels safe here when there are hundreds of inmates roaming around and not an officer in sight. No one can or will answer the uncomfortable questions of why all the veteran officers quit or why the new ones don’t stay. There are many assumptions you could make about who is the least safe here. Young white men are at extreme risk for sexual assault, and white men of all ages are targets to be assaulted and robbed or to have their property stolen. But when it comes to who is least safe, the facts speak for themselves. Time and time again, young black men are the victims of the most violent assaults. Young black men are the most likely to die. The prevailing attitude seems to be that, as they say in the South, when young black men kill young black men it’s just the trash taking out the trash. I’ve never seen so many guys on drugs — I mean cheap drugs that have them falling out and throwing up everywhere, stealing everything they can get their hands on and selling everything they own, and in too many cases it’s their body. Officers allow other inmates to deal with those that wig out because it happens far too often. This has always been the case in prison, it’s only now that people are beginning to pay attention. We didn’t just start dying and getting hurt in prison, there were far, far more rapes 20, 30 and 40 years ago, and the prison administration was well aware of it and society didn’t care. Prison graveyards are filled with bodies buried on top of bodies of men that have been murdered or died of old age or lack of proper medical care since the late 1800s. This is Alabama. Too often you would have to stab, beat down or kill someone to get the point across that you’re not to be [expletive] with, sometimes more than once. The reason I’ve avoided getting stabbed or raped was God, because I wasn’t a killer, not all that smart, and I’ve never been so lucky. Somebody must have really prayed for me, because I didn’t have sense enough to pray for myself as much as I should’ve. Pick out your friends slowly and wisely. Seek out educational programs. Borrow nothing from no one. Don’t make the officers your friends nor enemies. Never overspend on the commissary. Living in prison is expensive. The contracted companies control the phone prices, shoe prices, hygiene and food package prices, medical co-pay and the supply of goods sold at the prison stores and canteens. Most of those prices range from inflated to ridiculous. There is no competition, no other options, no consumer protection. Montgomery is responsible for all economic policy decisions. The only prisoners who get paid here make $3 a day. Institutional job assignments become hustles. Kitchen workers are “paid” in leftovers from meals or in ingredients from stock. Yes, them getting paid in leftovers does create a conflict of interest which results in the population often receiving small food portions. I don’t have time to get into the details of the embezzlement economy, but most workers work to “get paid” out of whatever it is they work with. Tutors and clerks hustle office supplies, dorm cleaners sell cleaning supplies, garbage men get lucky sometimes. It’s not all stealing; most of the goods are “given” by the staff who supervises the workers. It’s part of the prison culture in Alabama. Every prison I’ve been in makes other compromises that would certainly have evangelicals marching in the streets if local Alabama governments were to condone, encourage, and even promote these activities like Alabama prisons do. Without question gambling, sexual relationships and money lending are the biggest hotspots for violence in prison. They all have a connection to the high expense to live in prison and the absence of paying jobs. I see overcrowding as an amplifier and exacerbation of the foundational economic and cultural sources of violence in the prisons. More people means more transactions. More people means less space and more competition for shared resources like TVs, phones, exercise equipment and ice in the summertime. At Limestone in each cell block there are 44 beds in day-space areas that were not designed for people to live. That area is now called “the parking lot.” The difference between living in a cell with one roommate and one toilet and in the parking lot with 43 roommates and three toilets is so great that admin and staff move guys from cells out to the parking lot as punishment for petty offenses like not having your bed properly made. This is just an example of D.O.C. using poor conditions of their own making as a tool. Most of the prison system could be green zones if Montgomery would change its views on a few things like rehabilitation over punishment, human potential over human weakness, and dignity over exploitation. I have both committed assaults against others and have been assaulted. I have behaved outside of rules and within compliance. I have also been stationed at nine different facilities. In my early years of incarceration, the focus of serving time was centered around hard labor and self-help programs with sincere instructors who were not just financially motivated. Both were for the purpose of rehabilitation and building character so that the ex-con can find greater self-worth and develop work habits which enable him to return to society as a productive member. These activities, naturally, became motivation for inmates to behave. These outlets were taken away. Over a short period of time, things that inmates used for years to abate stress and depression were confiscated, visitation privileges were decreased and discouraged, and a different method of behavior modification was implemented. With the subtraction of activities, depression set in like never before.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Oh, Hi There.’ Forest Cam Captures the Secret Lives of Animals.","[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] An hour or so north of New York City, where the skyline is still visible from mountain peaks, bobcats, black bears, rattlesnakes, and turkeys roam. They all thrive in what ecologists call young forest, an ecosystem halfway between grassland and what comes to mind when thinking of a forest. Unfortunately, their landscape is threatened. And virtually the only way to make room for a young forest is to cut down an old one. This is a tough sell in an eco-conscious world. No one wants to see a single tree cut down, let alone an entire woodlands. Ecologists are frustrated. “I blame Dr. Seuss for ‘The Lorax,’” said Michael Burger, the managing director of Audubon New York. But an interactive project that involves counting animals in the young forest has found a way to get through to a skeptical public. Furthermore, it has enlisted said public to help with the work. The project, Canid Camera, asks online volunteers to participate in a census of the young forest. Biologists and undergraduates from the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry have set up camera traps in Putnam and Dutchess Counties in the Hudson Valley and are relying on the volunteers to label the hundreds of thousands of photos snapped by the rigs to get a sense of what animals are there. Users log on to the Canid Camera website and browse through each photo and describe what they see: what animal is in the frame, and how many. The process is hypnotic, like scrolling through an Instagram feed of forest creatures going about their daily lives. So far, thousands of volunteers have labeled 200,000 shots, with a new set of 50,000 to be released this month. The byproduct of this census is to draw volunteers in, which makes the project easier to understand. Young forests were once plentiful across the Northeast, but now they cover only a fraction of their former range. At least 100 species, including cottontail rabbits, foxes, otters and muskrats, are in decline because of its loss. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation has introduced an effort to restore young forest areas, although the goal seems counterintuitive, cutting down forests to make room for new ones. “We can’t rely on Mother Nature to create young forests like she has for every century before this one,” said Amanda Cheeseman, a postdoctoral associate at SUNY-ESF, where she oversees Canid Camera. That’s because the department is unlikely to allow the natural methods like fires and flooding, especially in such a populous region as the Hudson Valley. So to create forest diversity, most biologists maintain that clear-cutting acreage is necessary. Yet despite the endorsement of groups like the Audubon Society to do just this, Mr. Burger said that local residents were attending public meetings and pushing back. Some, worried about climate change, don’t want to see the clearances happen since trees are particularly good at storing carbon. “Their hearts are in the right place,” Mr. Burger said. “But that’s not sustainable forestry.” Studies find that mixed-aged forests make the environment more resilient against pest outbreaks, weather events, even climate change. That’s in addition to sustaining species that do best in young forest areas. And that’s where the camera traps come in. Motion-sensing rigs the size of lunchboxes are attached to trees about a foot and a half off the ground. The traps take a snap anytime something moves, like a family of bears clambering through the frame. But a strong breeze may be enough to trigger it. Once the photos are uploaded, volunteers can click through as many as they care to, choose a label from a premade list of a few dozen options. There is even a field guide with details on how to tell similar species apart, like gray and red squirrels. Individual pictures are screened 15 times before being marked done. For images with conflicting information — three volunteers see a turkey, say, and the rest see a ruffed grouse — Dr. Cheeseman and her interns weigh in. “There is a learning curve,” said William McShea, an ecologist at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, where he helps run eMammal, another camera trap project that relies on volunteers. “People get better at it as they go along.” Those volunteers do get something in return: a sense of being part of a team. They want to see the best images, interact with researchers on tough photos, and learn something. Some projects even include volunteer names on research papers. “They are doing you a favor,” Mr. McShea said. “You have to be giving them feedback. They want to be part of the project.” Not everyone interested in the forest health of the Hudson Valley is a New Yorker. Claire Sylvestre, a web developer who lives in Quebec, may be the leading wildlife spotter on Canid Camera. According to the site’s statistics, she has labeled nearly 45,000 images so far. Ms. Sylvestre, 64, came across Canid Camera after working on another project called Exoplanet Explorers. Some of the favorite photos she’s labeled have been of predators, including a bobcat with a gray squirrel in its mouth or a coyote that had killed a fawn. “Of course, the rarer the animal, the more exciting it is. The holy grail — gray fox — remains elusive,” Ms. Sylvestre said.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Old Town Road,’ Lil Nas X and the Long History of Country-Rap","In the last two weeks, “Old Town Road,” the viral hit by the rapper Lil Nas X, has become a flash point for conversations about what is, isn’t, or might be country music. The track briefly appeared on the Billboard Top Country Songs chart before being removed after it was deemed insufficiently country. (On Friday, Billy Ray Cyrus joined the track on a remix.) The lines are blurry, but this is far from the first time country music and hip-hop have been in dialogue. They’ve been dancing around each other, and sometimes with each other, for more than two decades, whether in the form of deeply Southern rap music, bluegrass-inflected hip-hop, country singers collaborating with rappers or, in some cases, those singers rapping themselves.

2019,‘Once’ Creators Will Reunite for Stage Version of ‘Sing Street’,"Members of the creative team that made “Once” into a Tony Award-winning stage show have a new music-themed movie adaptation on tap: “Sing Street,” based on the 2016 film written and directed by John Carney, will open at New York Theater Workshop next season. The Irish playwright Enda Walsh, who wrote the book for the theatrical adaptation of Mr. Carney’s film “Once,” has written the book for the new show. And Like “Once,” about a busking folk musician, “Sing Street” is also set in Dublin — albeit in the wild-haired mid-1980s. The show, about a teenager who starts a band to impress a girl, will have music and lyrics by Mr. Carney and Gary Clark, who was the frontman of the Scottish pop band Danny Wilson, which got its start around the time that “Sing Street” is set. Rebecca Taichman, who won a Tony Award in 2017 for her production of Paula Vogel’s “Indecent,” is slated to direct. The new musical has big shoes to fill. After a run in Cambridge, Mass., “Once” debuted Off Broadway at New York Theater Workshop in 2011. Transferring to Broadway, the production played 1,167 regular performances and won eight Tony Awards, including best musical, best direction of a musical (for John Tiffany) and best book of a musical, for Mr. Walsh. (His adaptation of the novel “Grief is the Thing With Feathers” just opened at St. Ann’s Warehouse.) The theater’s upcoming season will also include “Sanctuary City,” a new play by Martyna Majok, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 2018 for “Cost of Living.” The play will be directed by Rebecca Frecknall, who is fresh off the success of her London production of Tennessee Williams’s “Summer and Smoke,” which won an Olivier Award earlier this month. “Sanctuary City” centers on a newly naturalized teenager’s decision to marry her undocumented friend. It was originally slated to debut as part of the theater’s 2018-19 season, but subsequently postponed. In an email, the theater cited scheduling conflicts as the reason for the delay. Also featured in the season are “Runboyrun” and “In Old Age,” a pair of plays by Mfoniso Udofia that are part of “The Ufot Cycle,” a series of her plays that focus on a single family in examining the history of Nigerian immigration in America. They will be directed by Loretta Greco and Awoye Timpo. Another pair of plays from the cycle had their New York debuts at New York Theater Workshop in 2016. Two more productions for the theater’s season will be announced at a later date.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Overrun,’ ‘Outbred,’ ‘Replaced’: Why Ethnic Majorities Lash Out Over False Fears","The Interpreter Ask a member of Sri Lanka’s dominant ethnic group why the country seems plagued by racial and religious strife, which is resurging in the wake of terrifying Islamist terrorist attacks, and you will often get the same answer. We are fighting for our very survival, they’ll say. Though the Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhist, make up three-quarters of the population and dominate politics, many see themselves as an embattled minority. “They’re trying to destroy us — please tell someone in the government to take action,” Nelligala Dhammaratne, an influential young monk, recalled his Buddhist followers telling him just before riots broke out against the country’s Muslim minority last year. Such fears are not unique to Sri Lanka. Around the world, dominant majorities increasingly see themselves as imperiled minorities. That dynamic, sometimes known as a majority with a minority complex, is thought to be a major factor in the rise of right-wing populism in Europe, religious nationalism in Asia, and white nationalist terrorism in the United States and New Zealand. The drivers of this trend are often subtler than Sri Lanka’s history of civil war, but can be just as consequential. Demographic change, global interconnectedness and even the rise of democracy can make majorities feel as if their dominance is endangered, leading to fear of — and sometimes attacks on — minorities whose very existence is perceived as an existential threat. There is a classic, cautionary case: Northern Ireland. When communal tensions broke out into the outright fighting known as the Troubles in the late 1960s, Northern Ireland’s Protestants were numerically, politically and economically dominant. But they were a minority on the island as a whole, feeding a sense of demographic peril. “The basic fear of Protestants in Northern Ireland is that they will be outbred by Roman Catholics,” Terence O’Neill, Northern Ireland’s prime minister, said at the conflict’s outbreak. “It is as simple as that.” Others said the Catholics were part of an international plot orchestrated from the Vatican. Sri Lanka’s dynamics bear striking similarities. During its civil war, fought against separatists from the Tamil minority, Sinhalese felt outnumbered because of the large Tamil community in nearby India. This gave many Sinhalese a sense of siege, deepening us-versus-them divides that have outlasted the fighting. More recently, Sinhalese Buddhists have seen Sri Lanka’s Muslim minority as vanguards of a global Muslim horde. Last year, Sinhalese fears that Muslims were seeking to outbreed and replace them culminated in riots. Conspiracies about foreign influence or minority birthrates are often driven by fears of a much more real change: a loss of status. Modern democracy demands that minorities be granted equal rights and opportunities, which can feel like a threat to majorities’ traditional hold on power. Fears of existential, sectarian conflict can be self-realizing. In 1960s Northern Ireland, Catholic civil rights marches, modeled on those of the United States, felt to some Protestants like part of a wider Catholic plot to overrun them. Hard-line Protestants, acting in what they saw as self-defense, whipped up violent counter-protests, culminating in riots on both sides. In response, more Catholics joined violent republican factions, seemingly validating Protestants’ worst fears. The tit-for-tat cycle continued for decades. Long after the peace process, and with Catholics and Protestants now near evenly numbered, a shared perception of being the aggrieved, vulnerable minority persists. So does the cycle of violence. Earlier this month, the journalist Lyra McKee was killed when a member of the New Irish Republican Army fired on the police. The group issued an apology, calling it a mistake. These dynamics are rising globally, and not only when one group is a majority nationally and a minority regionally. Asked in 2013 about Buddhist violence against Myanmar’s Rohingya Muslim minority that would later culminate in genocide, Aung San Suu Kyi, the country’s de facto leader, responded by warning darkly of “global Muslim power.” “The fear is not just on the side of the Muslims, it’s on the side of the Buddhists as well,” she said. Technological change may also play a role in these fears, which are driving a rise in religious nationalism across Asia. The world is more interconnected than it once was, and so feels a lot smaller. Word of any sectarian violence, no matter how far away, spreads rapidly on social media, feeding into perceptions of being threatened and outnumbered. And the rise of democracy, long considered a force for ethnic harmony, may be provoking majority backlashes instead, according to research by Jack Snyder, a Columbia University political scientist. As democracy became the global norm, dominant ethnic groups found themselves under growing pressure to share power with minorities. They even lost the occasional election. Anxiety around losing status can manifest as fears, however unfounded, of becoming outnumbered. In countries with weak institutions, that can lead to violence, possibly contributing to the stall in democracy’s once-rapid spread. “We often see this phenomenon at moments of increasing democratization and increasing enfranchisement,” said Kate Cronin-Furman, a University College London political scientist, citing “horrible violence against the Rohingya breaking out at a time of increased democratization in Burma.” Among supporters of Europe’s right-wing populist parties, it is common to hear fears uncannily similar to those expressed by Sri Lanka’s Sinhalese. Muslims, we hear at rallies for the Alternative for Germany and France’s National Front, will soon outnumber non-Muslims in Europe and impose Shariah law. A leader of Vox, the Spanish far-right party that just won its first Parliamentary seats, warned at a September rally of an “Islamist invasion.” The party supports policies to increase Spanish birthrates. Many whites welcome pluralism and multiculturalism. But for those who see the decline of white dominance as destabilizing, any increase in the minority population is perceived as an attack. A growing body of research suggests that this sentiment may be driving significant political change in the United States, which is projected to become “majority minority” — with whites less than half of the population — by 2050. A study by Maureen Craig of New York University and Jennifer Richeson of Yale University found that white Americans who so much as read a news article on these demographic changes will express “more negative attitudes toward Latinos, blacks, and Asian-Americans” and “more automatic pro-white/anti-minority bias.” The effect disappeared when the authors told participants that whites were expected to remain politically and culturally dominant. Other studies find that when white Americans learn about these demographic trends they become less supportive of immigration, affirmative action, welfare spending and health care spending, and more supportive of military spending and of President Trump. In a 2016 poll, 57 percent of whites said “discrimination against whites is as big a problem today as discrimination against blacks and other minorities.” Whites are subject to the same forces as any other demographic group. Fears of being outnumbered can lead to violence. A rising wave of white-nationalist terrorists repeatedly cite “replacement theory,” in which Jews are said to be orchestrating mass immigration in order to destroy the white race. At the 2017 “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, white power activists chanted “Jews will not replace us” during their torchlit march on the University of Virginia campus. Brenton Tarrant, who murdered 50 people in two Christchurch, New Zealand, mosques, described immigration and low white birthrates as “an assault on the European people that, if not combated, will ultimately result in the complete racial and cultural replacement of the European people.” Last week, a gunman opened fire in a synagogue in Poway, Calif. A document attributed to the shooter echoed the same fear: demographic replacement.",The New York Times
2019,‘Panda Diplomacy’: A $24 Million Zoo Enclosure Angers Some,"COPENHAGEN — It was designed by Bjarke Ingels, the renowned Danish architect, and cost $24 million to build. It was inaugurated by Queen Margrethe II, Denmark’s reigning monarch. And it now accommodates a celebrity couple with peculiar eating habits and an almost year-round animosity toward each other. Welcome to Copenhagen Zoo’s new panda house. Officials at the zoo estimate that the combination of adorable animal starpower and innovative Danish design will draw an additional 400,000 visitors per year. “For such an iconic animal, we needed an iconic setting,” said Bengt Holst, the zoo’s director. “You wouldn’t put the Mona Lisa in an ugly frame.” But not everyone is a fan of the new house, a circular enclosure in the shape of the yin and yang symbol that cost $24 million to build and that has made front-page news in Denmark over the past weeks. Opponents believe the pandas, which are on loan from China under a 15-year agreement requiring the host to pay $1 million annually, will limit Denmark’s willingness to criticize Chinese policy. The campaign to bring the pandas to Copenhagen began in 2010, just after Denmark’s parliament approved a memorandum recognizing China’s sovereignty over Tibet. Although the panda house is privately funded, some also object to the project’s cost. Shaped like the Chinese symbol representing opposites in balance, the enclosure has two tilting halves. Visitors can observe the pandas from above, or from a ground-level restaurant where they can dine while watching the male panda, who spends most of his waking hours scarfing down bamboo, at close range. “Normally, zoos have a front of house for the audience, and a back of house for the animals,” Mr. Ingels said in an interview. “We thought we would make this 360 degrees, so that no aspect of the pandas’ life was off limits.” The panda’s unusual mating habits posed the main challenge for the architects. Male and female bears only mate during two or three days each year; the rest of the time, they must be kept far enough apart that they cannot see or hear one another. “We didn’t want to have two separate structures,” Mr. Ingels said. “And we wanted to stay away from the typical pagoda. We realized that this ancient Chinese symbol, of black and white, male and female, offered the architectural solution.” A separate area within the enclosure — normally a sort of no panda’s land — will be opened to both bears during their exceedingly brief mating season and includes trees that the female panda can climb up if her suitor is not to her liking. The rest of the year, the animals will live mostly outdoors in their separate areas, which have been landscaped to resemble the panda’s two main habitats, a dry bamboo forest and a denser woodland kept misty by a fog machine. The pandas have already proven popular — 5,000 people showed up for Thursday’s public opening, double the average attendance on that day — but so has the structure. Karsten Ifversen, the architecture editor for the Danish newspaper Politiken, said that while pandas were “very lazy animals,” the enclosure “goes in the opposite direction.” “There’s a lot going on everywhere you look,” he said. “The architecture is almost as much an attraction as the animals.” As for the cost, the pandas do not have the most expensive home in the Copenhagen zoo. The elephant enclosure, for instance, was designed by Norman Foster and cost over $36 million. But for critics, the panda house is not so much a feat of animal architecture with a hefty price tag than it is a signal of overly cozy ties with China. Pointing to other instances of so-called “panda diplomacy,” both the far-left Unity party and the far-right Danish People’s Party criticized the new enclosure as a symbol of political appeasement. “Denmark gets the pandas because we have dropped our criticism of the Chinese repression of Tibet, and because Chinese human rights violations aren’t being criticized so much,” Eva Flyvholm, a member of parliament for the Unity party, told the Danish television station DR. The Danish government has welcomed this new phase in its relations with China. When the panda loan was confirmed in 2014, it was accompanied by 40 new trade agreements between the two countries. At the panda house’s inauguration on Wednesday, Mette Bock, Denmark’s culture minister, said in a speech that this was a project “about friendship.” But outside the zoo, a few dozen protesters dressed in panda suits disagreed. Cecillie Sita, 19, and Christina Kalesh, 18, said they were protesting because they objected to Denmark “kneeling” before a country that violated human rights. They said they were disappointed by Mr. Ingels’ decision to design the enclosure. “As a representative of Denmark, it would be nice if he came out in favor of human rights,” Ms. Sita said. Mr. Ingels said the protesters — and the media — were overblowing it. “The fact is, we all collaborate with China — just look at the phone in your pocket,” he said, adding that the previous night he had seen firsthand how excited people were by an invitation to dine at eye-level with the pandas. “At the end of the day, this is about two really cute animals,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,‘Parliament Really Is Broken’: Water Leak Derails U.K. House of Commons,"LONDON — A week before the country faces a potentially chaotic departure from the European Union, debate in Britain’s House of Commons was interrupted on Thursday by something even more urgent: a leak that sent a torrent of water into the press gallery. Justine Greening, a Conservative lawmaker, was concluding a speech about an anti-tax-avoidance measure when she was interrupted by the sound of water pouring down inside the chamber. “I want to finally finish my comments with a leaky roof in the background,” she said on Thursday afternoon, amid laughter from fellow lawmakers. Proceedings had to be suspended, prompting members of Parliament to tweet about the symbolism of their building showing strain at such a tense moment: Prime Minister Theresa May has seen her proposals on the European Union withdrawal, known as Brexit, repeatedly rejected. She is discussing potential compromises with Jeremy Corbyn, the opposition leader, to the outrage of some Conservatives. “A very noisy torrent of water coming in from the ceiling — is this a Biblical flood coming to wash us all away?” wrote Julia Lopez, a Conservative lawmaker. “In the Commons Chamber and can hear rain dripping in through the roof. Parliament really is broken,” wrote Justin Madders, a lawmaker from Mr. Corbyn’s Labour Party. Some initially feared that the leak was something worse than pent-up rain. The House of Commons press office, however, was quick with reassurances that the problem was being taken care of, and that only water was involved. It was the second unusual interruption at the Commons in less than a week. On Monday, protesters stripped nearly naked in the public gallery of the chamber, proclaiming that climate change, not the stalemate over Brexit, was the real emergency facing the country. This one, however, was perhaps less of a surprise. The Palace of Westminster, the largely Victorian Gothic complex that hosts both houses of Britain’s Parliament, is crumbling and is scheduled for a multibillion-dollar restoration that will involve lawmakers temporarily moving out. Its famous clock tower is silent and swathed in scaffolding as it undergoes its own renovation. And officials have a little time to shore things up.

2019,‘Partly Alive’: Scientists Revive Cells in Brains From Dead Pigs,"In a study that upends assumptions about brain death, researchers brought some cells back to life — or something like it. In a study that raises profound questions about the line between life and death, researchers have restored some cellular activity to brains removed from slaughtered pigs. The brains did not regain anything resembling consciousness: There were no signs indicating coordinated electrical signaling, necessary for higher functions like awareness and intelligence. But in an experimental treatment, blood vessels in the pigs’ brains began functioning, flowing with a blood substitute, and certain brain cells regained metabolic activity, even responding to drugs. When the researchers tested slices of treated brain tissue, they discovered electrical activity in some neurons. The work is very preliminary and has no immediate implications for treatment of brain injuries in humans. But the idea that parts of the brain may be recoverable after death, as conventionally defined, contradicts everything medical science believes about the organ and poses metaphysical riddles. “We had clear lines between ‘this is alive’ and ‘this is dead,’” said Nita A. Farahany, a bioethicist and law professor at Duke University. “How do we now think about this middle category of ‘partly alive’? We didn’t think it could exist.” For decades, doctors and grieving family members have wondered if it might ever be possible to restore function to a person who suffered extensive brain injury because of a severe stroke or heart attack. Were these brains really beyond salvage? The new research confirms how little we know about the injured brain and so-called brain death. Bioethicists like Dr. Farahany were stunned and intrigued by the findings, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature. “This is wild,” said Jonathan Moreno, a bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania. “If ever there was an issue that merited big public deliberation on the ethics of science and medicine, this is one.” Until now, it has been assumed that the brain declines quickly when its blood supply is cut off. Cells deteriorate, and the connections between neurons crumble. Scientists have believed those changes are irreversible unless blood is quickly restored. Researchers at Yale University acquired the heads of 32 pigs killed for their meat. The scientists sawed into the skulls and removed the brains. By the time the experiment started, the brains had been without blood and at room temperature for four hours. The team has developed a system called BrainEx that pumps an experimental solution into the intact brain. The scientists hope the technology will help point the way to new treatments for strokes, traumatic brain injuries and diseases like Alzheimer’s. The scientists pumped the solution into the pigs’ brains for six hours. It brought oxygen to the tissue and contained chemicals that allowed the scientists to track its flow with ultrasound. The solution also contained chemicals intended to block nerve signals. The scientists reasoned that brain cells might be better preserved — and their metabolisms more easily restarted — if the cells were not active. But the investigators also did not want to take a chance that the brains might regain consciousness, unlikely as that seemed. Had the team seen electrical activity suggesting actual consciousness, they planned to give the brains anesthetic drugs and cool them immediately to stop the process. In addition to the brains that got the BrainEx solution, the scientists also examined brains that did not receive infusions and those receiving infusions of a dummy substance. Brains in both groups showed no signs of activity, and their cells deteriorated. The National Institutes of Health, which supported the research, held a briefing to discuss its significance. “It is not a living brain, but it is a cellularly active brain,” Dr. Nenad Sestan, a neuroscientist at Yale University who led the research, said of the revived tissue. “We wanted to test whether cells in the intact dead brain can have some functions restored,” he added. Some people who seemed dead after prolonged exposure to cold have been resuscitated and their brains continued to function, he noted. Stroke patients who had gone as long as 16 hours with a clot blocking blood to parts of the brain have regained brain function once doctors removed the clots. “This is a real advance,” said Andrea Beckel-Mitchener, who leads brain research efforts at the N.I.H. “This has never been done before in a large intact mammalian brain.” Christine Grady, chief of bioethics at the N.I.H.’s clinical center, said that the work “presents for the first time an opportunity to study the whole mammal brain outside the body after death.” “It allows researchers to map cells and connections between them in ways that were never before possible,” she added. And the technique may broaden the study of brain injury and cellular repair, as well as how drugs affect the brain. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] The ethical issues posed by research into revived brain tissue are nearly unprecedented. Among them are questions about the welfare of laboratory animals. “This is brand-new,” said Stephen R. Latham, a bioethicist at Yale. “This is not animal research. The brain comes to researchers from a dead animal.” How, he asked, will ethicists decide if suffering caused by the research — to a “partly alive” brain — is justified by the goals? Even though there was no electrical activity in the brains, it may be possible to restore it, Dr. Farahany and other experts said. It’s not known what would have happened if the scientists’ solution had not contained nerve blockers. When you have a cellularly active brain, what are the appropriate protections, she asked. Do you treat it like a living animal? You can’t treat it like a dead animal, she said. “What does it mean to talk about consciousness in a pig? What are we looking for?” Dr. Moreno wondered. The work also may have implications for organ donation. In France and Spain, if a person has, say, a heart attack that deprives the brain of blood, emergency medical service workers try for 30 minutes or so to restart the heart, said Stuart Youngner, a bioethicist at Case Western Reserve University who was a co-author of an editorial accompanying the study. If they fail, emergency workers preserve the organs with a portable heart-lung machine to pump blood through the body; they also insert a balloon to prevent blood from getting to the brain. That way the person can be an organ donor, because the brain is dead. But “if something like BrainEx was available, why wouldn’t you do that instead of trying to get their organs?” Dr. Youngner said. In the United States, Dr. Youngner said, the balloon system is regarded as unethical. But a system like BrainEx would probably encourage doctors and emergency workers to try longer and harder to resuscitate patients. The result one day could be fewer brain-dead patients and fewer organ donors. It will take years before brain resuscitation reaches even preliminary testing in humans, researchers emphasized.

In “Penguins,” the beautiful but frustratingly shallow Disneynature documentary, Ed Helms provides the internal monologue for a 5-year-old Adélie penguin referred to as Steve, who is about to embark on his first mating season. Helms explains that if Steve hopes to thrive in the Antarctic spring and summer, he must find a mate, procreate and provide food to keep his new family alive. The camera follows Steve as he waddles through extraordinary vistas filled with cliffs backlit by a sun that never sets and ice floes rocked by the tempestuous waves of the Southern Ocean. These are precious glimpses of a vibrant ecosystem, one under severe threat because of ocean warming. But the pressure to build a family-friendly narrative out of these images diminishes the observational accomplishments of the directors, Alastair Fothergill and Jeff Wilson. As a result, nature’s complexities are reduced here to dull clichés. The character invented for Steve is as bumbling and cute as his wobbly walk. But the choice to create an inner monologue for him feels like an infantilizing suggestion that animals must be wholly anthropomorphized to be compelling subjects. And although Helms alternates between perspectives — frequently leaving Steve’s head to offer third-person descriptions of the environment — “Penguins” only grants internal life to one creature out of thousands, concealing the symbiotic relationships that sustain life in such a harsh climate. Even Steve’s mate is silent. As a fairy tale with a penguin for the hero, “Penguins” is proficient. But as a documentary with access to one of the world’s most remote locations, this fantasy feels insufficient and even distorting, particularly when common threats that connect every species — like climate change — are never mentioned.

2019,"‘Pet Sematary’ Has a Shocking Change. Yes, Stephen King Approved.","It’s a young girl’s birthday in a small town. Family and friends have come to celebrate. What could possibly go wrong? Since this is a scene in the new “Pet Sematary” movie, everything. Death echoed throughout Stephen King’s 1983 novel and his adapted screenplay for the 1989 film. The latest iteration, now in theaters, follows a similar dreaded path, but the story has been revised to give audiences a fresh shock. (Spoilers are forthcoming.) Here’s what’s familiar. The Creeds are still the focus, having just moved from Boston with their children, Gage and Ellie, and cute cat in search of a quieter life in Maine. There’s still the ominous, dead-raising burial ground in the woods that will upend those hopes. Semi trucks speeding by still foreshadow doom. The death of the family cat still pushes the film into creepy places, and the death of a child still instigates the movie’s horrifying final act. But here’s what’s different. Unlike the novel and the 1989 film, in which Gage, chasing a kite, is struck down by a semi, this time it’s Ellie’s death that fans may find jolting. [Read our review of the new movie.] The tragedy occurs at Ellie’s ninth birthday party. It’s already not a cheery affair, because she’s missing her cat, Church. But her spirits are lifted when she sees (an undead version of) Church and goes into the street after him. Gage follows her. Their father, Louis (Jason Clarke), runs to grab Gage as a truck bears down. The truck swerves and its chassis detaches, sliding down the street, striking and killing Ellie. This shocking departure was at the heart of the plot when the remake was first pitched to Paramount by Matt Greenberg, a writer credited with the screen story. (The screenplay, incorporating Greenberg’s ideas, was written by Jeff Buhler.) In an interview, Greenberg said the reasons for the changes were “personal, textual and cinematic.” On a personal level, Greenberg, who has three daughters, said he was drawn to the relationship between Louis and Ellie and the discussions they have about death. “I’d had a lot of those conversations with my daughters after pets died,” he said. “It’s something that really stayed with me.” Looking closely at the text, Greenberg said, he saw “Pet Sematary” as the novelist’s “King Lear” and pointed specifically to Lear’s loss of his daughter Cordelia. Greenberg wanted to emphasize the heavy pain of that here. And cinematically, Greenberg said, killing Ellie (played by Jeté Laurence), not the toddler Gage, would make for more menacing horror once she’s resurrected in her not-quite-living body and wreaks havoc: “I was thinking, an evil 2-year-old, yeah, that can be scary. But an older, more fully formed child makes it a more credible threat.” So how did King feel about this change? One of the film’s producers, Lorenzo di Bonaventura, worked with the author on the 2007 screen adaptation of the short story “1408.” In an interview, di Bonaventura said that when his team gave King the script, “we all held our breath about the Ellie decision. But his answer back was simple and reassuring. He said: ‘Oh, I see why you made that decision. That’s a good decision.’” King confirmed that in an email. “I thought the change was O.K.,” he wrote, adding: “Both versions — the old one, where Gage dies, and the new one, where Ellie dies — result in the same chain of events. I don’t necessarily think one version of the story is better, but I’m sure the directors found it easier to work with a girl zombie than with a toddler zombie.” The filmmakers Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer were ready to go to dark places, having directed a creep-out movie-business horror satire called “Starry Eyes.” They amped up the gore and scare factor in some “Pet Sematary” scenes, but for the birthday party sequence, they chose to go in a different direction. The moment of impact isn’t shown, and the aftermath is relatively bloodless. “We didn’t want it to be too graphic because we didn’t want blood or gore taking away from the emotion of the scene,” Kölsch said in a Skype interview. Widmyer said building the suspense and surprise of the moment was akin to a magic trick, “a combination of sleight of hand and dread.” By presenting one perilous situation in Gage running for the street, and averting that tragedy only to create another, the filmmakers said they were aiming to emphasize the fatefulness of death in the material. “The idea,” Widmyer said, “is that no matter how hard you might have tried to stop this from happening, it was meant to happen.”",The New York Times
2019,‘Pet Sematary’ Review: An Unsettling New Take on a Stephen King Classic,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Stephen King is so monumentally productive, even now, five decades into his career, that it’s hard to nail down the peaks of his bibliography. But critics and fans agree that his 1983 novel “Pet Sematary” was something special, and especially horrific. The story of an attractive American family finding terror in a new home credibly wedded Edgar Allan Poe’s twitchy, stiff-necked dread with the fetid, swampy atmospherics of a 1950s EC horror comic. The Creeds, Louis and Rachel and their young children, Ellie and Gage, move to rustic Maine and find out their property includes a creepy burial ground for pets, and behind that, an even creepier burial ground where the loved ones interred “come back,” as the Creeds’s avuncular neighbor, Jud, puts it. Louis and Jud try it out on the family’s killed-by-a-truck cat. That doesn’t work out well. Then other things don’t work out well. King’s novel was adapted for the screen in 1989. Directed by Mary Lambert, that “Pet Sematary” was a squirrelly, wild-eyed movie. This version is more Hollywood smooth. It’s very well-acted by Jason Clarke, Amy Seimetz, John Lithgow and especially Jeté Laurence as young Ellie. Directors Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer, showing puzzling distrust of their strong source material, overload the movie with arbitrary jump scares. And they replace King’s despairing, tragic denouement with something altogether more glib. But when they settle into a groove that aligns with the novel’s, the movie delivers great unsettling jolts that approximate the power of King’s vision. I also appreciate the respect and good taste of the filmmakers’ choice of closing song, a blistering Starcrawler cover of the Ramones’s theme from the original movie. An earlier version of this review referred incorrectly to who plays the theme song at the end of the film. It is Starcrawler, not Joan Jett.

2019,‘Peterloo’ Review: Political Violence of the Past Mirrors the Present,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Mike Leigh’s “Peterloo,” about a notorious episode of political violence, is for most of its running time a riot of verbal eloquence. One of the characters, Henry Hunt (Rory Kinnear), takes “Orator” as an honorific, like “Reverend” or “Doctor,” but his rhetorical gifts hardly set him apart. High-flown phrases pour from the mouths of activists at meetings, judges on the bench and politicians in the halls of Parliament. Orotund syllables drip from the mouths of government ministers, military officers and property owners in private consultations. Radicals rouse the rabble with vivid images of oppression and fiery exhortations to revolt. Every so often, someone will remark that the time for talk is past, that what is needed now is action. But part of the argument of this brilliant and demanding film is that words are deeds, that language matters. Language is a weapon in the arsenals of power and resistance alike, and if you listen closely to the motley idioms and accents that fill the soundtrack (punctuated and underlined by Gary Yershon’s musical score), you can hear the currents of history moving. This is not just a matter of accuracy with respect to the look and sound of the past, though Leigh and his crew see to that with characteristic artistry, as they did in “Topsy-Turvy” and “Mr. Turner.” The production and costume designers (Suzie Davies and Jacqueline Durran) and the director of photography, Dick Pope, create a plausible, breathing picture of England in 1819, and Leigh’s script takes pains to capture the texture of the time. Surely this is as close as we can hope to come to experiencing what people saw and how they spoke in various corners of Regency society, from the royal boudoir to the taverns of Manchester. But the past, if it is a foreign country where people do things differently, is also a mirror. We can see our own world in its contours if we look from the right angle. On Aug. 16, 1819, in St. Peter’s Field near Manchester, at least 16 demonstrators were killed — trampled by horses and run through with swords — by military and constabulary forces. The protesters, 60,000 to 80,000 strong according to contemporary estimates, marched under a broad banner of reform, demanding expanded suffrage, tax relief and repeal of the trade-inhibiting Corn Laws. The march, forever after known as the Peterloo massacre, comes at the end of the film, which begins on a different battlefield a few years earlier. A young bugler, Joseph (David Moorst), wanders through the carnage of Waterloo before making his way home to Manchester. Meanwhile, the prime minister, Lord Liverpool (Robert Wilfort), heaps praise and public funds on the victorious Duke of Wellington. The home secretary, Lord Sidmouth (a marvelously vulpine Karl Johnson), worries that the forces unleashed by the French Revolution will survive the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte. The threat of insurrection is especially dire in the North of England. In some ways, the plot of what follows could not be simpler. The disaffected residents of Manchester — owners of small businesses, intellectuals and weavers toiling in the newly mechanized mills — plan a mass meeting. The defenders of the status quo, in government and private enterprise, calculate their response. A great many arguments ensue. But Leigh’s narrative is touched by the literary spirit of the later 19th century. “Peterloo” has the sweep of Tolstoy and the bustle of Dickens. It’s crowded with noble, villainous and comical characters: police spies and magistrates; radical firebrands and anxious liberals; pompous officials and plain-spoken workers; servants, tradesman, gossips, thugs and children. The prince regent himself (Tim McInnerny). Every one carries a spark of individuality. Every voice and face is something to remember. The movie is equally packed with ideas — about strategy and tactics, ends and means, liberty and order. Through the mist of ideology and the fog of oratory, the sharp outlines of modern politics become visible. There are two sides, those who demand reform and those who oppose it, but each side is crosshatched with factional and temperamental schisms. Orator Hunt’s main cause is his own ego, and it’s his celebrity that brings out the crowds. Among his fans are city businessmen who see universal suffrage as a way of bringing a share of political influence to a middle class whose economic influence is growing. The workers see the vote as a steppingstone toward full social equality. While the organizers insist on nonviolence, a group of younger militants (egged on by an agent provocateur in the pay of the home secretary) dreams of armed revolt and regicide. The specter of Jacobinism — of the guillotine and the mobs at the Bastille — haunts Britain’s rulers, from the prince regent to the owners of Manchester’s factories. But they, too, have their quarrels. Should they offer modest improvements in wages and political access in the hopes of quieting popular fury? Or should they respond with force? As it happens, the state and its agents both take control and lose it. The violence in “Peterloo” arrives swiftly and grimly. The chaos of the climactic minutes stands in brutal contrast to the decorum that has come before. For most of the movie, even when tempers flare and passions burn hot, a certain courtesy prevails. This civility, though, serves as both screen and scaffolding for the cruelty that is the society’s organizing principle. Like many great works of history, “Peterloo” has a point of view — you might even say a grudge. Leigh’s sympathies lie with Joseph, the bugler, and his family, particularly his parents, Nellie (Maxine Peake) and Joshua (Pearce Quigley), whose suffering seems to lie beyond the reach of any political rhetoric. The way they are portrayed edges close to sentimentality, but the honest sympathy the film extends them is the element that gives the wider tableau its clarity and force. The concerns and causes that for most everyone else provide occasions for speechmaking are, for these people, a matter of life and death.

2019,"‘Queen of Diamonds’ Review: Fear, Loathing and Misogyny","Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The writer David Foster Wallace called Las Vegas “a city that pretends to be nothing but what it is, an enormous machine of exchange.” “Queen of Diamonds,” a 1991 film by Nina Menkes set in Vegas now debuting in a new restoration, is, among other things, an urgent portrayal of the tedium of endless transaction. In one of the movie’s central sequences, the protagonist, Firdaus (her name, derived from the Arabic word for “paradise,” is only said once in the movie), played by the filmmaker’s sister Tinka Menkes, plies her trade as a low-stakes blackjack dealer. Firdaus’s face is powdered so white one might mistake her for a Goth aficionado; that face stays impassive as she pulls cards from a shoe, slides them to players, turns over her own, pushes bills into a slot with a clear plastic plunger, gives out chips, takes them away. The players are nearly as limited in their movements and displayed emotions as she is. The clanging of fruit machines and the electronic whoops of video poker games drown out the piped-in music. This is not the furious gambling action of so many Vegas-set movies. Nobody’s blowing on anyone’s dice. It’s a minimal-mobility death dance. Menkes’s highly controlled cinematic style suits the dance well. She sets up ungainly and awkward scenes with a compositional eye that’s almost classical. Camera movements of any kind are so rare that when a zoom occurs, you snap to a different kind of attention. Firdaus also serves as a caregiver for an old man; the other people in her sphere include a missing husband, a boisterous best friend and a neighbor who regularly beats the woman with whom he lives. The quotidian elements of this life are depicted as cold horrors, sometimes interrupted with wondrous, unsettling sights, such as a tree on fire, vigorously burning. Any spiritual or religious connotation here is left in the lap of the viewer. No matter how much of the unconscious, or of the subconscious, is injected into the movie’s images and sound, nothing here is aestheticized. This is not a “dreamy” film. Its moments of disconnect from “ordinary” reality, as when a character holds up a hand to show a long set of fresh and spiky-looking sutures on her wrist, are meant to provoke — specifically, in a way that’s anticapitalist and feminist. Even at a terse 76 minutes, “Queen of Diamonds” is not an easy film. But it’s an essential one.

2019,"‘Rafiki’ Review: Falling in Love, Illegally","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. It was hard not to get swept up in the anticipation when “Rafiki” was shown last May at the Cannes Film Festival, the first Kenyan feature to be shown in the event’s official lineup. The film, a debut feature from Wanuri Kahiu, had just been banned in Kenya for its positive portrayal of homosexuality. This exceedingly modest romance involving two young women — Kena (Samantha Mugatsia), who plans to go to nursing school, and Ziki (Sheila Munyiva), a free spirit who yearns to travel and who encourages Kena to set her sights higher in medicine — hardly seems designed to withstand outsize expectations. The illegality of same-sex relationships in Kenya isn’t the heroines’ only problem. Kena and Ziki’s fathers are running against each other for a seat in the county assembly — which means the women’s being seen together, even chastely, raises eyebrows. (Kena’s father warns her about the optics for donors.) The film is sharp at rendering the hesitancy of their flirtation, as well as the forces — parental expectations, religion, an ever-watchful gossip — arrayed against them. The drama’s initial delicacy makes the subsequent emotional and physical violence feel even more brutal — and the weaknesses of other characters appear all the more glaring (Kena’s father, separated from her mother, has shied away from telling his daughter he’s about to have another a child). At the same time, the movie’s dialogue can be earnest and blandly functional. This is a love story for the time, not for the ages. An earlier version of this article misstated the status of Kenya’s ban on “Rafiki.” It is still in place.

2019,‘Ramy’ Is a Quietly Revolutionary Comedy,"Ramy Youssef was home, in a manner of speaking. The Egyptian-American stand-up comedian had just finished shooting several takes of a scene for his new Hulu show, “Ramy.” The set was a mock-up of his childhood New Jersey home and the scene took place inside the dining room. Pictures of Youssef and his sister were hanging on the wall. “It was actually kind of emotional when I walked in because I hadn’t seen it,” Youssef, 28, said last fall as he stood outside his faux-home, which was built in a Brooklyn studio. He added: “It doesn’t feel exactly like my house but the emotional correctness is totally there. It’s the right vibe.” The house looks like many middle-class suburban homes: A living room, dining room, kitchen, all unremarkable. But what is remarkable about “Ramy” isn’t that it significantly differs from other millennial coming-of-age stories. It’s that it doesn’t. The comedy, debuting Friday, tells the story of a young American Muslim grappling with his faith along with the usual array of 20-something pressures: romance, career aspirations, drugs, parents. It’s a simple formula, but after decades of Muslims being depicted onscreen as terrorists and villains or otherwise pushed to the side, it’s practically revolutionary. [Our review: “Ramy” is a soulful, funny leap of faith.] “On one level, it’s very clear that there’s nothing out like it,” Youssef said. “There’s this initial reaction that you have of: ‘Oh, man. I have a lot of responsibility. I have this responsibility to speak for my people.’ Then you start to make the thing and you’re like: ‘That’s an impossible goal. If I try to do that, it just won’t work.’” He continued, “The more that I got into the process, I realized all I can do is really offer my singular point of view, and make sure that it’s as much me as possible, and that will speak to who we need to speak to.” Portrayals of Muslims in Western pop culture have historically lacked nuance. If they’re depicted at all, it is usually as the bad guys — see “True Lies,” “24,” and “Homeland,” among many other examples. Jack G. Shaheen, a professor and author who spent much of his life cataloging how Hollywood has stereotyped Muslims and Arabs, said before his death in 2017 that anti-Muslim prejudices onscreen were as bad as they’ve ever been, which he cited as a contributing factor to a low view of Islam among Americans. In 2017, a poll conducted by the Pew Research Center showed a warming view of Muslims in the United States, but still the lowest among other religious groups in the survey, including Jews, Catholics, and evangelical Christians. In 2010, the broadcaster Katie Couric suggested a possible solution to change attitudes about Islam in the United States: “Maybe we need a Muslim version of ‘The Cosby Show.’” Aasif Mandvi, the former correspondent for “The Daily Show,” gave it a shot with a 2015 Funny or Die spoof called “Halal in the Family.” But attempts to seriously address the issue have become more common in recent years. In 2017, in a widely hailed speech in the British House of Commons, the actor Riz Ahmed spoke about the importance of onscreen representation. “If we fail to represent, we are in danger of losing people to extremism,” Ahmed said. After Ahmed’s speech gained publicity, Sadia Habib and Shaf Choudry, an academic and a tech consultant in Britain, created the Riz Test, the Muslim equivalent of the Bechdel Test, which set criteria for judging Muslim portrayals in film and television. (A representative for Ahmed said he was unavailable for comment.) Among the categories: Are the characters “presented as irrationally angry?” or “talking about, the victim of, or the perpetrator of terrorism?” “The general portrayal is obviously quite negative,” Dr. Habib said in an interview. “It almost serves to perpetuate this idea that Muslims are quite backward, culturally deficit, and you get quite a lot of contradictions.” Recent projects that failed the test include the BBC hit “Bodyguard,” Amazon’s “Jack Ryan” and even the smash Marvel movie “Black Panther” where, in an early scene, a terrorist screams, “Wallahi, I will shoot her!” — Wallahi, in Arabic, means “I swear to Allah” — after the main character T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman) goes to rescue Nakia (Lupita Nyong’o). “The awareness that there was nothing like it was what pushed me to make it even more unique, because there’s never been a Muslim family show,” Youssef said. “I didn’t want to give the Muslim family the same treatment that is given to the Asian family show and the Hispanic family show. There are almost kind of tropes of how an immigrant family is treated on television, and I felt like, ‘No, this needs to go even further than that.’” “All those things were driven by the reality that we have no other portrayal outside of the news,” he added. In “Ramy” Youssef plays a version of himself embracing Islam. It’s not the only authentically Muslim story told in recent years: “The Big Sick,” the 2017 movie written by Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon, was nominated for an Oscar and told the story about Nanjiani and Gordon’s real- life romance. The difference between “Ramy” and “The Big Sick” is that Nanjiani spent much of that story trying to run away from his faith, whereas Youssef fully welcomes religious aspects of Islam. And in the non-scripted realm, the comedian Hasan Minhaj discusses his culture and faith with regularity on his Netflix show, “Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj.” If “Ramy” is not exactly a Muslim “Cosby Show” — this version is far more vulgar — Youssef, who also has a stand-up special debuting on HBO on June 29, can claim credit for acing the Riz Test. “If that’s how it is, I have hopes for it,” Dr. Habib said. “It will change the narrative and it will maybe open the floodgates for more shows like this about Muslims.” The Ramy of the show has to reconcile his faith with the demands of being a young adult in New Jersey. He said that while his character on the show wasn’t an exact replica of himself, “a lot of the rules that are in the show are kind of the ones that I do have for myself personally.” Most of his love interests early in the season are white and do not understand why he doesn’t drink or do drugs. He has deep conversations at his mosque about how to properly wash his feet and what his place is in the world. (Youssef doesn’t completely avoid caricatures in the show: His uncle, played by Laith Nakli, is cartoonishly homophobic and anti-Semitic.) At the same time, “Ramy” explores many of the same issues as other contemporary shows about young adults trying to get by, like HBO’s “Girls” and “Insecure.” Along with the push-and-pull of his faith, Ramy contends with meddling relatives, selfish friends, dating woes and career struggles. “I do believe in God,” Youssef said. “I realized that there was this void in entertainment of someone talking about that genuine construct. I have a bit about it I do all the time about how there’s Friday prayers, and then there’s Friday night, where it’s like: ‘No, I want to do both. I want to pray, and then, I also go out, and I have a girlfriend.’” Born in Queens and raised mostly in Rutherford, N.J., Youssef began conceiving the show when he dropped out of Rutgers University at 20 and moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting. Being on the opposite coast of his family, he found more solace in Islam than he had ever found before. During one of his first acting jobs, on Nickelodeon’s “See Dad Run,” the show was “shooting at Paramount Pictures and I remember praying at Paramount,” Youssef said. “I had this thought where I was like: ‘Who else has done this? Who has prayed on this lot?’” His stand-up and acting career started taking off. (I have performed multiple stand-up shows with Youssef over the years.) Youssef began dabbling in comedy with a sketch group in high school and then stand-up in Los Angeles. He started touring with Jerrod Carmichael. In 2017, he landed his most high-profile appearance to date: a set on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.” That same year, he pitched his own show to several outlets, including Hulu. “For someone who was doing a show for the first time, he just knew what his show was,” Beatrice Springborn, Hulu’s vice president of original programming, said. “He also knew how to take his experience of being a first generation Muslim-American and make it feel like every millennial’s experience.” Youssef acknowledged that he would not have been able to make this show a decade ago — the explosion of streaming platforms has created more opportunities for more diverse perspectives and talent. (Steve Way, an actor born with muscular dystrophy, plays a close friend of Youssef.) It has also created room for formal experimentation. “We take a lot of tonal and storytelling risks,” he said. “We have episodes that I’m not even in.” One episode depicts experiencing the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks solely through a young version of the central character. The episode, which Youssef directed but does not appear in, is indicative of the show’s balancing act — it delivers Youssef’s distinct point of view while also giving a broader portrayal of the Muslim experience in the United States. “I think a lot of people look at Muslims and they think every day, the moderate Muslim or the good Muslim — it’s almost like we all have this choice every morning that’s like, ISIS or breakfast,” Youssef said. “As if that’s like a genuine temptation,” he continued. “I don’t know anyone who knows anything about anyone who’s ever been in ISIS. We’ve got nothing to do with any of that. Really placing what our actual issues are, and what our actual things are at the forefront is the thing that I think makes us most human. That’s what I want people to see.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘Red Joan’ Review: I Spy, Reluctantly","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. A story of Cambridge spies, atom-bomb secrets and a passionate affair between a demure Brit and a dashing Commie should steam up the screen and pop your popcorn. Or you would think so: but leave it to the feted British theater director Trevor Nunn to flatten the intrigue and dampen the lust that could have made “Red Joan” zing. Nunn, however, can’t take all the blame for the terribly-proper tone and stodgy pacing. Lindsay Shapero’s screenplay (adapted from Jennie Rooney’s 2013 novel and based on the real-life spy Melita Norwood) is an equal culprit, heavy on flashbacks and light on the seductiveness of hazardous ideas. Structured around the questioning of Joan Stanley (Judi Dench, reliably flawless), an English octogenarian charged with treason for leaking classified information to the Soviets, the movie strains to shed the claustrophobia of the interrogation room. Slipping back to 1938, the story finds Joan (now played by Sophie Cookson) studying physics at Cambridge and falling under the spell of the glamorous Sonya (Tereza Srbova). She’ll keep falling when she meets the dangerously handsome Leo (Tom Hughes), a German Jew and Communist whose body interests her much more than his radical politics. Not until later, when she’s part of a secret project to build the bomb, do its fearsome capabilities persuade her of the upside of mutually assured destruction. As a portrait of misplaced love and pacifist ideals, “Red Joan” isn’t terrible. Zac Nicholson’s images are soft as dust, but it’s the haze of fusty rooms and the free-floating sexism of the time. What should be breathless and urgent is instead polite and listless: if you can’t ignite sparks from an illicit bathroom assignation, then maybe espionage just isn’t your thing.

2019,‘Redacted’ Is Word of the Day as the Mueller Report Lands,"The special counsel’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election has been released to the public at long last. All 400-plus pages of it. But as lawmakers, journalists and lawyers for President Trump devour every detail in the highly anticipated report from Robert S. Mueller III, what was not made public may be just as important in shaping how the report is received. After a closely guarded investigation captivated the American public for nearly two years, redactions to the final report have quickly become a sticking point. Democrats have expressed distrust over any attempt to filter their view of the treatise, with lawmakers demanding to see a full, unredacted copy. Tensions over transparency could lead to a subpoena or even send the issue to court. Here’s what you need to know about the redactions and what they mean. Since Attorney General William P. Barr received the report from Mr. Mueller on March 22, law enforcement officials have spent nearly a month reviewing the report and removing information that they said could not be made public. The findings from the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, are now available to the public. The redacted report details his two-year investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Mr. Barr, who promised to be as transparent as possible, said the redacted material would fall into four categories: • Secret grand jury information: A federal rule of criminal procedure generally forbids disclosure of grand jury material. • Classified information: Material that intelligence officials fear could compromise sensitive sources and methods, such as information from F.B.I. informants and foreign allies. • Information related to other continuing investigations, a.k.a. “harm to ongoing matter”: Officials blacked out anything that could interfere with current investigations, including spinoffs of the Mueller inquiry. • Information about “peripheral” people: Mr. Barr said he would redact “information that would unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties.” These concerns are standard for prosecutors handling sensitive information, although how broadly Mr. Barr applied them could be a matter of debate. [Read more about the redaction categories and what they mean.] Mr. Barr said, “We will color-code the excisions from the report and we will provide explanatory notes describing the basis for each redaction.” The report shows sections covered by black bars, with colored text describing the nature of the redaction. For example, grand jury information is labeled in red text. Personal privacy information is in green text. Material related to continuing investigations is labeled in white text. At a news conference on Thursday morning, Mr. Barr described the redactions as “limited.” More than a dozen pages were fully redacted, or nearly so. Other pages had sections of text blacked out, including full paragraphs. Much of the undisclosed material was in the first section of the report, on Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and its interactions with the Trump campaign, and was flagged as a “harm to ongoing matter.” Far less was scrubbed from the second part of the report, on whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice. Mr. Barr, a Trump appointee who has come under criticism for his handling of the report, including from Democrats who are suspicious that he may be trying to color the investigation’s outcome in the president’s favor, has said that his team was working with the special counsel to redact the report. At the news conference on Thursday, Mr. Barr said the report had been redacted by lawyers from the Justice Department, working “closely” with the special counsel’s team, the intelligence community and prosecutors handling continuing cases. “No one outside this group proposed any redactions,” he said. He said Mr. Trump’s lawyers read a final version of the redacted report this week, but the White House did not request redactions based on executive privilege. “The president’s personal lawyers were not permitted to make, and did not request, any redactions,” he said. Sort of. It is not uncommon for federal reports or other sensitive documents to be released with redactions, even with full pages blacked out. Information has both been kept secret for decades (F.B.I. files suspecting Marilyn Monroe of Communist sympathies remained redacted until 2012, 50 years after she died) and accidentally revealed with sloppy redactions (lawyers for Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman who was a target of the special counsel, recently revealed sensitive information because of a redaction failure). On the other hand, this is not your average government document. This is a report about an investigation involving a sitting president, which comes with strong national interest and its own historical precedent. Congress, if not the public, has received full reports, including grand jury information, according to Protect Democracy, a government watchdog group. In the Watergate investigation into President Richard M. Nixon, Congress received a 62-page report, and through public hearings, the American people learned much of what it contained, according to lawyers for Protect Democracy. The report itself remained under seal for decades, until last year, after the watchdog group petitioned for its release. Ken Starr, the independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton, gave Congress a detailed, 445-page report that lawmakers voted to make public, although it is worth noting that he was operating under different rules than Mr. Mueller is today. Regulations required Mr. Mueller to file a confidential report to the attorney general. Under the regulations, Mr. Barr can publicly release as much of the document as he deems appropriate. Anne Tindall, a lawyer with Protect Democracy, said that at the very least, some members of the House Judiciary Committee should be able to view the unredacted Mueller report. “There is a difference in what goes to Congress and what goes to the public,” she said. If the committee issues a subpoena for the full report and the Justice Department does not cooperate, she said, the House could sue to enforce the subpoena. Mr. Barr said Thursday he would make the report available to a bipartisan group of congressional leaders “with all redactions removed except those relating to grand jury information.” “I don’t think anyone would debate that this is one of the most important investigations in American history and one where Congress’s interest in understanding what happened and making sure it doesn’t happen again is at its peak,” Ms. Tindall said. We may find out more in the coming weeks. The House Judiciary Committee has authorized a subpoena for the full report, which could come quickly if lawmakers are not satisfied with Thursday’s release. Mr. Barr has also agreed to testify about his decisions to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, which could happen in early May. And he has said he may release some of the redacted information to Congress, opening up the possibility that more information could reach the public. But if you are ravenous for information now, you can always try some old tricks to reveal sloppily redacted information. The Justice Department was probably pretty careful in this case, but you could try copying and pasting the text into a new document, printing the report out on a high-quality color printer, changing the text color to white or simply counting the number of characters in a word to try to decipher its meaning. Good luck!",The New York Times
2019,‘Reinventing Rosalee’ Review: A Centenarian Who Won’t Slow Down,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. If you can look past the low-grade production values — and to do that you’ll need two awfully forgiving eyes — “Reinventing Rosalee” delivers a few rewards, thanks to its vibrant subject and her noteworthy life. Rosalee Glass was born in Poland in 1917. She spent part of World War II in a Siberian labor camp, and was later relocated by the Soviets to Kazakhstan. Following the war, she migrated to Germany, then to the United States. Over the course of her journeys, she married, had children, lost children, started a drapery business and worked to remake herself. In her 80s and 90s, she competed in a seniors’ beauty pageant and began acting in commercials. At 100, she traveled to Alaska to ride with sled dogs. Directing her first film, Lillian Glass, Rosalee’s daughter, interviews her mother and very few others. Rosalee’s past is outlined using family photos and vacation tapes, giving the documentary the feel of a well-meaning yet slapped-together tribute video. Clunky narration and badly edited stock footage do little to illuminate Rosalee’s times or support her memories. (Several poorly chosen movie clips are credited here, strangest among them Ed Wood’s “Glen or Glenda.”) Still, when the camera returns to Rosalee, it’s easy to be charmed by her smile. She’s a study in fortitude, and a fount of homespun advice (“Remain true to yourself”; “You can do new things at any age”). Now 102, Rosalee continues to be a lively woman to listen to, even as this film remains irksome to watch.

2019,"‘Return to Return to Nuke ’Em High A.K.A. Vol. 2’ Review: Troma Is Back, Icky as Ever","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. As cinematic practitioners of bad taste go, Lloyd Kaufman, one of the founders of the microbudget quasi-studio Troma, is no John Waters. He lacks that director’s Wilde-at-the-grindhouse verbal wit, and in place of Waters’s queer iconoclasm, Kaufman imbues his films with a species of heteronormative New-York-wisenheimer leering. That said, in “Return to Return to Nuke ‘Em High A.K.A. Vol. 2,” a rough-hewed sort-of sequel to 2014’s “Return to Nuke ‘Em High,” Kaufman really does bring the bad taste. Buckets and buckets of it. The opening scene pays homage to the 1976 horror film “Carrie” by … well, you don’t want to know. The “Nuke ‘Em High” films, like those in the “Toxic Avenger” series, are set in the fictional, and oft-traumatized New Jersey town Tromaville. The byzantine, trivial plot here features high-school lovers Chrissy and Lauren (Asta Paredes and Catherine Corcoran) trying to keep on the down-low, despite the prying of unappealing male internet trolls and radioactive monsters. There are other issues. “I didn’t think giving birth to a duck would be such an aphrodisiac,” Lauren confesses at one point. Kaufman plays a local magnate/mad scientist. The picture offers a relentless barrage of toilet humor, haphazard film parodies (the sight of the director naked, channeling a “Silence of the Lambs” character, is unfortunate indeed) and gore effects that are no less repellent for being unconvincing. This putrid but at times oddly amiable exercise raised questions of an esoteric nature to this reviewer’s mind, such as “Why do all the female extras look as if they’ve been kidnapped from the post-punk club Coney Island High, since that club closed over 20 years ago?” If you too are apt to be diverted by such concerns, you might be amused by this.

2019,‘Rocky’ Has a Statue in Philadelphia. Now the ‘Real Rocky’ Will Get One in Jersey.,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] In 1975, Chuck Wepner, a journeyman fighter known as the Bayonne Bleeder, was convinced he had snatched the world heavyweight title from Muhammad Ali after knocking the champ to the canvas in the ninth round of a matchup in Cleveland that just about everyone figured would be a cakewalk for Ali. “I headed back to my corner and said, ‘Start the car — we’re going to the bank, we’re millionaires,’” recalled Mr. Wepner, 80. “And my manager said, ‘You better turn around because he’s getting up.’’ Ali rallied to score a technical knockout over Mr. Wepner, moments before the final bell, but the underdog from Bayonne, N.J., had succeeded in showing the world that he could go the distance with perhaps the greatest fighter ever. Mr. Wepner’s gutsy performance made an impression on many, including a struggling actor named Sylvester Stallone, who made it the climax of the screenplay he wrote for the 1976 film “Rocky.” The movie went on to win three Oscars, including best picture, and catapulted the young actor to stardom. Mr. Wepner went back to his job as a liquor salesman in Bayonne, a working-class town across the harbor from New York City. His waning boxing career gave way to a series of tough breaks, including a prison sentence and cancer. But the Bayonne Bleeder has enjoyed a comeback of sorts in recent years, as the subject of three films. “The Brawler,” starring Zach McGowan, opened in January. Before that there was a 2016 film, “Chuck” with Liev Schreiber. And in 2011 an ESPN documentary, “The Real Rocky,” named after Mr. Wepner’s other moniker around Bayonne, where he grew up in public housing and learned to use his fists in the streets and in barrooms. A huge mural looming over an auto shop on Broadway in Bayonne pays tribute to his folk hero status. But one tribute Mr. Wepner never got was a statue like the one dedicated to the character, Rocky Balboa, outside the Philadelphia Museum of Art, next to the steps the boxer famously ran up in the film. “That scene is based on me running up the steps in Hudson County Park as part of my workouts,” said Mr. Wepner. “But it was Rocky, a fictional boxer, who got the statue.” But now Mr. Wepner is getting his statue, at the site of the actual training steps. A longtime friend of Mr. Wepner’s who owns a tire repair shop has raised enough money to commission one. “Chuck has always represented Bayonne, so we want a proper representation of him here — something that shows that he’s the real Rocky,” said Bruce Dillin, who has turned the waiting room of Dillin Tire, on Kennedy Boulevard, into a crowdsourced Chuck Wepner museum, filled with memorabilia largely donated by local friends of Mr. Wepner. Tire ads and displays of transmission and brake fluid share space with images and mementos from Mr. Wepner’s career, including fight posters, boxing equipment and video clips. The posters include a shot of Mr. Wepner in his boxing trunks, posing in a muffler ad for the shop. He agreed to appear in the ad “for a flat repair and an oil change,” Mr. Dillin joked. To have the Wepner statue made, Mr. Dillin said he initially asked A. Thomas Schomberg, the artist who created the Rocky statue in Philadelphia. But Mr. Schomberg, according to Mr. Dillin, typically charges around $500,000 for such a job. So he turned to Wu Zhen, a painter and sculptor who happens to have a studio next door to the tire shop. “Bruce bothered me everyday, he tortured me, until I agreed to do it,” said Mr. Wu, who charged $40,000, which he said barely covered his materials. The eight-foot-tall model of Mr. Wepner is complete, and Mr. Dillin is raising money to have it cast in bronze. Mr. Wepner, who lives in an apartment with a view of his old high school, said he had many opportunities to move out of Bayonne once his profile as a fighter rose. “Bayonne’s been so great to me, so why should I leave?” said Mr. Wepner, who presides over the town like an unofficial mayor — and that’s according to the official mayor, Jimmy Davis. “Chuck was the epitome of what Bayonne was. It was a blue-collar town and Chuck was a blue-collar fighter,” Mr. Davis said. “Even today, he’s probably one of the biggest cheerleaders for Bayonne.” Mr. Schreiber agreed. “It’s not just Bayonne — he’s the mayor wherever he goes,” said Mr. Schreiber, who recently accompanied Mr. Wepner to boxing matches at Madison Square Garden. “Every cop in the Garden said hello to him, and so did every fighter on our way to our seats.” Mr. Wepner was recently treated for rectal cancer, enduring three surgeries, radiation and chemotherapy, but he seems to have lost none of his trademark charisma. He is still a fixture around town, driving around in his Lincoln with the “CHAMP” license plate and mini-gloves dangling from the mirror. Mr. Wepner turned pro in 1964 and worked his way up from smoky joints in the Bayonne area to taking on such prominent fighters as George Foreman and Sonny Liston. The Liston fight left him with a broken nose, a broken cheekbone, 71 stitches in his face — and his Bayonne Bleeder nickname. Of 52 pro fights and nearly 100 amateur bouts, Mr. Wepner said he won most of them. “And in bar fights,” he said, “I’m undefeated.” Then there were the moneymaking gimmick matchups late in his career. In 1976, he fought a 1,250-pound grizzly bear and took on the professional wrestler André the Giant, who stood 7 feet 4 inches and tossed Mr. Wepner out of the ring long before Hulk Hogan did the same to Mr. Stallone in “Rocky 3.” Other aspects of Mr. Wepner’s life reflected in the “Rocky” films include him as an enforcer for local moneylenders. Then there was his trainer, Dominick Bufano — “The real Mickey,” Mr. Wepner said, referring to the character in “Rocky’’ — who jumped in front of Ali and gave him an “evil-eye” curse before the fight. Mr. Wepner was a 40-to-1 underdog and earned $100,000 for the fight, by far the biggest purse of his career. Mr. Wepner’s business card touts his Ali and “Rocky” claims to fame, and on the back, bears a photo of the Ali knockdown. As the “Rocky” franchise grew with sequels, Mr. Wepner said he had never received payment, even though Mr. Stallone had added to the value of the movies by repeatedly naming him as Rocky’s real-life counterpart. The actor did invite Mr. Wepner to audition for a minor role in “Rocky 2,’’ Mr. Wepner recalled, “but I blew the audition because I had been on a bender for two days.” So in 2003, Mr. Wepner sued Mr. Stallone, arguing that the actor had inappropriately used his name to promote the movies without compensating him. The case resulted in a private settlement, whose sum Mr. Wepner would not disclose, other than saying that, “I still have to work for a living.” “I always loved the guy — he made me Rocky — but I needed him to acknowledge that I was the real Rocky,” said Mr. Wepner, who still works in liquor sales, as does his wife, Linda. In the late 1980s he served 22 months in prison after being arrested with four ounces of cocaine. Mr. Wepner said he has been sober for years, but still has trouble sticking to the strict diet required after his cancer surgeries. In front of the tire store on a recent weekday, he grabbed his second chili dog from a hot dog cart and motioned to a group of locals who had stopped to chat. “Everything I’ve achieved, it all comes from my city,” he said. “So I’ll always be true-blue Bayonne.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘S.N.L.’ Sees BTS Perform and Emma Stone Host, as Julian Assange Lands in Jail","For a second consecutive week, “Saturday Night Live” avoided taking aim at President Trump and his administration in the show’s opening sketch. In fact, the sketch wasn’t even particularly political. (But don’t worry, there was still a surprise celebrity guest.) Beginning with a fake voice-over for MSNBC — “Now that the Mueller report turned out to be a big fat zero, we’re back to prison shows” — the sketch set up an episode of “Lockup: Chino Correctional Facility,” in which inmates played by Chris Redd, Kyle Mooney and Kenan Thompson boasted about the crimes that had put them behind bars. Enter Kate McKinnon, playing the actress Lori Loughlin. “Oh yeah?” McKinnon told the gang. “You think that’s insane? I paid 500 grand to get my daughter into U.S.C.” She added: “That’s not including the 300 grand I blew on tuition.” (She also said she owned the prison guards because “I helped their kids get into a really competitive pre-K,” and boasted that she was a Nation of Islam member because she’d “bought my way in for 100 grand.”) Next in the prison cell was Pete Davidson playing the lawyer Michael Avenatti, who was indicted this week on dozens of charges. “I’m accused of crimes you can’t even conceive of,” he told the other inmates. “Like blackmailing a sneaker company. And stealing taxes from a coffee shop to fund a racecar team. I’m so shady that a porn star once said that she needs to distance herself from me.” He said he still planned to run for president, announcing his ticket as “Avenatti Baldwin 2020.” Played by Michael Keaton wearing a long white beard, the next prisoner to show up was the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who was arrested in London on Thursday. “I’m the architect of anarchy,” Keaton declared. “I’m the king of chaos. I’m the scourge of the cleaning staff at the Ecuadorean Embassy.” “Here’s how crazy I am,” he explained. “I’m wanted in the U.S. and Sweden; I’m from Australia; I live in London, in Ecuador — you try figuring that one out.” Keaton added: “I’m an actual James Bond super villain, and I’m one step away from destroying the [expletive] moon. So, you want to get nuts? Come on, let’s get nuts!” For good measure, Melissa Villaseñor appeared in the sketch as the rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine, explaining that she was in prison for less interesting reasons. “Just robbery and gun stuff,” she said. “S.N.L.” has been sending up “The View” since time immemorial, and this week it returned to the scene of that ABC daytime show. Leslie Jones played the host Whoopi Goldberg (“I’m as surprised as you that this show is a fit for me”), while Cecily Strong and Villaseñor played her round-table partners Abby Huntsman and Ana Navarro. But the sketch focused mainly on the recent bickering between the hosts Joy Behar (McKinnon) and Meghan McCain (Aidy Bryant). As Bryant declared in a meandering rant: “Can I just say something? As the princess of Arizona, there is a crisis at the border, and the border is right up in my Arizona, which was founded on sunburned women selling turquoise jewelry, not rando Mexicans. And that’s not racist, because my makeup artist is gay.” The night’s host, Emma Stone, played the former “View” host Jenny McCarthy, who has been an outspoken critic of vaccinations. “I don’t believe in vaccinations,” she said. “My doctor is Google; my scientist, Twitter; and my religion is Donnie Wahlberg.” At the “Weekend Update” desk, the anchors continued to riff on Assange’s arrest and on President Trump’s announcement that his administration was considering releasing migrants detained at the border into so-called sanctuary cities. “WikiLeaks founder and reason I put tape over my computer camera, Julian Assange, was arrested at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, and this dude did not go quietly,” the anchor Colin Jost began. A video played of the arrest, in which Assange shouts, “The U.K. has no civility!” Jost resumed: That is not how you’re typically removed from an embassy. That’s how you’re removed from the F train. But it was so satisfying to see an internet troll get dragged out into the sunlight. Like, you can be lord of darkness on the internet, but when seven cops have you pinned to the sidewalk, you can’t be like, “I summon the power of emails!” Jost went on to note that Trump had been asked about Assange’s arrest, showing a video in which the president says: “I know nothing, really, about him. It’s not my deal in life.” “What is your deal in life?” Jost asked. “I’m just genuinely curious, since you brought it up. Also, you cannot say that WikiLeaks is not your deal, because at some point it was like your whole deal.” Playing numerous clips in which Trump praised WikiLeaks, Jost responded with a reference to the night’s musical guest, a Korean boy band: “You’re more obsessed with WikiLeaks than this audience is with BTS.” The anchor Michael Che picked up the Trump thread: President Trump is considering releasing detained immigrants into sanctuary cities to send a message to Democrats. What’s the message? Have some more voters? Yeah, man, that’ll show ’em. I don’t know how they’re going to handle a bunch of immigrants in a city like … New York. You can’t scare us with more immigrants. That just means faster Ubers and more Elmos. “Or, maybe he should send immigrants to New York,” Che continued, prompting an image of Trump Tower. “I know a huge building on Fifth Avenue where nobody wants to live anymore.” This week’s show featured performances by BTS, the first K-pop band to play on “Saturday Night Live.” If you’re wondering why their fans spent days camped outside NBC headquarters or why “S.N.L.” audience members burst into hoots, screams and applause any time the band’s name was mentioned, watch the video above, in which BTS performs “Boy With Luv” from its new album, “Map of the Soul: Persona.”",The New York Times
2019,‘S.N.L.’ and Kit Harington Spoof Biden and ‘Game of Thrones’,"Can “Saturday Night Live” still write an opening sketch that isn’t about the misadventures of the Trump administration? This week’s episode showed that yes, it can, though it still had to reach into its celebrity Rolodex to get it done. Jason Sudeikis, an “S.N.L.” alumnus, returned to his longtime role as Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president, who this past week responded after four women said they were uncomfortable being touched by him. (The episode, hosted by the “Game of Thrones” star Kit Harington, also featured a couple of sketches lampooning that popular HBO fantasy drama.) In the opening sketch, Sudeikis met with two campaign aides, played by cast members Cecily Strong and Kenan Thompson, who explained that they had an urgent matter to discuss with him. “Joe, it’s about all the touchy feely stuff,” Thompson said. Strong added, “If you’re really going to run in 2020, you have to change the way you interact with women.” Slipping back into his gregarious, oblivious portrayal of Biden, Sudeikis said, “You guys know that I’m a tactile politician, right? I’m a hugger, I’m a kisser and I’m a little bit of a sniffer. But the last thing I ever want to do is offend anyone.” His aides introduced him to a sensitivity-training consultant (Kate McKinnon), whom Sudeikis greeted by putting his nose and forehead against hers. “I’m just connecting,” he said. McKinnon replied, “So this is exactly the kind of thing that I’m here to prevent.” Sudeikis said that he, too, had recently taken a DNA test, just like “Lizzie Warren.” “It turns out that I’m one percent Eskimo so I’m allowed to do the kissing,” he said. He and McKinnon then talked through a couple of hypothetical scenarios when meeting people on the campaign trail. If he were to greet a woman with a handshake, Sudeikis asked, “What if during that handshake, I go ahead and I tickle her palm a little bit?” McKinnon replied, “I would say no tickling at all.” Sudeikis said, “Am I still allowed to do something like that gorgeous lift that they do at the end of ‘Dirty Dancing’?” Who would you do that with?, she asked him. He answered, “Hell, I don’t know. Whoever’s strong enough to pick me up, I guess.” Finally, Sudeikis was introduced to two prospective voters, the first played by Aidy Bryant. He put her in a headlock and gave her a noogie; she responded by punching him in the stomach. As she left the room, he said, “I have to say she’s still on the fence.” The second voter, played by Leslie Jones, greeted him enthusiastically. “You’re Obama’s granddaddy!” she exclaimed. Asked at the end of the exercise if he had learned anything, Sudeikis answered, “Not really, no. But the important thing, I think, is that I’m listening. I hear you and I feel you.” He proposed a campaign slogan: “Let’s hug it out, America — Biden and some woman in 2020.” For Harington’s monologue,“S.N.L.” went with one of its most familiar gimmicks: having the host field questions from ringers in the studio audience. After an eerily clean-shaven Harington vowed that he wouldn’t reveal how “Game of Thrones” concludes, he nevertheless faced several variations on that question — from his “Thrones” cast mates. Emilia Clarke, who plays Daenerys Targaryen, said she’d already forgotten the ending to the show. “It’s been so damn long since the last season,” she said, adding: “Do you remember in Season 6 when we had sex? Did you know they filmed that?” John Bradley, who plays the hapless Samwell Tarly, asked him, “Do you think we’ll still hang out after the show is done, like best friends? What about next Tuesday, I could come around by 6 a.m.?” (Pete Davidson, in costume as the villainous, undead Night King, wanted to know: “Do people hate me? Because it really feels like they hate me.”) Finally, Rose Leslie, who played Ygritte and is Harington’s real-life wife, asked him, “What are we going to do for money now?” In a fake HBO commercial, “S.N.L.” imagined the cable network’s future after “Game of Thrones” is over: a lineup saturated with “Thrones”-related prequels, sequels and spinoffs. Those shows included “Castle Black,” a moody, “Riverdale”-style drama about the forbidden romance between Jon Snow (Harington) and a female white walker (Heidi Gardner); an animated series in the style of MTV’s “Daria,” called — what else? — “Arya”; a sitcom called “The Queen of King’s Landing”; as well as “Cersei and the City”; “The Marvelous Mrs. Melisandre”; and a crime procedural, “Game of Thrones: Special Victims Unit,” starring Mariska Hargitay and Ice-T. At the “Weekend Update” desk, the anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che continued to riff on Biden’s troubles and the legal battle over the final report of the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. CHE: Four women have come forward claiming that Joe Biden touched them in ways that made them feel uncomfortable. And yeah, I could see that. He looks like one of those uncles that calls spring ‘Sundress Time.’ It’s very disappointing, but older people, in general, have a problem with boundaries. There’s a lady in my building who’s like 75. And every time I see her, she grabs my arm and says something dirty. It’s very uncomfortable but I let her because she’s hot. JOST: On Wednesday, Biden released a video responding to the allegations, and I’m not sure that it helped. Yeah, so it was supposed to be an apology, not a re-enactment. Also, the look of the video is so weird. Why is it shot vertically? It looks like something from a premium, adults-only Snapchat. And of course nothing puts women at ease like a man on a leather couch who’s already taken off his tie. He might as well end the video by unbuttoning his shirt and saying, ‘to find out what happens next, log onto GoDaddy.com.’ And then a pro-Trump group released a new ad saying that Biden’s behavior with women is unacceptable and should instantly disqualify him from running. The group’s name is Independent Republicans of New York, or IRONY. CHE: The House Judiciary Committee voted to subpoena the full, unredacted Mueller report from the White House. Man, I really wish I knew about redacting when I was in school. I probably would have graduated. “I did my report, it’s just redacted right now.” If Donald Trump stole his presidency, why don’t we just steal it back? If I was running for president, I would be in Putin’s DMs right now, negotiating. Why is everybody trying to play fair with this guy? Even the F.B.I. Oh, you didn’t find anything? Then plant it, you’re the F.B.I. Just turn off your body cam and put some crack in his shoes, man. Not to neglect the political turmoil on the other side of the Atlantic, “S.N.L.” cast McKinnon as Theresa May, the British prime minister, trying to keep her spirits up after Parliament rejected numerous plans to withdraw the nation from the European Union. In a filmed segment set to the Sara Bareilles song “She Used to Be Mine,” McKinnon walked through the streets of Britain, drawing nasty looks from her fellow citizens and some obscene gestures from royal guards. As the sketch went to increasingly surreal extremes, we also saw McKinnon performing an interpretive dance while dressed in a Union Jack body suit, and taking an imaginary twirl with Winston Churchill (likely the only time we’ll ever see Kit Harington play this role).",The New York Times
2019,‘Satan & Adam’ Review: Two Musicians Team Up to Play the Blues,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The blues seep into every scene of “Satan & Adam,” a gritty yet lovely documentary. And even after the songs stop, the music’s bittersweet emotions linger. Sterling Magee worked as a studio and backup musician in the 1960s and ‘70s, playing with James Brown and Marvin Gaye, and recording on Ray Charles’s label. Stung by exploitation in the industry, he rechristened himself as Mr. Satan and became a street musician in Harlem. Adam Gussow, a Princeton University graduate living in New York, was wandering near the Apollo Theater in 1986 and stopped to listen to Magee. The two soon started performing together. They were a pair often defined by their contrasts, not the least of which was their looks: Magee, a fiery black veteran guitarist, side by side with the young Gussow, a white and somewhat nerdy harmonica player. The duo began to attract crowds, then acclaim: They toured Europe, recorded an album that made the charts (“Harlem Blues”), and were featured on a U2 record. V. Scott Balcerek, the documentary’s director, tells the story (later parts of which are better discovered onscreen than spoiled here) using decades of well-shot footage and interviews, and an underlying sense of melancholy. You can easily imagine some Hollywood executive eyeing up the tale for a treacly feature film of interracial understanding. And certainly, this documentary highlights the strong friendship between the two men. Yet even with a short running time the filmmakers don’t shy away from more complex issues — racial tensions, gentrification, art and anger. Like the blues, there’s real pain here, mixed with real beauty. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.",The New York Times
2019,‘Sauvage / Wild’ Review: A French Hustler Gets Too Close to His Work,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The opening scene of “Sauvage / Wild” alerts viewers to be up for anything. A doctor (Lionel Riou) takes the symptoms of a patient (Félix Maritaud) and asks him to undress. The doctor turns out to work for the French equivalent of the I.R.S., and the patient — the film’s protagonist — turns out to be a prostitute. This role-playing exercise is hardly the most surprising tryst we will witness over the course of this sexually frank debut feature from the French writer-director Camille Vidal-Naquet. The hustler — never given a name, though the director calls him Leo — takes a laissez-faire attitude toward prostitution, both as a business and as a lifestyle. Ahd (Éric Bernard), a colleague he solicits with along a park road, asks him why he kisses his clients: “It’s like you enjoy being a whore.” Viewed one way, “Sauvage / Wild” is a cautionary tale about the perils of blurring what you do and who you are. Naïveté may be Leo’s defining attribute. When a newcomer to the turf begins charging less than the community rate for oral sex, Leo comes to his defense, saying he’s not bothering anyone. (Never mind that the man will later teach Leo a sneaky method for drugging a john.) Leo is also in love with Ahd, who can be sensitive and protective; he allows Leo to cuddle with him the morning after a party and later helps him recoup money from clients who rough him up. But Ahd advises him to leave the grind. “Find an old guy,” he says. “A nice one. It’s the best that can happen to us.” But whether Leo desires to escape is an unsettled question. The film doesn’t avoid addressing certain dangers of prostitution. Leo is shown being graphically violated, and the men fear a would-be client known as “the pianist,” who is known for twisted tastes. Also Leo, a chronic crack user who midway through the film receives a diagnosis for a possible lung infection, doesn’t look like he is in enviable health. But in both conception and conclusion, the movie takes a pie-eyed view of Leo’s ostensible wildness, as if living on the streets, drug addiction and charging money for sex were just radical expressions of liberty. Vidal-Naquet sells this facile notion by keeping his protagonist a borderline cipher — even-tempered, accommodating, seemingly at peace with drifting. It’s tough to build a character study around an unconvincing character.

2019,‘Shazam!’ Keeps Box-Office Lead as ‘Hellboy’ Flounders,"Two superheroes, both alike in not taking themselves too seriously, had very different experiences at the box office this weekend. Warner Bros.’s “Shazam!” made $25.1 million domestically, a solid sum that kept it in first place after a strong debut last weekend. That PG-13 film centers on a teenager (Asher Angel) who can transform into a hero with an adult body (Zachary Levi) by speaking the word “shazam.” Based on a DC Comics character, ""Shazam!” has a jaunty and lighthearted tone, and its continued box-office success provides further evidence of the success of Warner Bros.’s shift away from the dark mood of “Suicide Squad” and “Justice League.” “Shazam!” picked up an additional $35.9 million outside of North America this weekend, according to Warner Bros., which brings the film’s worldwide gross to $258.8 million. That’s more than double the roughly $100 million the movie cost to make. But a mix of wisecracks and superpowers is no guarantee of success, as evidenced by another new movie: Lionsgate’s “Hellboy,” financed by Millennium Media. That film, a bloody, R-rated affair with a cherry-red, semi-demonic superhero (David Harbour) at its helm, landed in third place with a dreary $12 million in North American theaters this weekend, well below analysts’ expectations. A reboot of the Guillermo del Toro movies (themselves based on comic books by Mike Mignola), the new “Hellboy” was directed by Neil Marshall, with Harbour taking over the title role from Ron Perlman. It had a production budget of $50 million, according to Box Office Mojo. [Read the New York Times review of “Hellboy.”] Though it keeps the unserious tone that helped del Toro’s movies develop a cult following and stand out from other superhero stories, the new “Hellboy” arrived to poor reviews from critics — it currently holds a 15 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. More successful was Universal’s “Little,” which landed in second place with $15.5 million, according to Comscore, which compiles box-office data. It had a reported production budget of around $20 million. “Little,” a comedy directed by Tina Gordon, is like “Shazam!” in reverse: The story is about an adult C.E.O. (Regina Hall) who gets transformed into her 13-year-old self (Marsai Martin). Paramount’s “Pet Sematary,” based on the novel by Stephen King, came in fourth place with $10 million domestically.",The New York Times
2019,‘Shazam!’ Review: A Boy’s Supersized Alter Ego in a Sunny Superhero Flick,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Ever since Christopher Nolan took Batman to their mutually productive dark place, the DC cinematic super-universe has been as somber as a grave. There have been exceptions, shimmers of light amid the doom. Outside the animated realm, though, the stories and mood have been downbeat, matched by hues that range from drab to black amid bilious green, raging purple and watery blue. Even the “S” on Superman’s chest looks drained of cheer, more like dried blood than some candy-colored delight. Given this, the bright, popping red of the superhero costume in “Shazam!” is an early warning sign, as obvious as a matador’s cape, that the dreary and crepuscular have given way to something less self-serious and end-of-the-world grim. It’s a nice change of pace for a big-screen mega-comic, if not a revolutionary shift. There are still a lot of brand shilling and the usual tediously overextended fights, ka-pow and ka-boom. But these are delivered via Shazam, a charmingly breezy avenger in tights once known as Captain Marvel, a.k.a. the World’s Mightiest Mortal, or as I thought of him going in: Who? The answer emerges piecemeal in “Shazam!,” another movie about a superhero with dual-identity issues. Here, the divided self begins with Billy (Asher Angel, a relaxed, natural presence), a foundling with pluck, heart and a sob story. He’s on a mission to find his mother (longish story), a journey that — as sometimes happens in male quests — leads him to a surrogate father. This one is an ancient wizard called, ta-da, Wizard (Djimon Hounsou in a comic Halloween-ish get-up), who passes his magic to Billy. Once back in his normal realm, Billy discovers that he can tap great powers by saying the word “shazam,” which turns him into a hero with an adult body (Zachary Levi). If this sounds familiar — the Moses-like savior who learns he’s meant for greatness — it’s because the character was conceived to compete with Superman. Yet because Shazam isn’t as well known as Supes et al., he’s not as weighed down with fan expectations, the fate of the world and auteurist aspirations. The filmmakers (Henry Gayden wrote the script, David F. Sandberg directed) adhere to the heroic template, which means there’s a regulation villain (the reliably watchable Mark Strong) with schemes. But they also fill in the faces and places, and add enough shading and color to Billy’s world that when his inevitable fight against evil happens it feels as if something more than the box office is at stake. Of course a franchise may be at stake, though considering how often the movie name drops Batman and Superman, it can’t help but feel as if the entire DC movie world is on the line. And maybe Shazam is a risk, just because he’s an unfamiliar avenger in a wildly overcrowded field. Created in 1939, the character was originally called Captain Marvel (and physically modeled on the actor Fred MacMurray). But for legal reasons, Captain Marvel went into storage only to be later resurrected by DC as Shazam. (DC’s longtime foe, Marvel Comics, managed to trademark the character’s first name for the avenger currently played by Brie Larson in “Captain Marvel.”) The new movie quickly dusts off the Shazam story, first by grounding it in Billy, a sweet, if somewhat melancholic mischief maker who soon becomes an appealing protagonist. The opening scene involving a couple of dimwit cops feels as ancient as a Bowery Boys movie, perhaps intentionally. Things soon settle into an easy, everyday groove when Billy moves into a new foster home, a sprawl populated by kids (Jack Dylan Grazer, among them) who are generally cute instead of cutesy. Tenderly overseen by Rosa and Victor (Marta Milans and Cooper Andrews), the house has a lived-in coziness, a warmth and security that feels as unforced as the mix of ethnicities and races. Once Billy says that magic word and his supersized alter ego appears, the movie goes to its happy place and comfortably embraces its own identity as a light, jocular, modest entertainment. Levi is best known for his television roles (“Chuck,” “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”), but he easily scales up for the big screen. He can look like a beefier, tougher John Krasinski; as Shazam, though, Levi is pure cartoon, from his bootblacked helmet of hair to his tumescent musculature. Ken-doll plastic and handsome, he is an ideal, suitably absurd figure on which to hang an old-fashioned hero with a satiny high-collared cape and a fat yellow arrow suggestively pointing down. The arrow is a winking joke and as subtle as the nod to the Tom Hanks body-swapping comedy “Big.” It’s also a reminder of Billy’s larger human journey, a metamorphosis that remains humorously, identifiably awkward, even as he wills his inner super-adult to heroic life. Angel’s performance lays the groundwork for the character — and keeps him tethered to reality — while Levi lifts Shazam up with an exuberant turn that conveys the delight of Billy’s extreme transformation as well as its lingering adolescent ungainliness and excess. It’s one thing to fight evil, but Shazam’s eye-popping, slack-jawed, discordant physicality is a reminder that it’s just as tough to get a grip on yourself. An earlier version of this review misidentified the character that once earned fans like Elvis Presley. It was Captain Marvel Jr., not Captain Marvel.

2019,‘Shazam!’ Solidifies a Superhero Turnaround at Warner Bros.,"LOS ANGELES — Warner Bros. has finally earned back the benefit of the doubt when it comes to its all-important superhero movies: “Shazam!” became the studio’s third nonsequel comic-book hit in a row over the weekend, arriving to applause from critics and stout ticket sales of nearly $156 million worldwide. “We really want these movies to stand on their own, with filmmakers best suited to the characters,” Toby Emmerich, chairman of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group, said by phone on Sunday morning. “We’re all feeling deservedly really good.” “Shazam!” was the No. 1 movie in North America, collecting $53.5 million over the weekend, according to Comscore, which compiles box-office data. Paid previews in partnership with Fandango in late March, designed to prompt positive chatter online, added $3.33 million. “Shazam!” also had a solid start in countries like Mexico and Russia. [Read our critic’s take on “Shazam!”] Second place at the domestic box office went to a remake of “Pet Sematary” (Paramount), based on the novel by Stephen King. It took in an estimated $25 million. Disney’s big-budget “Dumbo” trundled along in third place, selling $18.2 million in tickets, for a sad two-week total of $76.3 million. “Shazam!” was made by New Line, a division of Warner that focuses on lower-cost films that often serve as counterprogramming. Made for about $100 million — about 40 percent less than most superhero movies — “Shazam!” tells the story of a teenage boy (played by Asher Angel, known for Disney Channel’s “Andi Mack”) who can turn himself into a hero with an adult body (Zachary Levi) and unique powers. “New Line always thought that ‘Big’ as a superhero movie was a great idea, a way to make the genre feel fresh and different,” Emmerich said. Warner has spent the better part of a decade trying to get its act together with movies based on characters from its DC Comics division — an imperative given the runaway success of rival Marvel Studios and the film industry’s increasing need for spectacles that audiences see as worth a trip to theaters. Part of the problem was that Warner stuck for too long with a dark vision for its superhero universe, set by the filmmaker Zack Snyder, that was clearly not working. That led to creative and financial messes like “Suicide Squad” and “Justice League.” But the studio, having largely jettisoned Snyder’s plans and shaken up its executive ranks, including promoting Emmerich, has started to deliver superhero home runs on a consistent basis: “Wonder Woman” from Patty Jenkins, “Aquaman” from James Wan, and seemingly “Shazam!,” which was directed by a relative newcomer, David F. Sandberg. Where the PG-13 “Shazam!” will end up at the box office remains a bit of a question mark given the impending arrival of “Avengers: Endgame.” Ticket buyers gave “Shazam!” an A grade in CinemaScore exit polls, an indication of staying power.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Someone Great’ Review: After a Breakup, One Last Night on the Town","Streaming Movie Review When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Hot on the heels of “Girls Trip” and “Rough Night” comes “Someone Great,” Netflix’s contribution to the “girls’ night out” genre. Written and directed by Jennifer Kaytin Robinson, the film kicks into action when the college sweethearts Jenny (Gina Rodriguez) and Nate (Lakeith Stanfield) call it quits after nine years. Jenny’s new job requires a move across the country, and Nate decides to break it off rather than deal with dating long distance. As a goodbye and a way of taking her mind off her heartbreak, Jenny’s best friends, Blair (Brittany Snow) and Erin (DeWanda Wise), take her out for one last night on the town. What follows is a story about the lasting bonds of friendship dressed in the clothes of a romantic drama. The dynamic between the three leads is the film’s best quality, but the flashbacks to scenes from Jenny’s relationship with Nate take up more of the film’s attention. The other women are saddled with romance troubles of their own: Blair is in a long-term relationship that has turned lifeless; Erin is afraid of commitment. Both story lines are fun, as each member of the cast is endlessly charming, but they feel like separate movies. There’s a “Blue Valentine”-like drama starring Rodriguez and Stanfield on one side, and a studio comedy on the other. The film succeeds, however, in capturing the way that certain places and songs can take on a life of their own, triggering sense memories of the moments associated with them. The hooks on which “Someone Great” chooses to hang its emotional hats are a little clichéd, but Rodriguez, Snow and Wise have enough chemistry to pull it all off.

2019,‘Southern’ Is Not a Style,"Three retailers are thriving in very different ways below the Mason-Dixon line. There are two very distinct sides to contemporary Southern apparel. First, there are labels like the movie star Reese Witherspoon’s clothing line Draper James (which is, as its website tell us, “steeped in Southern charm”). And then there are a handful of local labels inspired not by down-home hospitality but the region itself: hardscrabble, indefatigable and ever-changing. Just for starters, here are three of the most exciting homegrown labels operating in the South today. Despite its current status as a peppy young cousin to New Orleans’s famed arcade of hipness, Magazine Street, Birmingham’s Woodlawn neighborhood wasn’t much of anything when Duquette Johnston and his wife, Morgan, moved there 10 years ago. “It was all we could afford,” either Mrs. Johnston or Mr. Johnston or both Johnstons say. The couple speaks in tandem, often cutting each other off to expand on the other’s idea. Both are excitable and irrepressible as they explain the evolution of Woodlawn over the decade since they moved there, what it has become and what it is becoming. After an 18-month battle with a postpartum illness that almost killed Mrs. Johnston, 34, the couple decided to start their boutique, Club Duquette. They opened shop in September 2016 with little more than a few of their own T-shirt designs, a handful of pieces from the men’s wear label Taylor Stitch and some stock from designer friends. The store sold out in its first weekend. Club Duquette is one of several newish higher-end boutiques in an area that is beginning to recover from decades of economic depression. And while “revitalization” is often code for shoving out the old, Club Duquette is trying to strengthen what already exists by promoting culture, arts, music and style. “I can’t write a big check to the community,” said Mr. Johnston, 46, also a singer-songwriter. “But I can host fund-raisers. I can help show people who don’t have access to the arts that you can make music and art and fashion.” Club Duquette has partnered with Levi’s Premium and Topo Designs, the travel outfitter, for fund-raisers that have benefited Girl’s Rock Birmingham, one chapter of a nationwide foundation working to empower young women and nonbinary people through music, and Ruffner Mountain, a nature preserve a few minutes’ drive from Woodlawn. Next year, in addition to introducing their first full line, Club Duquette will work with the Initiative for Creative Arts, a hip-hop-focused youth empowerment group, and with Desert Island Island Supply Company to fund local creative writing, poetry and music workshops. And while their store grows into something of a flagship for the new Birmingham, Mr. and Mrs. Johnston remain cognizant of the Woodlawn that came before them. “We’re not trying to rewrite the identity of the city,” Mr. Johnston said. “We’re just trying to help create a new layer of it.” In 2005, Jac Currie’s young line, DNO (Defend New Orleans), showed promise. Only two years after it began, DNO was selling wholesale to some of the city’s hippest retailers and growing with direct-to-customer sales. Then Hurricane Katrina decimated the Crescent City, forcing a nationwide diaspora of New Orleanians. Mr. Currie went to New York City for a time, but DNO, which was mainly T-shirts and stickers back then, began to gain traction as he shipped shirts to the city’s displaced around the country. “Defend New Orleans meant something to people,” Mr. Currie, 38, said in an interview at his home near the city’s famed French Quarter. He had returned to a place that was different in almost every way from the pre-Katrina era, perhaps most markedly in its renewed civic pride. “The urgency to express one’s New Orleans-ness or the need to express the fragility of the city really had people clinging to the idea of loving New Orleans,” Mr. Currie said. Soon, DNO began selling to skate shops, bookstores and record shops around the city. Eventually, Mr. Currie got an invitation to the city’s first post-Katrina Voodoo Fest. There, Mr. Currie sold dozens of DNO shirts to the tired, frightened and proud citizens of his hometown, immediately after handing all of the cash he’d made over to recovery-focused charities. “That era was kind of the birth of DNO being an operation,” Mr. Currie said, alluding to a shift for his brand from hobby to career and viable business. Since then, DNO has grown in step with its namesake city. It opened a flagship store on Magazine Street in 2011, followed by a second location in the burgeoning downtown area in 2016. The brand has stretched from T-shirts and stickers to a haven of arts and design. A website features a journal with interviews with some of the artists, designers, musicians, tattooers and style setters that Mr. Currie and his cohort admire most, highly stylized photographs and imaging, and a live radio player. Catering to a new New Orleanian while eschewing corny, inauthentic liquor-soaked tourism, DNO exudes and amplifies its city’s singularity. Last August, amid the crushing humidity of a North Alabama late summer, over a thousand people flocked to the tiny college town of Florence for the 10th iteration of Shindig, designer’s Billy Reid’s homage to his native South. What started as an attempt to attract to Florence the most significant voices of the fashion world for a weekend of eating, drinking and clothing has evolved into something more akin to a full-fledged music festival, with weekend ticket sales, V.I.P. packages and multiple venues. There are performers like John Paul White, Jason Isbell and Kacey Musgraves, as well as James Beard Award-winning chefs. One of four towns in Northwest Alabama’s Shoals region, Florence is part Southern Gothic and part Main Street U.S.A., as if Norman Rockwell painted Faulkner’s Yoknapatawpha County. And at two and some hours’ drive from anything resembling a metropolis, it’s among America’s most remote designer-clothing hubs. Mr. Reid, 54, never saw this as a hurdle. His lines feel at once classic and urbane, while still rugged, coarse and unafraid of hard work, and are advertised by Florence-based musicians, baristas and scenesters in lieu of professional models. “We’re always trying to promote the Shoals area,” Mr. Reid said, adding, “Do what you feel in your gut is right and then bring others to it.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘Spiritually Speaking, I am Free’","The night before Easter is a traditional time to complete the sacraments of initiation. In New York, many Chinese immigrants enter the Catholic Church and experience religious freedom for the first time in their lives. Catherine Chen was sitting in a pew at St. John Vianney Roman Catholic Church in Flushing, Queens, practicing. It was mid-April and she had just completed a run-through of what to do when the priest pours the Holy Water on her head later in the month. Fifty or so other Chinese catechumens — people who are joining the Catholic faith — accompanied by their sponsors, sat in the pews around her, listening to the instructions delivered from the altar. This was their only rehearsal for the Easter Vigil. “I think I might screw up,” she said in a low whisper. “I just hope I do well.” Across the country each year, more than 30,000 people officially join the Catholic Church on Easter Eve — a tradition that dates back to the early days of the church — by participating in the sacraments of initiation: baptism, holy communion and confirmation. Of the 500 or so converting in New York last weekend, about a third were Chinese immigrants, some of whom are seeking asylum based on religious persecution in China. Most of the Chinese immigrants live in Brooklyn and Queens, and they are having a transformative effect on local Catholic churches. State control over religion remains strong in China, which has been known to monitor churches threateningly, if not raze some of them entirely, while harassing and sometimes imprisoning pastors and priests. Christians in particular faced severe persecution in 2018, the worst registered in 40 years, according to an annual report by ChinaAid, a Christian nonprofit. That said, religion is on the rise in China. Tens of millions now identify as Christians. Protestantism has swelled to what some believe to be as many as 115 million adherents, while Catholics represent a smaller group, with approximately 10 million. These numbers have trickled down to immigrant communities in New York. “As more and more Chinese immigrants come to America, we see our parish get bigger each year,” said Sister Monica Gan, who runs the initiations at St. John Vianney. The process, developed by the Catholic church, teaches the tenets of Christianity and Catholicism to those who want to convert, like Ms. Chen. In the early 1990s in Brooklyn, Father Norman Bennett, then a priest at Our Lady of Perpetual Help, in Sunset Park, recognized an opportunity to connect with Chinese immigrants who were steadily moving into the neighborhood. At the time, the majority of immigrants were Cantonese speakers, so Father Bennett started studying the language. It was the Sunday after Christmas, in 1995, when Father Bennett delivered Brooklyn’s first Mass in Chinese. About 25 people showed up. “I was very nervous and overwhelmed,” Father Bennett recalled. “My pronunciation wasn’t that good, and I was barely able to get through it all.” Now, more than two decades later, at least four churches in Brooklyn offer Mandarin and/or Cantonese services. Three of those offer Christian initiation programs in Mandarin. Our Lady of Perpetual Help has seen the greatest increase in those converting to Catholicism, with a nearly 160 percent jump in five years, according to records from the Diocese of Brooklyn. Local churches are simply adjusting to changing demographics, said Father Thomas Gaunt, executive director of the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate at Georgetown University, an independent research group that studies the Catholic Church. “In neighborhoods like Brooklyn, people leave, but churches don’t,” he said. “Parishes there are trying to respond to the needs of the community.” Churches in Queens are adapting in a similar way. After years without a religious home, Chinese Catholics in the Flushing area settled at St. John Vianney in 2006. Now, daily Masses are celebrated there in Mandarin, with a Sunday morning Mass that is celebrated in both Mandarin and Cantonese. Five Christian initiation classes, taught in Mandarin, take place every week. Ms. Chen made the decision to convert this past fall, after a friend persuaded her to attend Mass. Born in Fujian Province and now a permanent resident, Ms. Chen moved to Flushing 10 years ago, when she was 14. She wasn’t raised in a religious household, and she didn’t know what to expect. Together, they went to St John Vianney. “I never felt like that before,” Ms. Chen said. “I just started to believe that God really does exist.” Many of Ms. Chen’s classmates, however, particularly those who are recent arrivals from China, did not have such an open and accepting experience practicing Catholicism before starting the Christian initiation program in Queens. They described repressed lives in China, often spent in the shadows and attending underground churches, keeping their faith a secret to all but a select few. Catherine Zhang came to the United States about a year ago from the Henan Province with her husband, Simon, to seek asylum, claiming religious persecution. Ms. Zhang, who spoke through a translator, said that she had been arrested in 2017 and held in police detention for participating in an “illegal religious activity,” what she described as a prayer and Bible study group. Last weekend, the Zhangs performed the sacraments of initiation. “Spiritually speaking, I am free,” Ms. Zhang said. “I am obtaining spiritual growth, and it is definitely worth it.” Last summer, an immigrant named Daniel, who asked that his last name not be used for legal reasons and also spoke through a translator, started to take Christian initiation classes at Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Brooklyn, when he wasn’t working as a dishwasher in a restaurant. He came to the country illegally, saying his “religious situation” in China threatened his mental health and strained his economic livelihood. But stories like Daniel’s and Ms. Zhang’s led to a sweeping investigation by federal authorities that, in 2012, resulted in charges against at least 30 people of running an asylum mill in Flushing and in Chinatown. The mill coached clients to make up stories about religious persecution, among other fabricated claims, in order to win asylum. The cases of 13,500 immigrants, many of whom are Chinese, are currently under review, with threat of deportation. “There is no evidence that recent Chinese Catholics in our diocese are not true believers and are just turning to us to help support their asylum applications,” said Adriana Rodriguez, of the Diocese of Brooklyn. “The Catholic Church has an extensive period of initiation and commitment,” she continued, arguing that those interested in immigration status only could opt for a “Christian church with a shorter period of conversion.” Daniel, who is currently seeking asylum, seems to have had no problem with the lengthy process, along with its rituals. Though he was raised Catholic, he was never baptized. His baptism on Saturday marked more than just his official entry to the church; it symbolized a new chapter. “I wanted to start a new life here,” he said, “and by being baptized, I will be reborn.” Jia Guo contributed reporting.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Star Trek: Discovery’ Season 2, Episode 12: Time Is a Flat Circle on Boreth","Star Trek: Discovery The most problematic episodes of “Star Trek: Discovery” have involved Klingons, and “Through the Valley of Shadows” continues that trend of writers on the show having difficulty getting themselves out of self-created holes from past episodes. But I’ll say this: The scenes on Boreth, the sacred Klingon planet, gave a depth to Klingons rarely seen in the Trek franchise. Instead of lusting for battle and honor, we see a thoughtful, contemplative version of the race. (We’ve spent time on Boreth before, in a “Next Generation” episode called “Rightful Heir.”) But I was distracted by how we got to the planet in the first place. The crux of the episode was about a new red signal appearing over Boreth — and Discovery, with L’Rell’s help, goes to investigate. L’Rell tells Pike that there are time crystals there — very casually, I might add. This is a huge revelation. Some plot holes you can live with — even the best iterations of Trek have them. But L’Rell openly making contact with Tyler and facilitating the trip so Pike could visit their son — when both Tyler and their son are supposed to be dead — was too much for me to bear. When we last left L’Rell, her hold on the Klingon Empire was tenuous at best. Powerful forces in the Empire saw her as a tool of the Federation, and her companion, Tyler, as too human to have honorable intentions. So L’Rell hatched a plan in “Point of Light” to fake their deaths — when in reality, Tyler was sent off and joined Section 31 and the infant to Boreth. If L’Rell’s rivals find out that Tyler and their son are still alive, the entire Klingon race could once again be plunged into war. And yet here L’Rell was openly appearing in the same room as Tyler. This season, the Klingons have been shown themselves to be sophisticated enough to dabble in manipulating time. They’re definitely skilled enough then to track who L’Rell speaks to. (On top of that, she must have crew members and security who have some questions about what the chancellor is up to.) Instead of Tyler going to Boreth, Pike is the one to go — raising the question again of what Tyler’s exact role is on the show. The scenes at the monastery are the most compelling of the episode. Boreth is beautifully shot and it was refreshing to explore the religious aspects of being Klingon that don’t involve strictly honor. We discover that the monk who will guide Pike to getting a time crystal (which many Klingons believe are a myth) is the son of L’Rell and Tyler. (Sorry, the Human Previously Known As The Klingon Voq.) “Time flows differently for those who protect the crystals,” the son says. “The past, the present, the future are all equal in their presence.” Pike gets a glimpse of his future when he tries a crystal on for size and sees exactly, in horrifying fashion, how he will end up in the wheelchair that has become part of Trek lore. By removing the crystal from the monastery, he seals himself to his fate, which he agrees to so he can, you know, to save the universe and all. O.K., so I have a couple questions here: The monk tells Pike, “Even if a crystal is revealed to you, even if it provides you with the answers you seek, you are not strong enough to accept them.” Because … he sees his future? What if someone like Saru went down there and had a perfectly pleasant resolution to his life? Could he take a time crystal with no issue? The suggestion by L’Rell and Tyler’s son is that it is incredibly difficult to remove the crystal from Boreth. Meanwhile, all it seems to require is acceptance of your fate. Pike has a rough future, yes. But what if someone doesn’t? And if one removes a crystal, is Pike then sealing in the fate of everyone around him too? (Shoutout to Anson Mount though: He plays the shock of seeing his eventual state perfectly.) I don’t want to focus too much on the time crystals because the “Discovery” writers could either address the glaring plot holes they create in canon at some point in the future or they’ll just leave it, leaving Trek fans like me to shake our fists. But I do have another question that keeps nagging at me: The existence of time crystals on Boreth doesn’t seem to be a secret. Why didn’t one of L’Rell’s opponents go there, remove a crystal, and figure out a way to turn back time in a way so that Klingons could win the war against the Federation? Surely, not everyone believes it’s a myth. L’Rell clearly doesn’t. (Of course, it’s possible somebody has, so who knows?) The episode’s other arc features Burnham and Spock going to investigate a Section 31 ship that didn’t check in at the right time. This hamfisted story line didn’t make sense for several reasons. The brother and sister find that the entire crew of the Section 31 ship has been ejected into space — except for one crew member who is somehow alive. Bafflingly, Spock and Burnham aren’t suspicious that this is a trap, even while knowing how strong Control is. It turns out that the very living Kamran Gant, a former colleague of Burnham’s on the Shenzhou, is actually possessed by Control. This is unbeknown to Spock and Burnham, who for whatever reason decide to check out the ship that Control attacked. By the end of the episode, it seems that the entire Section 31 fleet has been taken over by Control and they are coming for Discovery. Pike seriously considers destroying the Discovery and the sphere data along with it. The ending didn’t quite hit home — but that’s in large part because important people or things don’t actually stay dead in “Discovery.” This was less a cliffhanger and more of a stopping point in the continuing story. • Welcome back Tig Notaro! Where has Jett Reno been this whole time? And more to the point, using Reno to convince Culber that he should get back together with Stamets seems like a waste to me. If Culber doesn’t have the same feelings for Stamets, that’s perfectly O.K. He shouldn’t be guilted into getting back with him. • There is growing speculation that Control is an early form of the Borg. Even after this episode, I’m still a no on this, but I can see the case for it. • It was a curious choice to have Amanda Grayson only speak to Spock and Burnham together, rather than with Sarek as well. • I don’t know where we’re headed with this story, but the Discovery crew has a time crystal now. My assumption is that the resolution involves Stamets finding a way to manipulate time in the same way Burnham’s mother did.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Star Trek: Discovery’ Season 2, Episode 13: Saying Goodbye, Maybe.","Star Trek: Discovery In the penultimate episode of this “Star Trek: Discovery” season, we get fan service: a lot of it. There are gratuitous shots of the Enterprise, complete with the musical riff familiar to Trek fans of multiple generations. We spend much of the episode on what will eventually become Kirk’s ship (or will it?) instead of the Discovery. We see the colorful uniforms we grew to love in the original series (in contrast to the dark blue typical of the Discovery crew). We hear the whooshes of the sliding doors and the whistle when Pike walks on the bridge. “She looks as good as I remember,” Pike says. Better, in fact, thanks to decades worth of production upgrades. The Trek franchise has been in dire need of a fresher look, and this week’s episode was a distinct reminder of what a visual upgrade “Discovery” is. I was into it, and not just because of how it looked. Previous Trek shows with tie-ins to earlier iterations sometimes struggle to keep the story their own — see the “Voyager” episode “Death Wish” involving Q. But the best ones (“Unification” in “The Next Generation”) keep the tone the show has already established while also properly integrating external elements from its forebears. “Such Sweet Sorrow” has Burnham preparing to make a giant sacrifice. The sphere and the Discovery have merged, making it impossible to destroy, while Leland and Control are speeding to come get the data. As Spock says, “Discovery’s very existence is the problem.” Burnham proposes using the crystal to “take the data out of this time,” meaning, “Discovery has to go to the future.” But of course, Burnham is the one who must go to the future without a certain path back to the present. Spock deduces that there is more than one Red Angel — one of them being Burnham. A new signal appears that leads the Discovery to Xahea, to the delight of Tilly. Xahea, you might remember, was the focus of one of the “Short Trek” episodes from before the official second season of “Discovery.” The queen of Xahea, Po, is a 17-year-old who developed technology to recrystallize dilithium, which comes in handy in creating the supernova necessary to launch Burnham and the Discovery into the future. Burnham’s crewmates, in a show of loyalty, commit to going with her into the future, suggesting that we might never see the Discovery crew again — unless the rest of the show takes place in the future. (Curiously, Pike offers to wear the suit in the first part of the episode but doesn’t offer to go later on. I was also surprised that Grayson and Sarek didn’t offer to go as well.) The problem here is a self-created one by the “Discovery” writing team: Much of the episode features emotional goodbyes, but as we’ve seen, characters too often appear to get killed off only to return. And in this case, Spock is one of the crew who says he’ll go with Burnham to the future — and we know that this actually doesn’t happen, unless we are just wholly disregarding Trek canon. My prediction is that Burnham doesn’t even get to make the trip because Control finds a way to disrupt the time crystal in the finale. In terms of the Control-as-Original-Borg theory, I’m beginning to come around. I’ve said before that I don’t think this is a good idea for “Star Trek” as a whole, but let’s see if that actually happens in the season finale. Vulture’s Devon Maloney wrote a really smart piece arguing for how brilliant that idea would be, if true. I’m not sure I agree, but let’s see the execution first. I enjoyed this week’s episode in part because of how much time we spent on the Enterprise. Some scenes made me laugh. At one point, Stamets snaps at his crew members to move quickly, emphasizing the urgency of the retrofit at hand. Seconds later, he pauses to have a personal conversation with Culber about the state of their relationship, which seems like a conversation that could’ve waited. But overall, it was a tightly focused episode, emphasizing the boldness of the writing staff. Now, as Saru says to close the episode, “Prepare for battle.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘Star Trek: Discovery’ Season 2, Episode 14: Virtue Signaling","Star Trek: Discovery The season finale of “Star Trek: Discovery” was true to form: alternately impressive and head-scratching; a visual marvel and yet muddled; nostalgic and fresh. And by the end of the episode, Spock suggests that Starfleet should essentially erase the existence of the Discovery. Unintentionally, Spock was voicing the thoughts of a vocal segment of “Star Trek” fans. Much of the episode, at least for me, recalled “Star Trek: Nemesis,” one of the more reviled Trek movies. There is an intensely long battle in which the Enterprise (and the Discovery, in this case) are massively outgunned by an enemy with the upper hand. The future of humanity is at stake. There is even an extended — and a bit pointless — boarding party when Leland beams over to the Discovery. But this battle played to a strength of “Discovery”: Olatunde Osunsanmi, who directed the episode, knows how to create riveting tension. The fast cuts, combined with the shaky cam, provided constant visual stimulation, almost taking the viewer on a roller-coaster ride. And unlike many “Trek” battles, this one, featuring a fleet of possessed Section 31 ships led by Leland against the Enterprise and the Discovery, felt realistic. In many starship fights in “Trek” lore, an enemy ship will fire one or two shots, and suddenly, one of the most powerful ships in the Federation will have its shields down — like in “Star Trek: Generations.” Here, both the Enterprise and the Discovery both take and deliver a wallop. I was riveted by the episode — the stakes felt real and drawn out — until the Klingons and the Ba’ul fighters showed up. This is where it went off the rails for me. I’ve been harping on this quite a bit this season: Ash Tyler is not supposed to be alive in the eyes of the Klingons. His existence nearly cost L’Rell her chancellorship before it got off the ground. And there he was on the bridge of a Klingon ship next to L’Rell. The notion that L’Rell could pull this off without significant opposition from other Klingons — or even from her own crew members — is questionable at best. And somehow, the Ba’ul and Klingons are able to come lend a hand, but no other Starfleet ships? Certain inconsistencies you can live with. Here, I was distracted. Particularly when Burnham and Spock solve another grand mystery, which is when Burnham sent the red signals. It turns out it was never from the future. She sent them from the present to bring them to this point, so that afterward, they can go into the future. This was another instance that confused me. From my understanding (and please email me if I’m incorrect!), Control (i.e. Leland) was coming for the sphere data and wouldn’t stop until they had it. This is why the Discovery has to go into the future. It’s very existence is the problem, as Spock said in the first part of the episode. Yet, in the finale, Georgiou, following a long fist fight, tells the bridge that Leland has been killed. “Control has been neutralized,” she tells Saru. So why does Discovery have to go into the future? Why not put a pin in that plan? The sphere data is valuable. To push an entire Starfleet crew into the future seems like a drastic step if the deadly enemy has been offset — even if temporarily. It would also deprive the Federation of key assets: a time suit, the spore drive and some of its best officers. Spock also mentions that the time crystal shows a version of the future that can apparently be avoided. So why was it such a big deal for Pike to take a crystal out of Boreth? Wasn’t Pike told he was locked into his future? I liked that the episode was more of an ensemble effort: Every crew member had a moment of some sort, even Cornwell, although her death seemed unnecessary. And knowing “Discovery,” she’ll find a way to have survived the blast. But the ending is where I found myself very baffled: Why did the Enterprise crew, and those associated with it, decide to lie to Starfleet about what happened with the Discovery? There didn’t seem to be a logical reason to. Spock, in particular, given his character history, would seem to have a hard time not telling the truth about this. The Discovery just saved the universe! Why hide their contributions? Maybe Starfleet would authorize the construction of a new time suit to bring back the Discovery crew. (And Spock, who suggests that everyone who knows about the existence of Discovery should keep quiet, closes the episode with a personal log which would reveal, or at least, acknowledge the falsehood. What if someone got a hold of it?) It was an uneven finale for an uneven show. Season 2 was certainly an improvement on the first season but overall, “Discovery” still felt like it was trying to find its footing. Ethan Peck was always going to have difficult shoes to fill with Spock. Over the course of the season, Spock went from petulant to showing a warmth for Burnham, exhibiting a range that felt to me out of character for the Spock we’ve come to know. (I did think it was a nice moment when Burnham and Spock said good bye to each other.) But that’s where we leave off: The Discovery is presumably in the future. Spock is on the Enterprise. And what about the Control-As-Borg theory? Speaking of which … • Lots of “Discovery” fans were convinced that Control is the origin story for the Borg. We don’t get definitive resolution on that in the finale. But maybe next season? • We know there is going to be a Season 3. We also know Anson Mount is leaving “Discovery” after this season. So where does the third run of the show take place? In the future? Does it center on Spock? • A shout out to Anson Mount and Rebecca Romijn (Number One), who is also saying bon voyage to “Discovery.” They were both charismatic assets for the show. I’d love to see Tig Notaro come back next season as well. • Thanks for following along this season. It’s much appreciated.",The New York Times
2019,‘Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker’ Trailer: Watch Rey Prepare for Battle in Episode IX,"Nearly 42 years after the release of the original “Star Wars,” audiences got their first look on Friday at the ninth chapter in this blockbuster science-fiction saga, set long ago in a galaxy far, far away. “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,” whose title and teaser trailer were released at the Star Wars Celebration convention in Chicago, closes out a new trilogy of films that started in 2015. The first in that series, “Star Wars: Episode VII — The Force Awakens,” directed by J.J. Abrams, reconnected viewers with venerable heroes like Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) while also introducing new characters like the mysterious scavenger Rey (Daisy Ridley), the renegade storm trooper Finn (John Boyega) and the villainous Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). A 2017 sequel, “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” directed by Rian Johnson, caught us up on the fate of the hero Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), who had been largely absent from “The Force Awakens.” The new teaser trailer for the next installment, for which Abrams returned to the helm, begins with a tantalizing glimpse of Rey, alone on a desert planet and wielding her light saber as a mysterious starcraft charges at her. (Can we presume it is piloted by Kylo Ren, her sometime ally and more frequent foe?) The voice of Luke Skywalker is heard to say: “We’ve passed on all we know. A thousand generations live in you now. But this is your fight.” There are all-too-brief looks at characters new and old, including Billy Dee Williams as the interstellar cad Lando Calrissian and Carrie Fisher, who died in 2016, as Leia, using footage shot for “The Force Awakens.” A piece of onscreen text vows: “The saga comes to an end.” And then there is a mysterious, villainous laugh, coming from an unseen figure. (Disney confirmed on Friday that this was indeed the cackle of the actor Ian McDiarmid, who will reprise his “Star Wars” role as the nefarious Palpatine in this new movie.) The new film is scheduled for release on Dec. 20. This is at least the third time fans have been promised closure to the long-running narrative of the Skywalker clan: Everything looked well and fine at the end of George Lucas’s “Return of the Jedi” in 1983, which wrapped up the classic original “Star Wars” trilogy. Then Lucas had to go and make a second trilogy of not especially beloved prequel films, telling the story of Anakin Skywalker’s metamorphosis into the sinister Darth Vader, which concluded in 2005 with “Star Wars: Episode III — Revenge of the Sith.” But that bargain was altered after Disney acquired Lucasfilm and its “Star Wars” franchise in 2012, leading to the new trilogy and stand-alone movies like “Rogue One” and “Solo.” At present, people like Johnson, as well as David Benioff and D.B. Weiss (the showrunners of “Game of Thrones”), are developing their own “Star Wars” movies that will chronicle new characters and plot lines. So you can expect the larger, post-Skywalker franchise to continue until the heat death of the universe. As Luke says near the end of the teaser trailer, “No one’s ever really gone.”",The New York Times

2019,‘Stockholm’ Review: Seduced by a Hostage-Taker,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Ethan Hawke is the best thing about “Stockholm,” but the moment he strides into a bank things begin going haywire. With strained comedy, unearned sobriety and Bob Dylan on the soundtrack, the movie revisits the 1973 Swedish robbery that inspired the coinage Stockholm syndrome. That term is often used when hostages — or victims of any kind, including of relationships and of long novels — develop an identification with their captors. Hawke plays Lars, the robbery’s would-be mastermind, who appears too ridiculous to be persuasively dangerous but who is also meant to be somehow irresistible. That Lars may not be up to the convoluted operation that he has set for himself is evident from his get-up, which looks straight out of “Easy Rider” (1969). “I’m the outlaw,” Lars announces to himself, making the movie’s audience his mirror. His black motorcycle jacket and pants evoke Peter Fonda’s cool cat from “Easy Rider,” but his cowboy hat and comical Little Lord Fauntleroy wig suggest that he is also tapping into his inner Dennis Hopper, Fonda’s more demonstrably zonked-out co-star. Lars’s enthusiasm for the Steve McQueen action classic “Bullitt” (1968) further suggests that he’s playing a role (or aspiring to one), but, for the viewer, also perilously evokes other, livelier movies. Drowsy in feel and muted in color, “Stockholm” is lightly amusing and watchable — mostly thanks to Hawke — but never makes the case that this is a story that needed to be told, with or without laughs. Once Lars hits the bank, an incursion executed with gun waving and mouth flapping, he takes hostages, including two employees, Bianca (Noomi Rapace) and Klara (Bea Santos). In time, the police and Lars begin talking and negotiating. Lars wants his pal, Gunnar (Mark Strong), released from prison. And so Gunnar joins the fray, as does a third hostage. Together, robbers and hostages hunker down and, as grimaces turn to smiles, form a shaky, unconvincing connection that’s reinforced by the ineptitude of the police and apparent callousness of the prime minister. Stockholm syndrome seems more widely diagnosed in journalism and in pop culture than in medical offices, and is perhaps still most associated with Patty Hearst, whose defense lawyers argued that the heiress hostage turned accused bank robber had gone along with her captors because she was under duress. The jury didn’t buy it, and Hearst was convicted (and later pardoned); the American Psychiatric Association seems similarly skeptical and doesn’t officially recognize the syndrome. It’s unclear what the writer-director Robert Budreau thinks of it, although given the attention he bestows on Lars — in camera love and in the dialogue — he seems to think raffish charisma explains a lot. He gets a great deal of help from Hawke, who takes hold of the movie from his first scene to last. Once Lars starts shedding his disguise, a clearer picture of him and his desires emerges. He sweetly hangs onto the increasingly skeptical Gunnar while also creating an implausible bond with Bianca, who remains a sketch at best. Lars’s manic energy starts to look a lot like vulnerability; his febrile charm feels like the real thing. By the time he is staring soulfully at Bianca — Hawke widens his eyes and drains his face of its earlier warring emotions, leaving a look of childlike, near-saintly awe — it’s hard not to wonder if this is a movie about Stockholm syndrome or an advertisement for it.

2019,‘Stop Sanders’ Democrats Are Agonizing Over His Momentum,"WASHINGTON — When Leah Daughtry, a former Democratic Party official, addressed a closed-door gathering of about 100 wealthy liberal donors in San Francisco last month, all it took was a review of the 2020 primary rules to throw a scare in them. Democrats are likely to go into their convention next summer without having settled on a presidential nominee, said Ms. Daughtry, who ran her party’s conventions in 2008 and 2016, the last two times the nomination was contested. And Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont is well positioned to be one of the last candidates standing, she noted. “I think I freaked them out,” Ms. Daughtry recalled with a chuckle, an assessment that was confirmed by three other attendees. They are hardly alone. From canapé-filled fund-raisers on the coasts to the cloakrooms of Washington, mainstream Democrats are increasingly worried that their effort to defeat President Trump in 2020 could be complicated by Mr. Sanders, in a political scenario all too reminiscent of how Mr. Trump himself seized the Republican nomination in 2016. [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.] How, some Democrats are beginning to ask, do they thwart a 70-something candidate from outside the party structure who is immune to intimidation or incentive and wields support from an unwavering base, without simply reinforcing his “the establishment is out to get me”’ message — the same grievance Mr. Trump used to great effect? But stopping Mr. Sanders, or at least preventing a contentious convention, could prove difficult for Democrats. He has enormous financial advantages — already substantially outraising his Democratic rivals — that can sustain a major campaign through the primaries. And he is well positioned to benefit from a historically large field of candidates that would splinter the vote: If he wins a substantial number of primaries and caucuses and comes in second in others, thanks to his deeply loyal base of voters across many states, he would pick up formidable numbers of delegates. To a not-insignificant number of Democrats, of course, Mr. Sanders’s populist agenda is exactly what the country needs. And he has proved his mettle, having emerged from the margins to mount a surprisingly strong challenge to Hillary Clinton, earning 13 million votes and capturing 23 primaries or caucuses. His strength on the left gives him a real prospect of winning the Democratic nomination and could make him competitive for the presidency if his economic justice message resonates in the Midwest as much as Mr. Trump’s appeals to hard-edge nationalism did in 2016. And for many Sanders supporters, the anxieties of establishment Democrats are not a concern. That prospect is spooking establishment-aligned Democrats, some of whom are worried that his nomination could lure a third-party centrist into the field. And it is also creating tensions about what, if anything, should be done to halt Mr. Sanders. Some in the party still harbor anger over the 2016 race, when he ran against Mrs. Clinton, and his continuing resistance to becoming a Democrat. But his critics are chiefly motivated by a fear that nominating an avowed socialist would all but ensure Mr. Trump a second term. “There’s a growing realization that Sanders could end up winning this thing, or certainly that he stays in so long that he damages the actual winner,” said David Brock, the liberal organizer, who said he has had discussions with other operatives about an anti-Sanders campaign and believes it should commence “sooner rather than later.” But to some veterans of the still-raw 2016 primary, a heavy-handed intervention may only embolden him and his fervent supporters. R. T. Rybak, the former Minneapolis mayor who was vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 2016, complained bitterly about the party’s tilt toward Mrs. Clinton back then, and warned that it would backfire if his fellow mainstream Democrats “start with the idea that you’re trying to stop somebody.” If the party fractures again, “or if we even have anybody raising an eyebrow of ‘I’m not happy about this,’ we’re going to lose and they’ll have this loss on their hands,” Mr. Rybak said of the anti-Sanders forces, pleading with them to not make him “a martyr.” The good news for Mr. Sanders’s foes is that his polling is down significantly in early-nominating states from 2016, he is viewed more negatively among Democrats than many of his top rivals, and he has already publicly vowed to support the party’s nominee if he falls short. “Bernie Sanders believes the most critical mission we have before us is to defeat Donald Trump,” said Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager. “Any and all decisions over the coming year will emanate from that key goal.” Or, as former Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri put it: “One thing we have now that we didn’t in ’16 is the uniting force of Trump. There will be tremendous pressure on Bernie and his followers to fall in line because of what Trump represents.” But Mr. Sanders is also taking steps that signal he is committed for the duration of the race — and will strike back aggressively when he’s attacked. On Saturday his campaign sent a blistering letter to the Center for American Progress, a Clinton-aligned liberal think tank, accusing them of abetting Mr. Trump’s attacks, of playing a “destructive” role in Democratic politics, and of being beholden to “the corporate money” they receive. The letter came days after a website aligned with the center aired a video highlighting Mr. Sanders’s status as a millionaire. [Read more: The blowup between the Center for American Progress and Mr. Sanders’s campaign reflects ideological divisions among Democrats.] With other mainline party leaders, he is offering more honey than vinegar. Last month, for example, he used his first trip to Iowa as a 2020 candidate to quietly meet with Jeff Link, a veteran party strategist, and Patty Judge, the former state agriculture secretary, to discuss rural policy and politics, according to a Democrat familiar with the meeting. Mr. Sanders’s campaign also reached out to Randi Weingarten, the head of the American Federation of Teachers and a top Clinton ally in 2016, to have her join them at what they called an “Ohio workers town hall” on Sunday. “If anybody thinks Bernie Sanders is incapable of doing politics, they haven’t seen him in Congress for 30 years,” said Tad Devine, Mr. Sanders’s longtime strategist, who is not working for his campaign this year. “The guy is trying to win this time.” But such outreach matters little to many Democrats, especially donors and party officials, who are growing more alarmed about Mr. Sanders’s candidacy. Mr. Brock, who supported Mrs. Clinton’s past presidential bids, said “the Bernie question comes up in every fund-raising meeting I do.” Steven Rattner, a major Democratic Party donor, said the topic was discussed “endlessly” in his orbit, and among Democratic leaders it was becoming hard to block out. “It has gone from being a low hum to a rumble,” said Susan Swecker, the chairwoman of Virginia’s Democratic Party. Howard Wolfson, who spent months immersed in Democratic polling and focus groups on behalf of former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, had a blunt message for Sanders skeptics: “People underestimate the possibility of him becoming the nominee at their own peril.” The discussion about Mr. Sanders has to date been largely confined to private settings because — like establishment Republicans in 2016 — Democrats are uneasy about elevating him or alienating his supporters. The matter of What To Do About Bernie and the larger imperative of party unity has, for example, hovered over a series of previously undisclosed Democratic dinners in New York and Washington organized by the longtime party financier Bernard Schwartz. The gatherings have included scores from the moderate or center-left wing of the party, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California; Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader; former Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia; Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., himself a presidential candidate; and the president of the Center for American Progress, Neera Tanden. “He did us a disservice in the last election,” said Mr. Schwartz, a longtime Clinton supporter who said he would support former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in this primary. But it is hardly only Mr. Sanders’s critics who believe the structure of this race could lead to a 50-state contest and require deal-cutting to determine a nominee before or at the convention. “If I had to bet today, we’ll get to Milwaukee and not have a nominee,” said Ms. Daughtry, who was neutral in the 2016 primary. The reason, she theorized, is simple: Super Tuesday, when at least 10 states vote, comes just three days after the last of four early states. After that, nearly 40 percent of the delegates will have been distributed — and, she suspects, carved up among candidates so that nobody can emerge with a majority. Unlike Republicans, who used a winner-take-all primary format, Democrats use a proportional system, so candidates only need to garner 15 percent of the vote in a primary or caucus to pick up delegates. And even if a candidate fails to capture 15 percent statewide, he or she could still win delegates by meeting that vote threshold in individual congressional districts. Should no bargain be struck by the time of the first roll call vote at the 2020 convention in Milwaukee — such as a unity ticket between a pair of the leading delegate-winners — the nomination battle would move to a second ballot. And under the new rules crafted after the 2016 race, that is when the party insiders and elected officials known as superdelegates would be able to cast a binding vote. The specter of superdelegates deciding the nomination, particularly if Mr. Sanders is a finalist, is highly unappetizing to party officials. “If we have a role, so be it, but I’d much prefer that it be decided in the first round, just from a unity standpoint,” said Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan. That may not happen should Mr. Sanders, sustained by his online fund-raising network, remain in the primary but fail to win a majority of delegates after the last states vote in June. Yet that result might not be fully realized until later in the primary calendar — well after Mr. Sanders has put his money to work. “If he is consistently raising $6 million more than his next closest opponent, he’s going to have a massive financial advantage,” said Rufus Gifford, former President Barack Obama’s 2012 finance director, noting that Mr. Sanders would be able to blanket expensive and delegate-rich Super Tuesday states like California and Texas with ads during early voting there. Mr. Gifford, who has gone public in recent days with his dismay over major Democratic fund-raisers remaining on the sidelines, said of Mr. Sanders, “I feel like everything we are doing is playing into his hands.” But the peril of rallying the party’s elite donor class against a candidate whose entire public life has been organized around confronting concentrated wealth is self-evident: Mr. Sanders would gleefully seize on any Stop Bernie effort. “You can see him reading the headlines now,” Mr. Brock mused: “‘Rich people don’t like me.’” An earlier version of this article misstated the Senate position of Chuck Schumer. He is minority leader, not majority leader.",The New York Times
2019,‘Storm Boy’ Review: Raising Pelicans in a Film That Never Fully Takes Flight,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. In a new adaptation of the early 1960s Australian children’s book “Storm Boy,” the story of a child who raises pelicans is updated to mixed effect. In the present day, a businessman, Michael Kingley (Geoffrey Rush), is poised to make a deal with the devil — in this case, a mining company — that would decimate his home’s natural ecosystem. His granddaughter (Morgana Davies) urges him to reconsider, spurring Michael to tell her about his childhood. He recalls his youth on the coast, recounting the time when he was better known as Storm Boy. The director Shawn Seet flashes between scenes of Michael as an adult and his memories as Storm Boy (Finn Little), a child who lives in seclusion with his father, Hideaway Tom (Jai Courtney). They reside in a shack that sits on land they hope will become a pelican sanctuary, but hunters threaten the purity of the region and kill the birds for sport. Storm Boy’s loose education comes from his father, leaving him endless time to wander the beach. He finds three chicks orphaned by hunters and decides to raise the birds with the help of his father and Fingerbone Bill (Trevor Jamieson), a Ngarrindjeri Aboriginal who teaches the boy how to care for the land and animals. Storm Boy nurtures the three pelicans, forming a particular connection with a bird that he names Mr. Percival, who returns the child’s loyalty beyond all expectations. “Storm Boy” tries to present itself as a modern fable, where the lessons learned relate directly to present-day concerns over the environment, industrialization and the marginalization of indigenous cultures. But these themes come across as didactic rather than moving. The cinematography is frequently beautiful, in large part because of the majesty of South Australia’s Coorong region, where the movie was shot. But the ham-fisted dialogue saps the energy from the images, drawing attention to the thinness of archetypal characters. And the centrality of white characters who learn from a noble native undermines the film’s attempts at political relevance. Seet does best when he focuses on the boy with his birds. In keeping with the movie’s environmental themes, Seet uses live pelicans for many scenes, documenting the growth of the birds from bald infancy to their first flight. Largely free from the trappings of treacly dialogue, these scenes place the emphasis where it belongs — on the rather remarkable performance by its misty-eyed child actor and on nature itself.

2019,‘Stuck’ Review: A Movie Musical Set in a Subway Car? Stand Clear.,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Setting a stage musical inside a stalled subway car sounds like such a natural idea that I’m surprised there hasn’t been a whole bunch of such shows. But after watching the film adaptation of the 2012 musical “Stuck,” directed by Michael Berry, I’m sorry anybody ever thought of the concept at all. “Everyone has a story like yours within them,” sings the sagacious homeless man Lloyd (Giancarlo Esposito, who, like most of the cast, somehow manages to get through this with his dignity intact). The stories of the five other passengers on the stationary subway car aim to show how, yes, we’re all connected and yes, we all need one another. The pregnant woman (Ashanti) who intends to terminate her pregnancy needs to hear from the grieving mother (Amy Madigan) who lost her adult son to cancer. The sullen dancer (Arden Cho) needs to learn that the floppy-haired guy who seems to have been stalking her, to the point of following her onto this very car (Gerard Canonico), is not a stalker as such, but a sensitive artist. And so on. Underneath the ostensible humanism of the scenarios, fleshed out in songs by the playwright Riley Thomas with Tim Young and Ben Maughan, seems to lurk a mind-set more attuned to “Father Knows Best” than “Rent.” When the characters are singing, you can’t wait for them to get back to talking. And when they’re talking, you can’t wait for them to get back to singing. After a while, you start wishing you were watching that TV ad with a bunch of people on a bus, singing about how they have a structured settlement but they need cash now. That spot gets its point across in less time, and has better music.

In the opening shot of “Suburban Birds,” the spectacular feature-directing debut of Qiu Sheng, there’s a blurry-edged circle inside the square frame, a far-off cityscape in the distance. A man eventually comes into frame, and the view swivels. The effect can be taken as a reflection of the viewer’s own eye, with the sharp center representing the pupil, and the blurred portion the outer iris. We soon learn the view is through a surveyor’s level. While the director’s camera does not peer though that device again, the perspectives in this movie shift subtly but distinctly from adult’s eye view, to child’s eye view, to a hushed omniscience and back. A crew of four male engineers are taking measurements on the outskirts of a growing Chinese city. The area seems to be plagued by craters, or sinkholes — it’s hard to say. The men don’t discuss the work in much detail. One of them, Hao (Mason Lee), initiates a sexual relationship with a female resident of his hotel, Swallow (Lu Huang). Alone one afternoon, he enters a suburban school through a window. The movie initially gives no clues as to why. Inside, he rifles though a desk, and finds a journal. The film’s scenes then begin to follow the journal’s dates. Its world is now one of school children, including a small boy, also named Hao (Zihan Gong). The kids aren’t terribly engaged in their school work, and like to wander nearby woods looking at birds. They don’t have cellphones, and when one of them doesn’t show up to school one day, the others don’t have access to any present-day tools that might help them find his house. It’s therefore reasonable to infer that their story line is set in the past. But as the film goes on, it’s harder to be sure. At a certain point, the kids come across the four surveyors, all improbably napping in tree shade, and one of the kids puts a wad of gum on the lens of a level. The movie keeps visiting the adult Hao, whose relationship with Swallow suffers because of her drunken behavior. Qiu shows remarkable facility as he patiently adds layer upon layer to a mystery that wants to stay one. This is not a puzzle film, but its ends are elusive. Its observations on the expanding cityscapes of China recall the work of Jia Zhangke (“Ash Is Purest White”), while its near-mystical quietude has accents one recognizes in the films of Apichatpong Weerasethakul. But Sheng is also very clearly his own artist, and this movie is an assured debut.

2019,‘Teen Spirit’ Review: Elle Fanning Can Sing. Who Knew?,"Critic’s Pick When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “Teen Spirit,” Max Minghella’s sweet and touching directing debut, is both proudly clichéd and refreshingly different. The rhythmic beats of his rise-to-fame story, about a teenage singing hopeful who enters a televised competition, are comfortingly familiar. Yet the poignant, almost despondent mood created by his visual choices and the raw vulnerability of his star, Elle Fanning, transform the pop energy of the soundtrack into a yearning cry to be heard. Fanning plays Violet, a sensitive British 17-year-old who lives with her mother (Agnieszka Grochowska), a Polish immigrant. Aside from a beloved horse and a disappeared father, not much defines the character beyond her passion for music. Whether tethered to her iPod or singing in a greasy bar, Violet is in thrall to her tunes. And when a local drunk (Zlatko Buric) is revealed to be a fallen Croatian opera star with his own familial angst, the role of the problematic mentor and manager feels satisfyingly filled. All they need now is a national contest to showcase her talent. Conflicts, naturally, arise (with Rebecca Hall briefly slapping the movie out of its fairy-tale daze as a music-industry vulture with a dubious contract offer); yet Minghella refuses to be distracted from his waiflike star or her internal ache. The son of the director Anthony Minghella (who died in 2008 and whose 1991 heartbreaker, “Truly, Madly, Deeply,” remains an exemplar of romantic-comedy perfection), he and his cinematographer, Autumn Durald Arkapaw, fashion a soft, almost dreamy aesthetic that even the neon-bathed stage scenes fail to puncture. And then there’s Fanning, who — fabulously — does all her own singing. The music might belong to Robyn and Ellie Goulding, but the journey from insecure child to tentative adult is all hers.

2019,"‘Tell Them Who You Tortured’: Gina Haspel Faces a Heckler, and Her Past","WASHINGTON — Gina Haspel, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, made a rare public appearance on Thursday to give a nostalgia-laced recruiting pitch to students at Auburn University. But she was confronted instead by a heckler shouting about her role in torturing suspected militants in the years after the Sept. 11 attacks. Ms. Haspel was recounting the excitement she felt at the start of her own career when the heckling began. “Tell these young children, tell them who you tortured. You know their names — they’re still in Guantánamo Bay,” an unidentified man shouted. “You’re a decrepit human being,” he continued before being removed by security. “The only people you should be talking to is a prison guard in a jail cell.” The C.I.A. has strenuously sought to distance Ms. Haspel from the now-defunct torture program since 2017, when she was named the agency’s deputy director; she ascended to the top job nearly a year ago. In her speech on Thursday, Ms. Haspel talked about the C.I.A.’s efforts to change with the times — to diversify, to bring in recruits with new technology and language skills, and to refocus on the business of spying on rival powers after years of being deeply enmeshed in the fight against Islamist militants. But Ms. Haspel has not been able to escape the part she played in the agency’s brutal detention and interrogation program under the administration of President George W. Bush. Ms. Haspel supervised a secret prison in Thailand in 2002 when a Qaeda suspect was waterboarded there, and later conveyed orders to destroy videos documenting torture that had taken place at the so-called black site. The same issue dominated the Senate hearing to confirm her as the director of the C.I.A. last year, and it upended her speech on Thursday. A few minutes in, Ms. Haspel was recounting the “thrill of being sworn in” as a C.I.A. officer when the heckler interrupted. “Do you remember the thrill of the C.I.A. black sites you tortured people in and the evidence you destroyed?” he shouted. Ms. Haspel stood silently at the podium, glancing at her notes as the heckler was removed. She then looked up and said, “I’ll continue.” The speech was part of Auburn’s National Security Forum and was followed by questions from retired Lt. Gen. Ronald Burgess, the former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, the military’s intelligence arm. As he sat down onstage with Ms. Haspel, Mr. Burgess said, “I don’t think she needs to respond” to the heckling, and added that he helped set up the intelligence collection unit at the Guantánamo Bay prison in 2002. “We did the best we could with the guidance that we were given, with the resources we were given, to protect the United States of America,” Mr. Burgess said. But another person in the audience wanted answers. “So when can we expect her to answer?” came another shout. Mr. Burgess told that person to “wait your turn” or “be excused.” He then steered the conversation back toward how Ms. Haspel saw the C.I.A. and the world it was supposed to keep American leaders informed about. Of dangers facing the United States, Ms. Haspel said she believed talks of threats could be overblown. “I sometimes worry about the emphasis on the word ‘threat,’” she said. The threats may be serious, she said, but they are not existential. She cited Russia and North Korea as two places where “time, money and creativity” are paying off for the C.I.A. At the same time, Ms. Haspel said, the agency has not let up on the Islamic State, Al Qaeda and other militant groups. Mostly, though, Ms. Haspel tried to keep the conversation light, and her remarks at times seemed to be an extended recruiting pitch. She said that in 2018, the agency had its best recruiting year in a decade, and that her own ascension to the top job “sends a signal to the young women entering duty at the C.I.A. or the other intelligence agencies that their prospects are strong and are rich.” She also revealed that the agency would soon be starting its own Instagram account, spreading its social media wings beyond the narrow confines of Twitter, where the agency has had an account since 2014. Ms. Haspel said little about President Trump, whom she is said to have charmed, despite his complaints about the United States’ intelligence agencies. What little she did have to say about the president was complimentary, praising his attempts to build a relationship with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. “After years of failure I do think that President Trump has shown a lot of wisdom in reaching out his hand to the North Korean leader and to suggest to them there might be a different future for the North Korean people,” she said.",The New York Times
2019,"‘Terror Will Not Win,’ Says Rabbi Injured in Synagogue Shooting","Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein was walking into the banquet hall at Chabad of Poway on Saturday when he heard a loud noise. He thought a table had toppled or that one of his congregants had fallen. “I did not know what that was,” he said. But when he turned around, he immediately found out. “I was face to face with this murder terrorist who was holding the rifle and looking straight at me,” he said. The gunman did not say anything. “As soon as he saw me, he started to shoot toward me and that is when I put my hands up,” Rabbi Goldstein said. In an interview on the “Today” show on Sunday, Rabbi Goldstein recounted the harrowing moments when the gunman entered the synagogue in Poway, Calif., about 25 miles north of San Diego, and opened fire with an A.R. 15-style gun. “My fingers got blown away,” Rabbi Goldstein said. “I cannot erase that face from my mind.” The shooting at Chabad of Poway was the most recent in a string of deadly attacks at houses of worship, including a mass shooting at a mosque in New Zealand in March that was live-streamed on Facebook and fatal bombings at churches in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday that killed more than 300 people. The attack at Chabad of Poway happened six months to the day after one of the deadliest attacks against the American Jewish community killed 11 in a Pittsburgh synagogue. The attack on Saturday left a 60-year-old woman dead, the rabbi wounded, and a 34-year-old man and a young girl with shrapnel wounds. The shooting occurred while there were 40 to 60 people at the synagogue and on Saturday, which was the Sabbath and also the last day of Passover, a holiday that celebrates Jewish freedom. Rabbi Goldstein and those injured were expected to recover but he said he will be scarred for life. “I cannot erase the moment, and it is going to be embedded there forever,” he said. After the gunman, identified by officials as John T. Earnest, 19, shot Rabbi Goldstein in his hand, he shot to death a woman the rabbi had known for 33 years and who had helped him build the synagogue. Rabbi Goldstein said he immediately went into action. “I turned around and I saw a group of children in the banquet hall, including my granddaughter, and I just ran, not even knowing that my fingers were blown off and curled all the kids together and got them outside and went into the sanctuary and got everyone out of the sanctuary to safety,” he said. As they were waiting for the authorities to arrive, Rabbi Goldstein continued the sermon he had started inside the synagogue. “I got up there and just spoke from my heart,” the rabbi said. “Just giving everyone the courage to know, it was just 70 years ago during the Holocaust we were gunned down like this, and I just want to let my fellow Americans know that we’re not going to let this happen.” The authorities called the shooting a hate crime. The gunman was charged early on Sunday with one count of murder in the first degree and three counts of attempted murder. No bail was set. “I’m just so heartbroken and saddened by the senseless killing,” Rabbi Goldstein said. “Everyone needs to be a hero and everyone needs to step up and do something in the face of terror,” he said. He added: “I guarantee you, we will not be intimidated or deterred by terror. Terror will not win.” OpinionCharlie Warzel",The New York Times
2019,‘Tesla Nation’ Review: A Documentary Celebrates Serbian-American Accomplishments,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Nikola Tesla was of Serbian descent and did great things in the United States. The ostensible thesis of “Tesla Nation” is that other Serbs and Serbian-Americans have done great things in the United States, too. Throughout this documentary, an unconvincing actor named Jack Dimich recites excerpts from Tesla’s autobiography. There are also a few digressions that explain the history of major Serbian waves of immigration to America. But mostly, the movie, directed by Zeljko Mirkovic, consists of a barely organized series of interviews with notable Serbs and Serbian-Americans, and name-checks of others. Their ranks include scientists and engineers, writers and athletes. Some, like Karl Malden and Peter Bogdanovich, made their marks in Hollywood. Others, like Helen Delich Bentley of Maryland and George Voinovich of Ohio, served in Congress. It’s not surprising that there have been great Serbian contributions to the United States. But to whom is this film being addressed? The credits indicate that it is part of a project initiated by the Tesla Science Foundation, cryptically described on its website as “the most-active Tesla-related group in the world.” Based on interviews late in the movie, the goal of “Tesla Nation” is to present positive examples of Serbian entrepreneurs who are operating globally and to improve relations between the Serbian diaspora and Serbia itself. That it is showing in a movie theater — as opposed to a tourism bureau or a corporate training session — makes no sense whatsoever.

2019,‘That’s When I Acknowledged What Had Been Simmering Inside Me for Years: Anger’,"Inside the List Back in 2016, the soccer legend Abby Wambach was honored at the ESPY Awards with two other newly retired athletes, Kobe Bryant and Peyton Manning. “As I watched those men walk off the stage,” she writes in “Wolfpack” — a women’s advice book inspired by her viral 2018 commencement speech at Barnard — “it dawned on me that while the three of us were stepping away from similar careers, we were facing very different futures” because of salary disparities. She says now, “I realized that their hustling days were over but mine were just beginning. And that’s when I finally acknowledged what had been simmering inside me for years: anger.” That was the night Wambach became an activist. “Because women are told in a million different ways that the only thing they are allowed to do is be grateful,” she says. She’s not just talking about sports: “The truth is that on average every woman in every industry in every state and every country around the world will earn significantly less than men in equivalent positions throughout her career.” Wambach has never calculated what being a female athlete cost her in actual dollars, “but I’ve imagined it in terms of freedom, because dollars represent respect, and deliver freedom,” she says. “If you work the same as a man, but you don’t earn what he earns because of institutionalized discrimination, then — at the end of a day, and the end of a career — you have less freedom than he does.” Though the U.S. Soccer Federation “invests more in the men’s program, the women still earn more for the federation, and are paid significantly less,” she points out, adding that she’s proud of the American women’s team for recently filing a lawsuit over this discrimination. [ Read about the long history of pay discrimination in sports. ] For Wambach, being an activist means two things. “First, it’s using my platform and privilege to pursue change that is too risky for others to call for,” she says. “Second, it’s encouraging people to become active in their own lives. “Throughout my 20 years of training and playing professionally, there was a moment in every soccer game when I’d feel the energy shift toward me,” she explains. “Whether it was a morale boost, a momentum swing or a goal that we needed — it was my job to make it happen. When I felt that shift, I’d say silently to myself: Let’s go, Abby. It’s your time.” She wants “Wolfpack,” which enters the advice and how-to list this week at No. 3, to empower other women to do the same thing — “to embrace and step into those monumental everyday moments.”",The New York Times
2019,‘The Best of Enemies’ Review: A Klansman and a Civil Rights Activist Become Friends,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. In 1971, C.P. Ellis was the Exalted Cyclops of the Durham, N.C., klavern of the United Klans of America. Ann Atwater was a fair-housing activist, advocating for better treatment for the city’s African-American residents. The beginning of their unlikely real-life friendship is the subject of “The Best of Enemies,” the latest muddled and well-meaning big-screen attempt to find solace in the history of American racism. Don’t get me wrong. The facts of the story, chronicled in a book by Osha Gray Davidson, are eye-opening and inspiring, and the film, written and directed by Robin Bissell, includes some fascinating details about the granular challenges of local politics. As Ellis and Atwater, Sam Rockwell and Taraji P. Henson do what you expect Oscar-nominated actors to do: They clarify and complicate their characters, paying attention to their individuality even as the movie loads them up with symbolic baggage. C.P. loves his family and hates black people, which makes him a fairly normal white person of his time and place. Unlike other movies on similar subjects, “The Best of Enemies” doesn’t treat racial prejudice as a freakish, isolated pathology, but rather as an unremarkable, omnipresent fact of life. C.P. and his Klan brothers aren’t especially extreme. They carry membership cards in their wallets and are openly allied with many of Durham’s political leaders and prominent white citizens, who are fighting a rear-guard action against racial progress. As the movie begins, those forces of reaction seem to be winning. In spite of the civil rights legislation of the previous decade, Ann still argues for basic fairness in front of a City Council composed entirely of white men, one of whom makes a show of turning his back on her when she speaks. Nearly 20 years after Brown v. Board of Education, the schools in Durham are still segregated. When a fire damages the black school that one of Ann’s daughters attends, she and other parents, supported by the N.A.A.C.P., argue that white and black children should be educated together. C.P. and his friends are appalled by the idea. There have been movies that dramatize social change via courtroom debates, street demonstrations and legislative struggles. “The Best of Enemies” is the first I have seen that focuses on a charrette, a term borrowed from design that basically means a period of enforced, deadline-driven discussion. Under the impressively patient guidance of Bill Riddick (Babou Ceesay), a Raleigh-based specialist in this kind of nonviolent process, black and white citizens gather every day to talk. The hope is that by spending time together and working in common, they will discover tools of civility and compromise. It would be interesting to observe the fine grain of this process, a form of nonviolent, democratic politics that seems both wildly idealistic and soberly practical. But the charrette serves as a backdrop for the far more conventional story of a white man’s change of heart and the black woman who brought it about. The political moral of the movie is that change happens when the oppressed are nice to their oppressors. Ann takes it on herself to do a kindness for C.P.’s family, and this causes him to question his beliefs. Meanwhile, his fellow racists, in and out of the Klan, set about intimidating white charrette participants who seem likely to support integration. C.P., in breaking with his side, risks ostracism and worse. There is real danger there, and “The Best of Enemies” doesn’t sugarcoat it. But it makes nearly all of its emotion and suspense depend on what the white people will do. We see a lot of C.P.’s domestic and social activities, getting to know his wife, Mary (Ann Heche), and his best Klan buddy, Floyd (Wes Bentley). But we barely catch a glimpse of Ann’s children, or set foot inside her house. African-American life in Durham is all but invisible, which means that the political, religious and cultural roots of the real story remain offscreen. As do its implications. Like many other movies — “Green Book” being the most recent and popular example — “The Best of Enemies” invites you to believe that racism lies safely in the past. It may not have died the minute C.P. Ellis saw the error of his ways, but the public conversion of a Klansman surely meant its days were numbered. You would never guess that school integration in particular remains an elusive goal, resisted not only by sheet-wearing whites in the South but also by avowed liberals in Northern cities and suburbs. Rather than illuminating the politics of the present by examining the struggles of the past, Bissell lurches from folksy comedy to clattering melodrama, producing the opposite of enlightenment.

2019,‘The Case Against Adnan Syed’: Finale Reveals New DNA Test Results,"This article contains spoilers for the four-part HBO documentary “The Case Against Adnan Syed.” Did Adnan Syed kidnap and murder his ex-girlfriend and high school classmate Hae Min Lee in 1999? A Baltimore County jury in 2000 decided he did. Millions of listeners to the podcast “Serial” haven’t been so sure. Viewers of Sunday night’s finale of the four-part HBO documentary “The Case Against Adnan Syed” will continue to wonder. But they will do so armed with new facts. Chief among them: A series of new forensic tests found no traces of Syed’s DNA on the many samples taken from Lee’s body and car during the original investigation. The series’s director, Amy Berg, made good on HBO’s promise to deliver big revelations on a 20-year-old murder case that “Serial” made famous starting in 2014. Like the podcast, the HBO series offered no definitive statements about Syed’s guilt, but it did raise numerous questions about the methods and conclusions of the state. What’s next? Whatever happens will arrive in a context very different from the one Syed faced less than a month ago, when the highest court in Maryland denied him a retrial, overturning the decisions of two lower courts. Here’s a quick look at the finale’s major revelations. Many samples were taken from Lee during the original investigation, including fingernail clippings and material from necklaces and clothing. New tests performed at the defense’s request revealed that none of the samples tested positive for Syed’s DNA. His DNA also was not found among samples taken from Lee’s car, where prosecutors have said they believe she was strangled. [Read an interview about the series with its director, Amy Berg.] No physical evidence against Syed was presented at his trial in 2000, so these findings could add heft to his innocence claim. Still, there is a major caveat: No one else’s DNA was found on Lee’s body or in her car, either. That means only that the killer, whether it was someone else or Syed, left no detectable trace among the areas sampled. News about the DNA testing was first revealed Thursday by The Baltimore Sun, based on documents obtained by a Freedom of Information Act request. “These results in no way exonerate him,” a spokeswoman for the Maryland Attorney General’s Office told The Sun. According to the documents, one female DNA profile not matching Lee was found on a piece of rope found near the place where Lee was buried. But that profile did not match anyone’s DNA in law enforcement databases. The DNA of investigating officers, who might accidentally have left some material behind, was eliminated. Latent fingerprints pulled from the rearview mirror of Lee’s car did not match Syed’s. The defense requested that they be compared with prints in the database. They did not match with anyone’s prints in the system. Whoever left the prints has never been arrested and booked. [Haven’t yet seen the HBO series? Here’s what to know before watching.] The state’s key witness, Jay Wilds, a former friend of Syed’s, told the police that after he helped Syed bury Lee’s body, he went with Syed to ditch Lee’s car at a grassy lot in a residential area of Baltimore. Wilds led the police to the car about six weeks after Lee was killed. Private investigators hired by Berg asked Erik Ervin, a turf physiologist from the University of Delaware with a Ph.D. in horticulture, to examine the grassy lot, along with photographs of the car from the day police discovered it. Numerous factors — including the freshness of the tire tracks, the freshness of the grass blades visible in the treads and the condition of the grass beneath the car — led Ervin to believe that the car may have been there for a week or less. The private investigators also spoke with Jan Gorniak, the chief medical examiner of Fulton County, Ga. She examined the autopsy report and photographs and surmised that descriptions of Lee’s injuries did not in many ways appear consistent with the theory that she died during a struggle in her car. Because of markings caused by a phenomenon called lividity, which Gorniak described as “the settling of blood after you die,” she said that Lee’s body must have lain for eight to 12 hours somewhere other than where she was ultimately buried, in Baltimore’s Leakin Park. Her assessment contradicts the prosecution’s timeline, which has Syed and Wilds burying Lee’s body about five hours after the slaying. Wilds gave two police interviews and testified at trial, and the contradictions among those accounts were well documented in “Serial” and in earlier episodes of the HBO series. (Click here for a useful comparison of the various timelines Wilds gave to investigators.) They are significant and many. Berg contacted Wilds, who declined to be interviewed for the series. He did, however, provide statements. In them, he made several new claims. One was that the police had coached him to say in his second taped interview that Syed first showed him Lee’s body, in the trunk of her car, at a Best Buy parking lot, not at a meeting point off Edmondson Avenue, as he had originally said. The Best Buy location matches a map drawn by investigators based on cellphone geolocation records. Those records have themselves been called into question — a factor cited in the lower courts’ decisions to vacate Syed’s conviction. In his statement to Berg, Wilds said that Syed showed up to his house in Lee’s car with the body in the trunk. This is new. Also new: Wilds told Berg that Syed asked him to procure 10 pounds of marijuana. Wilds said that once the marijuana was acquired, Syed threatened to turn him in if he did not help bury Lee’s body. The police and prosecutors have consistently stood by their methods and conclusions. According to Syed’s defense lawyer, C. Justin Brown, the state’s attorney general refused as recently as November to offer Syed any plea deal without a full admission of guilt and more prison time.",The New York Times
2019,"‘The Curse of La Llorona’ Review: California Freakin’, With Scares, Laughs and a Murderous Ghost","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. The scares are plentiful and sometimes ticklishly funny in “The Curse of La Llorona,” an enjoyably old-fashioned ghost story. It’s the latest installment in a rapidly expanding horror series that started with “The Conjuring” (2013) and now includes the “Annabelle” flicks (about a devil doll) and “The Nun” (a demon nun). The connective tissue among these titles can be very thin; here, the most obvious link is Father Perez (Tony Amendola), who’s on hand again to explain that, why, yes, evil exists — boo! Like the others in the series, this one largely takes place in the not-too-distant past, which lends a little atmospheric exoticism to the tale. (Also: no handy smartphones for emergencies.) The main story unfolds in a smog-wreathed Los Angeles in 1973 — cue the flare jeans and Curtis Mayfield. Anna (Linda Cardellini), a widow with two kids, works in social services. She’s still mourning for her husband while trying to keep her family together and do her job. This includes investigating some serious weirdness at the Alvarez home, where the wild-eyed mother (Patricia Velásquez) has locked her sons in a closet decorated with eerie markings. As the title announces, there’s a curse hanging over this story, one that soon bedevils Anna, forcing her to deal with weirdness closer to home. She discovers that whatever haunted the Alvarezes has invaded her life and is threatening her children, Chris (Roman Christou) and Sam (Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen). That threat has a name, La Llorona (Marisol Ramirez), a weeping woman in white with an ugly past and insatiable malevolence. Plucked from Mexican folklore (and beyond), this jealous Medea-like figure, whose love turns into consuming hate, has echoed through the ages. She never gets old and she also doesn’t get more interesting, as this movie reminds you. More efficient than ambitious, “La Llorona” is basically a maternal showdown with shock cuts and billowing curtains. The director Michael Chaves, making the most of his silkily mobile, at times predatory camera (he likes to shift the point of view mid-prowl) delivers the horror classics nicely. Every floorboard and door in Anna’s sprawling house seems to get a solo, with squeaks that become shrieks. By the time La Llorona is a regular visitor, Anna’s house has become a haunted world unto itself, each room — bathroom, attic, basement — a stage, complete with a flamboyant entrance and exit. Movies that turn on violence against children can swerve into uncomfortable terrain because kids are such obvious prey but also because the offscreen world is filled with so many real horror stories. There are a few moments, especially in scenes of near-drowning, when Chaves embraces the spectacle of child endangerment a little too lustily. For the most part, though, the movie avoids unmotivated sadism. Like the better titles in this series, it leans on primal fears — the unknown, the certainty of death — and solid actors who can deliver the silliness straight. Even better is how it explores and exploits the divide between comedy and horror. Again and again in “La Llorona,” Chaves creates setups that are so obvious that you giggle, only to turn the dial a bit — and amp the creepiness — so your laughter abruptly cuts out. (The script is by Mikki Daughtry and Tobias Iaconis.) Much like the prowling camera and the editing that smacks you around, this intentionally unstable tone adds to the spookiness as do the syncopated performances. Anna and her children may spend much of the story in near-hell but when a stern shaman (the excellent Raymond Cruz) delivers the phrase “ta-da,” he and this movie show you a little bit of horror heaven.

2019,‘The Dirt’ Sends Mötley Crüe to the Top 10 for the First Time in 11 Years,"On the Billboard album chart this week, the Canadian rapper Nav, a protégé of the Weeknd, opened at No. 1, while a new Netflix biopic propelled Mötley Crüe to the Top 10 for the first time in over a decade. Nav’s “Bad Habits,” released through Republic Records and the Weeknd’s label, XO, opened with the equivalent of 82,000 sales in the United States, including 79 million streams and 24,000 copies sold as a full album, according to Nielsen. Nav’s numbers were helped by bundling deals that offered his fans copies of “Bad Habits” along with tickets to his upcoming tour, and also by the release of a deluxe version of the album, as Billboard noted. Also this week, Ariana Grande’s “Thank U, Next” holds at No. 2, Juice WRLD’s “Death Race for Love” fell to third place after two weeks at No. 1, and the Atlanta rapper Rich the Kid opened at No. 4 with “The World Is Yours 2.” XXXTentacion’s year-old album “?” jumped 22 spots to No. 5, thanks to sales of merchandise bundles connected to the album’s anniversary; XXXTentacion, whose real name was Jahseh Onfroy, was killed last year at age 20. Mötley Crüe’s soundtrack to “The Dirt,” a drama based on a proudly debauched tell-all book on the band, opened at No. 10, the first time Mötley Crüe has reached the Top 10 since its last studio album, “Saints of Los Angeles,” went to No. 4 in 2008. Next week, the 17-year-old pop artist Billie Eilish is expected to have one of the biggest No. 1 openings of the year with her debut album, “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?”",The New York Times

Mao was a wuxia star variously nicknamed “Lady Whirlwind” and “Lady Kung Fu” and is now a successful restaurateur in our own fair city. The 1973 picture “The Fate of Lee Khan” was the first and only time that Hu and Mao teamed up, and it’s the latest restored Hu picture to hit New York. Set during the 1366 rebellion against Mongol rule in China, it pits determined rebel forces against the title character, one of the Khans of Genghis’s line. Lee Khan is a high Mongol official traveling to receive a secret war map, and he’s stopping at the newly opened Spring Inn for his rendezvous. Hu’s films often showcase formidable female fighters, and this one is no exception. The Spring Inn becomes a home for six women fighters. For the resistance, there’s innkeeper Wan Jen-Mi, played by Li Li-Hua, whose long filmography includes the female lead (opposite Victor Mature!) in 1958’s “China Doll,” one of the last pictures directed by the great Frank Borzage. Wan has four new serving girls, plucked from lives of crime and almost exclusively referred to by the colors or patterns of their uniforms. “Peony,” a semi-reformed pickpocket, is played by Mao. A couple of the other servers also show recidivist tendencies, like the former con artist, dressed in red, who haunts the inn’s dice table. But when it’s time to get busy, these undercover rebels do, as when three sword-bearing would-be robbers try to knock the place over. The sixth woman warrior is Lee Wan-erh, Lee Khan’s devoted sister, played by Hsu Feng. A thoroughly ruthless character, she’s calling for beheadings before she’s had her first meal at Spring Inn. Once the players are established, the movie falls into a sweet lather, rinse, repeat mode of scenes, alternating character intrigue and fighting. Because it’s as much a “hangout movie” as it is an action picture, it’s sad at the end to note how many losses the good guys suffered. Such is the way of the wuxia.

2019,"‘The Inheritance’ Triumphs at Olivier Awards, and So Does a Gender-Swapping ‘Company’","LONDON — “The Inheritance,” a two-part, six-and-a-half-hour play about the legacy of AIDS in New York, dominated the Olivier Awards on Sunday night, winning four trophies at the British equivalent of the Tony Awards. At the Royal Albert Hall in London, the play, by Matthew Lopez, won best new play, best director for Stephen Daldry, best actor for Kyle Soller, and best lighting design for Jon Clark. It beat strong competition, including “The Lehman Trilogy,” the acclaimed family saga about the founders of the financial firm, which is playing at the Park Avenue Armory until April 20, and “Sweat,” Lynn Nottage’s Pulitzer Prize-winning play set in working-class Pennsylvania. Mr. Lopez said in an interview that he hoped “The Inheritance” would transfer to Broadway, especially given the play’s setting. “We’ve seen a lot of Brits come over and take home Tonys, so I think it’s only fair really,” Mr. Lopez said, when asked about the play’s success. “The Inheritance” received rave reviews in Britain after opening last year at London’s Young Vic. Dominic Cavendish, writing in The Daily Telegraph, called it “a theatrical marathon that instantly looks like a modern classic,” adding that it was “perhaps the most important American play of the century so far.” The play “pierces your emotional defenses, raises any number of political issues and enfolds you in its narrative,” wrote Michael Billington in The Guardian. It had been nominated for eight awards, the most for any play. Mr. Soller, in his acceptance speech, referred to a new law in Brunei that makes gay sex between men punishable by death. “For those that continue the fight in a world where you can still be stoned to death for loving who you love, thank you,” said the London-based American actor. Last week, numerous celebrities, citing the law, called for a boycott against hotels owned by the Sultan of Brunei. Those include the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles and the Dorchester in London. The success of “The Inheritance” was matched by only two musicals: a gender-swapping version of Stephen Sondheim’s “Company,” and “Come From Away,” the musical about residents of a small Canadian town who had to accommodate 6,700 travelers whose planes were diverted there after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. “Company,” which won best musical revival, was one of the most acclaimed productions in London last year. The New York Times theater critic Ben Brantley wrote that the decision to replace its original male lead with a woman gave the musical “emotional coherence and clout that it never possessed in my previous experiences of the show.” Marianne Elliott, the musical’s director, thanked Mr. Sondheim in her acceptance speech for being “so open to allowing us to meddle with this piece” and believing “that theater could change and evolve and should be of and for the times.” Ms. Elliott said in an interview later that she had no idea if it would transfer to New York but hoped it would. “Come From Away” won best new musical despite receiving less positive reviews in London than it did when it opened on Broadway in 2017. The other success story of the night was a revival of Tennessee Williams’s 1948 play “Summer and Smoke,” which initially showed at the Almeida Theater. It won best revival for a play and best actress for Patsy Ferran. Ms. Ferran beat Gillian Anderson and Sophie Okonedo for the prize, cementing her reputation as a rising star in London theater. Reviewing the play for The Times, Matt Wolf praised her performance, writing that she was “a child-woman teetering on the abyss of tragedy.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘The Lehman Trilogy’ Criticizes Capitalism, at $2,000 a Seat","Big City [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] Since its American debut at the Park Avenue Armory last month, “The Lehman Trilogy” has had New Yorkers of a certain breed held tightly at the forearms. A play about money and decline, it has been chewed over by those still on top. The show was virtually sold out long before it opened, with tickets for the best seats costing more than $400. Tickets for some of the final performances have now reached $2,000 on StubHub, at which point you might consider flying to London — the production returns there next month — spending a night at Claridge’s and buying a royal-baby saltshaker with whatever is left. We are lingering in a moment in which there is a fashion, or even a giddiness, for spending large sums of money on theatrical experiences that explore the foundations and promises of American capitalism. Commenting on the success of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s singular effort in this vein, The Harvard Business Review ran a piece three years ago titled: “Hamilton’s $849 Tickets Are Priced Too Low.” The point was that there were so many people with plenty of money desperate to see the show that too much power was redounding to scalpers. But the fact that there were — and remain — so many people willing to spend so many hundreds or even thousands of dollars on a single evening of live theater suggests something else as well. Technology has so democratized the consumption of culture — much of it of impressively high quality — that it is possible for virtually anyone to stream nearly anything at any time. Naturally, a new system of status was bound to evolve. The housekeeper can watch “The Crown,” but only the mistress of the penthouse can see the musical sensation that has won 11 Tony Awards on her own schedule. During its run, “Springsteen on Broadway” had tickets that sold for as much as $850. But resale platforms made them available for many times that — so it was possible to pay $8,000 to immerse yourself in Bruce’s world of vanished working-class hope. Or you might have realized that if you had that kind of money lying around to spend on two hours at the theater, you may be the root from which the problem weed is spreading. The “Lehman Trilogy” has in its soul a critique of these imbalances, but its criticisms are facile and anodyne enough to offend no one benefiting from them. A history play, enacted by performers of incredible stamina who spend close to three and a half hours on stage, it tells the story of the Lehman brothers — Henry, Emanuel and Mayer — from their arrival in the United States as poor Bavarian immigrants in the middle of the 19th century to the downfall of the bank they eventually created, more than 150 years later. Coming to this country, the Lehmans went straight to Montgomery, Ala., where the cotton business was roaring. They opened a dry goods store but at some point epiphany struck. They realized they could potentially make lots of money serving as middlemen between local cotton plantations and northern mills. The play is not entirely blind to the flaws of its characters but bundles up sufficiently under the pup tent of hagiography to have us assume that the Lehman brothers invented the notion of brokering, a tradition that predates them by at least a millennium. (The word “broker,” just so you can keep this fact on hand, derives from “broceur,” meaning “small trader” in a style of regional French spoken in the eighth century.) Cotton led to business in other commodities and ultimately to money lending and a banking empire. The play’s creator, the Italian dramatist Stefano Massini, mines a well-established idea: that as the Lehmans, and by extension modern capitalism, moved further and further away from the intimate business of buying and selling tangible things to focus on shifting money around for maximum profit — developing abstract financial instruments that ordinary people could not possibly understand — virtue gave way to corruption. “The Lehman Trilogy’’ is not an angry play; it would like you to believe that the greed of dynasties and the values of bloodline are superior to those of the scrappy interlopers who inherit corporate lines of succession when the founding families have either died off or retreated to lives of spirituality. In Mr. Massini’s understanding, trouble found its true engine when the last of the actual Lehmans ran Lehman Brothers and management was given over to the ambitious roughnecks in the trading division rather than the well-mannered investment bankers who had been in charge. Something precious was gone. But what exactly? By completely omitting something terribly obvious — that the original fortune was made on the backs of slaves — the play suggests that the real evildoers were not the kindly young men from Bavaria who sold cloth and simply saw expanding opportunities but the 21st-century financiers who ignited an economic crash, besotted by the idea of bundling subprime mortgages into tranches. “The Lehman Trilogy” comes with an easy appeal to wealthy audiences beyond the mere fact that it’s a play about an investment bank. It affirms the idea that there is a hierarchy of greed and that some forms are more benign than others. What is the harm of passing down outsize wealth from one generation to another, or the tax system that so eagerly supports it? Ultimately, the play coaxes you into leaving with a sober skepticism about the complexities of modern finance that you probably already had before the curtain rose. It just won’t let you feel too guilty.",The New York Times
2019,‘The Lion King’ and Other Trailers That Raise Questions for Us,"In Hollywood, the circle of life has its own meaning. As evidenced by this week’s most interesting trailers, studios keep returning to properties that worked in the past. Here’s the new crop, ranked from most to least derivative. The second promotional clip for Disney’s remake doesn’t answer the questions raised by the initial teaser in November, like: If it’s computer-animated, what sets it apart from the original cartoon? Is it a musical? (It is, although oddly only a snippet of “The Lion Sleeps Tonight” can be heard at the trailer’s end.) And what do Donald Glover and Beyoncé Knowles-Carter sound like as Simba and Nala? Sorry, but we’re not quite feeling the love for this one yet. Technically, this thriller from Luc Besson is a piece of original intellectual property, but it appears eerily reminiscent of the director’s “La Femme Nikita” (1990) and “Léon: The Professional” (1994), which also both followed young women trained to be assassins. (In this case, the title role is played by Sasha Luss, a model raised in Moscow.) It also looks a lot like “Hanna” — the 2011 film directed by Joe Wright that Amazon recently turned into a series — not to mention the Jennifer Lawrence movie “Red Sparrow” and the Jennifer Garner TV drama “Alias.” In the trailer, Anna is compared to a Russian doll, and this similarly seems like a copy of a copy of a … you get the point. “Every family is different, but some families are more different than others,” the narrator notes in the first trailer for the animated film inspired by Charles Addams’s New Yorker cartoons. Scored with the ’60s sitcom version’s finger-snapping theme, the spot doesn’t promise a fresh take on the material, aside from a sly inside joke as Morticia (Charlize Theron) observes of a red balloon, “Strange, there’s usually a murderous clown attached to the end of these.” Finn Wolfhard, the “Stranger Things” actor who also appeared in the clown shocker “It,” voices son Pugsley, and the ensemble also includes Oscar Isaac (father Gomez), Chloë Grace Moretz (daughter Wednesday) and Nick Kroll (Uncle Fester). As in “The Big Sick,” Kumail Nanjiani plays an Uber driver, but that’s the only parallel between his Oscar-nominated 2017 rom-com and this pedal-to-the-metal action comedy. Nanjiani’s hence-the-title character, Stu, picks up a Los Angeles cop (“Guardians of the Galaxy” behemoth Dave Bautista) and finds himself in hot pursuit of a murderer. The odd-couple setup feels a bit hackneyed, but if the film’s gags are as clever as the trailer’s tagline, “Prepare for the Rideshare of Your Life,” “Stuber” could earn a five-star rating. Director-co-star Amy Poehler casts a bevy of fellow “Saturday Night Live” veterans (Maya Rudolph, Rachel Dratch, Ana Gasteyer and Tina Fey as well as writers Paula Pell and Emily Spivey) in this boozy comedy about a group of women who travel to the Napa Valley for a 50th-birthday party. With its mix of physical shtick and raunchy one-liners (“I did Molly in college, but she went back to her boyfriend”), the rollicking trailer for “Wine Country” suggests a middle-aged “Bridesmaids.” And that’s a trip we’ll happily take.",The New York Times
2019,‘The Most Dangerous Year’ Review: A Personal Look at Transgender Rights,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “The Most Dangerous Year” takes its cue from a projection by the Human Rights Campaign that 2016 would see an unprecedented number of efforts in state legislatures to curb the rights of transgender Americans. The documentary zeros in on Washington, where a bill in the State Senate sought to repeal the rule allowing transgender people to use restrooms based on their gender identity. After it failed by one vote in February 2016, a campaign to achieve the same goal by ballot measure began. (At the end, we learn that it fell short of the required signatures to get on the ballot that year.) The film also chronicles a successful effort to introduce a transgender-inclusive policy in one school district. For the director, Vlada Knowlton, who also narrates, all of these processes hit home: She is the parent of a transgender daughter. Through interviews with other parents (and the children themselves), the movie presents a portrait of families who got an intimate education in what it means to be transgender and who now want to educate others. Knowlton makes clear that this can be a difficult process, especially for those who are new to the issues involved. The thorniest scenes show tensions playing out at hearings and public meetings, where both sides clash. While “The Most Dangerous Year” can be intensely personal — Knowlton speaks of the pain she felt watching visitors to a strawberry festival sign the petition for the anti-transgender ballot measure — it is primarily an informational documentary, not a film with artistic pretensions. But it makes its case effectively. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.",The New York Times
2019,‘The Public’ Review: Emilio Estevez Takes Us to the Library for a Civics Lesson,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Apart from Frederick Wiseman’s “Ex Libris: The New York Public Library,” few movies have celebrated book-lending institutions as havens of fair-mindedness and pluralism, so it’s tempting to give a pass to “The Public” as a rousing, lovingly made civics lesson, even if its screenplay does not seem fated for shelves. Emilio Estevez wrote, directed and served as a producer on the film; he is also its star. Inspired by an essay that appeared in The Los Angeles Times in 2007, the movie isn’t the actor-filmmaker’s first brush with earnest Americana. (His ensemble piece “Bobby” (2006) tried to capture the optimism at the Ambassador Hotel in 1968 as admirers of Robert F. Kennedy awaited his arrival.) But it may be his most substantive. At what other physical institution can you learn about virtually any topic? Where else are the homeless welcomed as equals, at least until they are not? (A subplot deals with the fallout from a patron’s eviction for body odor.) And if libraries are microcosms of democracy, what does it mean that they are sometimes closed? The bulk of the movie takes place inside a public library in Cincinnati as the city braces for a cold snap. Estevez plays Stuart Goodson, a librarian on easy conversational terms with the homeless who camp out there every day. Then one night, during the potentially fatal arctic chill, Jackson (Michael K. Williams) informs Stuart that the city’s shelters are full. He and a large group of other men simply won’t leave. Estevez does an elegant job with this setup, creating a low-key, uncondescending portrait of lives on the edge. Stuart has his own checkered past, as does the building manager for his apartment (Taylor Schilling), a recovering alcoholic and new romantic interest. The standoff is when the eye-rolls begin. Alec Baldwin is brought in as a police negotiator, who, incidentally, is looking for his son on the streets. Christian Slater is a prosecutor and mayoral candidate who senses an opportunity — and has already rebuked Stuart after the city faced legal consequences for the body odor episode. Most egregiously, Gabrielle Union plays a TV news reporter determined to portray the protest as a hostage situation. At the film’s nadir, Stuart, on the phone with her during a broadcast, stops making his case and begins quoting from “The Grapes of Wrath.” Despite having internet and cellphones, the protesters have surprising trouble getting their message out. Yet in other respects, “The Public” seems overly thought through. Even small details — a song selection, the price of pizza — return as crucial plot points later on, often in silly ways that undermine authenticity. So, too, perhaps, does the contrived character of Big George (the rapper Che Smith, a.k.a. Rhymefest), a gentle giant and a newcomer to the library’s homeless scene who proves crucial to events. The movie’s literary virtues, in other words, are up for debate. Its sincerity, though, is not.

2019,‘The Silence’ Review: Fleeing Winged Peril for a Quieter Place,"Streaming Movie Review When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. There may come a time when the Netflix algorithm grows sophisticated enough to cut out the middle man and write its own scripts, but until that day arrives, niche-targeted dreck like “The Silence” will have to suffice. If the streaming service’s recent hit “Bird Box” seemed like an ocular companion to the aural deprivation of “A Quiet Place,” this new film feels like a de facto prequel, catching the apocalyptic moment when hordes of sound-sensitive creatures wipe out the bulk of humanity. For Shane Van Dyke, who wrote the script with his brother Carey, such “mockbuster” enterprises are his business: His credits include off-brand entertainments like “Transmorphers 2” and “Paranormal Entity,” and he even wrote and directed “Titanic II,” a disaster film set on a replica ship 100 years after the original voyage. Here, only a quality cast and more generous production values can cover up the shoddy stitching. Though adapted from a 2015 novel by Tim Lebbon — himself a movie novelization specialist — “The Silence” echoes “A Quiet Place” in most of its particulars, including a deaf child fleeing with her family to a country refuge. Kiernan Shipka, of “Mad Men” fame, acquits herself well as Ally, a teenager whose heightened perception helps her parents (Stanley Tucci and Miranda Otto), grandmother (Kate Trotter) and little brother (Kyle Harrison Breitkopf) escape pterosaur-like carrion called “Vesps.” The family dog has more trouble keeping mum. “The Silence” posits a grand evolutionary struggle between mankind and its winged tormentors, but every moment feels like regression.

2019,‘The Volunteer’ Braids the Lives of Fathers and Sons,"Fiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. THE VOLUNTEER By Salvatore Scibona Even an inexhaustible subject can become tired. The treatment of selfhood, arguably the richest subject for the novel, has taken two notable courses in recent American fiction. After the memoiristic work we called auto-fiction has come another kind of novel that, perhaps overwhelmed by the absurdity and sprawl of political reality, moves just beyond the self to draw highly circumscribed worlds — a trio of characters, say, absorbed in their own relations, in one setting, over a year or so. (I should say I have read and admired many of these novels, and also that I wrote one of them.) One of the most thrilling things about Salvatore Scibona’s second book, “The Volunteer,” is a refusal not just of this novelistic trend of smallness, but also of our own craven, personal brand-driven cultural moment. This novel’s question is not how a person might become himself through “finding,” but how he might lose everything, and, through losing, gain an honest apprehension of the world. We begin with a small boy abandoned in an airport. His father, Elroy, leaves this unwanted child behind and makes his way to the man who was once his legal guardian, whom we come to know as Vollie Frade. He is another unwanted son, born to aging cattle ranchers in rural Iowa. What follows is a magnificent counterpoint of four generations of fathers and sons who roam geography and experience as Scibona braids the narrative strands of his various men in a way that is both disciplined and symphonic. What an audacity to build a novel around a character preoccupied with self-erasure! But, for a nobody, the main character of Scibona’s novel is a compelling somebody: Vollie is a nickname of a nickname (the eponymous Volunteer), but why his parents call him this remains a mystery, as does his real name, as does his very character. At 17 he shocks himself when he signs up with the Marines, an acte gratuit that prompts his mother to remark, “I’m surprised they let a person just take himself away like that.” This is neither the first nor last instance of Vollie taking himself away; he has already experienced a hallucinatory vision of self-loss when, as a small boy, he watched his parents burn his clothes as a precaution against an outbreak of meningitis. To Vollie, it seems that it’s him they’re burning. Afterward, a revelation: “His self was a ‘who’ who had burned away in the flames; but the creature was a ‘what’ that could endure even this. The self that had seemed all of him was only a part; it could be shed and left behind.” When he contracts the illness nonetheless, it’s his first almost-death of many. Later, as a Marine in Cambodia in the ’70s, “he kept on unaccountably not getting killed.” Scibona is a savage coiner of similes, one who’ll cut sublimity with bathos to snatch a reader’s breath away: “In the night, he went out to piss, and the stars were like a kitchen mess across a dark floor.” There are also roving, lyrical long shots of Queens streets that, in their grit and dazzle, recall the boyhood Bronx of Don DeLillo’s “Underworld.” Like DeLillo in that book, Scibona wreaks an epic from the lives of ordinary, supposedly negligible men. His lens zooms in and out of streets, rooms, consciousnesses. It becomes kaleidoscopic during those moments in which, with sickening inexorability, a life can go wrong. Appropriately for a novel of the anti-self, much of this wrongness is passively accomplished: A man fails to prevent a murder, a man fails to father his son, another father fails to defend himself against another son. Here is a masculinity not of muscular exertion but baleful inaction. A particular American violence seems refracted among these men, and it’s such violence that induces one character to think, “A person was a world that walked through the world.” By paying grave attention to both worlds, both the self and everything beyond it, Scibona has built a masterpiece.

2019,"‘The White Crow’ Review: The Young Nureyev, Gotta Dance! Gotta Defect!","When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “The Raft of the Medusa” is a large, foreboding painting filled with drama and writhing male bodies. Painted by Théodore Géricault in the early part of the 19th century, it shows a tangle of men crowded on a raft after an accident. Some appear dead, while others signal toward some unseen sight, perhaps salvation, their ropy muscles tense with effort but also with beauty. In “The White Crow,” the young Soviet dancer Rudolf Nureyev visits this painting at the Louvre. What does he see — death, life, hope, divinity? Ralph Fiennes, who directed the movie, doesn’t tell you, and neither does the face of Oleg Ivenko, the ballet dancer playing (and dancing) Rudy. The character is transfixed by the painting, and as his eyes — and the camera — sweep over the images something meaningfully seems ready to emerge. It doesn’t, creating an unmet expectation that becomes familiar in “The White Crow,” a fictional take on the early life of Nureyev that hits its biographical marks dutifully. As handsome and self-serious as its subject, the movie focuses on his young adulthood, glances back at his early struggles and gestures at his later fame. Every so often during the dance sequences, it also shows you beauty. These moments are a balm, the very thing that you impatiently wait for while Rudy pouts and practices and repeatedly demonstrates that the young Nureyev — or the film’s conception of him — was more of a vital and engaging presence onstage than off. It makes sense that any great dancer, perhaps especially one of the most renowned of the 20th century, would fascinate when he’s leaping and nearly levitating across a stage. The problem is that while there are dance performances scattered throughout “The White Crow,” as well as interludes with a sweaty Rudy practicing and striving, the offstage scenes tend to feel like filler, the bits stuck between the barre and the theater. Written by David Hare, the movie opens around 1961, after Rudy has defected to the West. It’s a promising start because of Fiennes’s presence as Alexander Pushkin, Rudy’s teacher and mentor in Leningrad. Pushkin, his face gray and hairline in severe retreat, looks defeated, almost deflated, as if every atom in his body has surrendered. He and a government type are discussing Rudy (the kid’s gotta dance!), a scene that activates the story by turning back the clock. From that point on, the timeline jumps around, perhaps in imitation of its high-flying subject, landing in different moments in Rudy’s life. A lot of what follows is drowsily watchable. Soon after Pushkin’s entrance, Rudy makes several of his own: on a Soviet train, where he’s born in 1938; as an adult on a plane; as a boy in a colorless childhood filled with snow and Ashcan browns; and as a teenage student. Though Fiennes keeps changing the aspect ratio, the movie settles down once Rudy lands in Paris smiling under a beret. At the height of the Cold War, the Kirov Ballet has gone west to perform at the Paris Opera House (Palais Garnier). Rudy embraces Paris, visits the sights, dazzles audiences and hangs out with a dreary crowd. In time, he defects. (The cast includes the exasperatingly limp Adèle Exarchopoulos as an heiress.) Nureyev certainly seems an ideal candidate for big-screen memorializing: He was sternly beautiful, wildly talented, feverishly acclaimed. But if you didn’t know why he was considered a transcendent dancer or a transformational figure, you still won’t know after the final credits roll. Rudy’s dances are well-shot — Fiennes emphasizes the entire body in motion so the viewer can trace its line — but they’re pretty and bloodless instead of thrilling, which doesn’t encourage offscreen oohing and ahhing. Like most movies about great art, “The White Crow” only points at the sublime without ever expressing it. One flaw that Fiennes never transcends is Ivenko, a dancer with a Russian company who slides off the screen when not onstage. The busy, mosaic structure doesn’t help, while the emphasis on Nureyev’s origin story seems a mistake, particularly because his name no longer means what it once did. In a 1962 review, the year after Nureyev defected, the British critic Richard Buckle announced the arrival of the “pop dancer,” writing, “What the telly did for art, what Billy Graham did for religion, Nureyev has done for ballet.” Rudy the pop dancer is missing, as is the global star who dabbled as a matinee idol (“Valentino”), was a casualty of the AIDS crisis and still inspires veneration, however artfully muddled.

Two couples, two pregnancies and two dead bodies right up front make “The Wind,” Emma Tammi’s first narrative feature, a frontier ghost story with very human stakes. And maybe a very human explanation: Like Tommy Lee Jones’s marvelous 2014 Western, “The Homesman,” this pioneer chiller shines a gender-specific spotlight on the ways isolation and hardship can ravage a woman’s mind. The first time we see Lizzy (an intense Caitlin Gerard), she’s exiting her log cabin bearing a bloody bundle and wearing a traumatized expression. “How did she get my gun?” she asks her husband, Isaac (Ashley Zukerman), and their new neighbor, Gideon (Dylan McTee), whose erstwhile wife, Emma (Julia Goldani Telles), is about to follow her newborn into the ground. Frequent flashbacks show Emma’s gradual descent from emotional fragility to hallucinatory breakdown as a religious tract about demons becomes an obsession. Soon Lizzy, left alone while Isaac fetches supplies, is also beset by terrifying, shape-shifting apparitions. Their provenance and intentions are unclear, but Lizzy, a staunch German immigrant, isn’t about to give in to her fears. Atmospheric if narratively thin, “The Wind” (similarities to the 1928 silent film of the same name are coincidental) kicks up a competitive dynamic between the two women that further muddies the psychological waters. Teresa Sutherland’s nonlinear screenplay emphasizes the godlessness of the setting, while terse dialogue and a moaning, percussive sound design enhance its oppressive loneliness. The movie’s most striking aspect, though, is Lyn Moncrief’s arresting cinematography, which turns the vast vacancy of the plains into both hostile observer and hellish metaphor. The story might finally slip its leash, but the baleful mood holds firm.

2019,‘There Are Bad Actors Out There’: Readers Discuss Safety When Using a Ride-Share,"Times readers share some close calls and offer advice for protecting yourself. Ride-share companies are facing increased pressure to ensure their users’ safety and to provide better identification for their drivers after the death of Samantha Josephson, a University of South Carolina student who was killed last weekend after she got into a car she believed was her Uber. The Times’s Jack Healy reported Thursday about other incidents in which ride-share users, mostly young women, have been assaulted, kidnapped or robbed by someone posing as a driver. Uber sent an email to customers on Thursday imploring them to “Check your ride, every time.” We asked readers to share their stories of scary experiences with ride-share services. We heard from passengers and legitimate drivers alike, who offered advice for navigating these frightening situations. In some cases, drivers who don’t work for ride-share companies said they have been startled by would-be passengers trying to get into their cars. Here are some of those responses, which have been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. I was lucky! A few years ago I was visiting New York and decided to use the Uber app I had read about to go to the Metropolitan Opera. I stood on the curb outside my hotel looking at my phone as a Lincoln Town Car pulled up. “Are you my Uber?” I naïvely asked. “Yes. Yes. Get in.” When we arrived at Lincoln Center the driver asked for $20. “Doesn’t this go on my account?” I handed him the money and stepped out of the car, somewhat puzzled by my first Uber experience. Later, when I checked my voice mail, my real Uber driver said, “I am here at the Carlyle Hotel … ” I have since learned to verify all the driver details before getting in a car. — Kathryn Ryder Boussemart, 63, Palm Beach, Fla. I was leaving a club in a desolate part of the city in the small hours of the morning and got into the only car waiting on the block thinking it was my Lyft. The guy had a box of doughnuts in the back and I told him I would move them and started small talk. Before we got to the end of the block he stopped and said, “I am not your driver,” so I got out, in shock. I probably would have figured it out myself within the next couple of minutes but whoa was that a close call! I am increasingly choosing to drive myself if I can chance the parking situation in the city, which I increasingly do since it is a much better experience than rolling the dice with a Lyft/Uber. On that note, this urban dweller will not be relinquishing her car anytime soon. — Julia V., 33, San Francisco I’m currently studying abroad in the Dominican Republic. It’s actually quite common here for the car to not match what the app says; people borrow their friend’s cars, or drivers have their original account suspended so they share a profile with a friend. My tactic is to always check that they have my profile up on their phones. There was a ride I took where the driver canceled the trip on the app as soon as we got in the car (I don’t have data service here so I didn’t find this out until I got to Wi-Fi) and drove us around the city, ignoring our directions. He charged us three times the average toll, and Uber can’t do anything about this since the trip was technically canceled. If I could do it over again, I’d get out of the car as soon as I suspected he was trying to scam us. It’s hard to know when you’re doing the right thing in such an intimidating situation. — Liz Roberts, 21, Saratoga Springs, N.Y. Recently, I decided to try a Lyft in Sunny Isles Beach, Fla., where I vacation. When the car arrived, there was already one female passenger. I noted that the license plate did not match the plate indicated on the app, and pointed this out to the driver, who said, “Sometimes I drive a different car.” His face did match the app photo. He pulled away and should have driven straight west. However, he left course and drove to a less populated industrial area. I asked him where he was going. He said, “To pick someone else up.” Four miles later, I told him to “let me out of the car.” The other female passenger did not speak English and she agreed this felt “wrong in some way.” I didn’t want to leave her alone. The uncommunicative driver said he “couldn’t find his pickup” and wanted me to calm down. I said, “I do not like this.” I pretended to be on a phone call with a loved one (a very protective and angry loved one), describing the area, giving the license plate, the driver’s name and street names. He did not slow down but did turn around and head to the most direct route. What should have been simple turned into something else. Immediately following I contacted Lyft and asked them to respond to my concerns. What I got was a standard email that dismissed my concerns. The email said, “OOPS that’s on us” and “sometimes our drivers are asked to pick up … ” Not what I expected. The Lyft response was unacceptable and made me rethink this whole Lyft/Uber thing. — Rebecca Krueger, 53, Bay Village, Ohio After parking my car recently, a young woman jumped in the back seat thinking I was her Uber ride. She was so careless that she did not even notice I had no Uber decal. After some confusion on both our parts, she spotted her actual Uber ride, apologized and jumped out. Her Uber ride car was not even the same color as mine. I hope this horrible story will get people to be a lot more careful, but ride-share companies need to come up with solutions not only for people who are paying attention, but those who are not. It is very easy to get distracted when you are with a group having fun and in many other scenarios. — Michael Rodriguez, 55, Corvallis, Ore. I am a driver. I can’t tell you how many times people try to hop in my car without looking and think I am their driver. There are bad actors out there, and you are the first person responsible for your safety. I can go on with hundreds of stories, but I am going to leave the ladies here some advice. If you are in a situation where you actually have someone who you think may not be a legitimate driver, fake it that you are receiving a phone call. Act extremely upset that your loved one was just rushed to a hospital. Tell the driver to bring you straight to the local emergency room. Now why do you ask about the emergency room? Simple, they are open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. There are always people there, and there is almost always a cop stationed there. Go inside and wait for the driver to leave, and then order a new car. — Matthew J. Andras, 48, Atlantic Highlands, N.J. Unfortunately, I regularly experience men telling me that they are my Uber driver when I am waiting for an Uber in Boston. It usually happens when I am waiting alone for an Uber outside of a bar or other highly trafficked spot. I have never gotten into one of these cars and I am fortunate that the first time that it happened I was walking where I needed to go and hadn’t called for a ride-share. — Sara Goldman, 22, Boston This happens to young women far more often than is reported. I had a similar situation in 2016 in Washington, waiting for an Uber on Wisconsin Avenue (in a well-lit, wealthy area). As my Uber X was supposed to arrive, a black car pulled up like clockwork. The driver rolled down the window and said he was my ride. As I was about to open the door and get in, something didn’t feel right. I hesitated and checked my app to make sure it was my car. He became increasingly insistent that he was my ride, and that he could give me a ride to wherever I want to go. Thankfully I realized he wasn’t an Uber driver and politely declined his ride. Unfortunately, at the time, I didn’t know this was a growing problem and didn’t know how to report it. Predatory drivers are scanning the sidewalks seeking women waiting for Ubers, even in areas you wouldn’t expect. — Amy Casey, 23, Brooklyn, N.Y.

2019,‘There’s Poison in the Sea’: An Oil Spill Fouls a Tropical Eden,"On Rennell, an impoverished Pacific island, mining had already scarred the land. Now an oil spill has polluted the water and threatens a World Heritage site. The Hong Kong-flagged Solomon Trader, carrying bauxite mined on Rennell Island, ran aground in violent weather in February and has been leaking oil ever since.CreditCreditDavid Maurice Smith for The New York Times KANGAVA BAY, Rennell Island — On Rennell Island, a wild, windswept speck in the Pacific Ocean, water binds everything, from its teeming tropical rain forest to its craggy limestone cliffs. It is the lifeblood of the island’s impoverished people, a source of income and sustenance. But a spill of hundreds of tons of heavy fuel oil from a cargo ship has now fouled the water off its southern coast. And residents have no choice but to keep eating from it. “They told us there’s poison in the sea,” said William Teikagei, 60, who lives in a shack he built on the beach. “But we have no money, so we still fish.” An environmental disaster is unfolding here on Rennell, a coral atoll 2,000 miles northeast of Australia that is home to a World Heritage site with a vast lake ringed by dense forest. It began nearly three months ago, when a ship carrying metal ore bound for China slammed into a reef during one of the violent storms that frequently rake this island of fewer than 2,000 people. The vessel is still leaking fuel, staining the white-sand beaches and imperiling a delicate marine ecosystem — a reminder of the reach and cost of humanity’s operations to extract resources from the planet. 200 MILES Pacific Ocean SOLOMON ISLANDS Honiara GUADALCANAL RENNELL ISLAND Coral Sea PAPUA NEW GUINEA 1,000 MILES Area of detail FIJI Coral Sea AUSTRALIA Sydney NEW ZEALAND By The New York Times The Polynesian population on Rennell has no phone, television or radio service. Medical care is a flight away in Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands, which includes Rennell. The islanders have few working vehicles, and the airfield is little more than a grassy paddock along a bumpy dirt road. But what Rennell does have are mining operations and the infrastructure and foreign workers that come with them. Mining trucks tear past villages day and night, moving through the forest to the port, leaving a trail of dust behind them. The oil spill is not Rennell’s first mining-related calamity: The operations have gouged red gashes in the coastline and left gaping holes in the forest. The grounded ship was carrying bauxite, an ore used to make aluminum. Bauxite mining on the western side of Rennell has been shadowed by allegations of rampant corruption, deception of landowners and regulatory violations. Yet with few prospects for revenue, and with little ability, or perhaps desire, to keep corporate interests in check, the Solomons government has allowed mining and logging at an unsustainable pace. The Solomon Islands, a nation of hundreds of islands in the western Pacific, is one of the poorest on earth, with an unstable Parliament that frequently changes hands. Honiara is on Guadalcanal, the site of pitched fighting between the United States and Japan during World War II. Until the late 1970s, the country was a British protectorate. Bauxite mining began in 2014. All of the ore from Rennell goes to China, by far the world’s largest producer of aluminum. Chinese logging is also threatening to wipe out the country’s rain forest. Island residents, however, have seen little in return. “West Rennell was mined because people were tricked and misled,” said George Tauika, chairman of Lake Tegano World Heritage Site Association. “You can see the damage with the naked eye.” “People are desperate and believe mining and logging is the only alternative,” he added. In March, Rick Hou, the Solomon Islands’ incumbent prime minister, said the country was essentially not benefiting from the Rennell mining operation, which was approved under a previous administration. The operator is an Indonesian company, Bintan Mining, whose directors are from China and Hong Kong. Last month, Mr. Hou, in the run-up to an April 3 election, announced an investigation into how the lease for the bauxite mining was issued. “It is my government’s view that exporting our resources for virtually no economic return is immoral and unacceptable,” he said. Mr. Hou said the oil spill — now estimated at 300 tons of oil, much more than initially forecast — had caused irreversible damage. And not just to the environment: It has only deepened a sense among Rennell residents that they are a forgotten people. Rennell, the world’s largest raised coral atoll, is the most geographically isolated among the Solomons. After the 700-foot ship, the Hong Kong-flagged Solomon Trader, ran aground on Feb. 5, it was pushed farther into the reef by a cyclone. The ship had been loading bauxite in Kangava Bay, which is threatened by cyclones from November to April. The ship’s owner, King Trader, from which Bintan had chartered the vessel, and its insurer, the Korea Protection and Indemnity Club, were slow to react, allowing oil to spill uncontrolled for weeks, Australian officials said. Soon after the accident, officials declared that oil had spread along more than three miles of coastline. They said that it was approaching the World Heritage site, called East Rennell, which includes the largest lake in the insular Pacific and many endemic land and marine species. Amid squabbles over liability, the parties involved eventually brought in cleanup equipment and teams under international pressure. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority was asked to lead the effort to sweep up the oil out at sea, and a salvage company, Resolve Marine Group, has led cleanup efforts onshore. Workers and villagers now roam the shoreline in oil-stained white suits and orange boots, removing the fuel. “Do we have a choice?” said one resident, Ribeka Tago, when asked why she was helping Resolve. “We are worried,” she continued, adding, “It’s toxic in the sea.” Villagers say they have felt sick after breathing oil fumes in the searing heat. Their skin itches, and their children have been vomiting, they say. On March 7, Mr. Hou, the prime minister, said his government was considering temporarily halting loading activities at the port run by Bintan. He stopped short of suspending mining operations. But in a surprise move, Mr. Hou said he had instructed officials to investigate how a company called Asia Pacific Investment Development obtained a mining lease. Bintan mines the bauxite under contract with that company. A report by the nation’s attorney general has already found that the lease was granted without a recommendation from the country’s Mines and Minerals Board — a breach of law. In 2015, Asia Pacific Investment Development was found guilty of illegal logging in the Solomons. Experts said the company had reinvented itself for bauxite mining but employed the same tactics it used in the logging industry. “Rennell demonstrates how corporate actors have colluded with national-level political and bureaucratic elites,” said Matthew Allen, a professor at the University of the South Pacific in Fiji, who has written a book about mining in the region. Mr. Allen cited local accounts that middlemen had paved the way for Asia Pacific Investment Development, and then Bintan, by making good-will payments and providing all-expenses-paid trips to Honiara, the capital. But while Mr. Hou has taken a harsher tone after the oil spill, he has not exactly cracked down on Bintan. His government issued prospecting licenses to the company for nearby islands a day after he called its activities immoral. Asked to comment for this article, Bintan sent clips of a news article about its lawsuit against the shipowner. The sites where Bintan operates were supposed to be mined in phases and progressively rehabilitated, according to an environmental impact assessment. But that never happened. One resident, Tupuitenuku Hu’aitemanongi, accused Bintan of digging on his ancestral lands, destroying graveyards and other important sites. “Some of my family members and relatives were harmed in our first encounter, and though we reported them to the police in Rennell, they did nothing,” he said. People rely on the slim pickings from the mining. But not everyone benefits from royalties, employment or the basic facilities the company provides, leaving the island divided. “They work on our land,” said Obed Saueha, chief of the Tenuginuku tribe. “But we don’t have any power.” Still, residents want the wrecked ship out of their sight. Words scrawled in red paint on the Solomon Trader make that clear. “Sorry, it’s time to go,” it reads. An earlier version of an Oceania map with this article gave the incorrect scale for the region. The scale bar represents 1,000 miles, not 100. The scale for the accompanying map of the Solomon Islands was correct.",The New York Times

2019,‘They Didn’t Burn Down Our Spirit’: Louisiana Black Churches Defiant Amid Fires,"As the authorities investigated a series of blazes that destroyed three black churches, residents gathered Sunday with a mix of concern and defiance. A fire burned down Greater Union Baptist Church in Opelousas, La., on April 2.CreditCreditWilliam Widmer for The New York Times OPELOUSAS, La. — Much of Monica Harris’s identity is tied to the Greater Union Baptist Church, a 129-year-old sanctuary that has been at the center of her family for generations. As a child, she was dunked into a baptismal basin and then paraded like a princess up the aisle in a white dress and white patent leather shoes. She was married at the church, and she said goodbye to her parents there, too. And so she felt like a piece of her was missing when she set eyes upon the charred remains of Greater Union, one of three predominantly black churches in St. Landry Parish, La., that law enforcement authorities said were set ablaze and destroyed over the stretch of 10 days. “Seeing the church in the condition it is now,” Ms. Harris, 57, said of the tan brick sanctuary where her parents raised their 12 children and where they celebrated dozens of weddings, funerals and Bible studies, “it’s almost like losing a family member.” It was still not known Monday whether the fires were intentionally set or whether they were motivated by racism. Still, they have drawn the attention of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the F.B.I., which are assisting the Louisiana state fire marshal. The authorities said Monday that they were vetting new information every hour and that an A.T.F. crane had arrived at one of the churches to help process the scene. Representative Clay Higgins, a Republican representing the area, said in an interview on Monday that based on information from the investigators and his own observations of the crime scenes, “the method of each burn is notably the same,” suggesting that the fires were related. A day earlier, Mr. Higgins, who left his job as a captain in the local sheriff’s office after he referred to alleged gang members who were black as “animals,” posted a video to Facebook directed at whoever burned down the churches. “Your only path to freedom is through jail,” he told the camera as he stood before a pile of charred bricks and rubble that is now St. Mary Baptist Church in nearby Port Barre. “Turn yourself in because you’re going to jail, one way or the other.” Over the weekend, as the authorities worked to sort out what happened, black residents gathered for services with a mix of befuddlement, concern and defiance. “They burned down a building,” the Rev. Harry J. Richard of Greater Union preached at a makeshift gathering Sunday in Opelousas. “They didn’t burn down our spirit.” Two of the fires took place in Opelousas — at Greater Union and Mount Pleasant Baptist — and the third was at St. Mary Baptist in Port Barre. Officials reported a fourth, smaller fire that was “intentionally set” at a predominantly white church in Caddo Parish, about three hours north. In his State of the State address on Monday, Gov. John Bel Edwards called the fires “disturbing.” “Churches are sacred places, and no one should fear for their safety in their house of worship,” he said. The blazes have evoked uneasy recollections of racist attacks on black churches across the country. But parishioners and residents said they would also let the investigation unfold before making any judgments about what the fires might say about their community, which is just north of Lafayette. With a black population — nearly 42 percent — that is larger than many of the surrounding areas, St. Landry Parish is a place where an eccentric black Republican politician and lawyer has defended Klansmen in court, and where a nondenominational Christian congregation has attracted a diverse crowd and grown so much that it recently broke ground on a new $12 million, 43,000-square-foot building. “We are a very close-knit society here in St. Landry Parish,” said Elbert Guillory, 75, a former Republican state senator from Opelousas who defended the Klansmen. “There are good relationships within the black community and there are very good relationships interracially. And so you’d have to wonder, where does this come from? Who’s doing it and for what reason?” Tamiko Chatman, 48, who is black and who was born and raised in Opelousas, said it has never been a place where black and white residents seemed to clash. But people did not interact much across racial lines when she was growing up, she said. In high school, mostly black students attended the prom that was organized by the school, she said, while white students held their own prom elsewhere. Still, she said, some divisions can be found today in the town of more than 16,000 residents, three-quarters of whom are black. It has a strong ecumenical church community, but events tend to draw either mostly white people or mostly black people, depending on which congregation is hosting. And some community members still have problems with interracial relationships, said Clayre Savage, 19, who is white and who said her grandparents discouraged her from dating outside her race. There were uneasy feelings, too, among some classmates when black students started being bused to their mostly white middle school campus because of a desegregation program that had stemmed from a court case. Still, Ms. Savage said she had a difficult time believing that racism would be behind the church burnings, because she had not personally witnessed that sort of behavior in her community. Greater Union members, too, said they were puzzled. They said they had not experienced open racial hostilities in St. Landry Parish, a predominantly agricultural community with a deep pride in a francophone heritage that has spawned rich culinary and cultural traditions, like boudin and zydeco, and where one in four residents live in poverty. “I can’t comprehend that at all,” Ms. Harris said. “There was really nothing per se that led up to it.” While church burnings might seem like a vestige from the country’s Jim Crow past, there have been notable instances in recent memory. In 1996, three black churches burned on the same night in Baton Rouge, and the authorities determined that the fires were a hate crime committed by a group of young adults. Shortly after Dylann Roof, a white supremacist, killed nine black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., in 2015, several black churches were set ablaze in Southern states, though it was unclear whether the fires were racially motivated. “For decades, African-American churches have served as the epicenter of survival and a symbol of hope for many in the African-American community,” Derrick Johnson, the N.A.A.C.P. president, said in a statement on Monday condemning the fires. “As a consequence, these houses of faith have historically been the targets of violence.” Many of the 100 or so congregants at Greater Union are related. The church sits on land with a cemetery where many of its former members are buried, including Ms. Harris’s parents, Joseph Jr. and Hilda Guidry, who died two months apart last year. Preaching from a white, windowless room in the low-slung Masonic Lodge in Opelousas, Mr. Richard said he wanted to deliver a message to whoever was behind the fires. He had an usher place an empty chair next to his brown lectern, a seat for someone he called “Mr. Firestarter.” “We forgive you, Mr. Firestarter,” Mr. Richard said, his voice rising and straining with each sentence. “We love you, Mr. Firestarter. We thank you because you didn’t burn up our children. Our prayer for you, Mr. Firestarter, is that you meet our savior.” An earlier version of this article misidentified the congregation of a church in Caddo Parish that suffered a fire. It is a predominantly white church, not a predominantly black one.",The New York Times
2019,"‘They Will Bounce Back’: In Seattle, Where the Boeing Max Is Built, They’ve Recovered Before","Seattle is feeling the pain from Boeing’s 737 Max crisis, but the aircraft manufacturer has weathered other tough challenges. Boeing announced on Friday that it would slow production of its 737 planes in Renton, Wash., just outside Seattle.CreditCreditGrant Hindsley for The New York Times SEATTLE — Just south of Seattle’s Boeing Field and the Museum of Flight sits another shrine to aviation, Randy’s Restaurant. Model airplanes are suspended from the 24-hour diner’s ceiling, with flight manuals and various dog-eared aerospace tomes strewn about its candy-colored booths. Given its proximity to a major outpost of the Boeing Company, Randy’s has served more than its fair share of chicken-fried steak and brick-shaped hash browns to Boeing employees and their families, among them Ron Russell. Mr. Russell’s son works at Boeing’s aircraft assembly plant in the city of Everett, where he used to install doors on 747s. His mother also worked for Boeing. He doesn’t have to think back too far to remember 1971, when a global economic slowdown and skyrocketing oil prices prompted the company to lay off more than half its work force, sending Seattle into a tailspin. Now, as the company grapples with a pair of fatal crashes involving its most popular airplane, the 737 Max, Mr. Russell points to Boeing’s record of resilience as proof that it will be able to overcome the latest troubles. Will its engineers be able to design a solution to the technical conundrum that threatens the company’s best-selling jet ever, which now has been grounded worldwide? “Sure,” Mr. Russell said, without missing a beat. A total of 189 people died aboard a Lion Air flight that went down in Indonesia in October 2018, while a second fatal Max crash in Ethiopia last month claimed 157 lives. On Friday, as preliminary findings from the Ethiopia crash cast further doubt on Boeing’s instructions to pilots flying the new Max planes, the company announced that it would reduce monthly production of its 737 jets to 42 a month from 52. [Read more about Boeing’s decision to slow production of the 737.] It is hard to find a place in Seattle where people don’t have some personal or family connection to the giant aircraft manufacturer, the largest private employer in Washington state, and that means plenty of people worried about whether the back-to-back crashes will affect orders for a plane upon which the company has banked much of its near-term future. The company is everywhere: Boeing Field, just south of downtown Seattle, is still used for testing and delivery of Boeing planes. Wide-body jets are assembled at the company’s giant factory in Everett, to the north. The 737s are put together at the 1.1 million-square-foot plant in Renton, 12 miles southeast of downtown Seattle. Renton is also home to the headquarters of Boeing’s commercial airplane group. “One of my very best friends from first grade, both his parents worked for Boeing,” said Ed Prince, a City Council member in Renton. “Seattle, for so many years, was a company town — Boeing was it.” Where downtown Seattle is booming with expensive high-rise condo towers, Renton, a suburb of slightly more than 100,000 people, still sports single-family homes in its small-townish core. The city’s population tripled during World War II, and “Boeing was a huge part of that,” said Elizabeth Stewart, executive director of the Renton History Museum. The one-way roads that permeate downtown Renton are, said Ms. Stewart, a relic of World War II-era Boeing, which lobbied for the street grid so it could get workers in and out more quickly. “They’ve been here for over 75 years; they’re iconic for our city,” said Renton’s mayor, Denis Law. “There was a period of time where there were very few people in the immediate region who either didn’t work for the Boeing Company or knew someone who did.” These days, though, Boeing is no longer the only fish in the Cedar River, which flows beneath Renton’s downtown library. The city has welcomed a number of new health care companies, as well as high-tech companies like Wizards of the Coast and industrial stalwarts like Paccar, the truck manufacturer. Across the street from Boeing’s Renton plant, on Lake Washington’s southern waterfront, is a new 712,000-square-foot office complex that city officials hope will attract new high-tech tenants. Some of those one-way streets are being transformed into two-way streets. Still, the question of what caused the crash of the two 737s and whether Boeing engineers bear any responsibility has been a near-constant topic of conversation — along with questions about a company that has changed significantly since many old-timers around town worked there. The company’s corporate headquarters moved to Chicago in 2001. Some aircraft parts are now manufactured as far away as Asia. Since countries grounded the Max plane, and after Boeing paused deliveries of new jets, a backlog has been created on its production lines in Renton. Boeing employees are not allowed to publicly discuss the crash investigations, so many of those outside must rely on snippets of information from friends, or news reports. Lately, many of those reports have focused on an automated system designed to prevent stalls that may have caused the pilots to lose control of the planes — though no definitive cause has been determined. Greg Langmann, 60, who spent 35 years with the company as an engineer before retiring in 2017, said he came to believe that the culture at the company was in need of revamping. “Decisions at Boeing are typically conducted in tribal fashion, rather than openly using reason and logic,” said Mr. Langmann, who worked in offices down the street from the Renton plant for much of his career. “Project management, a focus at Boeing, should be more than managing cost and schedule,” he said. “You should understand something of the project. Otherwise you can’t manage product performance, value or safety.” On Friday, when it announced the slowdown of its production of the 737, the company also said it would establish a new committee on its board of directors to review how it develops and builds aircraft. Dave Hayes is a recently retired Boeing pilot who moved to the Seattle area more than a decade ago from California, where he worked for Northwest Airlines. He was hunched over a pale ale one recent afternoon at Trencher’s, a sports bar in a large mixed-use complex called The Landing, which opened in 2007 on what used to be Boeing property in Renton. Mr. Hayes is still in close contact with his ex-colleagues, who he says are concerned about the prospect of increased oversight by Congress and the Federal Aviation Administration in the wake of criticism that the F.A.A. allowed Boeing to do much of its own safety analysis. “My personal opinion is Congress has never provided funding to the F.A.A. to give them in-depth knowledge of how some of the intricate systems of airplanes work,” said Mr. Hayes. “They’re not as involved on a daily basis as the pilots and engineers at Boeing are.” On a recent afternoon at Liberty Park in Renton, several people had gathered for a high-school baseball game, and once again, talk turned to the crash inquiries and the increasing signs that Boeing’s design could have played a role. “They will bounce back. They’re No. 1. They just let a money issue cloud their mind,” said Mario Terrell, a wellness nurse who comes from a family that includes several current and former Boeing workers — including his mother. He said he fears the company cut corners to save money. “My mom’s very upset,” he said. That she is. Jacquelyn Terrell, now 86, was a longtime shop steward at Boeing’s Renton plant and is still in touch with many of her former co-workers and the union. “Everyone is shocked,” she said. “That’s not Boeing. Something’s wrong. They need to dig further. There’s a lack of pilot training.” Having seen many of the troubles the company has faced in past years, most people here seem to expect that whatever the current problem, Boeing’s designers will, as they always have, engineer a way out of it. Mr. Russell, who used to build truck cabs for a Paccar subsidiary in Renton and Seattle, recalled “the battery fiasco” in 2013, when it was discovered that the batteries in Boeing’s just-rolled-out 787 Dreamliner were prone to overheating; it led to a three-month grounding of the plane. Boeing, he noted, swiftly developed a fix and got the fleet back on track. “It was a big deal,” Mr. Russell said. “But they made a bigger deal out of it than it was.”",The New York Times
2019,4 of the Most Dramatic Moments From the Mueller Report,"WASHINGTON — The special counsel’s report was publicly released on Thursday, offering long-awaited details about the investigation into potential ties between President Trump’s campaign and Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The report, which found insufficient evidence of cooperation between the campaign and Russia to warrant criminal charges, contained plenty of redactions, but its more than 400 pages still included a number of revelations. Amid the fact-finding and the legal rationale, the report also described the toll that the investigation took on Mr. Trump and chronicled private conversations between the president and his associates. Sometimes, things in the White House got heated. Here are some of the most dramatic moments from the report. In May 2017, when the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, appointed the special counsel, the president issued a polite public statement, deploying a phrase that would become a refrain throughout the investigation: “There was no collusion.” Privately, Mr. Trump had a visceral reaction. When Jeff Sessions, then the attorney general, shared the news in the Oval Office, the president slumped in his chair. “Oh my God,” he said, according to the report. “This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency,” he said, adding an expletive. Mr. Trump then became angry and blamed Mr. Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation, something he would never forgive Mr. Sessions for. “Everyone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels it ruins your presidency,” Mr. Trump reportedly said. “It takes years and years, and I won’t be able to do anything. This is the worst thing that ever happened to me.” The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, ultimately agreed that there was insufficient evidence to establish that Mr. Trump or his associates engaged in a criminal conspiracy with Russia to disrupt the 2016 election, although Mr. Mueller was less definitive on the issue of obstruction of justice. At a news conference on Thursday, Attorney General William P. Barr deemed the president cleared of obstruction. “There is substantial evidence to show that the president was frustrated and angered by his sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency,” he said. The president angrily asked for Mr. Sessions’s resignation the day the special counsel was appointed. But when Mr. Sessions gave the letter to Mr. Trump the next day, he was in a different mood. Mr. Trump pocketed the letter, asking Mr. Sessions several times if he wanted to keep his job and shaking his hand when he said that he did. But the president did not return the letter, according to the report. Reince Priebus, the former chief of staff, and Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s former chief strategist, were concerned that Mr. Trump had kept the letter. Mr. Priebus told Mr. Sessions that it could function as a “shock collar” and that as long as he had it, the president had the Justice Department “by the throat,” the report said. Mr. Priebus spent almost two weeks trying to wrest the letter back from Mr. Trump, who took it with him on a trip to the Middle East. The president showed the letter to aides as they flew from Saudi Arabia to Israel, asking them what he should do with it. Later on the trip, when Mr. Priebus asked Mr. Trump for the letter, the president told him it was at the White House. The president did not hand over the letter to Mr. Sessions until May 30, three days after he returned, with a note, “Not accepted.” According to the report, Mr. Trump sparred with Donald F. McGahn II, the former White House counsel, over a very lawyerly tendency: taking notes. After news outlets, including The New York Times, reported in early 2018 that Mr. Trump had ordered the firing of Mr. Mueller, the president tried to persuade his White House counsel to rebut the coverage. Mr. McGahn refused because the articles were generally accurate, according to the report. Although the president denied that he said the word “fire,” Mr. McGahn replied that was how he interpreted their conversation. During the meeting, the president quizzed Mr. McGahn about why he took notes, the report said. “Why do you take notes? Lawyers don’t take notes. I never had a lawyer who took notes,” Mr. Trump reportedly said. Mr. McGahn said that he took notes because he was a “real lawyer,” explaining that they created a record. Mr. Trump invited the F.B.I. director at the time, James B. Comey, to dinner in January 2017, one day after the acting attorney general, Sally Yates, came to the White House to discuss her concern that the national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, had not been telling the truth about his contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States. The invitation appears to have alarmed a number of Mr. Trump’s advisers, according to the report. Mr. McGahn had earlier advised the president not to communicate directly with the Justice Department. When Mr. Bannon, a senior adviser at the time, heard about the invitation, he suggested that he or Mr. Priebus attend as well. The president declined the offer and said he wanted the time alone with Mr. Comey. According to the report, Mr. Priebus told him, “Don’t talk about Russia, whatever you do.” The president said he would not discuss Russia. Instead, he brought up Mr. Flynn, saying that “the guy has serious judgment issues.” He also demanded loyalty from Mr. Comey. After that exchange became public, Mr. Trump and his aides disputed Mr. Comey’s version of events, going so far as to say that Mr. Comey, not the president, had requested the meeting. But the report said “substantial evidence corroborates Comey’s account of the dinner.” That evidence includes the president’s daily diary, which notes that he extended the invitation, as well as the recollection of senior F.B.I. officials whom Mr. Comey told about the conversation afterward. As the disclosure of his demand for a loyalty pledge spurred controversy, the president did not seem to understand the fuss. During a private conversation with the White House press secretary at the time, Sean Spicer, Mr. Trump denied ever making the demand, the report said. And even if he did, the president told Mr. Spicer, “Who cares?”",The New York Times
2019,‘Thriller’ Review: High School Slasher Offers Nothing New,"Streaming Movie Review When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. There’s a moment in the first “Avengers” movie when Captain America, the Rip Van Winkle of the superhero crew, picks up on an allusion to “The Wizard of Oz” and announces to the group, proudly, “I understood that reference.” In the ensuing years, that moment has become a meme, its GIFs and JPEGs an easy way to communicate, in Internet-speak, a shared set of references. Dallas Jackson’s Blumhouse-produced “Thriller,” on Netflix, is like a feature-length version of that meme, a haphazard assemblage of recycled parts from other, better horror movies. Its story concerns a group of teen friends bonding — and dying — over a shared, dark secret, just like “I Know What You Did Last Summer.” Its climax unwinds during a high school dance that goes sideways, just like “Carrie.” The movements of its hulking, silent villain are accompanied by a piano theme that uncannily echoes that of “Halloween.” It even includes a character who talks to herself in a mirror and then talks back in an altered voice like in “The Shining,” though the voice is (unintentionally) far funnier. None of this is automatically disqualifying. All genres, especially horror, have a rich tradition of looting from their collective past. But “Thriller” has no virtues of its own: the staging is listless, the soundtrack is overbearing, the dialogue is loaded with outdated slang, and the big twist is utterly asinine. The diversity of its casting does deviate refreshingly from the norm, and the performers are engaging. But there’s only so much they can do with this material. Though seemingly awash in winks, “Thriller” broaches self-awareness only once: when poor Mykelti Williamson, stranded in the nothing role of a police detective, tells our protagonist, “You sound like one of those paranoid white girls in the scary movie.” Say what you will about a movie like “Scream” (or even “Scary Movie”); it at least had a point of view. Some early, halfhearted attempts at social relevance aside, “Thriller” is an act of quotation and little else. It’s less a movie than a mix tape.

2019,‘Under the Silver Lake’ Review: Andrew Garfield Gets Lost in a Haze of Pop-Culture Allusions,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Sam is 33 years old, unemployed and counting down the days to eviction from his apartment near the Los Angeles reservoir that gives “Under the Silver Lake” its name. He doesn’t seem too upset about his situation, though he is kind of a mopey guy. His malaise looks like more of a temperamental or existential condition than the response to a crisis. And he doesn’t have it all that bad. There are a few guys who are willing to hang out with him, one woman who is willing to have sex with him and a few more who might be, including a neighbor named Sarah with a fluffy little dog. There’s another neighbor who has a lot of birds and walks around topless on her porch, giving Sam an opportunity for a bit of voyeurism and the director, David Robert Mitchell, a chance to nod to “Rear Window.” This is one of a great many nods, winks, rib-pokes, throat-clearings and other gestures in the direction of famous and less-famous movies, comic books, video games and songs. At one point, an issue of Spider-Man attaches itself to Sam’s hand by means of an errant wad of bubble gum, which is a funny coincidence — no coincidence at all, in other words — because Sam is played by Andrew Garfield, who used to be Spidey. Most of the other allusions in this shaggy-dog tale of wild conspiracism and male petulance are not quite so blatantly meta. Sam and the director are both steeped in classic Hollywood, ’90s indie rock, and various kinds of vintage memorabilia. The mood borrows from Hitchcock (whose grave figures in one scene), and also from Nicholas Ray, David Lynch, and the Southern California noir tradition more generally. Also Thomas Pynchon, Robert Altman and Raymond Chandler. These aren’t esoteric references yielding themselves up to a connoisseur’s prying. They are part of the movie’s surface, and part of its point. Sam believes that there are clues everywhere, if only he could figure out what they were clues to. He finds hidden messages in comics, song lyrics and antique cereal boxes, and he connects this information with strange happenings around him. Dogs are being killed in the Silver Lake neighborhood. A billionaire dies in a fiery crash. Sarah (Riley Keough) goes missing. Mix-and-match trios of young women — 21st-century variations on a meme of Betty Grable, Lauren Bacall and Marilyn Monroe in “How to Marry a Millionaire” — float through the city. Our man gives chase, gets sprayed by a skunk, and eventually discovers … Don’t worry. It doesn’t turn out to matter much. The sweet smarts of Mitchell’s first movie, “The Myth of the American Sleepover” (treated to a bit of auto-allusion in “Silver Lake”) aren’t much in evidence here. Nor are the slippery psychosexual scares of “It Follows,” his breakthrough horror movie from 2015. The ambitions this time are grander, but also vaguer and duller. Which isn’t to say that “Under the Silver Lake” is without some diverting qualities. The light, for one thing. Mitchell and his director of photography, Mike Gioulakis, savor the gorgeousness that has seduced so many previous filmmakers. And there are some moments of humor and surprise embedded in the overwrought intricacies and long slack stretches of the plot. But beyond the coy nostalgia and the timid satire is a feeling of bottomless exhaustion. At a crypt party in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, in the company of a balloon girl (identified as Balloon Girl in the credits and played by Grace Van Patten), Sam jumps to his feet to dance to “What’s the Frequency, Kenneth?” by R.E.M. It’s a song partly about the latent, mysterious meanings embedded in pop ephemera (“I’d studied your cartoons, radio, music, TV, movies, magazines”), and as such a plausible anthem for Sam’s quest. An equally apt, less pretentious choice might have been ZZ Top’s “Tush,” since that’s mostly what Sam is looking for and the camera is looking at. One of Sam’s prized possessions is an issue of Playboy from 1970 (it belonged to his dad), and “Under the Silver Lake” dwells in a hedged, half-guilty, self-conscious iteration of the magazine’s hedonist philosophy. There’s plenty of titillation and sexual opportunity, but no real lust, passion or liberatory energy. Even Sam’s sense of belatedness feels secondhand. He’s a Gen-X sensibility trapped in a millennial body, with the tastes and obsessions to match. (Mitchell, it’s worth pointing out, is 44 years old). R.E.M. called irony “the shackles of youth,” and he drags it around like a Styrofoam ball and chain. Like other guys his age, Sam feels oppressed by an older generation of guys who lay claim to all the credit, the money, the art and the women, while he is left with a literal and spiritual pile of junk that may not mean what he hoped it would. The movie turns his resentment into a cosmic joke. Look, I’ve been there. But I can’t say I sympathize, because there’s no basis for sympathy. “Under the Silver Lake” is less a cinematic folly than a category mistake, taking the sterility of its own imaginative conceits for a metaphysical condition. It isn’t a critique of aesthetic or romantic ennui, but an example of intellectual timidity. As a Los Angeles movie it lacks the rough, naturalistic edge of “La La Land,” and it thinks it’s so much cooler than “La La Land.” When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.",The New York Times
2019,‘Unicorn Store’ Review: When It’s Never Time to Put Away Childish Things,"Streaming Movie Review When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. All that glitters is not gold in the Netflix original film “Unicorn Store,” a sickly-sweet monument to arrested development, built around a failed artist who never grew past the mythical, magical, one-horned creature that enchanted her as a child. She also likes sticking Bugles on her fingertips, consulting with a shelf of Care Bears and a color palette that suggests an explosion at the Skittles factory. Not that there’s anything wrong with that — at least not according to Samantha McIntyre, who wrote the script, and Brie Larson, who directs and stars, earnestly championing a dreamer that others might dismiss as childish or ridiculous. In fact, “Unicorn Store” becomes an argument for itself: If such a tacky fantasy can get produced, then clearly it’s a viable enterprise for grown-ups. Although the film predates “Captain Marvel” — it debuted at the Toronto Film Festival in 2017, and it is only now on Netflix — the chemistry between its two stars, Larson and Samuel L. Jackson, shrewdly connects the two projects. Resigned to the cubicle drudgery of a public relations agency, where she serves as a temp, Kit (Larson) responds to an invitation to “The Store,” a mysterious operation run by a Willy Wonka type (Jackson) who offers to sell her “what she needs.” Kit asks for a unicorn. As Kit designs a homemade stable for the animal, “Unicorn Store” establishes a crude binary between her rainbow iconoclasm and the assortment of middle-aged stiffs who nudge her toward a life of coffee-swilling and temp work. The message here is that there’s no one-size-fits-all formula for adulthood, but the film doesn’t bear it out.

2019,‘Veggie Discs’ Could Replace Burgers Under European Food Labeling Proposal,"What’s in a mushroom burger? Or a veggie sausage? Perhaps worried that you may be confused, some epicures at the European Parliament have proposed a new rule: If a product does not contain meat, it cannot be called a burger or a sausage or a steak. The proposed amendment was passed by the body’s agricultural committee this week as part of a voluminous revision of the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy. Eric Andrieu, a French Socialist member of the European Parliament, introduced the proposal, but suspicions remained that the meat lobby was behind the idea. Environmentalists said the suggested labeling rules were an effort to undermine the growing demand for plant-based foods. “We didn’t support the proposal,” said Molly Scott Cato, a British member of the European Parliament from the Green Party. “We don’t see any problem with calling a veggie burger a veggie burger.” Mr. Andrieu, who could not be reached to comment, told The Guardian that the meat lobby had nothing to do with the amendment and that he was attempting to add some common sense to food labeling. “We felt that steak should be kept for real steak with meat,” he said, warning that “a lot of creativity” would be needed to come up with new names for vegetarian products. “People need to know what they are eating.” Some news accounts of the proposed rule reported on a search for new names, including “vegetable protein tubes” and “veggie disc.” Dairy producers were the first to allege that competitors selling plant-based foods were using misleading labeling such as “tofu butter” or “veggie cheese” and they won a 2017 ruling from the European Court of Justice that reserved the names of dairy products for foods with an animal source. As part of its vote last week, the agricultural committee added to the dairy restrictions with a rule that would ban the use of phrases like “yogurt style” or “butter substitute” for plant-based products. The proposal about meat labeling was opposed by a coalition of environmental and animal rights groups. “There is no evidence of consumer confusion,” Greenpeace, Humane Society International and other groups wrote in a letter dated April 1. “On the contrary, consumers purchase these items because they do not contain meat or dairy.” The proposal must still pass the full European Parliament, which will not take it up until after elections in May. It would then have to be negotiated and agreed on by the Council of Ministers before becoming law, according to Neil Corlett, a European Parliament spokesman. Whether the proposal is a maneuver by the meat lobby or simply an attempt by the French to assert food traditions, the proposal reflected a certain defensiveness by the meat industry as more and more people reduce their meat consumption, Ms. Scott Cato said. “There was no consumer demand for this,” she said, adding that she would continue to oppose the amendment as “an attempt by the meat industry to make life harder for people” who prefer vegetarian diets. In the United States, there has been a push by the dairy industry to require the Food and Drug Administration to enforce labeling rules for milk as more Americans switch to “alternative milks,” which come from any number of plants. (Pea milk, anyone?) “Nobody thinks their almond milk comes from a cow,” said Michele Simon, the executive director of the Plant Based Foods Association in San Francisco. As for efforts in some states to come up with labeling for plant-based meat substitutes, there was no confusion there either, she said. “People are happily buying these products not thinking they are beef,” she said. Ms. Scott Cato pointed to the breakout success of vegan sausage rolls this year introduced by Greggs, a British bakery chain, in January, as evidence that more people are eating vegetarian dishes — and that they know what is in them. “It’s not like anybody bought a vegan sausage roll and asked where is the pig,” she said.",The New York Times
2019,‘Wall’ Review: A Writer Reflects on Borders,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Adapted by David Hare from a monologue he performed on stage in London and at the Public in New York, the animated feature “Wall” begins with a plane arriving in Israel and ends with one flying away. Its perspective is that of an outsider trying to make sense of an impossibly complicated, foreign situation — but of course, who qualifies as an insider and who as an outsider is part of what Hare is interested in. The title refers to the partition that divides Israel and the West Bank. (Hare’s companion play, “Berlin,” dealt with the barrier that split the German city.) With a combination of motion capture and more free-form renderings, the Canadian animator Cam Christiansen gives visual life to Hare’s words. The film’s imagery — black-and-white with strategic splashes of color — moves fluidly between the abstract and the tangible. During Hare’s discussion of the wall’s construction, slabs of concrete fall from the sky. Near the end, animated graffiti depicts an imagined outward view of the sea. Speaking to Israelis and Palestinians, Hare reflects on the wall from political, philosophical, historical and aesthetic angles. Recounting a visit to the West Bank city of Nablus, Hare describes it as a trading center with a problem — “nobody’s allowed to go there.” The author David Grossman (played by the actor Paul Jesson) characterizes Israel in similarly paradoxical terms. “To the world, Israel seems powerful and aggressive,” he says. “Yet to itself, it seems weak and frail.” Imperiously wringing his hands at both sides of the conflict, Hare never brings his observations together in a satisfying conclusion (not that any was likely, in just 80 minutes). He does sound pleased at having appointed himself ambassador. “The artist doesn’t choose the subject,” he says. “The subject chooses the artist,” adding that the Middle East “answers to something in me.” Does it, though?

2019,‘We Are Amplifying the Work’: France Starts Task Force on Art Looted Under Nazis,"PARIS — A new task force in France has been given a broader mandate to search for and return artwork that had been looted or sold under duress during the Nazi occupation, after years of criticism that its restitution efforts were not proactive enough. The task force, announced last year and starting work in the coming weeks, will primarily look at artwork in France that is already suspected of having been looted during World War II, to try to return it to the original owners or their heirs. But in a step up from current policy, it will also try to determine whether any other pieces acquired by French institutions have dubious origins, though those are only expected to represent a small fraction of France’s vast national art collections. “We are not starting from nothing, but we are amplifying the work,” David Zivie, a Culture Ministry official who is expected to lead the new task force, said in an interview. French authorities had faced criticism that they were not doing enough to identify looted artwork in France’s collections and were instead waiting for the owners or their heirs to file claims on specific pieces. Many belonged to Jewish families whose homes were raided during the Nazi occupation, or who were forced to sell the art — paintings, drawings, sculptures or antiquities — as they fled the country to avoid arrest by France’s collaborationist Vichy government and deportation to concentration camps. Officials had pledged a more proactive approach to restitution in recent years, but the efforts were still shared by museums, the Culture and Foreign ministries and the Commission for the Compensation of Victims of Spoliation, or CIVS, established in 1999 to examine reparation claims from victims of France’s wartime anti-Semitic laws. Édouard Philippe, France’s prime minister, said last year that the government had “to do better,” despite the “difficulties” of identifying pieces and finding the original owners or their heirs. “It is a question of honor, a question of dignity, of respect for the victims of this looting, for their memory and for their descendants,” Mr. Philippe said last July in a speech commemorating an infamous roundup of Jews that the French police carried out in 1942. The creation of the task force, called the Mission for Research and Restitution of Spoliated Cultural Property, was announced shortly after that speech. It will be part of the Culture Ministry, with six to seven permanent staffers and an annual budget of 200,000 euros, or about $225,000, dedicated solely to research, according to Mr. Zivie, the ministry official. While the funding is modest compared to the German Lost Art Foundation, a similar organization that received nearly 6 million euros from Germany’s federal government last year, it is the first time that France has specifically earmarked funding for restitution work. The goal is to remedy problems that Mr. Zivie had identified in an official report last year: a “dispersed organization” of the government’s restitution efforts, with an “absence of visibility and coordination” that led to claimants’ “mistrust.” The task force will now centralize those efforts, Mr. Zivie said. “We want to make this policy visible, we want to assert it,” by encouraging academic research and curator training and forging partnerships with similar institutions abroad, he said. About 100,000 objects in France were looted by the Nazis or sold under duress and transferred to Germany, according to estimates by French authorities. From 1945 to 1949, roughly 60,000 of those objects were returned to France, and about 45,000 were then claimed by their owners. Most of the unclaimed pieces were sold at auction. But the French state kept about 2,100 and entrusted them to museums. Even today, experts say it is unclear how those pieces were chosen, and they caution that they do not know how many were actually looted or sold under duress, and how many were proper sales that the authorities have been unable to trace. Since 1951, after the first wave of restitutions, only about 120 among the 2,100 pieces have been returned. France has streamlined the restitution process with this latest move, and taken some of the decision-making power out of the hands of curators. The ability to file claims has been widened to “any individual concerned,” and only the task force will investigate the claims. Cases will then be referred to the CIVS, which will make a recommendation to the prime minister, who will ultimately decide. “It’s also a change in response to a criticism that was justified, even though it is now a bit outdated, that the ministry and museums were, by nature, very reluctant about restitution, because a curator’s nature is to curate,” Mr. Zivie said. Over 70 years after the end of World War II, museums and other institutions around Europe are still returning looted artwork, with varying speed and eagerness. Most recently, in March, a cathedral in Germany agreed to return a Nazi-looted painting to the heirs of an Austrian Jewish couple from whom it was stolen in 1941. Emmanuelle Polack, an art historian who has worked extensively on the French art market under the Nazi occupation, praised the new task force and said that after years of difficult relations between the state and claimants, “tensions have lifted.” “There is a real turning point on these questions in France,” she said, adding that museums and curators were now much more open to discussing restitution. “Everyone wants to move things forward.” For proof, Ms. Polack pointed to an exhibition that she is curating at the Mémorial de la Shoah, a museum on the Holocaust in Paris. The exhibition, which runs until November, is about the art market in France between 1940 and 1944, which flourished as it was flooded with paintings, drawings and other pieces that had been taken or bought from fleeing Jewish families. At one auction, held in 1942 at the Savoy Hotel in Nice, a Louvre curator bought a dozen pieces that were from the collection of Armand Dorville, a Jewish lawyer who had died the previous year. Because of anti-Semitic legislation applicable in France at the time, the artwork was sold by a temporary administrator named by the Vichy government, in a complex case that will be one of the first to be picked up by the task force. (Some pieces from Mr. Dorville’s collection also ended up in the trove of artwork amassed by Cornelius Gurlitt in Germany.) The Louvre has lent three of the pieces bought in 1942 — drawings by the French artists Jean-Louis Forain, Camille Roqueplan and Henri Monnier — for the exhibition at the Holocaust museum. Ms. Polack called that “a real step.” “We won’t be able to return everything,” Ms. Polack said, noting that passing time and fading memories were making it increasingly hard to pinpoint the rightful heirs to a stolen piece of art. “But at least we should feel, in good conscience, that we did as much as we could,” she said.",The New York Times

His family said he had been the target of homophobic bullying. I remember when I was a young black boy in high school like Nigel. I was ridiculed and called homophobic slurs that, at such a young age, I hardly understood. I remember grappling with the feeling that I was different from my peers. According to the Center for Social Equity, a nonprofit organization based in South Carolina, 74 percent of L.G.B.T.Q. youths say they do not feel safe in the schools they attend. Many students don’t feel comfortable telling their teachers about the bullying they experience because they fear it will lead to more bullying. They don’t bring it up with their parents because they don’t want to deal with questions they are not quite ready — or able — to answer. I also remember how being both black and gay made all of this worse. I was fighting both racism and homophobia while also trying to figure out who I was. I bottled up all my emotions hoping that someone would notice how much pain I was in and hear my cry for help. Sadly, for some of us, that cry is never heard. Nigel’s untimely and tragic death is a reminder of the urgent need for more research to help us better understand how racial disparities affect the national suicide crisis. Studies show that black children take their own lives at a rate that is nearly twice as high as white children. “Parents, please talk to your students about Nigel’s death,” Aaron King, the principal of Nigel’s school, said in a statement. “Know and be aware of changes in your child. Talk to them about what they see, words they speak and actions they can take to make a difference. We must be better.” We must do better.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | ‘We Went From Being Poor to Living in Misery’,"A wave of countrywide blackouts in Venezuela has exposed the extent to which the state has failed, forcing the population to improvise quick fixes to cope with a catastrophe. Ms. López Glass is a journalist who has covered Venezuela for more than a decade. CARACAS, Venezuela — On Saturday, the capital and at least a dozen of this country’s 23 states were left without power. It was the fourth major blackout to hit Venezuela this month. The government has blamed the collapse on an “electromagnetic attack” waged by the United States and terrorist acts from the opposition. In the past six years, citizens have increasingly been left to fend for themselves as President Nicolás Maduro’s government has proved unable to provide even the most basic services like food, health care, electricity and, soon, water. If the first blackout on March 7 exposed how decades of misrule have destroyed the country’s economy, society and its infrastructure, the last one left no hope that the government has the capacity to find solutions to the country’s many problems. For years Venezuelans have muddled through overlapping social and economic crises, but the blackouts have made everything worse. It’s not just that life became harder overnight. It’s that the prospect of it ever getting better became more distant. The first blackout left people without phone and internet services for at least four days. Hospitals across the country collapsed, and countless places had no water. Given that the state has continuously failed them, people did what they’ve been doing for years: seek out their own solutions to public problems. The collective improvisation highlighted how vulnerable the country has become. Numerous images of people collecting water from polluted rivers were posted on social media, foreshadowing epidemics that an already struggling health care system will be unable to cope with. In Maracaibo, the country’s second-largest city, more than 500 businesses were looted and destroyed. The fear of another episode of violence now looms large. As the blackout dragged on, it became difficult to buy food because card payments couldn’t be processed without electricity. Within hours people began using United States dollars. In the Maca section of El Llanito, several open-air markets hung signs announcing that they accepted “lettuces,” the Venezuelan code word for dollars. Overnight the economy had been informally “dollarized.” But Venezuela’s overlapping crises means that a solution to one problem can bring on another. With Venezuela’s soaring crime rate, having dollars can get you killed. Inside one of the food stores, a woman told me, as she defensively clutched her bag, that her cash was a gift from a relative who visited in December. Paula, a homemaker in her late 50s, emphasized she “only had a couple of $20s.” She feared neighborhood thugs would target her. “If hunger doesn’t kill you, crime will,” she said. If the blackout gave the economy a deadly blow, it has hit the health care system even harder. The country’s crumbling hospitals were already experiencing a shortage of medicine and parts needed to repair equipment. Dozens of patients died when old generators failed to kick in. Doctors at the Domingo Luciani Hospital in Caracas described the futile task of trying to keep patients alive with manually pumped respirators. Newborn babies died in idle incubators. The day I visited, power had finally been restored but they still had no water. Next to patients’ beds lay several five-liter bottles of water that relatives had brought them. Yet another example of people left to fend for themselves. A young surgeon, who preferred to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals, told me the lack of water was also worsening the shortage of surgical instruments. “We discard them because, under these conditions, we cannot sterilize them.” As shocking as it is to see hospitals operate with no water, in most neighborhoods it has now become the norm. At 4 in the morning, on the outskirts of Petare in the San Blas slum, women line up at a winding road to fetch water from a stream. The wait is charged with anger. Leticia Vargas, who was second in line after a three-hour wait, described a life stripped to the bare minimum. “We went from being poor to living in misery,” the 50-year-old woman tells me. Her tank top is in tatters and the deep-set eyes in her gaunt face reflect a life so hard, she looks 10 years older. Leticia’s desperation is coupled with a sense of hopelessness. “They promise, but they never fix anything” she says, referring to the government. Zuri Zambrano, her neighbor in line, interjects: “They’ve only given us lies.” She says it so loud that the man at the front of the line can hear. That man is Jeison Carvajal, the head of the pro-government community council. His job today is to limit time at the spout. Standing by a wide, galvanized metal cylinder from where the water pours, Jeison tells me that the original plan was to add several spouts to shorten the wait. After 20 years in power, and a windfall of nearly a trillion dollars from the oil boom, the best the government can offer the people of San Blas is an improvised solution. And they even failed to deliver that. When I ask Leticia and her friends if they ever consider protesting, they shrug the suggestion off. “If we do, the army will kill us,” Leticia says. Zuri adds that despite her anger the “hunt” for food, water and medicines leaves her no time. “And besides, nothing will change,” she says. Dire living conditions and fear of repression can sometimes demobilize a society like in San Blas. Other times, like in Maracaibo, they propel it. Contrary to Caracas, Maracaibo experienced daily power outages for most of last year. What was once the heart of a booming oil industry has now become the epicenter of a gasoline smuggling operation into Colombia, and a crossing point for the millions leaving the country. The local economy is so bad, goods are often bartered, not sold. In the wake of March 7 blackout, three days of riots rocked the city. News reports from the ground seemed taken straight out of Mad Max, as armed mobs tore through the streets destroying and stealing everything from shops to whole malls, and even copper wiring. The city was cannibalized. Until now, Caracas has been spared the horrors that have shattered Maracaibo. But there is little that a government that is bankrupt, delegitimized and now sanctioned can do for its people. If blackouts become the norm, we might not be so lucky the next time around. I fear that violence and looting will spread like wildfire in the nation’s capital and beyond. That could prove to be another deadly blow for Venezuela.

2019,‘We Will Come for You’: How Fear of Terrorism Spurs Online Mobs,"The Interpreter LONDON — Less than a day after the worst terrorist attack in Sri Lanka’s history, thousands of Sri Lankans were consumed with vitriol, outrage and fear. Their community was threatened, they believed. Something must be done. But some settled on a target who was not a perpetrator of the Easter bombings, not a sympathizer, not even someone who lived in Sri Lanka. He was Thusiyan Nandakumar, a doctor and part-time journalist living thousands of miles away in suburban London. He stared at his phone in bafflement and terror as thousands of threats rolled in. “I know where you live,” one message said. “We will come for you terrorist low life to teach you a lesson.” “If I see you anywhere,” read another, “I will cut your throat.” In Sri Lanka, angry mobs attacked Muslims after the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, and the island nation braced for further violence. But in the echo chambers of social media, Dr. Nandakumar — who is not Muslim — was singled out as an enemy. And the threats kept coming. By Wednesday, the outrage had spread to mainstream politics. Sri Lanka’s opposition party, led by the former strongman president Mahinda Rajapaksa, held a news conference and denounced Dr. Nandakumar by name. This surge of rage and harassment directed at a doctor living abroad may seem inexplicable. But social scientists say it reveals the impulses that lead people, particularly when they feel weak or threatened, to band together to punish a perceived transgressor — and the ways that social media has encouraged those impulses. “The world of vigilantism can help explain this,” said Regina Bateson, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who researches vigilante violence. “It’s very similar.” Seething at Dr. Nandakumar offered Sri Lankans, particularly those from its Sinhalese Buddhist majority, a sense of strength at a time of vulnerability — and, crucially, a way to feel unified by their rage, and therefore safer. Those impulses can drive not just social media outrage but real-world lynchings and sectarian fury. Research on vigilante violence helps explain not only why people lash out, but also why, in this era of hyper-connected online communities, the phenomenon is gathering strength and frequency. After the bombings, Dr. Nandakumar, whose family is from Sri Lanka’s Tamil minority, gave a brief interview to the BBC in which he mentioned the country’s history of ethnic conflict, including a recent attack on a church by Sinhalese Buddhists. To most people who watched the broadcast, his statements were forgettably anodyne — the kind of sound bite that television news anchors use to fill time until more concrete facts become available. But online, rumors spread that he had accused Buddhists of carrying out the Easter bombings, that he was trying to destroy Sri Lanka’s reputation, that he was a terrorist. A study led by Daphna Canetti-Nisim, a University of Maryland psychology researcher, helps explain why people would focus their energies on harassing a distant target with no connection to the Easter bombings. The researchers found that episodes of terrorism can lead people to rage at minorities, even if there is little logic behind doing so. People cling more strongly to their group identities at such times, and band together against outsiders they perceive as threats. “The Sinhalese have famously been referred to as ‘a majority with a minority complex,’ convinced that the island’s Sinhalese-ness and Buddhist-ness is under constant threat,” said Kate Cronin-Furman, a professor at University College London who studies Sri Lanka. “We’re seeing the effects of this siege mentality in the aftermath of Sunday’s bombings.” Punishing outsiders creates a sense of group agency and lets people feel they are on the side of good, protecting their communities, Professor Bateson said. Targeting Dr. Nandakumar, who edits a Tamil news site, may have been a means for people to prove that they are good Sinhalese, defending Sinhalese interests. This past week an online mob soon identified Dr. Nandakumar’s family and began circulating photos of them. His parents and brother received death threats. His teenage sister was graphically threatened with rape as well. Meanwhile, Dr. Nandakumar faced ever-worsening threats. “I got one message saying some S.T.F. boys are waiting to ‘smoke’ me,” he said, a reference to the Special Task Force, a notorious unit of the Sri Lankan military. Anger spread beyond Dr. Nandakumar. Azzam Ameen, the BBC’s Sri Lanka reporter, became a target. A petition denouncing the BBC’s coverage went viral, attracting more than 50,000 signatures. Journalists at The Tamil Guardian, a news site for which Dr. Nandakumar is an editor, increased their security precautions, worried they might be attacked. Any social media user has seen the way a seemingly minor offense can set an entire online community aflame. Online rage, at its most extreme, tends to follow a very similar pattern. Public criticism quickly turns to threats and intimidation. Women often receive graphic sexual threats. The target gets “doxxed,” with private information being made public, as well as links to partners, family members and employers, who are then threatened as well. That pattern has played out around the world, growing out of controversies including video gamers’ anger at feminists and fury over foreign correspondents’ coverage of local crises. In Brazil, teachers and health workers have been driven from their jobs and homes by campaigns known as “online lynchings.” Real-world lynchings are difficult to carry out, Professor Bateson said, because of the time and effort required to spread a message, bring people together and persuade them to attack a victim physically. But with social media, an outraged group can gather almost instantly, drawing together users who may not know one another or even be in the same country. “Rhetoric demonizing an ‘other’ is easy,” Professor Bateson said. “Collective violence that’s physical and in person — that’s hard. This mass online targeting and harassment falls somewhere in between.” And, as Dr. Nandakumar found, an online mob can still reach directly into its victims’ lives. “Even though I’m thousands of miles from Sri Lanka, the fear crosses boundaries and borders,” he said. Communities that lynch tend to develop specific “repertoires” of violence, Professor Bateson said, with individuals learning how and when to attack. Because the impulse is one of complying with group norms, the sense of a community ritual can be powerful. Now, social media platforms — communities in their own right, of millions of users — seem to be developing their own specific patterns of targeting victims. And new tools like doxxing have become part of the online repertoire of violence. “People are learning tactics of how to intimidate and coerce online,” Professor Bateson said. The emergence of those patterns suggests that users who harass and threaten are learning from one another — and that the group norms of social media may be pushing users to follow suit, even if they might never do something so aggressive offline. But there is always a chance that online hate can spill over into physical violence. That prospect terrifies Dr. Nandakumar’s family. A few days after the attacks, his aunt called him in tears, begging him to apologize and mollify the mob. Otherwise, she warned, “they will come for you.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | ‘What’s Your Favorite Book?’ Is Not a Trick Question,"Candidates should tell us what they actually love to read, and there shouldn’t be any wrong answers. Contributing Opinion Writer One of my fondest memories of motherhood is of when my younger daughter, Phoebe, learned to read. It was bedtime, and her sister, her stepfather and I were settled in bed with our books. I kissed Phoebe good night and left the light on, and as I walked down the hall I heard her announce, “I am part of the reading family now!” (I felt good about my parenting, in a way I hadn’t since the incident, a few weeks previously, when, on our way to a doctor’s appointment, my other kid looked up at me with a sunny smile and announced, “Guess what I am not wearing today!”) As an author and a lifelong reader, a girl who found refuge in books, I am glad that my children are part of the reading family. Many Americans are not. According to the Pew Foundation, almost a quarter of Americans said they had not read a book in the previous 12 months. My guess is that school is to blame. Somewhere along the way, between “Beowulf” and Chaucer, people learned that reading was a slog and that literature consisted of books about characters who looked and sounded nothing like them, living in worlds that were nothing like their own. Reading was a duty and not a pleasure. And so, as soon as no one was forcing them to do it, they stopped. The list of books that most schools still consider required reading — the canon, still heavy on dead, white, male authors — doesn’t help. Nor does the way some cultural gatekeepers, many of them proudly progressive and reflexively inclusive in other parts of their lives, seem invested in keeping the ranks of readers closed. See, for example, Stephen Colbert’s recent treatment of the novels the Georgia politician Stacey Abrams wrote under the name Selena Montgomery. With salacious glee, and with a visibly uncomfortable Ms. Abrams beside him, Mr. Colbert read a sex scene from her novel “Reckless” on TV. She writes bodice rippers, was the joke, which played into layer upon layer of prejudice against women writers, women readers, women’s pleasure and women’s stories, especially when those stories are by, and about, women of color. Ha ha, sex! And also, lady-trash! “There is a long history of using romance writing and, specifically, the writing of sex scenes as a way to discredit the woman who wrote them,” Courtney Milan, a romance writer and a former law professor, told me recently. “Reckless,” which was published in 2008, is an especially challenging journey to happily ever after, given that its star-crossed African-American lovers were lawyer and the cop who pulls her over. Ms. Milan noted that the book was exceptional at the time because of its subject matter and its author’s identity. Rebekah Weatherspoon, a romance writer and the head of Women of Color in Romance, said that “Reckless” and its on-camera mockery are part of what has historically been a “problematic narrative around black women’s autonomy over our bodies, over our sexuality, however we decide to express it. It seems to be up for public consumption and judgment.” The jokes on TV were just the latest version of that judgment. “It was unnecessary in a way that hurt,” Ms. Weatherspoon said. Compare the snickers at Ms. Abrams’s writing to the response to Pete Buttigieg’s reading. Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., Democratic presidential aspirant and current shiny new thing, told reporters that he learned Norwegian to read more from an author he’d discovered, whose work was not available in translation. Then he put James Joyce’s “Ulysses” at the top of 10 books he’d take to a desert island. Some people rolled their eyes at this; the literati swiftly leapt to his defense, some saying they’d rather reread Joyce than attempt a graphic novel. When a politician or other public figure is asked to list his or her favorite books, it’s never just a list. It’s an answer to the question, Who do I want people to think I am? Clearly, Mr. Buttigieg wants us to know that he is smart. “Ulysses” is a great book, a book that is firmly ensconced in the canon, but probably doesn’t end up in a lot of beach bags. I am ready to concede that Mr. Buttigieg is an outlier, a man who truly enjoys “Ulysses” and expects that other readers will dig it, but it is not a book that many people read for fun. So what does it say when progressives are putting a difficult, forbidding book, and the candidate who praises it, on a pedestal while, at the same time, we’re laughing at the books that many, many readers enjoy and using steamy, context-free snippets to take the women who write them down a peg or two? At this point you may be asking: Isn’t it better to have politicians who read hard books than a president who doesn’t read at all? And the answer is yes. Of course. Absolutely. It is appalling to me that the man in the White House seems to read absolutely nothing — not literature, not best sellers, not his security briefings, not even, if his co-authors can be believed, the books he has ostensibly written. I dearly miss President Barack Obama’s summer reading lists and the glimpse they gave us into his mind. But let’s be honest: If President Trump doesn’t like to read and can’t come up with a book to recommend, that makes him pitiable to much of literary Twitter. It also makes him totally relatable to a lot of America. If progressives really have inclusion as our goal, shame won’t help. When we laugh at Selena Montgomery’s sex scenes or take shots at “relatable” stories or “likable” heroines or dismiss mysteries or fantasies, there are readers who hear us condemning them. When we mock nonreaders or books we see as less-than, we do Mr. Trump’s work for him. As the 2020 election approaches, all the candidates should have a chance to talk about the books they love. In the best of all worlds, their answers should tell us something about how they think and who they are and whose stories and voices have shaped them. I hope the next person to answer talks about the pleasures of reading and how every book counts, that whether you love the tough classic from the canon or graphic novels or even bodice rippers, you, too, are a member of the reading family. Because progressives gain nothing — in politics or in publishing — by laughing at anyone’s books.

2019,‘When Brooklyn Was Queer’ Evokes the Borough’s Hidden History,"Nonfiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. When Brooklyn Was Queer By Hugh Ryan In 1929, a gay novelist in a Brooklyn cafeteria was flirted with by his waiter, to the novelist’s surprise. “Brooklyn is wide open,” he reported to a friend, “and N.Y. should be notified of its existence.” The borough is wide open today, too, but between today’s openness and that of a century ago, a shadow of oblivion fell in the late 20th century. Hugh Ryan was inspired to write “When Brooklyn Was Queer,” his boisterous, motley new history, when, a few years ago, he set up an amateur museum of local queer history in his Bushwick loft — he prefers the term “queer” for its chronological sweep and denotation of gender and sexual nonconformity — and noticed that queers in Brooklyn today know little about their antecedents. As if to dramatize the disjuncture, Ryan’s introduction features a gay elder who remembers almost nothing of the borough’s queer history — a somewhat frustrating way to begin. When Ryan then turns to Brooklyn’s queer bard Walt Whitman in Chapter 1, he has a little trouble getting his bearings, wrongly locating the Brooklyn Navy Yard to the west of the neighborhood Vinegar Hill, mistakenly interpolating a “the” into the title of Whitman’s famous poem “Crossing Brooklyn Ferry” and improbably suggesting that Whitman studied ancient Greek (the poet’s formal schooling ended at age 11). Ryan also scolds Whitman for addressing himself primarily to fellow “white, male, cisgender artists,” a rebuke that seems to me not quite fair. Whitman did express ugly prejudice in some conversations recorded late in life, but his offenses should perhaps be balanced, in judging his work, against his consistent support for equal rights for all and his poetic efforts to share imaginatively in the experiences and sensibilities of women, blacks and laborers. Ryan hits his stride once he reaches the late 19th century, however, and by Chapter 2 the book has become an entertaining and insightful chronicle, building on earlier histories by George Chauncey, Sherill Tippins and Charles Kaiser, among others, and enhanced by original research in newspaper archives, unpublished letters and collections of ephemera. Ryan’s central thesis is that the old queer Brooklyn had a distinct economic basis: the waterfront. “Early queer life flourished where there were jobs queer people could have,” he explains. From the 1840s, when Brooklyn’s docks began to take on the excess shipping business that Manhattan’s could no longer handle, until 1966, when the Brooklyn Navy Yard was shut down, the jobs of “sailor, artist, sex worker, entertainer and female factory worker,” Ryan argues, were abundant enough to support a queer community. Almost all the Brooklynites he writes about had such jobs, located along or near the shore in bourgeois-bohemian Brooklyn Heights, in working-class Coney Island and Red Hook, or on lumpenproletariat Sands Street near the Navy Yard. At the Gaiety Theater on Old Fulton Street, for example, the drag king Ella Wesner sang nightly in the 1880s of being “a chap that’s dead stuck on women and wine”; her relationship with a fellow actress was described by one newspaper as “an unnatural attachment” and by another as “singular.” Elizabeth Trondle, arrested in a Brooklyn saloon in 1913 for cross-dressing, had been a sailor — she had the tattoos to prove it — and a letter she wrote to President Woodrow Wilson asking special permission to wear men’s clothes was reprinted nationwide. Loop-the-Loop, documented in a 1917 case study, was a trans sex worker in Coney Island; she had named herself after one of its roller coasters. Hart Crane was already a well-known poet when he moved to Brooklyn Heights with his lover, a Danish sailor and journalist, in 1924. Crane exulted in their apartment’s grand view of the Brooklyn Bridge, about which he was trying to write a book-length sequence of poems, knowing that one of his apartment’s previous inhabitants, Washington Roebling, had helped erect it. (Ryan compounds this conjunction of the queer and the literary-cultural, though it was probably unknown to Crane: When Roebling was a teenager, a friend of his committed suicide because, Roebling later confessed to his wife, “he loved me and I didn’t sufficiently reciprocate his affections.”) As distinctively colorful as these lives were, they were powerfully shaped by institutions, Ryan’s history shows. The Committee of Fourteen, a private group formed in 1905 to fight prostitution, sent undercover investigators to the Sands Street bars during World War I, inadvertently recording queer evidence for posterity (“It seems to me that the sailors were sex mad,” an informer reported), and contributing to a spike in arrests for “degeneracy.” Between 1935 and 1943, Brooklyn queers helped recruit subjects for the Committee for the Study of Sex Variants, a not-altogether-scientific organization run by, among others, a psychiatrist and a closeted, defrocked Episcopal priest, which published a two-volume documentary history of queer life in 1941 and helped draft boards in the city determine who was and who wasn’t a homosexual during World War II. After the war, the psychiatrist and the ex-priest went on to counsel veterans arrested for soliciting sex in movie theaters and subway toilets, with the aim of shoring up the men’s self-respect. In the end, it was neither vice squads nor psychologizing that shut down old queer Brooklyn. That sociocultural formation was liquidated instead by the automobile, Ryan reports, and by the automobile’s champion in New York City, Robert Moses. As transportation changed, Brooklyn’s shipping business collapsed, taking queer livelihoods with it, and Moses built new highways that cut Brooklyn’s waterfronts off from the rest of the borough. The Sands Street bars that had once harbored sex-mad sailors were leveled, as were queer haunts in Coney Island, Red Hook and Brooklyn Heights; public housing projects were built in their place. Moses had the former home of Hart Crane and Washington Roebling demolished to make way for an on-ramp to the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway.",The New York Times
2019,"Opinion | ‘When They Go Low, We Go Lower’","Will fake news decide Indonesia’s election this week? Mr. Tapsell is an Indonesia specialist at the Australian National University. Indonesia, the world’s third-largest democracy, will head to the ballot boxes on Wednesday for a largely unremarkable general election. The two presidential candidates — President Joko Widodo and Prabowo Subianto, a former army commander — also faced off five years ago. The gap between them on major policy issues has since narrowed, but the president’s lead in polls seems to have widened. Still, the election is noteworthy in one respect: the record deployment of negative campaigning, and sometimes outright disinformation, on both sides. The two candidates, though nominally quite different, hardly have distinguished themselves from the other on the economy, foreign policy or even religion. Perhaps that’s why their official campaign strategists, the officious operations they tacitly back and overzealous independent supporters together have produced a cocktail of negative ads, fake news and outright hoaxes to create buzz around their man. Indonesia’s leading investigative journalism magazine, Tempo, revealed late last year that both camps were relying on what the exposé called “shadow teams,” attacking each other using “fake news spread by proxies” — a form of “black campaigning that could not be carried out by candidates’ official teams.” A recent Reuters investigation uncovered groups of “fake-news peddlers” who, according to the article, appeared to want to exploit “ethnic or religious divides.” Hundreds of informal campaigners thought to be paid by politicians or their business acolytes — known locally as “buzzers” — create hashtags on Twitter and material for Facebook and Instagram ferrying nasty messages about their opponents, often using aliases or ghost accounts. Negative campaigning is nothing new in Indonesia, but there, as elsewhere, ever-popular digital platforms and messaging apps help spread the material faster. (More than 80 percent of internet users in Indonesia use Facebook and WhatsApp.) Mr. Prabowo and his Islamist allies have tried to portray Mr. Joko as un-Islamic. Mr. Joko’s lead shrank during the 2014 presidential campaign as material circulated stating (incorrectly) that he was Chinese, Christian and a communist. The message has taken root: In a national survey in December, one-fifth of respondents who had heard that Mr. Joko was born to a Christian parent now believed the news, and nearly one-quarter of respondents who had heard that he was Chinese believed that to be true. Conservative religious groups, many of which back Mr. Prabowo, have become more vociferous online in recent years. A network that calls itself the Muslim Cyber Army helped sway the race for governor in Jakarta in 2017, partly by spreading fake news about one candidate, an ally of Mr. Joko’s. Ahead of this week’s election, other groups have claimed — spuriously — that the president wanted to ban religious teaching in schools and abolish the call to prayer, among other things. Although Mr. Joko has had a comfortable lead in opinion polls throughout the campaign, his administration has pushed back, and hard, against disinformation targeting him. Its first response was to try to raise the public’s awareness about online hoaxes. But then its own tactics took a more problematic turn. Placing little trust in social media platforms to remove offending content, the government has threatened to ban Facebook and block WhatsApp in Indonesia. Mr. Joko has instructed security forces to clamp down on citizens who spread fake news. The police have made numerous arrests, including of important members of the Muslim Cyber Army, for sharing posts online that, according to the head of the police’s cybercrime directorate, were “either provocative or simply false.” Earlier this year, the musician and Prabowo supporter Ahmad Dhani was sentenced to 18 months in jail for a series of tweets from 2017, including one thought to refer to that losing candidate in the 2017 race for Jakarta governor (“anyone who supports the blasphemer is scum and deserves to be spat in the face”). Mr. Dhani was charged under the Electronic Information and Transactions Law of 2008, which penalizes defamation online. But the opposition claims that the law has been used for political ends. Mr. Dhani has since gotten in trouble again, under the same law, for saying that opponents to a #2019ChangeThePresident rally he attended last summer were “idiots.” I find few records of arrests of people charged with slandering opposition figures. That could be because government supporters do less bad mouthing; more likely, it says something about the selective enforcement of the law. (Mr. Joko is known to have close ties to the police.) The president has also gone on the counteroffensive online. One campaigner for Mr. Joko made this case for resorting to disinformation to me last month: “Michelle Obama said, ‘When they go low, we go high.’ But it didn’t work. Trump won. So here, when they go low, we go lower.” Pro-Joko buzzers likely are behind hashtags like #PrabowoJumatanDimana (Where is Prabowo during Friday prayers?): Mr. Prabowo comes from a multidenominational family and is known for not being especially devout. Another trending hashtag is #ManaKeluargamu (Where is your family?), a reference to the fact that Mr. Prabowo is separated from his wife and his only son lives overseas. And then there are the allegations that Mr. Prabowo’s campaign is somehow affiliated with ISIS in various ways. It is extremely difficult to identify which claim or lie comes from the campaigns themselves, buzzers or outsiders, but together these messages have created a dangerous pattern: A political opposition lagging in opinion polls spreads misleading content online about the president, and he deploys state institutions to crack down on them even as his campaigners and supporters put out misleading material of their own. As much as Indonesia’s politicians have been warning the people about disinformation, it is largely they and their teams who are producing fake news. One result is an election campaign that has been more snide than substantive and that, in the name of differentiating two candidates who aren’t distinguishable enough, harps on supposedly deep social and political divisions — “this great disconnect,” as one candidate for vice president put it — that may not really exist. Another effect of these dirty tactics is to undermine the credibility of the system itself. Mr. Prabowo’s team has already questioned the legitimacy of the election, citing problems with voter lists and other irregularities — it could be feeding a convenient line to fake-news peddlers. Meanwhile, the police arrested two people last week for claiming that the election’s results had already been predetermined by the election commission and that Mr. Joko will be said to have won 57 percent of the votes. Mr. Joko’s likely victory over Mr. Prabowo on Wednesday will come as a relief to many Indonesian liberals and minority groups. Yet they should be worried about the latest practices of a president once heralded as a democratic reformer. That Mr. Joko’s government has chosen to respond to disinformation with disinformation signals a dangerous backsliding for democracy in Indonesia.

2019,‘When They See Us’ Trailer: Ava DuVernay’s Central Park Five Mini-Series Features Felicity Huffman,"Thirty years ago today, a female jogger was beaten and raped in Central Park. Five young men of color were unjustly convicted of the crime, only to be exonerated in 2002. Now the story of the so-called Central Park Five has been turned into a Netflix mini-series, and the first full trailer for it has just been released. It features what appears to be Felicity Huffman’s first acting appearance since pleading guilty in the college admissions scandal. “When They See Us” was created and directed by Ava DuVernay, who has previously dealt with stories of racial injustice in the feature film “Selma,” about civil rights marchers, as well as the documentary “13th,” about mass incarceration. She cast five little-known actors as the wrongly accused teenagers, and several more recognizable faces can be seen in the powerfully dramatic trailer, including Vera Farmiga as a prosecutor, Joshua Jackson as a defense attorney, and John Leguizamo and Michael Kenneth Williams as the fathers of two defendants. Linda Fairstein, the former head of the sex crimes unit in the Manhattan district attorney’s office, is played by Huffman, who has said she plans to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud for paying a college consultant to arrange for cheating on her daughter’s SAT. “I am ashamed of the pain I have caused my daughter, my family, my friends, my colleagues, and the educational community,” Huffman said in a statement accompanying the announcement of her plea deal, adding, “My desire to help my daughter is no excuse to break the law or engage in dishonesty.” Huffman will also appear in another forthcoming Netflix project, the parenting-themed film comedy “Otherhood,” but its release has been delayed. (Fairstein, who has since become a novelist, made headlines herself in November when the Mystery Writers of America withdrew an award for her because of her role in the Central Park Five case.) The streaming service will release all four episodes of “When They See Us” on May 31.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | ‘Why Aren’t Democrats Winning the Hispanic Vote 80-20 or 90-10?’,"It’s the question that may decide the 2020 elections — and the future of the Democratic Party. Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality. The future success of the Democratic Party depends on the crucial — but unsettled — allegiance of the nation’s growing Hispanic electorate. Fernand Amandi, a Democratic pollster and podcast host based in Miami, addressed the party’s Latino quandary in a December interview with The Associated Press: The question is not are Democrats winning the Hispanic vote — it’s why aren’t Democrats winning the Hispanic vote 80-20 or 90-10 the way they are winning black voters? In an interview earlier this week, Amandi told me that Democrats “want and hope for this magical osmosis to happen but that’s not how politics works.” In the 2018 midterms, Democrats showed gains among Hispanic voters in most states, compared with 2014. Party operatives are concerned, however, about the slow rate of growth of these improved Democratic margins. They are equally worried about turnout — at a time when many thought that President Trump’s rhetoric and policies would produce impressive gains among Latino voters for the Democratic Party. Take turnout. Hispanics are one of the fastest growing ethnic constituencies in the United States, but their level of political participation is not keeping pace with their overall population numbers. As the accompanying Pew chart demonstrates, the number of Hispanic voters in midterm elections has grown steadily, from 2.9 million in 1986 to 6.8 million in 2014. At the same time, however, turnout — measured as a percentage of total eligible adult citizens 18 and over — has experienced a relative decline. 30 MILLION 25.1 Eligible Hispanic voters 20 Hispanic voters in midterm elections 10 7.5 6.8 2.9 1986 ’90 ’94 ’98 ’02 ’06 ’10 ’14 30 MILLION 25.1 Eligible Hispanic voters 20 Hispanic voters in midterm elections 10 7.5 6.8 2.9 1986 ’90 ’94 ’98 ’02 ’06 ’10 ’14 By The New York Times | Source: Pew Research Center In 1986, the Latino turnout rate was 38.7 percent; in 2014, that rate fell to 27.1 percent. If the 2014 turnout rate had been as high as it was in 1986, Hispanics would have cast 9.7 million ballots instead of 6.8 million. (Complete numbers for 2018 are still being compiled.) In a preliminary analysis of Hispanic voter turnout last year, Catalist, a Democratic firm that builds voter lists, found significant increases in turnout of three to five percent, comparing 2018 with the 2014 midterms. Texas, Nevada and California saw five percent increases, Florida four percent, New Mexico and New York three percent. Turnout rates and levels of support are two key (but quite different) political measures. While Latinos had a turnout rate of 27.1 percent in 2014, their support for Democratic House candidates that year was 62 percent. Their support for Republican House candidates was 36 percent, according to exit polls. While Democratic support among Hispanics has improved over the past decade, from the low 60s to the high 60s, there is evidence suggesting that those gains cannot be relied upon in future elections. In the midterm elections, Florida became the prime example of such unreliability, as Republicans demonstrated they could buck state and national trends to make substantial gains among Hispanics. Republicans won two close statewide races in Florida in 2018, one for senate and one for governor — despite the gradual erosion of Republican support among Cuban-Americans in the state and despite the continuing influx of pro-Democratic Puerto Ricans in the wake of Hurricane Maria in 2017. Simon Rosenberg, president of NDN, formerly the New Democrat Network, a pro-Democratic think tank, wrote, “In All Important Florida, Democrats Lose Ground With Hispanic Voters” a month after the 2018 election: In an election where Democrats had one of their best years ever with Hispanic voters across the country, Florida Democrats saw their Hispanic numbers decline. Nationally, Democrats went from 62-36 (26 pts) in 2014 to 69-29 (40 pts) this election. In Florida, Democrats went from 58-38 (20 pts) in 2014 to 54-44 (10 pts) this year. As Rosenberg pointed out, this shift occurred despite the fact that Trump did everything possible to alienate Latinos, along with undercutting Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis, the winning Republican candidates for Senate and governor. Rosenberg noted that Trump had relentlessly attacked immigrants and Hispanics in particular. He grossly mismanaged the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, sending hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans fleeing to Central Florida. He revoked the temporary status of many immigrants in Florida. Given all this, one would have imagined the environment for Democrats to make gains among Hispanics was present in Florida this year, gains which were made elsewhere. Yet we fell back. By all accounts, Scott and DeSantis campaigned almost daily in Hispanic precincts, while their Democratic opponents, Bill Nelson and Andrew Gillum, took the Hispanic vote for granted. “We had no infrastructure,” Christian Ulvert, Gillum’s director for Spanish-language media, told Politico: And honestly, Democrats have been playing catch-up on Hispanic outreach for two decades, because Republicans have invested in it. You can’t close that gap overnight. Politico described Nelson’s bid for a fourth term as “a uniquely lazy campaign that made laughably ineffectual attempts to engage with Hispanics.” Melissa Michelson, a political scientist at Menlo College in California and president of the Latino caucus of the American Political Science Association, described in an email the changing political orientation of Florida’s Cuban-Americans. In a 1989-90 survey, Michelson wrote, 68.8 percent of Cuban-Americans identified with Republicans. Since then there have been significant changes: Over the years, she continued, Pew has documented a steady decline in Cuban-Americans’ Republican identification, from 64 percent in 2002 to 56 percent in 2006 to 47 percent in 2013. Despite the decline in Republican support among Cuban-Americans, Michelson emphasized that There has always been a contingent of Latinos who identify as Republican and are more interested in Republican/conservative (or anti-Communist) policies than in immigration issues or racism. Recall that 40 percent of Latinos voted for Bush in 2004. Reagan also enjoyed considerable Latino support. I think many Democrats are continually perplexed by this — that there could be Latino voters who are willing to support a president (or candidate) like Trump whose rhetoric and policies are so clearly anti-Latino and racist. While Scott and DeSantis revived Cuban-American willingness to support Republicans, two of the three Florida House seats that had been represented by Cuban-American Republicans switched parties in 2018. Revealing a contrast to Florida, Matt A. Barreto, a political scientist at U.C.L.A. and a co-founder of Latino Decisions, analyzed turnout and voting patterns in Texas. In a March report, Barreto described a huge pro-Democratic turnout increase there, ranging from 105 to 125 percent in eight counties where Hispanics make up more than 90 percent of the population. There were significant gains in counties with white majorities of 83 to 91 percent too, but these upturns were smaller, in the 35 to 55 percent range. The ability of two conservative Florida Republicans to make such inroads simply by campaigning diligently suggests that the Democratic hold on Latinos is less firm than many believed. So where do Latinos stand politically? The NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll surveyed 918 Hispanics during 2018 and found that Trump’s job approval rating was a relatively dismal 30 percent, 21 points below his 51 percent favorability rating among whites, but 18 points higher than his 12 percent approval rate among African-Americans. The data, provided to The Times by Public Opinion Strategies, one of the two firms that conducted the survey, found that Trump’s approval among Hispanics was highest among men and among the affluent — 40 percent for both — and among men without college degrees, at 39 percent. A 2018 Pew report, “Key takeaways about Latino voters in the 2018 midterm elections,” found that Hispanics cast a decisive majority of votes for Democratic congressional candidates (69-29), a smaller percentage of votes, however, than African-Americans (90-9) and Asian-Americans (77-23). Whites backed Republicans, 54 to 44. In a state-by-state breakdown, Pew found that in the Texas Senate race, Latinos backed Democrat Beto O’Rourke over Ted Cruz by nearly two to one, 64-35, while Greg Abbott, the incumbent Republican governor, lost the Hispanic vote to Democratic challenger Lupe Valdez, 53-42. In Florida, Democrats Gillum and Nelson won the Hispanic vote by nearly equal percentages (54-44 and 54-45) — but in both cases by margins that were inadequate to produce overall victory. The Democratic winner in the Nevada Senate race, Jacky Rosen, did far better among Hispanics, who backed her over Dean Heller, the Republican incumbent, 67-30. While many Democrats expected Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies, especially the family separation debacle, to produce a decisive shift to the left among Hispanics, that has not proved to be the case. An October 2018 Pew report found that almost half of Latinos (48 percent) believe there is about the right amount of immigrants living in the U.S., while a quarter say there are too many immigrants and 14 percent say there are too few. Three quarters of Hispanics opposed Trump’s proposal to build a wall along the Mexican border, while one in five favors construction. In an email, Barreto, of Latino Decisions, argued that Democratic support among Hispanics remains solid: I do not see anything since November 2018 to suggest Dems are losing any support at all. Trump continues on the same path of bashing immigrants and bashing Latinos without evidence and this only further decreases his favorability among Latinos. Asked about the declining share of eligible Hispanics turning out on Election Day, Barreto countered that the growing numbers of eligible Latinos are almost entirely driven by U.S. born young Latinos turning 18 and entering the eligible voter pool. In a common pattern, Barreto pointed out, “young people have very low rates of voter registration and voter turnout — especially in midterm elections.” Because of that, Barreto said that in order to get a better picture, the data should be age-adjusted so that turnout levels of older voters of different races and ethnicities could be compared. Barreto is also sharply critical of most polling of Hispanics and of exit polls in particular, arguing that the lack of Spanish-speaking interviewers results in an undercount of Hispanic turnout as well as inaccurate estimates of Republican and Democratic votes. In addition, candidates and political parties have to make a much stronger case to young Hispanics that their vote matters, according to Barreto: Otherwise, you will only get incremental growth each year — which still puts Latinos as a larger and larger share of the electorate, but perhaps not as large as we could be. Rosenberg, of NDN, argues that the Democratic Party did not start targeting the Hispanic electorate “with modern campaign tactics and communications” until the 2006-8 period. Those efforts immediately bore fruit, Rosenberg contended in an email: Remember that in 2004 Bush won Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada. Now Colorado and New Mexico are no longer really competitive at the presidential level, Nevada is slipping away from the Republicans, and Democrats elected a Senator in 2018 in Arizona. Texas, according to Rosenberg, “is about to hit a tipping point,” in large part because of the Hispanic vote. What conclusions and what questions remain in the wake of these complex and sometimes conflicting trends in the Hispanic electorate? First and foremost, Latinos remain a decisively Democratic constituency, with important caveats. Brian Schaffner, a political scientist at Tufts and co-principal researcher at the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, wrote in an email that nationally, Hispanic support for Democrats has been relatively consistent. Schaffner provided the accompanying graph, which shows the level of voting for Democrats in House contests in the six elections from 2008 to 2018 for whites, blacks, Asian-Americans and Hispanics. The Hispanic Democratic vote shows a significant 8.6 point increase from 2014 to 2016 and a 13.6-point increase from 2014 to 2018 — call it the Trump jump — although the increase in the percentage of Asian-Americans voting for Democrats was even larger at 20.2 points. Of votes for the two major-party candidates in House races, the share that went to Democrats. Change since 2008 (percentage points) 100% 94 Black 93 –1 72 +5 75% 70 +9 67 Asian 61 Hispanic 47 50% 46 –1 White 25% 2008 ’10 ’12 ’14 ’16 ’18 100% Black 94 93 –1 Change since 2008 (percentage points) 72 +5 75% 70 +9 67 Asian 61 Hispanic 50% 47 46 –1 White 25% 2008 ’10 ’12 ’14 ’16 ’18 By The New York Times | Source: analysis of Cooperative Congressional Election Study by Brian Schaffner, Tufts University Latinos’ partisan loyalties are much less hard and fast than, say, those of either African-Americans or white evangelicals. The results in Florida demonstrate that Democrats risk defeat if they fail to campaign heavily in Hispanic communities, and Republicans stand to gain at the margins if they are prepared to invest time, money and energy. The major question mark going into 2020, assuming Trump is the Republican nominee, is whether Hispanic opposition to his presidency will prevent a recurrence of the Florida 2018 phenomenon. Will Trump’s presence so nationalize the election that down-ballot Republicans will face a brick wall when they try to make modest inroads among Hispanics? To date, Trump has shown every intention of turning the election into a referendum on himself, and all the baggage he carries, with no regard for the political survival of fellow Republicans. If anything, he appears determined to drive up hostility to him among Latinos. For the past two days, for example, the president has ranted on Twitter, attacking Puerto Rico and its political leaders. On Monday, he told his Twitter followers: Puerto Rico got far more money than Texas & Florida combined, yet their government can’t do anything right, the place is a mess — nothing works. On Tuesday, he was still at it: All their local politicians do is complain & ask for more money. The pols are grossly incompetent, spend the money foolishly or corruptly, & only take from USA. Behaving this way, Trump may succeed in driving up support among “his people,” as he likes to call his voters. But if he keeps it up, he will be doing both his Democratic opponent and the Democratic Party as a whole a huge favor as far as the Latino vote goes.

2019,Sri Lankans Mourn Victims of Easter Sunday Bombings,"NEGOMBO, Sri Lanka — The little room, like much of Sri Lanka, could hold no more grief. All day Monday, through the steamy heat, mourners quietly stepped inside and paused in front of a sealed coffin containing what was left of Sneha Savindi Fernando. Sneha was 11 years old and standing in line for communion at Easter Mass on Sunday when she was blown apart. “Why did you leave me?” her grandmother cried, sitting in front of the coffin and rubbing its sides, the anguish tight in her hands. “There are so many bad people in the world. Why kill the innocents?” It was a question all of Sri Lanka was asking. The day after suicide bombers carried out coordinated attacks on half a dozen hotels and churches across this island nation, Sri Lanka remained in shock. The death toll continued to climb, with the authorities saying the attacks had killed at least 310 people. [Follow our live updates on the Sri Lanka bombings.] Just 10 days before the attack, a top police official had warned the country’s security services that a local, little-known Islamist group, National Thowheeth Jama’ath, was planning suicide attacks against churches, but no action was taken against the group, which a government official, Rauff Hakeem, the minister of city planning, called a “colossal failure on the part of the intelligence services.” But the question of blame was overshadowed by the sobbing and the shuffling of feet in Maha Hunupitiya, a Roman Catholic neighborhood near St. Sebastian’s Church in Negombo, a city about 20 miles north of Colombo, the capital. The suicide bomber’s blast was so powerful that it blew off much of the church’s roof. Heavy clay tiles rained down on worshipers, and dozens were killed. Maha Hunupitiya is now a neighborhood of the dead. White funeral flags fluttered everywhere. Mourners flowed down roads barely wide enough for one car, lined by profusions of pink and white bougainvillea. Their blank faces were a mirror of what so much of this country is feeling. In a small house near the Negombo church, Chandrani Fernando sat by an open window. Her husband’s body lay in a coffin a few feet away. Diluk Fernando was a carpenter and the father of a little girl. “We were so happy,” said Ms. Fernando, who is unrelated to Sneha. Her husband loved the beach, even though he couldn’t swim. Her eyes welled up with some memory, and as she wiped them she said, “Now, I am alone.” Also left alone is Kevin Goulding, a 17-year-old who watched his parents walk off for church on Sunday morning. His father was wearing a purple shirt and black trousers, his mother a smart orange blouse. That was the last time he ever saw them. Near the Gouldings’ home, just out of earshot of Kevin, a group of men from the neighborhood stood in a knot around one man’s phone, watching a video made moments after the bomber struck. It showed the bodies of Kevin’s parents heaped on the floor, along with many others. Investigators continued to collect evidence at the church, where flesh and burned hair were stuck to the walls and sunlight streamed through holes in the roof. Sri Lanka is nothing if not resilient. A relatively small, poor country, it endured a decades-long civil war that killed tens of thousands of civilians before it ended in 2009. Five years earlier, 30,000 Sri Lankans died in the Indian Ocean tsunami. Shaped over the centuries by waves of immigration and trade, Sri Lankan society is a tapestry of different ethnicities and faiths. It has struggled with sectarian divisions among its Buddhist majority and Hindu, Muslim and Christian minorities that have occasionally erupted into violence. People are hopeful that the universal grief from these attacks will stitch those groups more tightly together. “For many years, we have lived in peace,” said Sanjeewa Samarasinghe, one of the few shopkeepers open on Monday. But trouble is beginning to brew. Monday afternoon, a band of young Christian men prowled through Negombo carrying long sticks. They said they were looking for Muslims. “I’m worried,” said Sithy Suwadha Kudhoos, one of the few Muslims in Negombo. “Everyone here is feeling so terrible. You never know.” At Sneha’s house, no one mentioned anything even close to revenge. Anger still seemed many phases of grief away. People stood quietly in front of the coffin. Most said nothing. A picture of Sneha sat next to the door. A faint smell of jasmine hung in the air. Her family said she loved to cook and eat cake. For her next birthday, she was hoping to get a pair of jeans and a T-shirt. The heavy silence in the room was occasionally punctured by the sobs of her grandmother, Lalitha Hettiarachchi, who never left her seat next to the coffin. She was inconsolable, and her utterings seemed to capture what the other mourners were quietly thinking. “Everyone has come to see you, my daughter,” she said, rubbing the coffin. “We will wait for you. We will wait for you. Please, get up and talk.” An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified the Sri Lankan official Rauff Hakeem.

2019,‘Wild Nights With Emily’ Review: Emily Dickinson as Romantic Comedy Heroine,"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. In Madeleine Olnek’s “Wild Nights With Emily,” the life and work of Emily Dickinson are subject to a delightfully droll — even gay — reinterpretation. For believers in the legend of the hermetic poet who never left her bedroom, it may come as a surprise that the Emily (Molly Shannon) of Olnek’s film is not a melancholic recluse, but the heroine of a romantic comedy. Olnek’s version of events is supported by studies of Dickinson’s poems which revealed that references to possible lovers were covered up. Historians debate the meaning of such findings, but Olnek’s film is free of equivocation. Her Emily is a woman who loves women, and her film details one version of how her life might have differed from her legacy. The film is largely narrated by Mabel Todd (Amy Seimetz), who assembled and edited the first posthumous collection of Dickinson’s poetry. A faithless reader — and, notably, the mistress of Emily’s brother — Mabel erases Emily’s dashes and scrubs out the poet’s loving dedications to her sister-in-law, Susan Gilbert (Susan Ziegler). As Mabel presents a sanitized version of Emily, Olnek undercuts her account with scenes of Emily and Susan in love, in bed and in correspondence. The tension between what we see and what we hear of Emily’s life provides the film with much of its levity. As the gaudy, pink-clad and ill-tailored Mabel delivers her chaste accounts of the Dickinson household, Olnek gleefully cuts to scenes of petticoats and hoop skirts akimbo. This is an irreverent film, but its lightness is meaningful. With each silly flourish, Olnek offers joy and companionship to a figure whose history was more conveniently presented to generations of readers as solitary.

2019,‘Will You Stay With Me Until I Die?’,"Rites of passage My patient had a simple, devastating request. To honor it meant grappling with how a therapist responds to her clients. I was mainlining pretzels in my office kitchen as I waited for Julie to arrive. Whenever she was late, I would think the worst. Should I check on her between sessions or let her call if she needed me because I knew she had trouble asking for help? Should therapists’ boundaries be different — looser — with terminally ill patients? Then again, the week before, I’d done something therapists aren’t supposed to do. I told her that I loved her. Julie, whose real name I am not using to protect patient privacy, discovered her cancer on her honeymoon. A spot on her breast felt tender, and she thought she might be pregnant. She and her husband, both in their 30s, wanted to start a family as soon as they got married. When they returned home, she learned that the tender spot was cancer. That’s when Julie landed in my office. Her physician referred me, which was unusual, given that I didn’t specialize in work with cancer patients and I was only about two years into my practice. But that was exactly why Julie wanted to see me. She had told her physician that she didn’t want a therapist from “the cancer team.” She wanted to feel normal, to be part of the living. And since her doctors were confident she would be fine, she wanted to focus on getting through the treatment while being newly married. (What should she say in her wedding thank-you notes? Thanks so much for the lovely bowl … I keep it by my bed to vomit in?) Given the situation, we dived right in; there were none of the usual preliminaries. We discussed wigs versus scarves, post-mastectomy body image, marriage and her desire to become a mother. We weren’t even thinking about death then. By year’s end Julie seemed healthy, just as her doctors expected. Our work was done. Of course, I was thrilled for her, but I knew I would miss seeing her. A little-discussed fact about therapy is that it involves forming deep attachments to people and then saying goodbye, often forever. I looked forward to our weekly sessions because Julie was, refreshingly, so unlike me: an easygoing extrovert to my more cautious introvert, a realist but not an overthinker. We did share a sense of humor, though. Once, after I had distractedly put on my gray pajama top that said “Namast’ay in Bed” instead of the gray sweater I’d laid out for work that morning, I was mortified while seeing other patients. Julie and I laughed and laughed about it. I was surprised when, six months later, I heard Julie’s voice in my messages. The cancer was back, and this time it was going to kill her. It might take a year or five or, if things went very well, 10. “Will you stay with me until I die?” Julie asked as she sat on my couch the next morning, her eyes red, her face puffy. Though my instinct was to do what people tend to do when somebody they care about brings up death, which is to deny it completely, I had to remember that I was there to help Julie, not to comfort myself. Still, I wasn’t sure I was the best person for this. I had absolutely no experience accompanying a young newlywed to her death. What if I said or did the wrong thing? What if I couldn’t handle my own sadness? What if I let her down? She must have sensed my hesitation. “Please,” she said. “I can’t go to those cancer people. They call everyone ‘brave,’ but I’m terrified and besides, what choice do we have?” She leaned forward on the couch. “They have affirmations on their walls. So, please?” I knew that approach would be all wrong for Julie. So right then, I promised to be there until the end. We started with Julie’s bucket list: How, she wondered, should she spend her time? She told me that she’d begun to notice how often in casual conversation people talked about the future. “This summer, I’m going to lose weight.” “In three years, I’ll get that promotion.” “I’m saving to buy a house.” It was hard for Julie to plan a future not knowing how much time there was. But planning, we learned, was illusory, and not just for Julie. After all, Julie wasn’t the only one who was dying. Life has a 100 percent mortality rate, and most of us have no idea how or when we will die. Here’s what I quickly got used to: the startling juxtaposition of great joy and great despair; yelling expletives together in my office at the delivery of bad news; the roller coaster of what we came to call the “just kiddings” — tumors disappearing and then coming back with a vengeance; and writing her obituary together when Julie, uber-organized, wanted to have what she called her final paper “turned in early.” Near the end, our sessions consisted of more and more silence, not because we were avoiding saying something anymore, but because this is how we faced each other most honestly as her energy waned. Our silences were rich, our emotions swirling in the air. One day, between the silences, Julie said she was thinking about time travel. She had heard a radio show about it and shared a quote she loved, a description of the past as “a vast encyclopedia of calamities you can still fix.” A few minutes later, she fell asleep in session for the first time. When she woke up, she felt embarrassed and made a joke about how I must have been time-traveling while she was sleeping, wishing I were someplace else. I told her I wasn’t. I had heard the same radio show and was thinking about an observation made at the end: that we’re all time-traveling into the future and at exactly the same rate, 60 minutes per hour. “Then I guess we’re fellow time travelers in here,” Julie said. “We are,” I said. “Even when you’re resting.” Another time, Julie broke our silence to tell me that her husband thought she was being a deathzilla — going crazy with the death-party planning, the way some brides become bridezillas with their weddings. She’d even hired a party planner to help carry out her vision, and her husband, despite his initial discomfort, was now fully onboard. When I asked what she wanted that day to be like, she grinned. “Well, I’d rather not be dead that day,” she said. Then she said she liked the idea of a “celebration of life,” which the party planner told her was all the rage, but didn’t like the message that came with it. “It’s a funeral, for God’s sake,” Julie said. “All these people in my cancer group say, ‘I want people to celebrate! I don’t want people to be sad.’ And I’m like, ‘Why not? You died!’” “This might sound crazy,” she said, “but I know that I’ll hear your voice after I die — that I’ll hear you wherever I am.” She said she believed she’d hear the voices of those she loved. “I would never say this if I weren’t dying,” she added quietly, suddenly shy for the first time since I had met her, “but I include you in those I love.” Though I had come to love many patients over the years, I had never used those words with any of them. There are many ways to convey to patients how deeply we have come to care about them without getting into dicey territory. But Julie had said she loved me, and I wasn’t going to stand on professional ceremony and reply with a watered-down response. “I love you too, Julie,” I said to her that day. She smiled, then closed her eyes and dozed off again. THE DAY OF ALL THE PRETZELS at work was three years after I had started seeing her. When my light went on, indicating Julie had arrived, I breathed a sigh of relief: She was alive. But that would be our last session in my office. Julie wanted to die at home, and for our last few sessions, that’s where I saw her. We didn’t have a profound “grand finale,” as she had been calling our final session. Her last words to me were about steak, though she could no longer eat. “God, what I would give for a steak,” she said, her voice weak and barely audible. “They better have steak wherever I’m going.” “Will you think about me?” Julie used to ask me before she went in for her various surgeries, and I always told her I would. Later, though, when it became clear that Julie would die, that question took on another meaning: Will a part of me remain alive in you? At the most random of times, I still hear Julie’s question: Will you think about me? The thing is, I do. I remember her most in the silences.

2019,"‘Women Talking,’ by Miriam Toews, Is a Mennonite #MeToo Novel","Fiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. WOMEN TALKING By Miriam Toews Between 2005 and 2009 in an isolated Mennonite colony in Bolivia, women and girls (as young as 3) regularly woke up groggy and bruised, their sheets smeared with blood and semen. Some members of the conservative patriarchal community blamed demons; others attributed these reports to “wild female imagination.” In reality, nine men in the close-knit community had been breaking into houses every few nights, spraying the sleeping inhabitants with a drug designed to anesthetize cattle and raping them while they lay unconscious. This real-life horror story inspired Miriam Toews’s scorching sixth novel, “Women Talking,” set in the fictional Mennonite colony of Molotschna, where nearly every girl and woman has been raped. But don’t expect a crime novel full of detail about the assaults, and don’t expect an excavation of the survivors’ emotional experience. Toews skips over the rapes and the apprehension of the rapists, cutting straight to existential questions facing the women in the aftermath. “Women Talking” is a wry, freewheeling novel of ideas that touches on the nature of evil, questions of free will, collective responsibility, cultural determinism and, above all, forgiveness. As Agata Friesen, an unflappable matriarch, puts it: “Let’s talk about our sadness after we have nailed down our plan.” They don’t have a lot of time. The men of Molotschna have traveled to town to bail the rapists out of jail. Should the women still be there when the men return? In a mouse-infested hayloft, sitting on overturned milk buckets, the women drink instant coffee, joke, smoke, weep, endure bouts of morning sickness (one of the women was impregnated by an “unwelcome visitor,” as the colony’s male elders call the rapists) and debate what a better future might look like. [ Read our profile of Miriam Toews. ] The narrator is the local schoolteacher, August Epp, who grew up Mennonite and speaks Plautdietsch, but also lived for many years outside the community. The women recruit him to take minutes at their meetings because they can’t read or write; they trust him because he is, as one woman says, “an effeminate man who is unable to properly till a field or eviscerate a hog.” In other words, harmless. Like his introspective fourth-century namesake, August was once paralyzed by guilt over stealing some pears, and he’s prone to extravagant bouts of self-loathing. When August broods on his own sorrows, the novel sags. When he transcribes what these angry women say to one another, it crackles. [ Read our review of two other Toews books about Mennonite communities: a novel, “Irma Voth,” and a memoir of her father, “Swing Low.” ] The women have come up with three competing plans. They can remain in the colony and live exactly as they did before the assaults, they can stay and fight for change or they can hitch up their buggies and leave. Although they disagree constantly and sharply, there’s one point on which they concur: They have been treated like animals — and it didn’t start with the rapes. “When our men have used us up so that we look 60 when we’re 30 and our wombs have literally dropped out of our bodies onto spotless kitchen floors, finished, they turn to our daughters,” a woman named Salome says. “And if they could sell us all at auction afterwards they would.” Fierce, articulate Salome often gets the last word, but the novel is a choral ensemble piece in which each woman chimes in with a distinctive voice. Toews, who was raised Mennonite and left the church at 18, depicts the women at the center of the novel with insight, sympathy and respect. Their conversation is loose, unpredictable, occasionally profane and surprisingly funny. The best parts of the narrative consist of women asking questions and other women answering, with little description or editorializing from August. Practical concerns loom large. How will the women survive if they leave? As Agata says: “We’re unable to read, we’re unable to write, we’re unable to speak the language of our country, we have only domestic skills that may or may not be required of us elsewhere in the world, and speaking of the world — we have no world map.” A tentative point in favor of leaving: “We will see a little bit of the world?” On the list of cons: “We won’t be forgiven.” But while the practical obstacles to leaving are formidable, the philosophical questions are at the heart of the discourse. The women of Molotschna haven’t read Plato, but they’ve got the principles of Socratic dialogue down cold. Given that biblical law mandates women obey their husbands, chain-smoking Mejal wonders if it isn’t a sin to leave them. Salome retorts that it is impossible to disobey a Bible that none of them have ever actually read. Agata pronounces: “Our faith requires of us absolute commitment to pacifism, love and forgiveness. By staying, we risk these things. We will be at war with our attackers because we’ve acknowledged that we — well, some of us — want to kill them.” Salome, who went after the rapists with a scythe, scoffs at the idea of an “absolute commitment” to love: “A very small amount of hate is a necessary ingredient to life.” But if Salome stays in the colony, she will not be allowed even her tiny nugget of hate. The community’s leader, Bishop Peters, has decreed that if the rapists ask to be forgiven, the women must forgive them. If they don’t, the men will be barred from heaven and the women excommunicated, forfeiting their own places in the celestial kingdom. Is coerced forgiveness even forgiveness? wonders dreamy, eccentric Ona, whom Peters has nicknamed “the Devil’s daughter.” Maybe they shouldn’t worry too much about getting into heaven, Salome grumbles, as there are no chores up there, so beasts of burden probably aren’t even allowed. One of the biggest questions is the degree to which all the men in Molotschna are responsible (or not) for what the rapists did. “Perhaps not all men, per se, but a pernicious ideology that has been allowed to take hold of men’s hearts and minds,” Ona says. But doesn’t this view actually exonerate the rapists? Doesn’t it suggest, as one of the women puts it, “that all of us, men and women, are victims of the circumstances from which Molotschna has been created?” By loosening the tongues of disenfranchised women and engaging them in substantive dialogue about their lives, Toews grants them agency they haven’t enjoyed in life. By refusing to focus on the crimes that launched this existential reappraisal, she treats them as dignified individuals rather than props in a voyeuristic entertainment. The only problem with this approach is that the grotesque and bizarre crime wave that launches the narrative remains all but unfathomable. It looms in the background, begging to be dramatized and explained. You don’t need an appetite for the salacious to want to know how a handful of men could rape dozens of women in a close-knit community, year after year, undetected. And you can appreciate this smart novel of ideas while also wanting to know how the women might have felt about this profound and intimate betrayal even before they started talking.",The New York Times
2019,‘You Are Hiding in Plain Sight’: Indiana Police Still Looking for Killer of 2 Teenage Girls,"“Down the hill.” For more than two years, investigators in Indiana have pored over those three words and a video of a man taken from the cellphone of a teenage girl who was found murdered with her friend in the woods. The man’s voice and image in the phone were among thousands of clues and tips that the authorities have investigated since the bodies were discovered on Feb. 14, 2017. But on Monday, law enforcement authorities released more material to the public, saying they had still not solved the case. The new material included about one second of video of the man walking behind the girls, his hat pulled down low, in the hopes that someone watching might recognize a quirk in his gait or a familiar mannerism, Superintendent Douglas G. Carter of the State Police said. All the material had been secretly captured by Liberty German, 14, before she and her friend Abigail J. Williams, 13, were “brutally murdered,” the superintendent said. Speaking at a crowded public meeting attended by the girls’ families and the news media in Delphi, Superintendent Carter urged the audience to “watch the mannerisms” of the man, who was shown stepping unevenly along deteriorated wooden tracks on an old railroad bridge. A new sketch of the suspect was released as well as a new version of the audio recording, in which a slight inflection in the man’s voice can be detected as he says the word “guys,” in addition to the words “down the hill.” Superintendent Carter said the suspect was believed to be from Delphi, and between the ages of 18 and 40. He said they might have already interviewed him during “thousands and thousands” of hours of investigation. In fact, he said, the suspect might even be at the public meeting. “We believe you are hiding in plain sight,” Superintendent Carter said. “We know that this is about power to you,” he added. “We try so hard to understand how a person could do something like this to two children.” The public meeting on Monday was part of a fresh push for leads in the case that has shaken Delphi, a city of around 3,000 residents about 60 miles north of Indianapolis. On Monday, the State Police also published an announcement urging the public: “Look at the sketch, listen to the audio, watch how this coward walks on the high bridge and send your tip to this email: Abbyandlibbytip@cacoshrf.com.” “We are coming for you and there’s no place for a heartless coward like you to hide that gets his thrill from killing little girls,” Superintendent Carter said. The authorities have not said how the girls, who were eighth-grade students at Delphi Community Middle School, were killed. The case traces back to about 1 p.m. on Feb. 13, 2017, when they set off for a walk to the Monon High Bridge, an abandoned rail bridge near a 10-mile trail known as the Delphi Historic Trail. It was a Monday, but there was no school that day because of winter break, and the girls had arranged to be picked up in the area that afternoon. They never showed up. Frantic family members called the authorities. Search parties were organized, and at about noon on Feb. 14, a team discovered the bodies of the girls in a wooded area near the trail, about a half-mile upstream from the bridge, the police said. The Delphi Police Department, the Carroll County Sheriff, the State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation initiated an investigation. Grief counselors were stationed at the middle school, where the girls had participated in sports teams and the school band. A tip line and an initial reward of $41,000 were set up. The reward has since ballooned to $240,000. About a week after the girls’ bodies were found, the authorities released the three-word audio and the enhanced image taken from Liberty’s cellphone of the man following them in the hopes that someone might recognize a suspect. About a year after the bodies were found, investigators had fielded more than 30,000 tips, and followed up on more than 1,000 people of interest from almost every state, the police said. Superintendent Carter said the authorities were also looking for the driver of a truck that had been abandoned near a highway on the day the girls went missing, but he did not elaborate on the connection to the case. Officials have praised Liberty for having the presence of mind to take what appeared to be a secret recording of their killer. “This young lady is a hero, there is no doubt, to have enough presence of mind to activate the video system on her cellphone to record what we believe is criminal behavior that is about to occur,” Sgt. Tony Slocum of the State Police said in 2017.",The New York Times
2019,‘You Shouldn’t Be Here’: U.S. Pushes U.N. to Pull Venezuela Envoy’s Credentials,"UNITED NATIONS — Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday urged the United Nations to revoke the credentials of Venezuela’s ambassador to the world body, portraying him as a loyalist to the country’s disputed president, Nicolás Maduro, and to a government that has allowed crime, violence and starvation to rise. In a 20-minute speech to the United Nations Security Council, Mr. Pence called for a formal recognition of Juan Guaidó as the rightful leader of Venezuela, which he called “a failed state — and as history teaches, failed states know no boundaries.” Mr. Pence turned to the Venezuelan ambassador, Samuel Moncada Acosta, telling him, “You shouldn’t be here.” “You should return to Venezuela and tell Nicolás Maduro that his time is up,” Mr. Pence said. “It’s time for him to go.” The Council meeting addressed the situation in Venezuela, which officials and experts are increasingly describing as a humanitarian crisis that has led about 3.5 million citizens to flee the country. Instead of offering temporary asylum to Venezuelans, the Trump administration has called for Mr. Maduro’s ouster to relieve a country rattled by skyrocketing inflation, widespread blackouts and a growing public health crisis. The United States, as a replacement, is forcefully supporting Mr. Guaidó, the National Assembly politician whom the administration recognizes as the rightful interim president. On Wednesday, Mr. Pence also accused China and Russia of meddling in efforts to remove Mr. Maduro. While “Russia and China continue to obstruct at the Security Council,” Mr. Pence said, “rogue states like Iran and Cuba are doing all they can to prop up the Maduro regime.” Global rivalries have hindered the ability of the United Nations to address the crisis, despite intensifying warnings that the situation is deteriorating. In February, the United States and Russia introduced dueling resolutions on Venezuela at the Security Council. The American proposal called for free and fair elections, and the Russian plan backed Mr. Maduro’s government. Both failed. Two weeks ago, President Trump warned Russia to “get out of” Venezuela after two of Moscow’s military planes landed in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, to unload supplies and military personnel. But Mr. Trump has done little else to publicly engage as the crisis continues. That role has fallen to Mr. Pence. But on Wednesday, he did not give a firm answer when asked by a reporter where the United States would draw a line on Russia’s involvement. He also did not give a timeline when asked if the possibility of American military intervention, an option long played up by administration officials, was drawing closer as conditions in Venezuela worsened. Instead, the Trump administration has tried to choke off Mr. Maduro’s economic resources. Last week, it announced a round of sanctions targeting oil shipments between Venezuela and Cuba, the latest in a string of initiatives meant to curb Caracas’s ability to do business. Visas have been revoked in recent weeks for hundreds of Mr. Maduro’s associates. In briefings held before Mr. Pence arrived to speak, United Nations officials warned of a situation that has only grown more dire as unrest continues and said that offering relief to Venezuelan citizens should not be a political issue. Mark Lowcock, an under secretary for humanitarian affairs, told the Security Council that a recent draft overview of the situation by the United Nations indicated that around 1.9 million people require nutritional assistance because of worsening food availability, including 1.3 million children under 5. Additionally, Mr. Lowcock said, tuberculosis, diphtheria, measles, malaria and other preventable diseases have resurfaced in Venezuela. Food shortages also remain a main factor in driving people out of the country: Surveys show that 80 percent of Venezuelan households struggle with finding enough food, United Nations officials said. “In Venezuela, there is a need to separate political and humanitarian objectives,” Mr. Lowcock said. “Humanitarian assistance must be delivered on the basis of need alone.” The number of people expected to leave Venezuela may surpass five million by the year’s end, said Eduardo Stein, a special United Nations envoy for Venezuelan refugees and migrants. Citing a worsening public health crisis aggravated by constant blackouts, Kathleen Page, a doctor and professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, urged the Security Council to declare a humanitarian crisis formally and address it in a “neutral, independent and impartial” way. On Tuesday, Mr. Maduro said he had met with members of the Red Cross to finalize plans for the arrival of aid to Venezuela. His government and the opposition reached a deal to organize a large-scale relief effort late last month. “We reiterated our disposition to establish cooperation mechanisms for international aid and assistance,” Mr. Maduro wrote Tuesday on Twitter. The United States still does not have a permanent representative to the United Nations, a fact that reporters pointed out to Mr. Pence as he fielded questions over whether the Security Council would support his demand to revoke the Venezuelan ambassador’s credentials. Mr. Pence said he felt that “momentum is on the side of freedom.”",The New York Times
2019,"‘ZooMass’ No More, UMass Crashes the Men’s Frozen Four","AMHERST, Mass. — When Coach Greg Carvel arrived at University of Massachusetts-Amherst from St. Lawrence University in 2016, he inherited a hockey program that had just two winning seasons since 1995 and had won only 11 conference games in Hockey East the previous three seasons. “We were the joke of Hockey East for a while there,” said Kurt Keats, the only senior on the team who has been in the program for four years. “We definitely were not a source of pride for the university.” But this season, the Minutemen won their first Hockey East regular-season title and advanced to their first men’s Frozen Four. They will play eight-time national champion Denver University in the semifinals on Thursday night in Buffalo, with the winner facing the defending champion Minnesota Duluth or Providence in the championship game Saturday night. Almost from the moment he arrived on campus, Carvel, who on Tuesday was named the national coach of the year, promised a change in culture and fortune for a program that was often overshadowed by in-state rival UMass-Lowell, announcing, “We’re not ZooMass, we’re NewMass.” Still, in his first season, UMass had only five victories and lost its last 17 games. Last year UMass finished 17-20-2, but did win its first-round series in the Hockey East playoffs. Signs of a breakthrough came early this season. The Minutemen won at Ohio State, ranked No. 1 at the time, in its second game, then rode a nine-game winning streak to the top spot, sweeping No. 4 Providence along the way. They are ranked fourth in the most recent poll, and are the only Division I men’s team that did not lose consecutive games this season. UMass takes a 30-9-0 record to the Frozen Four, but after earning its berth in Buffalo, even Carvel admitted, “We’re way ahead of schedule.” The Minutemen produced this surprising season with one of the youngest rosters in college hockey. Of its 25 skaters, 19 are freshmen and sophomores, including the first-year Finnish goalie Filip Lindberg. Lindberg took over the starting job from the sophomore Matt Murray, who had won 20 games, in the Hockey East quarterfinals sweep against New Hampshire and has posted three shutouts since. In the N.C.A.A. East Regional, UMass outscored Harvard and Notre Dame by a combined 8-0. The team’s marquee player, though, is the sophomore defenseman Cale Makar, the No. 4 overall pick in the 2017 N.H.L. draft. He is expected to join the Colorado Avalanche in the Stanley Cup playoffs as soon as his college season ends. Along with St. Cloud State’s Jimmy Schuldt and Harvard’s Adam Fox, also defensemen, Makar is a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award, given to the most outstanding player in college hockey. The winner will be announced on Saturday. Carvel left no doubt on how he thinks the vote should go, saying last week of Makar: “He’s the best player in college hockey. It’s not even close.” According to Brian Willsie, the development consultant for the Avalanche, Makar has all the qualities necessary for success in the N.H.L. “To say he’s a mobile defenseman is an understatement,” Willsie said. “His skating is what blows you away. It’s on a different level.” With 16 goals and 32 assists, Makar, a native of Calgary, Alberta, is tied for third in the nation in scoring. With three points in Buffalo, he would become the first defenseman to lead the nation in points. “In tight games, in the third periods, he knows how to win games,” Willsie said. “He’s such a driven, focused kid.” Northeastern Coach Jim Madigan has seen enough of Makar the last two seasons to say, “ He has all the makings of a 15-year pro.” Makar anchors a defense that is UMass’ strength. Not only are the Minutemen sixth in the country in goals against average (1.97), but their defensemen have accounted for 39 goals and 87 assists, powering an offense that is third in the country at 3.77 goals per game. Forward Brett Boeing said UMass’s aggressive style starts with its defense. “We want to force turnovers and then control the play,” he said. “When we’re playing well, you can see the frustration on the other team.” Carvel, 48, was not thinking about immediately reaching Frozen Fours when he took over the program in 2016. UMass had been a Division II program when it dropped men’s hockey in 1979. The sport didn’t return to Amherst until the 8,389-seat Mullins Center opened in 1993. After one year as an independent, when it won 20 games, UMass joined Hockey East for the 1994-95 season. UMass received an at-large bid to its first N.C.A.A tournament in 2007, losing to Maine in the quarterfinals. Despite losing records in all but two of its Division I seasons before this one, the Minutemen have produced N.H.L. players, among them goalie Jonathan Quick and forward Conor Sheary, who have won Stanley Cups. Carvel’s first objective was to identify the right players to take the team forward. Keats, who played 35 games as a freshman, was one of those players under the microscope. “When he came in, we knew he wanted to weed guys out,” Keats said. That first season, Keats said, players bought in to Carvel’s message, “but we didn’t see the results.” For the 2017-18 season, Carvel brought in 13 freshmen, including Makar and fellow defenseman Mario Ferraro, the No. 49 overall pick by the San Jose Sharks in 2017. A different attitude arrived with them. “You could see something starting to develop,” Keats said. In a season of few regrets, Carvel said he wished success had come earlier for players like Keats and Boeing, who were around when the program was floundering. “I think they’re a little wistful about that, how success came late in their time at UMass,” he said. “But they will always carry that they were part of the group that turned this program around.”",The New York Times
2019,ためらう花嫁,皇位の存続：エピソード3 彼女は、外交のキャリアを志していた。皇太子は、彼女への想いがあった CreditCreditAssociated Press 火曜日、天皇明仁は、200年ぶりに生前退位をする。シリーズのエピソード１、２では、彼が、敗戦国となった世界最古の君主制を再定義した。この物語は、水曜日に天皇となる長男、徳仁について続く。 二人はほんの数分間言葉を交わした。しかし、それで十分だった。 彼は26歳、オックスフォード大学で史学を勉強した、そしてたまたま皇位継承順位第二位にある温厚なプリンスだった。 彼女は22歳、ハーバード大学卒の才媛、父と同様に外務省に入省し、仕事を続けようとしていた。 1986年10月のある午後、彼が主催した、スペインのエレナ王女歓迎レセプションで二人は出会った。 弦楽のクラシック音楽が奏でられる中、外交官の娘であった小和田雅子は、オレンジジュースをすすった。皇太子明仁の長男である徳仁は、会場の120人のゲストの間を歩いて回っていた。二人は紹介され、彼は「どのような外交官になりたいですか」と彼女に尋ねた。 彼女の返事は記録に残っていないが、数年後、徳仁は、会話が楽しかった、と、そして心を奪われた、と語る。「彼女は控えめでしたが、自分の考えをはっきり述べ、非常に知的でした」と当時を振り返った。 もちろん、これは偶然の出会いではなかった。日本では、多くの政治家よりも人気の高い皇室の存続の問題は、徳仁が妻を見つけること、そして世継ぎをもうけることにかかっていた。彼は、いつか天皇になり、継承者を必要としていた。 宮内庁の侍従は、この年、難関な日本の外交官試験に合格した三人の女性のうちの一人が小和田さんと知り、レセプションに招待するよう調整を図った。このレセプション、またそれに続く都内での何回かの再会によって、徳仁の心に火がついた。 小和田さんは、求愛されたが、控えめだった。彼女は外交官になりたてで、仕事に没頭していた。それでも、彼は彼女の誕生日に花を贈った。一年後、彼女は外務研修のためにオックスフォード大学に留学、国際関係論を学んだ。記者達は、彼女が図書館の入り口で即席の記者会見を開き、皇太子との関係を否定するまで、しつこくつきまとった。 当時、関係者にとって、皇太子妃選考は、大変になるはずはないと考えられていた。日本の華族、資産家、また高学歴のエリートのたくさんの子女が、皇太子妃候補として挙げられていたのだ。選考班は200人近い女性の写真や関係書類を持っていた、と見るものもいた。徳仁は、そのうちの一人と意気投合するに違いない、と関係者は考えていた。 しかし、そうではなかった。年を追うごとに、徳仁が結婚しなければ皇室が危うい状態に陥るという懸念が高まっていった。1989年に明仁が天皇に即位し、彼が皇太子になると、その議論はますます強くなった。 徳仁の弟である秋篠宮は、東京の横断歩道で、大学時代からの恋人に突然プロポーズし、1990年に結婚したが、これが徳仁の結婚を促す助けとはならなかった。侍従たちは、秋篠宮より先に徳仁の結婚を望んでいたが、秋篠宮はしびれを切らしたのだろう。 彼ひとりではなかった。国全体がしびれを切らしていた。1991年のある新聞は「国民の最大の懸念は、結婚問題である」と報じた。記者達は、皇太子妃候補を追い掛けた。しかし徳仁はデートする姿を見せることはなかった（彼は一度、ブルック・シールズとの対面を果たしている。 あるタブロイドは、徳仁の髪型が真面目すぎて魅力的でないかもしれないとして、修正写真で違うヘアスタイルを提案する記事を載せた。また、彼のオックスフォード大学の論文「交通路としてのテムズ川：18世紀におけるテムズ川上流の航行と交通の研究」の題名を挙げ、彼は面白みに欠けるかもしれないというものもいた。 徳仁は記者達からの質問を受け、将来妻となる女性の家柄や資産、また、出身校や、身長にも関心がないと答えた（侍従たちは、163cmの皇太子より背の低い皇太子妃を望んでいた）。 徳仁は、自分が望んでいるのは、同じ価値観を持っている人、例えば、ティファニーの最新の宝石ではなく本当の美しさが分かる人、良い人間関係を築ける人、「必要なときには」自分の考えをしっかり述べられる人だ、と答えた。 とりわけ、妻となる女性は自分自身で選びたいと述べた。 天皇明仁は静かに見守るように、と求めた。皇太子のことがご心配ではないか、との記者達からの質問には、「静かに見守るのが大切だと思います」と答えた。 宮内庁は、日本のマスコミに対して、候補者たちを怖がらせないように、皇太子妃を巡る報道の停止を要請したほどだった。 その時にはわからなかったが、後に皇室の伝説となったのは、徳仁は、ガラスの靴が合う女性、つまり小和田雅子さんが受け入れてくれることをずっと待っていたのである。 多くの意味で、彼女が皇太子妃になる可能性は低いと考えられた。彼女は幼少期の半分を海外で過ごし、少なくとも4カ国語を話し、アメリカの公立高校を卒業後、ハーバード大学で経済学を勉強した。さらに、皇太子よりも少し背が高かった。 とりわけ、それまでの日本の皇太子妃とは異なり、彼女は仕事を持っていた。小和田さんは、1990年に日本に帰国して以来、外務省で、日米貿易の交渉に努める立場となり、長時間勤務、時には徹夜したことも知られている。 それでも、徳仁が思い留まることはなかった。もしも小和田さんが関心を寄せてくれなかったら、結婚しないかもしれない、と、徳仁は侍従に言った。 1992年の春までには、小和田さんが徳仁とデートするようにと、彼女への説得が始まっていた。複数の外交官に協力を仰ぎ、最終的には外務省の高官であり大使でもあった小和田さんの父までも加わることとなった。 彼女にどうしてノーといえるだろうか。小和田さんは皇太子とのお茶の誘いを承諾した。うまくいったに違いなかった。それから2カ月も経たないうちに、二人は、宮内庁新浜鴨場で再会した。32歳の徳仁は、プロポーズをした。 小和田さんは、考える時間が欲しいと答えた。 プロポーズを受け入れることは、キャリアをあきらめて、制約の多い生活を送ることになる。皇后美智子が皇太子妃時代に、民間出身であることを快く思わない義母や周囲からいじめを受け、心身の衰弱で苦しんだことはよく知られている。 しかし、小和田さんは28歳、プロポーズを断ったとしても、いずれキャリアか結婚かを選択しなければならないことは分かっていた。海外駐在は間近に迫り、おそらく大使への道を選ぶことは、日本では、結婚の可能性がかなり低くなることを意味していた。 その年の暮れ、彼女は皇太子にイエスの返事をした。 婚約発表の場で、彼女は当時を振り返って、「僕が一生全力でお守りします」と約束したと語った。 彼女が本当は何から守られる必要があるのか、まだ知らなかった。 協力：井上真己子 （東京）,The New York Times
2019,ボサボサ頭の候補者,"皇位の存続：エピソード5 眞子内親王は、皇位継承には無縁である。もかかわらず、国民は彼女の私的な交際にも口を出している。 CreditCreditPool photo by Shizuo Kambayashi 火曜日に、天皇明仁は、200年ぶりの生前退位を行い、皇位から退く。シリーズのエピソード4では、世界最古の皇室が、敗戦、空襲、存続の危機に瀕した皇室、明仁の第一子である徳仁が世継ぎをもうけられなかった挫折を描いた。天皇家の物語は続く。 パパラッチが小室圭の姿を最後にしっかりと捉えたのは、彼が秋学期の初めに、ソフトタイプのブリーフケースを手に持ち、オフホワイトのブレザーとカーキ色のスラックス、茶色のシューズというスタイリッシュな姿でニューヨークのロースクールに到着した時であった。 そして、数週間前に出版された雑誌の写真では、キャンパス外で小室氏はアイロンがけが必要と思われるシャツをスラックスから出し、クロックスのサンダルという姿であった。髪はぼさぼさにのびていて、ファラフェルを販売するキッチンカーで午後の軽食を注文しているところだった。 東京のテレビ局のコメンテーター達は、「髪を切る時間もないほどずっと勉強が忙しかったのだろうか？」、「お金を節約するために遅めの昼食をとっていたのだろうか？」などという疑問を口にした。 一方で、コメンテーター達の、そして日本の人々の大半の心の中にある本当の疑問は、明らかに「この男性は、天皇陛下の初孫の眞子内親王にふさわしい人物なのか？」という点であった。 これまでも、皇室は話題に事欠くことはなかった。とはいえ、近年では、海外の王室を傷つけたようなスキャンダルからは無縁であった。不倫もなければ、離婚もなく、皇室の影響を利用しようとしたり、ギャンブル行為などは無縁であった。 反対に、日本の皇族は、熱心で共感をもたれ、不自然なほど礼儀正しく振舞ってきた。 しかし、皇室は、TMZやインスタグラムの時代に耐えることができるだろうか。 二年前、眞子内親王は結婚を前提にお付き合いしている男性として小室氏を記者らの前で紹介した。 大学時代からデートを重ねており、彼女は彼の笑顔は太陽のように明るいと語り、一方、小室氏は、眞子さまは月のように静かに自分を見守って下さる存在だと語った。また、二人は天皇からも祝福をいただいたとも付け加えたため、国民も大いに喜んだ。 タブロイド紙は、小室氏の詳細を報じるようになった。一年もたたないうちに、 夫と死別した小室氏の母親が、かつての交際相手から四百万円（約36,000米ドル）を借り、返済していないと報じられた。 記事は、当時パラリーガルとして働いていた彼女の息子とは無関係であったが、家族の経歴が大きな意味を持つ社会においては、彼が眞子内親王のステータスとお金を目的に結婚をしようとしているという疑惑が深まった。 世論は彼に対して否定的なものに変わった。数週間後、二人の婚約にあたる正式な儀式を延期すると宮内庁が発表した。27歳の眞子内親王は、「結婚についてより深く具体的に考えたいと思います」と述べた。 この後で、小室氏はフォーダム大学ロースクールへと発ったが、これが皇室側から身を引くようにとの圧力であるか、あるいは、彼自身が確実な奨学金付きの入学を得ることができる状況を利用したなどの憶測が巻き起こった。 眞子さまの父親であり、天皇の下の息子である秋篠宮は会見で、将来義理の息子になる可能性のある彼が「話題になっている問題をクリアする」までは二人の関係を祝福することはできないと述べられた。（その昔、秋篠宮自身は、かつて自身のお兄よりも先に結婚することについて、皇室側に真っ向から反抗したことについては、ここでは気にしないでおこう。） 小室氏は、問題の36,000米ドル相当のお金は贈与だと説明し、「ご心配をおかけした」として謝罪した。小室氏の弁護士（彼には依頼している弁護士がついているのだ）は、最近のインタビューで、クライアントである小室氏の眞子さまに対する気持ちは変わっていないと回答した。しかし、二人が今でも話しをしているかについては明言を避けた。 しかし、「婚約者したもの同士なら誰でもコミュニケーションをとるのが普通では。そうじゃなかったらおかしいのでは。」と弁護士は話した。 一世代前には、タブロイド紙は、皇太子徳仁（次期天皇）がシンデレラを見つけるかどうかを詮索していた。現在は、皇族に求婚する可能性のある人物を引きずり降ろそうとしている。どちらの物語も、君主制のはかない存在を物語っている。徳仁が結婚しなかったら、世継ぎが生まれなかっただろう。眞子内親王が結婚したとしても、世継ぎを産むことは認められないのだ。 実際、彼女は皇室の身分を手放して皇族を出なければならない。法律で内親王は全員、皇位継承の対象からは除外されると規定されている。例えば、天皇の娘である紀宮内親王は、14年前に結婚して、黒田清子となった。 つまり、皇族には皇位から切り離されているいくつかの名目上の分家が存在することを意味する。菊地明史氏（34歳）もこの分家にあたる一人である。彼は、日中は広告コピーの執筆、夜は詩人としての表現活動を行っている。彼の母親は天皇明仁のいとこにあたり、 茶道宗家の子息と結婚した際、皇族の身分を失っている。 菊地氏は、 皇位継承の対象から外れていることを特に気にしていないが、別の国であれば「自分は上位100位には入るであろう」と語った。眞子内親王とは冠婚葬祭の際にわずかに面識がある程度であるが、彼女の「望む通りのことが叶える」ように願うと語った。 現在85歳の天皇明仁と皇后美智子も同様のスタンスをとっており、昨年発表されたお言葉の中で、婚約について意見を直接述べたわけではないが、皆が「眞子内親王が自分自身で決断を下すことを待つ」必要があると考えていると述べた。 *** 2016年7月のある一週間、天皇は、ブルガリア、オランダ、南アフリカ、タイの各国大使を招き御茶会を主催、また、障害者アスリートのためのキャンペーンに関する説明を受けた。さらに、博物館展示の開会式、小児ガン患者支援募金活動など含むいくつかのコンサートにも出席した。 天皇自身も前立腺ガンと冠状動脈バイパス手術を経験しており、二回の健康診断も受けた。その後、皇后美智子と共に海沿いの別荘でのご静養に向かった。 天皇が東京を不在の間に、日本の公共放送であるNHKが、夕方の番組を途中で中断して臨時ニュースを放送した。匿名の情報としながらも、天皇陛下が生前退位で引退の意向を示されたと報じた。 このニュースは衝撃的だった。これまで200年間以上の間、退位した天皇は存在せず、生前退位は、内閣の承認が必要な行為であった。 一ヶ月後、明仁はテレビで国民に向けて会見を開いた。 「次第に進む身体の衰えを考慮する時、これまでのように、全身全霊をもって象徴の務めを果たしていくことが、難しくなるのではないかと案じています」と述べた。 数十年にわたり、明仁は、君主制を日本の軍国主義回帰に対する、防波堤へと静かに再構築してきた。その過程で、天皇陛下は、日本の政治家のなかには過去を否定あるいは忘却しようとするものもいる事実を認識していた。 そして現在、おそらくこれが最後となるだろうが、いつものように極めて慎重に、世論を味方につけ、政治家を推し動かしてきた。 政権の保守派は躊躇した。女性の皇位継承を認める議論に扉を開けることになることを案じた。そのため、ここに至るまでにほぼ三年を要したのだ。 火曜日の午後、日本の第125代天皇は、その父は、日本を破滅の瀬戸際まで向かわせながらも自らの退位を拒んだのであるが、自発的に皇位を退位する。 そして、かつて英語教師からジミーと呼ばれた天皇は、退位後には、特例の新しい称号「上皇」となる。 協力：上乃久子、井上真己子（東京）",The New York Times
2019,敗戦の長い影,"皇位の存続：エピソード2 皇室は、侵略した国々との平和を追求した。しかし国内でも、修復すべき問題があった。 An attacker, foreground, approaching Crown Prince Akihito and Princess Michiko in Okinawa in 1975.CreditCreditHiroaki Yamashiro/The Yomiuri Shimbun 日本には、天皇が15世紀以上に渡って存在し続けている。皇室は、世界最古の継続する君主制である。火曜日に、天皇は、200年ぶりの生前退位を行い、長男に譲位する。このシリーズのエピソード１では、明仁は、敗戦国の12歳の皇太子であった。彼の物語は続く。 知念功は、島内の洞穴に身を潜め、その要人の到着を待ちながら、好機をうかがっていた。 六日間、知念氏と彼の共謀者の二人は身を隠し、缶詰、チョコレート、ビスケットを食べて生き延びた。七日目、二人はトランジスタ・ラジオにかじりつき、訪問者が到着したとのニュースを聞き入った。 知念氏は25歳、この計画を達成するために大学を中退していた法学生であった。その朝、カーキ色のつなぎ、黒いヘルメットに身を包み、洞窟から現れると、火炎ビンに火をつけ、腕を高く振り上げ、目標に向かって投げつけた——皇太子明仁だ。 「打倒天皇！」「帰れ、皇太子！」彼は叫んだ。 それは1975年の夏、明仁は沖縄に到着したばかりだった。41歳、近代日本における皇室の意義とは何か、という難しい問題に直面していた。その旅は、その後、彼の治世を特徴付ける始まりとなった。国が犯した戦争の罪への長い悔悟の旅である。 その30年前、沖縄は、第二次世界大戦の激戦地の一つとなり、80日以上に及ぶ壮絶な悪夢の中で、何十万もの陸海空軍の兵士が投入された。この地は、連合軍による侵攻を撃退するため、何百人もの神風パイロットを投入した日本帝国軍の最後の防衛拠点となった。 この戦いでは、日本兵95,000名、アメリカ兵12,500名のほか、沖縄の人口の約四分の一にあたる10万人近い民間人の命が失われた。その中には、強制的に戦いに参加させられた十代の若者、そして降伏するよりも、むしろ自決するよう日本兵に命じられた家族もいた。 その後の27年間、アメリカは沖縄を統治下に置き、米軍基地を建設し、朝鮮戦争とベトナム戦争にこれらの基地を使用した。地元の反対にもかかわらず、本土の南に位置する沖縄島内に核兵器を持ち込んだこともあった。 天皇裕仁も、また他の誰一人として沖縄を訪れようとした皇族はいなかった。沖縄返還から三年後、明仁の沖縄訪問時の県民感情の激しさは容易に想像できるだろう。 「天皇には謝罪してほしかった」と現在68歳の知念氏は、最近、振り返った。他の多くの人々と同様、彼は、裕仁がもっと早く降伏しなかったために、戦争が長引いた、と非難した。皇太子を狙うことは、天皇に近づくための一つの手段だった、と彼は述べた。 明仁は、一人で沖縄に来たわけではなかった。その側には妻、美智子妃を伴っていた。 二人は結婚して16年、テニスコートで出会い、明仁の母である皇后良子をはじめ、日本の伝統主義的な立場をとる人々に反対されながらも婚約した。美智子妃は、裕福な実業家の令嬢であったが、家族は貴族ではなく、過去何百年で、初めて皇室に嫁いだ民間人となった。 彼らの結婚式の一部は、初めて、テレビ放映され、二人は有名人となり、新しい日本の象徴となった。二人は、人柄がよく、洗練されていて、運動ができ、英語を話した。間もなく、三人の子宝、二人の息子と一人の娘に恵まれた。天皇は、一般国民の前に、姿を現すことはあまりなかったが、皇太子夫妻は、日本における皇室のあるべき姿を再定義し始めていた。 あの夏の日、沖縄で、夫妻が記念碑に白菊の花を供えた直後、目の前で火炎ビンが炎を上げた。護衛官がすぐに二人を炎から遠ざけ、急いで車列に連れ戻した。 逮捕され、刑務所で30か月間を過ごした知念氏は、明仁に危害を加えるつもりは決してなかった、「皇太子を驚かせたかったのです」と言った。 警備の穴があったことを考えると、残りの予定キャンセルすべきではないかとの議論があったに違いない。しかし、明仁と美智子は、旅を続行した。 皇太子夫妻の目前で火炎ビンを高く振りかざしている知念氏を撮影した山城博明氏は、当時のことを振り返り、事件後も、続けて沖縄県平和祈念資料館を訪問する皇太子の様子を見て、「とても普通の人にできることではない」と感じた。 その日の夜、明仁は、滞在先のホテルから予定外の談話を発表した。沖縄について「先の大戦で、わが国では唯一の住民を巻き込む戦場と化し、幾多の悲惨な犠牲を払った」と述べた。 「犠牲者や遺族の方々のことを思うとき、悲しみと痛恨の思いにひたされます」と文書で述べた。 沖縄は、始まりにすぎなかった。彼の父が1989年に崩御し、天皇に即位した後、アジア各国に、同じ悔恨のメッセージを持って赴いた。 明仁は、中国、インドネシア、マレーシア、パラオ、フィリピン、サイパン、シンガポール、タイ、ベトナムを訪問した。日本が戦時中に侵攻した国々である。 どの場所でも、彼は、日本の戦死者に敬意を払うとともに、日本による犠牲者に敬意を評した。どの場所でも、平和について語り、日本は戦争の恐怖を二度と繰り返さないと約束した。 まだ十分ではないと言うものも多くいるが、彼の平和主義のメッセージは、日本が海外からの評価を取り戻す助けとなった。しかし、国内では、意見が分かれた。 アメリカによる占領が終わると、戦争についての考え方が割れた。日本軍の行動を最小化しようとし、明仁による「謝罪の旅」に冷ややかな目を向け、日本はすでに十分に謝罪したと論じる右派もいた。 1994年に予定されていた真珠湾訪問は、保守派からの抗議によって変更を余儀なくされた。代わりに、明仁は、日本が攻撃をした場所から数マイル離れた記念墓地に献花した。 日本の憲法は、天皇の政治への関与を禁じている。しかし、明仁は、日本の極右に対する抑止力になっている。伝統主義者として、右派は天皇制を崇めてきた。しかし、明仁の、日本がその過去を忘れないように、という静かな抵抗に対し、彼らは苛立った。 2015年、安倍晋三首相は、自衛隊が海外の紛争地で戦うことができるようにする法案を可決した。同じ年、明仁は、毎年の終戦記念日における言葉に、あるフレーズを付け加えた。「ここに過去を顧み、さきの大戦に対する深い反省と共に、今後、戦争の惨禍が再び繰り返されぬことを切に願う」。 「深い反省」という言葉は、新しいものだった。そして、安倍氏に対する明らかな牽制に映った。明仁は、その年以降、毎年のお言葉にこのフレーズを繰り返し述べている。 協力：井上真己子",The New York Times
2019,父は、神と呼ばれたが、彼はジミーと呼ばれた,皇位の存続：エピソード1 若き皇太子明仁は、それまでの天皇の権力を行使しなかった。代わりに、国に癒しの手を差しのべた。 CreditCreditBettman Archive 日本には、天皇が15世紀以上に渡って存在し続けている。皇室は、世界最古の継続する君主制である。火曜日に、天皇は、200年ぶりの生前退位を行い、長男に譲位する。これは、その家族の物語である。 彼は、明仁、日本の天皇、戦争によって打ちのめされた国において、平和を擁護した穏やかな人物として知られている。しかし、彼女は、彼をジミーと呼んだ。 第二次世界大戦の終結から一年後の1946年の秋、12歳の少年、敗戦国の皇太子は、暖房のない東京郊外の教室に座っていた。そこでは、新しく着任したアメリカ人教師が、殿下にもっと平凡な名前を使うよう説得していた。彼の父、大戦時の天皇であった裕仁は、神として崇められていた。しかし、彼女は、その少年はそうではないということをはっきりさせた。 「このクラスでは、あなたの名前はジミーです。」その教師、エリザベス・グレイ・ヴァイニングはそう宣言した。44歳の彼女は、フィラデルフィア出身の司書、児童書作家であった。 「いいえ。」明仁はすぐに答えた。「私はプリンスです。」 ヴァイニング夫人は応戦した。彼女は、学習院の明仁のクラスメートの数名に、すでにアダム、ビリー、といった名前をつけていた。学習院は、貴族や裕福な家庭の子供達が通う学校である。 「そう、あなたはプリンス明仁です。」彼女は言った。「それがあなたの本名です。でもこのクラスでは、あなたは英語の名前があります。このクラスでは、あなたの名前はジミーです。」 ヴァイニング夫人は待った。他の生徒たちは、心配そうに互いを見合った。ついに、皇太子は微笑み、クラス中が笑顔になった。 泥だらけの床の粗末な建物の教室の外では、名前がどうのこうのということよりもっとたくさんのことが問題となっていた。 広島、長崎、そして三百万人以上の日本人を含め、数千万人が殺された戦争の終わりからわずか一年。東京は廃墟と化し、人々の多くは掘っ建て小屋に住んでいた。ダグラス・マッカーサー司令官は、アメリカ占領軍の指揮を任命され、その総司令本部を第一生命ビルに置いた。皇居の向かいである。 世界最古の君主制は存続できるのだろうか。 3歳のときから侍従と子守に育てられた孤独な子供であった明仁は、連合軍の空襲を逃れるため、終戦前の一年間、疎開していた。ナチスの降伏からまだ間もない頃、ナパーム弾による空襲により皇居も炎上した。 数ヶ月後の夏の朝、侍従は、疎開先のホテルの一室に明仁を案内した。彼の父親の肉声がラジオから流れた。「戦況は、必ずしも日本に有利とは言えない状態になった。」と天皇裕仁は言い、無条件降伏を宣言した。日本人が天皇の肉声を聞いたのは、この時が初めてであった。 放送後、明仁は涙を拭った。「これからもっとしっかりしなければならない。」と日記に書き記した。 「侍従たちは、皇太子が東京に戻ったら何が起きるかわからなかったのです。」と、皇太子とともに首都から疎開した級友の明石元紹氏（85歳）は回想する。「連合軍は予測不能でした。皇太子を殺すかもしれないと心配しました。」 合衆国と他の連合国の間では、裕仁を戦犯として起訴すべきだという圧力が高まった。日本の中心的な知識人は、道徳的模範を示すべく退位するよう天皇に迫った。皇族のなかには、天皇が退き、まだ若い明仁に摂政の監督のもとで皇位を継がせるようにと、説得する者もいた。皇太子ならば、戦争責任は問われない。皇太子が皇位を継げば、君主制に対するアメリカの影響力を制限し、皇室を守ることができる、という意見だった。 マッカーサーの考えは違った。この傲慢な司令官は、日本でほぼ無制限ともいえる権力を謳歌し、早い段階で、裕仁を生かし、そして利用しようと決めていた。 大統領選出馬を念頭に置いていたマッカーサーは、日本を非軍事化し、民主国家として建てなおす上で、天皇は鍵であると考えた。「天皇は、日本人全体をまとめる象徴だ。」とマッカーサーは秘密の電報を送り、もしも裕仁が裁判にかけられようものならば、国を鎮静するために百万人のアメリカ兵が必要になると警告した。 そして、皇室は起訴を免れた。他の者が代わりを被った。そこには裕仁の叔父に代わって南京大虐殺の罪で絞首刑に処された大将もいた。 君主制は、もちろん変化しなければならなかった。新しい憲法は、天皇から神としての地位を奪い、形だけの存在とした。そして、明仁は、日本を再形成するにあたって、アメリカが意図する価値を伝えるパイプ役として育成されるのだ。 日本は、明仁の家庭教師として、英国人を雇うことを計画したが、マッカーサーの側近がアメリカ人を起用するよう計らった。 ヴァイニング夫人が選ばれた理由には、彼女がクエーカー教徒だったこと（皇室の周囲には日本人のクエーカー教徒たちがいた）と、また未亡人だったことである。彼女の夫は自動車事故で亡くなっており、この悲劇的な経験が日本の痛みを理解する助けになるだろうと考えるものもいた。 当時も今も、彼女が任命されたことに不満を唱える者がいた。「戦後の日本にアメリカがしたすべてのことのなかでも、一番無礼なことは、皇太子に女性家庭教師であるヴァイニングをつけたことだ。」ある保守的な批判者は数十年後に不満を言った。 ヴァイニング夫人は、頑固なまでの熱意をもって仕事に取り組み、時には明仁の侍従と言い争いにもなった。「英語を教えることは、皇太子やその周囲の人たちをアメリカの民主主義的思考と実践に導くという、より大きな目的を達するための唯一の媒体という認識でした。」と、ベストセラーになった回顧録で述べている。 しかし、平等という概念を生徒に教え込むことは容易ではなかった。ある時、別の家庭教師が、明仁に普通の男の子になりたいかと訊ねた。彼は「わからない。」と答えた。「普通の男の子だったことがないから。」またある時、ヴァイニング夫人はクラスの生徒たちに大人になったら何になりたいかと質問した。明仁は、「私は天皇になる」と書いた。 モノポリーすら、学びの場だった。1949年のある日の静かな午後、彼女は明仁とその級友数人を彼女の自宅に招き、 連合軍将校の息子たちと典型的な資本主義のボードゲームで遊ばせた。 その日、明仁の対戦相手の一人だったトニー・オースティン（84歳）は、外国人たちはすぐに日本の少年たちを打ち負かしたと、当時を振り返った。「彼らとモノポリーをやるのは、まったくフェアじゃなかった。」と彼は言った。「彼らはモノポリーをそんなに知らなかった。」 将校の息子達は、失礼をしたのではないかと心配したが、明仁は穏やかだった。明仁の新らしい友人たちは気づいた。皇太子は上手に敗けることを学んでいた。 協力：井上真己子 （東京）,The New York Times
2019,籠の中の皇太子妃,皇位の存続：エピソード4 皇室の存続は、彼女の肩にかかっていた。そして、その呪縛から逃れられなかった。 CreditCreditPool photo 火曜日、日本の明仁天皇は、200年ぶりに退位する。翌日、皇太子徳仁が、世界で最も古い君主制の最高位に就く。エピソード３では、徳仁が、ためらう外交官の雅子に結婚を迫った。彼らの物語は、続く。 朝日新聞はスクープをものにした。1999年12月10日朝、日本で第二位、800万部以上を発行部数を誇るこの日刊紙は、日本国民が待ちわびていた見出し「雅子様、懐妊の兆候」と、一面で報じたのである。 聡明な若き外交官であった小和田雅子がキャリアを捨て、次の天皇となる、徳仁皇太子と結婚してから六年が経過していた。結婚一カ月後に行われた宮中晩餐会で、彼女は、ビル・クリントン大統領、ボリス・エリツィン大統領、フランソワー・ミッテラン大統領とそれぞれの国の言語で会話し、国民は彼女を誇らしく感じた。彼女は、皇室だけでなく、日本自体が近代化するのを助けるだろうと予測するものもいた。 日本国民は懐妊のニュースを朝刊で知ることになったが、それは消えかけていた夢のようなものであった。その年月は、ハーバードとオックスフォードで勉強し、多言語を操る貿易の専門家を、今や、日本にとって大切な、唯一の義務と思われる「皇位継承者の出産」を果たせずにいる女性に変えていた。 日本のマスコミでは、雅子の懐妊だけが望まれていた。彼女がローヒールの靴を履いていたり、レセプションに出席しなければ、大衆紙は、こぞって、懐妊したのではないかと書きたてた。そのため、信頼のある全国紙の朝日新聞がスクープを報じると、報道が過熱し、雅子が何年間も耐えてきたことが繰り返し報じられた。 記者達は、雅子の実家で張り込みをした。評論家は、ロイヤルベイビーの誕生によって日本の停滞した経済が活性化するだろうか、あるいは出生率の低下が回復するだろうかと論じた。ある者は、その月に行われたレセプションで、驚いたことに、雅子さまがワインをすすっていた、と話した。ある雑誌は嬉々として受胎日を推測し、その夜に夫妻が過ごした場所を調べ上げ、そのホテルにあるインペリアルスイートの大きなダブルベッドまで突き止めた。 3週間後、宮内庁は記者会見を行い、「雅子妃は、流産をした、七週目であった」と発表した。 専門家は、雅子妃が懐妊したかもしれない時に、ベルギー訪問をキャンセルしなかったとして、宮内庁を批判した。宮内庁は、朝日新聞が、懐妊が公式に確認される前に報道したため、雅子妃に非常なストレスを与えることになった、と批判した。 この出来事の背景には、国民の漠然とした不安があった。皇室は消滅してしまうかもしれないという危機に瀕していた。 皇位は、15世紀以上にわたり継承されてきた。天皇と皇太子の継承は、側室制度によって存続してきた。長い日本の歴史の中で、男系継承者が途絶えないように、公家の子女達が一時的に交替しながら天皇の側室を務めてきたのである。 しかし裕仁天皇は、その制度を廃止した。そして、1947年、アメリカ占領軍は、現在の天皇直系または兄弟系と叔父系の男系子孫を除いて、すべての宮家が皇室から離脱するよう日本に要求した。 法律に明記された新しい規則は、第二次世界大戦を招いた軍国主義を復活させるために別の宮家が利用されることを阻止するためのものだった。 その頃、皇位継承が危機に瀕することはほぼないと思われていた。裕仁には兄弟が三人、皇子が二人、皇位継承権を持つ甥が三人いたのだ。 しかし、雅子が流産した頃には、皇位継承者はわずかになっていた。明仁天皇の弟、常陸宮には子供がいなかった。明仁の下の皇子である秋篠宮には、皇女が二人のみであった。皇室の未来は、長男である皇太子徳仁と皇太子妃雅子にかかっているようだった。 その負担は、皇太子妃に重くのしかかった。1996年の初めての単独会見で、皇太子妃は国民を安心させようと、「鬱状態ということはありません」と述べた。 しかし、彼女は、流産から40日以上、公の場に姿を現さなかった。また、明仁の母である皇后良子の葬儀を欠席した。歌会始の儀も欠席したが、次のような和歌が披露された。 七年をみちびきたまふ我が君と語らひの時重ねつつ来ぬ 流産から二年、結婚から約十年、38歳の誕生日の数日前に、雅子妃はついに子供を授かった。女の子であった。二人は、「love」という意味の愛子と名付けた。 しかし、男系継承者を期待する圧力は消えなかった。宮内庁は雅子妃の外国訪問を許さず、マスコミは彼女の一挙手一投足を詮索し続けた。残念なことに、2004年までには、雅子妃が公の場に姿を現すことはなくなった。 徳仁は厳しい表情で、マスコミに詮索を控えるよう要請し、さらに、宮内庁が雅子妃の外国訪問を制限したことについて批判したようだ。 徳仁さまは、次のように語った。「世継ぎ問題については、その重要性を十分認識していますので、周囲からプレッシャーが掛かることなく、静かに過ごせることを望んでおります。また雅子がもう少し自由に外に出たり、さまざまななことができるようになると良いと思います。」 もちろん、簡単な解決策はあった。女性も即位できるよう法律を改正することだ。そうすれば、明仁の三人の孫娘、小さい愛子さまと二人のいとこ、眞子さまと佳子さまが皇位継承者に加わる。 2000年代初め、ライオンのたてがみのようなヘアスタイルで、改革を公約として掲げて有権者に人気のあった、小泉純一郎首相は、「皇位が確実に継承されるように」法律を改正すると公約した。朝日新聞もその考え方に賛同した。世論調査でも、明らかに国民の過半数が同じ考えを持っていたのだ。 しかし、提案は、特に自民党の保守派から、猛烈な反対を招いた。皇室の男系継承を「日本人にとって貴重な貴重な宝である」と発言した元閣僚もいた。 この問題の議決の直前、運命のいたずらが起きた。秋篠宮と紀子妃が三番目の子供、男の子、天皇にとっての孫息子を授かったのだ。悠仁と名付けられた。 少なくとも次の世代については、男系継承者を確保することができたように思われた。 そしてついに、次の皇后、雅子はプレッシャーから解放されたのである。 協力：井上真己子、上乃久子 （東京）,The New York Times
2019,"#MeToo Is All Too Real. But to Better Understand It, Turn to Fiction.","Critic’s Notebook In “The Friend,” Sigrid Nunez’s 2018 National Book Award-winning novel, the narrator, a writing teacher, grumbles about her students’ personal essays on sexual violence. Always the same nouns, she complains to us (scar, bruise, blood), always the same verbs (choke, starve, scream). The dull, depressing sameness of these stories. Their horrifying number. She has no way of knowing that she stars in a book that is part of a wave of its own: “#MeToo novels,” they’re called, these disparate stories of sex and power suddenly regarded as timely, and read through the lens of an unfolding movement — with happy results, I’m about to argue (irritating Nunez’s teacher, I imagine, and rather surprising myself). It does not feel reductive to read fiction through this prism, nor will you find the numbing sameness Nunez’s narrator deplores — in fact, these books deliver us from numbing sameness. They are remarkably various, and they trouble debates that traffic in certainties. They come laden with confusion, doubt, subtlety — is it excessively earnest to call it truth? The original “Me too movement,” was created by the civil rights activist Tarana Burke in 2006, out of her work with young women of color who had experienced sexual abuse. Since the sexual-assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein broke in 2017, the term has been adopted as a rallying cry for survivors of all kinds of gendered violence. The “#MeToo novel” shares this range; it has been applied to everything from Lisa Halliday’s “Asymmetry,” with its gentle May-December romance, to Édouard Louis’s autobiographical novel “History of Violence,” which recounts a rape and attempted murder. There is Anna Burns’s “Milkman,” set during The Troubles and awarded the 2018 Man Booker Prize (“I hope this novel will help people think about #MeToo,” the judges’ chairman said). See also Pat Barker’s “The Silence of the Girls” (called “an ‘Iliad’ for the age of #MeToo” in a review in this newspaper), Miriam Toews’s “Women Talking” (a “Mennonite #MeToo novel”) and Idra Novey’s “Those Who Knew” (“the definitive #MeToo novel,” according to Entertainment Weekly). Reissues, like “The Street,” a 1946 novel by Ann Petry, are included in the category, as well as a rare #MeToo novel by a man, James Lasdun’s “Afternoon of a Faun.” Recent feminist dystopias imagine the further erosion of reproductive rights (Bina Shah’s “Before She Sleeps,” Maggie Shen King’s “An Excess Male,” Sophie Mackintosh’s “The Water Cure,” Leni Zumas’s “Red Clocks”). Several books feature charismatic, predatory teachers, including Nunez’s “The Friend,” Susan Choi’s “Trust Exercise” and Kate Walbert’s “His Favorites.” There are revenge fantasies (Naomi Alderman’s “The Power”), romance and young adult novels that grapple with consent — even a #MeToo western. The best of these books are heretical where narratives of sexual violence are concerned. “A History of Violence,” “His Favorites,” “Asymmetry,” “Trust Exercise,” “Those Who Knew,” “The Silence of the Girls,” “The Friend,” “Women Talking”: Their titles run together in my mind, like the fragments of a rumor I’ve heard too many times before, but the books topple conventional stories of heroes and victims. They exist as reminders of the kind of touchy ethical explorations the novel makes possible. Adrienne Rich once wrote that Virginia Woolf’s style — that detachment and banked rage, that light, calculated charm — revealed a woman who never forgot she was being overheard, and evaluated, by men. Reading the flood of public writing about #MeToo in recent years — the op-eds and testimonies — I’d occasionally experience a prickly feeling of recognition. Here again, I’d think, was writing that stemmed from outrage, and often shame, but remained impeccably well-mannered and sure of itself, almost legalistic in structure and presentation. Necessarily, perhaps — women must constantly perform credibility. “The whole long arc of justice now crashing down that we call #MeToo has been about whether women may be in possession of facts, and whether anyone will bother to hear out those facts or believe them or, having believed them, allow those facts to have consequences,” Rebecca Solnit has written. These pieces often felt preoccupied with their imagined reception — straining to appease, convince, console — conscious of being overheard, in Rich’s phrase, but this time by women as well as men. Not these novels. They occupy the backwaters where the writer need not pander or persuade, and can instead seek to understand, or merely complicate, something for herself. They are stories about inconsistencies and incoherence, stories that thicken the mysteries of memory and volition. In “Trust Exercise,” a woman called Karen (not her real name, she tells us) confronts her youthful relationship with a much older man and finds she cannot arrive at any comforting conclusions. She feels victimized but also entirely responsible. Her feelings for young women in similar situations are “violently mixed”; “these young women who made a bad judgment and now want to blame someone else.” She wants them to shut up but hates them for their silence; she wants them to move on but cannot forgive them if they refuse to take revenge. Where does this leave her? What should she do with her pain? (I advise against following her example. Mostly.) “We all make our own choices,” a character in a play in “Trust Exercise” says. “Do we?” responds another. “Milkman,” a stream-of-consciousness novel dictated by a young, isolated woman stalked by a shadowy paramilitary figure, asks what sexual consent might mean to people who have never had any experience of control: “I did not know intuition and repugnance counted, did not know I had a right not to like, not to have to put up with, anybody and everybody coming near.” #MeToo is a moment full of reappraisals — of beloved artists, public figures, ourselves. How do we respond to this feeling of unmooring? By tightening our grasp on what we have always known? By jettisoning one set of scripts for another? In “Women Talking,” based on a true story, the women and girls living in a fictitious Mennonite colony in South America called Molotschna discover that men from their community have been drugging and raping them for years. They gather in a hayloft, and decide what to do: Stay, leave, fight. Over the course of the novel, much of it written in dialogue of the plainest possible language, they ask what separates justice from punishment. They re-examine every one of their premises: “When we know something we stop thinking about it, don’t we?” one character says. It’s a habit of mind this woman is talking about — a habit of skepticism toward the self, the ability and willingness to change your mind. These novels offer a kind of training in this way of being. They are full of narrative tripwires that force us to pay attention, reassess our reflexive responses, revise what we think the story is about. “His Favorites” has a circular structure, with vertigo-inducing shifts in time. “Trust Exercise” has odd, double-jointed sentences that flip between points of view; Karen refers to herself variously as “I,” “she” and “we” — experiencing herself as both subject and object. In “Milkman” there are no names at all — characters are “Somebody McSomebody” and “longest friend” — and only a few proper nouns. In several of these books, there is a fundamental confusion about what we are reading in the first place — is it a novel within a novel? Who is narrating? Do they have a right to the story? A striking number of these books — “The Friend,” “Asymmetry,” Trust Exercise,” “Afternoon of a Faun” and “Those Who Knew” — all involve a parallel plot, in which the story of a relationship, either lopsided or abusive, is juxtaposed with the story of a character who draws upon the experience of another in their own writing, often a tell-all. As an acting exercise, the drama teacher in “Trust Exercise” would turn off the lights in his classroom and have the students find their way around by touch. He’d watch them, talk to them: “Is that some other creature with me, in the darkness?” The answer, of course, is always. “We’re none of us alone in this world. We injure each other,” Choi writes. “You’re choosing for another when you make choices. We overlap. We get tangled.” We’re all here together, in the dark.",The New York Times

2019,"$1.7 Million Homes in California, Tennessee and Pennsylvania","What you Get A midcentury-modern house in Altadena, a grand 1943 home in Memphis and an 1888 house with seven bedrooms in Bryn Mawr. 24 Photos View Slide Show › Ian Mackinlay, a Scottish-born architect, adapted the design of this house from one his client admired in Hawaii. He built it on a knoll in the foothills of the San Gabriel range, on a private road that goes directly into the mountains. Hiking trails can be found down the street, and the house offers views of downtown Los Angeles, less than 20 miles southwest. Size: 2,701 square feet Price per square foot: $629 Indoors: Inspired by his tropical model, Mr. Mackinlay used mahogany in the paneling and glass-fronted built-ins, and cork on the kitchen floors. The roof is a composite with a rock surface that refracts the sun’s rays. The two-level house is an ell, with the front door at the bend. From the slate-floor vestibule you enter an open-plan living and dining area with a wall of glass and other windows, a vaulted, beamed ceiling and an offset fireplace of white-painted brick. Sliding doors in the dining area lead to an enclosed porch described as a meditation room. Another door opens to the kitchen, updated a dozen years ago with quartzite counters, stainless-steel appliances and mahogany-stained cabinets. (The meditation room connects to the kitchen, too.) Instead of a backsplash, the wall above the sink and surrounding surfaces has a ribbon of windows looking out to the front yard. Taking a hard right at the front door brings you to a glass-walled corridor opening to three bedrooms. The vaulted master is first, with beams, mahogany floors and an en suite bathroom with a stand-alone glass shower. The two guest rooms that follow flank a hallway bathroom with a tub. A door leading to the carport is at the end of the corridor. Just before the master is a staircase that descends to a family room almost 32 feet long, with polished concrete floors and a fireplace. The room could be divided into different seating areas and one end could be used as an office. The lower level also has a bathroom with a shower, and a large workroom. Outdoor space: A large deck with expansive views wraps around the house, from the living room to the meditation room. A separate patio with an outdoor grill is reached directly from the kitchen. On the other side, the master bedroom opens to a long, trellis-covered patio with a firepit.

2019,$146 Million Default by Nursing Home Chain Leaves U.S. on the Hook,"The failure of the Rosewood Care Centers is the biggest default in the history of a little-known program that underpins 15 percent of the nation’s nursing homes. The cracks in the foundation of a Chicago nursing-home business began to appear almost immediately. The owners stopped making mortgage payments on their crown jewel, the Rosewood Care Centers, barely a year after buying it in 2013. Paperwork about the chain’s finances was never filed with the government. Some money meant for the 13 nursing homes and assisted-living facilities went to prop up another investment. In the end, the business defaulted last year on $146 million in government-backed mortgages — the biggest collapse in the history of a little-known loan-guarantee program run by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Rosewood debacle demonstrates the problems plaguing the HUD program, which helps nursing homes obtain affordable loans and has become a linchpin of the American elder-care system. By the government’s own admission, the federal agency’s stewardship of the program has been haphazard. Its oversight of nursing homes has been weak. When HUD officials have spotted problems, they often have been slow to respond. Sometimes it has taken years to intervene, allowing the finances at certain facilities to unravel to such an extent that the quality of care was undermined. HUD officials described Rosewood as an outlier, saying that only 1 percent of the guaranteed loans end up defaulting. “Mortgage defaults in this program are exceedingly rare, yet reaching an acceptable resolution requires an owner’s willingness and ability to work on behalf of their residents,” the department said in a statement. But the program — run by a department better known for fostering affordable housing — is a vulnerability for the federal agency. The nursing home industry is increasingly being run by for-profit operators facing dwindling margins. Some homes — especially those in rural areas — are struggling to stay open, with operators blaming low occupancy and insufficient payments from Medicaid and Medicare. At the Rosewood chain, which houses more than 1,100 people, the housing department has been forced to take control of the 13 facilities in Illinois and Missouri. It is paying a million dollars a month to keep them afloat. When the program was created in 1959, its goal was to help ensure that Americans had access to affordable nursing homes by bankrolling the construction of new facilities. The program has evolved, and it now provides financial guarantees on loans that banks make to elder-care facilities. By making the loans less risky for banks, lenders could charge lower interest rates, thus reducing the fees that the nursing homes needed to charge patients. The result now is that the agency manages a portfolio of loans that are at risk of going bad. HUD, and therefore taxpayers, could be on the hook for money-losing facilities around the United States — just as waves of aging baby boomers are likely to prompt a surge in America’s nursing-home population. Today, the program guarantees $20 billion in mortgages to more than 2,300 nursing homes — about 15 percent of the country’s total, up from about 5 percent a quarter-century ago. Most of the nursing homes it backs are private, for-profit enterprises. The problems with the program go back decades. A report from the Government Accountability Office in 1995, when the program supported about 800 nursing homes, found that loan-management staff members “generally do not focus attention on nursing home loans unless financial trouble appears imminent or a default occurs.” The report said this left a gap in oversight, because other state and federal regulators focus on the quality of care and not on the homes’ financial viability. Reports by the HUD inspector general last year found similar issues. An audit of 18 “financially challenged” nursing homes concluded that the housing department “did not always identify and address the root causes of a nursing home’s financial or operational challenges” and failed to “penalize operators that did not submit accurate and complete data in a timely manner.” Another 2018 report focused on the agency’s lack of oversight of the homes’ physical conditions to ensure they would remain viable over the course of the federally backed loan. The inspector general said some facilities “were neglected and generally run down.” Edward Golding, a former top official with HUD during the Obama administration, defended the loan-guarantee program as essential to helping nursing homes and assisted-living facilities get access to credit. But, he said, the program “could benefit from more transparency and public awareness.” The housing department took Rosewood to court last summer, but it had known early on that the chain was struggling to pay its bills and possibly mismanaging the program’s money. Rosewood never filed the financial statements required by the program. Because HUD had insured the loans, it had to sign off when Rosewood was bought in December 2013 by a group of investors led by Zvi Feiner. Mr. Feiner, 48, a rabbi with a business degree, found most of his investors in the Chicago-area Orthodox Jewish community. Mr. Feiner’s firm, Feiner Investment, is in the same office building in Skokie, Ill., as Bais Medrash Binyan Olam, the congregation where he presided over weekday prayer services. He was also president of a Jewish elementary school and served for several years as a mayoral appointee to a neighborhood business improvement district in Chicago. Mr. Feiner raised tens of millions of dollars from investors, including a 90-year-old Holocaust survivor and several teachers at a Jewish day school. Mr. Feiner also bought nursing-home companies in Illinois, New Jersey and Indiana. Rosewood’s financial problems were compounded by legal battles over its debts, including money it owed vendors. Investors sued in state, federal and religious courts contending that Mr. Feiner misappropriated millions of dollars, an allegation his lawyer disputed. Last year, a rabbinical court in Chicago awarded one investor $13 million. By 2015, Mr. Feiner and his partners were missing mortgage payments and had improperly diverted $7 million of federally insured funds to at least one other nursing home, according to court documents. Ariel Weissberg, a lawyer for Mr. Feiner, said Rosewood’s financial woes stemmed in part from disputes with business partners. “Zvi is trying to get back on his feet,” Mr. Weissberg said. “He’s trying to pay these people back.” Even as Mr. Feiner’s investors and vendors sued, HUD mostly remained on the sidelines. The agency was aware in 2015 of Rosewood’s mounting monetary problems, including the diversion of funds, according to court filings. But the housing department did not force the facility to shore up its finances or press Mr. Feiner and his partners to sell to a stronger operator. Last August, Rosewood’s corporate parents defaulted on $146 million of mortgage loans, which meant the housing department’s insurance fund had to pay that amount to Rosewood’s lender. The agency filed a lawsuit seeking to appoint a receiver to run the nursing homes. In court filings, HUD described a toxic brew of litigation, infighting and financial mismanagement that “contributed to an environment of uncertainty and risk for the patients at the Rosewood facilities.” In October, the agency filed a complaint against Mr. Feiner seeking nearly $1 million in penalties for failing to file required financial reports. Mr. Feiner’s lawyer said they had agreed to settle the case. In a statement, the agency said its “foremost concern is always the health and safety of the residents.” It added, “Following a number of time-consuming and exhaustive attempts to resolve these defaults, foreclosure could not be avoided.” The federal department is now stuck running the Rosewood properties. About half are losing money, and several have problems with mold and faulty sprinkler systems, according to court papers. The agency plans to auction them off, with bids due on Friday. If they don’t sell, HUD will have to run them until a buyer can be found. Since August, HUD has spent more than $15 million to keep the facilities open — plus the $146 million it dispensed to Rosewood’s lender. The agency estimates that the facilities are worth no more than $95 million, according to public documents soliciting bids. Substantial losses are common when loans in the program fail. The department has incurred an average loss of 80 percent on defaulted mortgages in recent years, according to government documents. A nursing home's financial woes risk hurting residents. “Nursing homes’ financial difficulties almost inevitably impact resident care,” said David Stevenson, a professor of health policy at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. He said agencies like HUD needed to “figure out ways to act before people are harmed.” At Rosewood, health and safety problems developed soon after Mr. Feiner’s group took over. Between 2014 and 2018, the Illinois Department of Public Health imposed $213,000 in fines against the facilities — more than five times the amount levied in the last five full years under the previous owner. And six of the Rosewood nursing homes, including those in Moline, Ill., and Inverness, Ill., had one- or two-star ratings on the federal Medicare website, which rates them on health and safety on a five-star scale. It is part of a broader pattern at HUD-supported facilities. A New York Times analysis indicated that HUD-backed homes were more likely to receive one-or-two-star ratings from Medicare than other nursing homes. More than 850 nursing homes supported by HUD, about 43 percent of the 1,982 for which a Medicare rating could be determined, received the low ratings, the analysis found. There are nearly three dozen still-active personal injury lawsuits, including a number of wrongful death actions, filed by families of Rosewood patients. Lawyers for the estate of a 93-year-old dementia patient, Dorothy Dainty, said she died of complications from a fall at the facility in Rockford, Ill., because staff members failed to properly supervise her. At another nursing facility that Mr. Feiner ran in Decatur, Ill., regulators imposed about $280,000 in fines after a patient died of an untreated wound. That home has since closed. Sean Murray, whose law firm is representing Ms. Dainty’s estate, said she had fallen out of bed and broken her hip because some workers had been pulling double shifts. “For-profit homes are understaffing their facilities,” said Mr. Murray, whose firm is also representing the estates of two other Rosewood residents.

2019,$2 Billion Verdict Against Monsanto Is Third to Find Roundup Caused Cancer,"A jury in Oakland, Calif., ordered Monsanto on Monday to pay a couple more than $2 billion in damages after finding that its Roundup weed killer caused their cancer — the third jury to conclude that the company failed to warn consumers of its flagship product’s dangers. Thousands of additional lawsuits against Monsanto, which Bayer acquired last year, are queued up in state and federal courts. The couple, Alva and Alberta Pilliod, used Roundup on their Northern California property for decades. In 2011, Mr. Pilliod, now 76, was given a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. In 2015, his wife, who is 74, learned she had the same disease. The jury, in state court in Alameda County, reached its verdict two months after a federal jury in San Francisco awarded $80 million to a man who claimed that Roundup had caused his non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. In August, a state court in San Francisco found that Roundup had caused the cancer of a school groundskeeper, awarding him $289 million. A judge reduced that figure to $78 million. That verdict is being appealed. The Pilliods’ lawyer, R. Brent Wisner, argued in court that a billion-dollar judgment would send a message to the chemical giant. He based the amount of punitive damages, $1 billion for each of the Pilliods, on what he said was Roundup’s annual profit: $892 million in 2017. After the verdict, Mr. Wisner said in a statement, “The jury saw for themselves internal company documents demonstrating that, from Day 1, Monsanto has never had any interest in finding out whether Roundup is safe.” Another lawyer for the couple, Michael Miller, said homeowners like the Pilliods were more at risk than professional gardeners because they were never told to wear any protective gloves or clothing. A Bayer spokesman, Chris Loder, said in an interview, “Bayer believes the punitive verdict is excessive and unjustifiable.” The active ingredient in the herbicide, glyphosate, is the world’s most widely used weed killer. Bayer has repeatedly declared that the chemical is safe, saying health regulators worldwide have come to the same conclusion. “We have great sympathy for Mr. and Mrs. Pilliod,” Bayer said in a statement, but “there is not reliable scientific evidence” to conclude the herbicide was the culprit. Appearing with her husband at a brief news conference after the trial, Ms. Pilliod said, “We can’t do the things we used to be able to do, and we really resent Monsanto for that fact.” Last month, the Environmental Protection Agency issued an interim review that said the agency “continues to find that there are no risks to public health when glyphosate is used in accordance with its current label and that glyphosate is not a carcinogen.” Bayer’s stock has taken a beating since the jury verdicts started coming in last summer, losing billions of dollars in value. Shares have fallen roughly 40 percent since Bayer completed its purchase of Monsanto in June. An earlier version of this article misstated the reduced amount of a verdict against Monsanto last year. A judge reduced an award of $289 million to $78 million, not to $89 million.",The New York Times

2019,"$461,646 in Pay for One Worker: M.T.A. Overtime Scrutinized by Prosecutors","Handwritten bookkeeping is still in use at the Long Island Rail Road. Now the practice is the subject of a federal inquiry. [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] A vulnerability to payroll abuse at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is coming under the scrutiny of federal prosecutors in Manhattan after revelations that some employees were able to claim staggering amounts of overtime last year. One worker at the Long Island Rail Road, asserting that he logged about 74 hours of overtime every week atop his regular duty, was paid $461,646 last year — more than the combined salaries of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio. Federal prosecutors have subpoenaed pay records for that worker, Thomas Caputo, and more than a dozen other employees at the Long Island Rail Road and New York City Transit, according to three people with direct knowledge of the investigation. The three who spoke with The New York Times this week declined to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly. Beyond those individuals, prosecutors plan to review the 19th-century time keeping practices used in some departments of the Long Island Rail Road: handwritten records submitted by employees. Modern machines, better able to detect fraud, were installed but not used because, managers said, they feared pushback by employees. Some areas of New York City Transit, which oversees subways and buses, use timecards with mechanical punch-clocks, technology that dates to the early 20th century. The inquiry is being led by prosecutors in the public corruption unit of the United States Attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York. The Queens District Attorney’s office has also started a separate investigation along with the authority’s inspector general, which looks into wrongdoing at the agency. Mr. Caputo, who recently retired as a senior track worker after three decades with the railroad, did not respond to requests for comment. James M. Margolin, a spokesman for the Southern District, declined to comment. John Samuelsen, the international president of the Transport Workers Union, which represents city subway and bus workers, said he was unaware of a criminal investigation. “There is no evidence of systematic abuse or criminality or fraud at New York City Transit,” Mr. Samuelsen said in an interview. “This is putting the cart before the horse.” Mr. Samuelsen encouraged prosecutors to examine the authority’s “incestuous relationships with outside consultants” to find “the real fraud and corruption.” The union has criticized the agency’s reliance on consulting firms, which are often filled with former transit officials. Anthony Simon, the general chairman of a major union that represents many Long Island Railroad workers, said he did not know about the investigation and could not comment on it. “I have said all along we do not condone bad behavior,” Mr. Simon said in a statement. “We are going to focus on working hard to deliver the service our riders want and deserve.” The governor’s office and a spokesman for the transportation authority declined to speak about the investigation. Several cases of huge overtime payments for Mr. Caputo and others — first revealed to the public last month in an annual report from the Empire Center for Public Policy, a fiscal research group — have highlighted failures by the authority to modernize the time keeping systems for its 70,000 employees. Officials at the authority say many Long Island Rail Road workers are paid based on handwritten documents they submit listing the number of hours claimed, with little to no review before payment. Employees of the railroad are, by far, the highest paid of any workers at the region’s transit agencies; 19 people whose pay rate was around $50 an hour or less made $300,000 or more with overtime in 2018. Mr. Cuomo, who controls the authority, and one of his representatives on the M.T.A. board have said that the overtime hours suggest fraud, sparking an angry standoff with union leaders who said employees had been invited or pushed to work long hours so the system could be fixed. Five years ago, the Long Island Rail Road installed about 120 biometric clocks, which would require employees to sign in with their thumbprints at the start and end of shifts. Despite this, the paper time keeping system remains in use for union workers in the department that maintains tracks, signals, buildings and bridges. Management feared that insisting on the use of the automated clocks would have “an adverse impact on employee productivity,” according to an internal memo by the transit agency’s inspector general, which was described to The Times. Maintainers at the railroad have the lowest productivity among maintainers at the five biggest commuter rail lines in the country, according to a report published in April by the Citizens Budget Commission. Last week, transportation authority officials presented plans for the installation and use of biometric clocks for all employees on the Long Island Rail Road and the agency’s other commuter railroad, Metro North, within 90 days. The subway and bus systems, which still use time clocks with cards at many locations, would change in six months. Overtime has become a pressing issue for the authority as its payroll costs have been rising faster than the fares and tolls that support them. Officials say the agency is facing a nearly $1 billion deficit by 2022 and they are considering layoffs and other measures to reduce costs. Not surprisingly, overtime soared as leaders scrambled in recent years to catch up with basic maintenance that had been ignored or deferred and led to poor service. Both management and union officials say that most of the higher bills resulted not from fraud, but from an urgent need for more work. Union workers on Long Island also enjoy generous overtime provisions, some a century old, under contracts agreed to by their 10 unions with the authority and its predecessors. Though reform of the work rules on the railroad was a leading goal of the M.T.A. in its most recent round of contract negotiations, none of them were changed under the resulting agreements. They were signed in 2014 after intervention from Mr. Cuomo, who was then running for a second term as governor. The Long Island Rail Road was embroiled in scandal more than a decade ago, when an investigation by The New York Times found that nearly every career employee who retired received a disability pension, though many continued to enjoy vigorous, active lives. A total of 33 people — railroad workers, doctors, and a union official — pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges. An emergency M.T.A. board meeting last Friday to discuss overtime turned into a series of brawling arguments between union representatives and Lawrence Schwartz, an ally of the governor on the board. Union leaders blamed management for assigning the overtime and even raised the prospect of a subway strike, something not seen in New York City since 2005. The authority has started contract negotiations with its largest union, Transport Workers Union Local 100, which represents the city’s subway and bus workers. While its leaders have been close to Mr. Cuomo and contributed more than $275,000 to his political campaigns, they face internal political challenges from insurgents critical of their relationship with the governor. Mr. Samuelsen, the union leader who is also a transportation authority board member, has recently taken a decidedly harsher tone with the governor, expressing outrage over Mr. Cuomo’s comments on overtime fraud and comparing him to President Trump. William K. Rashbaum contributed reporting. Because of an editing error, an earlier version of the headline with this article misstated how much one railroad worker earned in overtime. The $461,646 paid was the worker's total pay for last year, not the amount he was paid in overtime.",The New York Times
2019,"$770,000 Was Just Spent on a Playground. Now the City Wants to Raze It.","To residents, a plan to replace a just-refurbished public area with a new residential tower was another example of the housing authority’s dysfunction. The playground of a housing project in Manhattan in recent years had slid into a state of disrepair so severe that parents felt uneasy about letting their children play there. So in 2015, the state approved a plan to steer $770,000 toward a new cushioned play surface, new barbecues and new water sprinklers for children to cool down, plus other improvements. The playground, in the Chelsea neighborhood, is scheduled to reopen early this summer. Except that the New York City Housing Authority is now planning to raze the playground and build a new residential tower in its place as part of the city’s contentious proposal to replace some public housing buildings with mixed-income private developments to raise money for urgently needed repairs. The move to scrap a newly renovated playground underscores the lengths the beleaguered housing agency is willing to go to finance $32 billion in backlogged improvements. To many residents, however, it was just the latest example of the dysfunction they have come to expect from the housing authority, known as Nycha, which has come under fire for financial mismanagement and scandals over heat, lead paint and mold. The agency is currently under the supervision of a federal monitor after prosecutors accused it of cover-ups and endangering the safety of its residents. “I think, in all honesty, it is a waste of taxpayers’ money,” said Miguel Acevedo, the president of the resident association for the housing project, Fulton Houses, about the plan for the playground. “I’m frustrated about it.” Read the project description for the renovations of the Fulton Houses playground in Chelsea. Housing officials for the first time presented the preliminary details of their plan at a meeting on Monday with residents of the Fulton Houses, an 11-building housing complex next to the High Line. The meeting was the first of several the housing agency will hold to answer questions and gather input from skeptical tenants who fear they will be displaced. Barbara Brancaccio, a spokeswoman for Nycha, said the plan has not been finalized, but that it would eventually generate at least $168 million that would be used for repairs at the Fulton Houses. “This means that if they want new residential buildings built near or at the location where there is currently a playground, and they want the playground relocated, then we will work with the developer to incorporate this vision into the design,” she said. She added that the playground renovations were underway before the most recent plan to build at the Fulton Houses was even conceived. Sean Campion, a senior research associate at the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group, said the about-face spoke to the “state’s historical lack of coordination with Nycha over how the state’s resources should be invested in Nycha’s greatest needs.” The funding for the playground stems from a $100 million public housing package that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo approved in 2015, but was wary of handing over directly to Nycha because of its reputation of mismanagement. “The $100 million is going to be controlled by the state because the state has a better track record at construction,” Mr. Cuomo said at the time. Mayor Bill de Blasio, a fellow Democrat, tried to convince the governor to entrust the $100 million to the housing agency to fix leaky roofs, one of the main causes of mold. Instead, the governor divided the money among members of the Assembly to fund smaller projects, like upgrades to security cameras, outside lighting and playground repairs. A spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo declined to comment. “If they are in fact in using the playground for some of the new construction, that would certainly be a real shame considering the recent work on it,” said Assemblyman Richard Gottfried, who allocated the state funds for the playground upgrades. He said the city should find a different site or guarantee that the new building’s developer will pay to replace the playground. Under the plan, one new residential tower would be built on the playground site. Then residents from 72 units at two of the development’s smaller buildings would be moved to that new tower and continue to pay subsidized rents. The two small buildings would be demolished, paving the way for two new mixed-income towers that would be operated by a private landlord. All told, almost 700 new units of housing could be built. Housing officials have stressed that residents would not be displaced from the complex. The money generated from the three new towers would be used to repair the other nine buildings in the Fulton Houses and the neighboring Chelsea-Elliott housing development. The city is also considering handing over the day-to-day management of both developments to a private partner who would invest to renovate the buildings. The proposal to partner with private developers is a central part of Mr. de Blasio’s revamped plan to generate desperately needed revenue for the housing authority to fix roofs, boilers and elevators. During the meeting on Monday, residents raised concerns about how they would be relocated to the new apartments and how the city would hold private developers accountable and ensure that residents’ rights and rents would be preserved. David Pristin, the executive vice president for external affairs at Nycha, told residents that housing officials were there to “work with you to refine this plan.” Developers could begin construction by 2021 and new apartments could be marketed by as soon as 2023, according to a presentation shared with tenants. Last year, an audit from the city comptroller’s office found that 70 percent of the playgrounds run by the housing authority at 238 public housing developments were plagued by dangerous conditions, such as broken play equipment or damaged safety surfaces. Residents said that the playground at the Fulton Houses, whose tar surface was gravely cracked, was dangerous and that renovations, however short-lived, were long overdue. “It’s just money being cut up and thrown out,” Amelia Martinez, 60, who has lived at the Fulton Houses for four years, said of the plan for the playground. “We need air. We need space. I’m so disgusted.”",The New York Times

2019,"$95,000 to Fix Up a Studio Apartment, but It Was All a Scam, Officials Say","Rents were jacked up on hundreds of New York City apartments in a kickback scheme, a lawsuit contends. [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] When a contractor was hired in 2012 to renovate nine rent-regulated apartments at a prewar, six-story building in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, the renovations were identical across all of the units — new hardwood floors, new countertops, new appliances — but the prices were not. The real estate firm that hired the contractor calculated how much was needed to spend on improvements to push the rent beyond the threshold to deregulate the apartments, instead of budgeting for the true costs of the renovations. For example, the firm paid the contractor $95,000 in labor costs to gut-renovate a studio apartment, while paying only $14,500 to do similar renovations on a one-bedroom. It was all part of a real estate scheme designed to jack up rents and illegally lift hundreds of apartments out of rent regulation in New York City, according to a lawsuit filed by the state attorney’s general office on Thursday. Landlords can deregulate apartments when the rent passes a certain threshold — currently $2,744.77 a month. Employees of Newcastle Realty Services, a Manhattan real estate investment firm, made up prices for renovations, lied about specific repairs, and forged documents, abusing a provision in state law that enables landlords to raise rents when they renovate rent-regulated apartments, the suit said. Along the way, contractors paid more than $1.2 million in kickbacks to two employees at the firm, including cash and checks to cover splashy expenses like country club dues and a loan on a Porsche. The goal was to systematically push the rents of regulated apartments in Manhattan and Brooklyn past the threshold that deregulates the apartments, thrusting them into the more lucrative free market. “Engaging in fraud with respect to renovations is a decades-old, devious practice designed to take advantage of tenants throughout New York,” Letitia James, the attorney general, said in a statement. “Knocking hundreds of rent-stabilized apartments off the market by illegal schemes is immoral and unacceptable.” In the past few decades, New York has lost tens of thousands of rent-regulated apartments, the city’s largest stock of affordable housing, for which monthly rents increase by only a small percentage each year. Abuses are rarely exposed, but advocates say they are rampant — claiming that unscrupulous landlords routinely game the system in an attempt to deregulate apartments and raise rents. The issue will be front and center when New York state’s rent laws expire next month; lawmakers are poised to make tenant-friendly reforms, and legislators are considering eliminating the exact provision that the lawsuit claims was abused by Newcastle employees. The suit accused David Drumheller, the former head of operations at Newcastle Realty Services, of engaging in a price-fixing scheme to deregulate hundreds of apartments managed by the firm from 2012 until 2016. Contractors who benefited from the renovations paid kickbacks to Mr. Drumheller and another unnamed employee, according to the suit. “We intend to fight this lawsuit and prove that all actions taken were lawful and appropriate.” said Roger Stavis, a lawyer for Mr. Drumheller, who is currently the director of operations at GFB Management, a real estate operator that also manages affordable housing, according to his LinkedIn profile. Newcastle Realty Services, which the lawsuit said manages about 2,500 apartments in the city, is not a defendant, but the lawsuit detailed how other employees at the company were also involved in the ploy. “Newcastle has been cooperating with the attorney general for over a year,” Ronn Torossian, a spokesman for Newcastle Realty Services, said. “Mr. Drumheller was terminated by Newcastle years ago for inappropriate conduct unrelated to this matter.” He said the unnamed employee was fired after the attorney general’s office disclosed the wrongdoing. A landlord is allowed to renovate an apartment and pass on a portion of the costs in the form of a rent increase under a provision known as Individual Apartment Improvements, or I.A.I.s. Building owners have said that I.A.I.s are one of the few incentives they have to make repairs and keep their apartments in livable conditions, and that abolishing the provision would deteriorate the conditions of the city’s housing stock. But the lawsuit offered a detailed look at how landlords can recklessly exploit a system known for its lax oversight to turn a profit and circumvent regulations meant to keep apartments affordable. The suit said Newcastle Realty Services is among the investors that “make it a business practice to target rent-stabilized properties with low rents” and deregulate the units to collect higher rents or sell the buildings for a profit. Newcastle Realty Services used just a handful of contractors, and Mr. Drumheller would work out how much the company needed to spend on renovations to push the rent beyond the threshold to deregulate the apartment, instead of budgeting for the true costs of the renovations, the suit said. Mr. Drumheller and other employees would dictate to contractors the prices the company was going to pay for renovations “without any competitive bidding or relation to the actual cost of the labor,” the suit said. In August 2012, Mr. Drumheller claimed the labor cost to renovate a one-bedroom apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn was to be $52,500. Newcastle gave the job to a contractor that in reality needed significantly less to cover its expenses for the job, the suit said. But the contractor took the money and the inflated renovation costs helped to successfully push the apartment’s rent to $2,512.01 — about $12 above the deregulation threshold at the time, the suit said. To legitimize the phony numbers, Newcastle employees often prepared invoices and job proposals on behalf of contractors using contractor letterhead, and Mr. Drumheller submitted these to regulatory agencies, the lawsuit said. According to the suit, contractors paid kickbacks in exchange for being awarded the lucrative renovation jobs. Two contractors, OVQ Consolidated and KKA Consolidated, paid Mr. Drumheller at least $527,000 in kickbacks between 2014 and 2017, the suit said. The unnamed employee regularly met with a window contractor at his van outside Newcastle’s offices to receive cash payments, the suit said; the contractor also paid the employee’s thousands of dollars in dues at the Elmwood Country Club in Westchester County. In November 2015, one contractor wrote a check for more than $20,000 to Porsche Financial Services to pay off the unnamed employee’s loan on a sports car, according to court documents. Mr. Drumheller, the suit said, worked to conceal the kickback portion of the scheme from Newcastle Realty Services. His former employer, however, has been on the state attorney general office’s radar before. Several years ago, Newcastle tried to improperly convert an Upper West Side rental building into a condominium and illegally induced tenants to leave the building through buyout agreements, the office found in 2015. As a result, Newcastle was forced to pay more than $1.5 million in fines and legal fees, and agreed to waive two years of rent for the 11 tenants who stayed put. The lawsuit against Mr. Drumheller seeks, in part, to prohibit him from engaging in any business related to rent-stabilized apartments and to compensate tenants who were affected. Ms. James said her office will work to re-regulate lost units. Tenants who believe they were overcharged can file a complaint with the state.",The New York Times

Snyder “glides from history to the present day, from scene to analysis, with a relaxed virtuosity that filled me with admiration,” our critic Parul Sehgal writes. “This is a writer using every tool at her disposal to make this story come alive, to make it matter.” THE SCANDAL OF THE CENTURY: And Other Writings, by Gabriel García Márquez. Translated from the Spanish by Anne McLean. Edited by Cristóbal Pera. (Knopf, $27.95.) Gabriel García Márquez called journalism “the best job in the world” and “a biological necessity of humanity.” This resonant new collection includes 50 pieces of García Márquez’s journalism, published between 1950 and 1984, demonstrating how seriously he took reportage and what’s now sometimes called long-form narrative. “Most of his journalism, like most of his fiction, is centered on his native Colombia,” our critic Dwight Garner writes. “So many of the best pieces in ‘The Scandal of the Century,’ however, are essays, unpretentious and witty meditations on topics like barbers and air travel and literary translation and movies.” OUR MAN: Richard Holbrooke and the End of the American Century, by George Packer. (Knopf, $30.) Packer’s complex portrait of the well-known American diplomat offers a “warts and all” picture, describing a highly accomplished man who was endearing and exasperating, relentless, ambitious, voracious, brilliant, idealistic, noble and needy. “I doubt that any novel, not even one co-written by Graham Greene and F. Scott Fitzgerald, could have captured Holbrooke fully, and I certainly thought that no biography ever would,” Walter Isaacson writes on the Book Review’s cover. “But now one has. George Packer’s ‘Our Man’ portrays Holbrooke in all of his endearing and exasperating self-willed glory.” MAYBE YOU SHOULD TALK TO SOMEONE: A Therapist, Her Therapist, and Our Lives Revealed, by Lori Gottlieb. (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $28.) A psychotherapist analyzes her patients’ stories — and her own. Our reviewer, Alex Kuczynski, calls it “an irresistibly candid and addicting memoir about psychotherapeutic practice as experienced by both the clinician and the patient. … In showing us how patients reveal just a part of their selves, she gives us a dizzily satisfying collage of narratives, a kind of ensemble soap opera set in the already soap operatic world of Los Angeles.” THE DEATH AND LIFE OF AIDA HERNANDEZ: A Border Story, by Aaron Bobrow-Strain. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $28.) Choosing as his subject an undocumented Mexican woman who is a complicated and imperfect figure, Bobrow-Strain, a professor of politics at Whitman College, has written a searing ethnography about immigration that reads like a novel. “As Bobrow-Strain depicts his titular heroine, she is ebullient and indomitable, a smart, fiercely loving survivor,” the Times columnist Michelle Goldberg writes in her review. “She is also impetuous, often shortsighted and frequently derailed by her own compounding trauma. Aida’s situation leaves her no margin for error, but she errs anyway. She’s a radiantly optimistic character in a relentlessly bleak, unlucky world.” REVOLUTIONARIES, by Joshua Furst. (Knopf, $26.95.) Set in the 1960s, Furst’s second novel is about the children of postwar tranquillity who, aghast at the tacit arrangements that underwrote their childhood, poured out of suburbia and into the streets as hippie radicals. According to Greg Jackson’s review, the book “is about the ones who really meant it — neither those playing at insurrection, nor the ideologues who, in their sincerity, betray a fatal affinity for dogma. Furst is concerned instead with the rabble-rousers, the mischief-makers, the dreamers and the prophets: those whose imaginations nourish movements, and who vouchsafe a glimpse of the new world to come.” BOY SWALLOWS UNIVERSE, by Trent Dalton. (Harper/HarperCollins, $26.99.) This debut novel by a celebrated Australian journalist closely echoes his own life: In a suburb of Brisbane, the main character’s mother is a drug addict romantically involved with a career criminal. “All this sounds grim,” Amelia Lester writes in her review, but the protagonist, “who notices everything and speaks in a kind of hyperactive journalese, is still somehow open to the world, and frequently amusing as a result. … The anxieties of adolescence are persuasively conveyed — the big ones, like drug dealing, but also the more trivial ones, like talking to girls.” THE BINDING, by Bridget Collins. (Morrow/HarperCollins, $26.99.) Bookbinders capture souls in this fantasy’s bleak Dickensian world. The novel’s most horrifying victim is the starving mother who doesn’t recognize her children because she had to sell her memories of them. “Collins’s vivid descriptions of the abuse of that magic within a grimy faux-Victorian-era world of workhouses and exploitation are almost too painfully true,” our reviewer, Naomi Novik, writes. “Nevertheless, ‘The Binding’ succeeds in creating the magic it proposes: the experience of memory returning, a rush of recollection that can change the whole world, if only for one person at a time.” LEAP OF FAITH: Hubris, Negligence, and America’s Greatest Foreign Policy Tragedy, by Michael J. Mazarr. (PublicAffairs, $30.) This detailed account rejects cynical explanations for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, arguing that it came from the best of intentions based on America’s “messianic or missionary” character. It also sees the war as a foregone conclusion: “Bush and his chief lieutenants were dead set on a course of action and nothing was going to prevent them from plunging ahead,” Andrew J. Bacevich writes in his review. “Process was a charade. Mazarr describes the result as ‘policy implementation on autopilot,’ with doubters and dissenters frozen out or simply ignored.” BLUEPRINT: The Evolutionary Origins of a Good Society, by Nicholas A. Christakis. (Little, Brown Spark, $30.) Christakis makes a forceful case that the need for community is as powerful a force as genetics in promoting friendship and cooperation. Reviewing “Blueprint” alongside two other books about social evolution, Aarathi Prasad writes that it “considers the power of crowds not just as a force that can instill fear, but one that can bring about great good; and, with that, the question of whether we can broaden our perspective away from tribalism and toward an appreciation of a more universal heritage.”",The New York Times
2019,10 New Books We Recommend This Week,"Editors’ Choice Before April recedes too far into the rearview, let’s pause a moment to appreciate a month that gave us cause — as if we needed it — to celebrate both earth and verse. Whether you wanted a book for Earth Day (April 22) or for National Poetry Month (the whole darn month), Brian Teare’s “Doomstead Days” might have served: A collection of poems composed while walking, it honors and mourns the changing landscapes it encounters throughout. If that whets your appetite for more poetry, you should definitely read Morgan Parker’s “Magical Negro,” which cements her place as one of the smartest, liveliest, most accomplished young poets working today. Or if it fires you up to read more about the environment and what we’re doing to it, Nathaniel Rich’s “Losing Earth: A Climate History” (which started as an article for The Times Magazine) spins a bleak and gripping narrative about how we’ve reached this point. SMH, as the kids say online. That’s short for “shaking my head,” but in my house we thought for a long time it meant “so much hate.” In this case, both meanings apply. We also bring a couple of novels your way, along with a look at science’s changing views of mental illness, a history of American cult leaders and Henry Louis Gates Jr.’s new book about the short-lived promise of Reconstruction. Then there’s Mary Norris’s love letter to Greek language and culture, and — because April also brought us Shakespeare’s birthday — a look back at the 1769 theater festival that renewed his reputation despite being so chaotic that our reviewer describes it, wonderfully, as an 18th-century version of the Fyre Festival. Gregory CowlesSenior Editor, BooksTwitter: @GregoryCowles MACHINES LIKE ME, by Ian McEwan. (Nan A. Talese, $26.95.) McEwan’s latest novel concerns a ménage à trois between a man, a woman and a sexy male robot. The story, set in an alternative 1980s England, is about what happens when Charlie, a London man in his early 30s, uses money left to him after his mother’s death to buy a first-generation robot named Adam. “There are some pokey moments in this novel, some dead nodes,” our critic Dwight Garner writes. “But McEwan has an interesting mind and he is nearly always good company on the page. In whichever direction he turns, he has worthwhile commentary to make.” MIND FIXERS: Psychiatry’s Troubled Search for the Biology of Mental Illness, by Anne Harrington. (Norton, $27.95.) Harrington, a historian of science at Harvard, says that psychiatry’s biological triumphalism began to unravel in the 1990s and the 2000s. Anticipated discoveries in the biology of mental illness, vigorously hyped before they even arrived, never panned out. “Harrington doesn’t romanticize the world of mental illness before drugs — drugs that many patients credit with offering relief and even a chance at survival,” our critic Jennifer Szalai writes. “What psychiatry needs to do, she says, is narrow its focus to the most severe forms of mental illness and ‘make a virtue of modesty’ rather than hubris.” WALKING ON THE CEILING, by Aysegul Savas. (Riverhead, $26.) Savas’s delicate, melancholy debut novel unfolds in a series of 72 short, non-chronological chapters, pieces of a mosaic that demand careful attention as you attempt to fit them together. Nunu, the narrator, has come to France to study literature after the death of her mother back home in Istanbul. Our reviewer Sarah Lyall writes: “The unreliability of memory; the ways we talk to ourselves and to each other; how we can act as detectives in our own lives, combing the past for clues; how places can seem clearer from afar than when we are there — all these themes are touched on in Savas’s spare, disarmingly simple prose.” LOSING EARTH: A Climate History, by Nathaniel Rich. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $25.) Rich posits that “nearly every conversation we have in 2019 about climate change was being held in 1979.” This history details the paths not taken and the warnings ignored as the threat of global warming increased over the course of those four decades of inaction. John Lanchester, in his review, calls it a “gripping, depressing, revelatory … account of what went wrong — of how it was that a moment of growing awareness of climate change, and an apparent willingness to act on the knowledge, was allowed to dissipate into stasis and inaction.” GREEK TO ME: Adventures of the Comma Queen, by Mary Norris. (Norton, $25.95.) Norris, a longtime copy editor at The New Yorker whose first book chronicled her passion for punctuation, here recounts, with the same contagious wit and enthusiasm, her obsession with Greece — its language, history and culture. “‘Greek to Me’ is one of the most satisfying accounts of a great passion that I have ever read,” Vivian Gornick writes in her review. “Norris’s irreverent reverence for the history of the Greek language is not only admirable, it is moving. … You feel yourself in the presence of a traveler whose authority emanates from lived experience.” WHAT BLEST GENIUS? The Jubilee That Made Shakespeare, by Andrew McConnell Stott. (Norton, $26.95.) In 1769 the great British actor David Garrick held a three-day extravaganza to celebrate Shakespeare and advance his own career. This lively book captures the poor planning, incessant rain and ensuing chaos. “Stott’s book delivers a vivacious portrait of the Stratford-upon-Avon Jubilee,” Dominic Dromgoole writes in his review. “Garrick’s Jubilee of 1769 runs the Fyre Festival of 2017 close for overambition, chaotic planning and near disaster. Garrick, unlike Billy McFarland, somehow got away with it.” AMERICAN MESSIAHS: False Prophets of a Damned Nation, by Adam Morris. (Norton, $28.95.) The religious history of America is filled with cults and marginal sectarian communities. Morris fills in the fascinating details, with a focus on the charismatic prophets who dissented from traditional Christianity — and claimed, in one way or another, to represent God directly. “As strange as Morris’s subjects may seem, in some ways they are quite typical of American religious culture,” Molly Worthen writes in her review. “Morris shows that these oddball spiritual liberators are not just historical footnotes. They reveal society’s fundamental themes and contradictions.” STONY THE ROAD: Reconstruction, White Supremacy, and the Rise of Jim Crow, by Henry Louis Gates Jr. (Penguin Press, $30.) This lucid and essential history — bolstered by a wealth of visual material — traces the rise of white supremacy in the wake of the Civil War. Reviewing it, Nell Painter calls the book “a bracing alternative to Trump-era white nationalism” and says that its “devastating inventory of cruel, ugly stereotypes, lynchings and torture puts our current era immediately in context.” MAGICAL NEGRO: Poems, by Morgan Parker. (Tin House, paper, $15.95.) Parker’s tense, funny collection, her third, explores the gap between black experience and the white imagination’s version of it, further proving her considerable skill and consequence. “While some of Parker’s poems ironically posit themselves as ‘guides’ to black culture, the collection, by and large, provides a space to celebrate black excellence and black joy as well as to commiserate about injustice,” Emilia Phillips writes in her review. “Parker is a dynamic craftsperson whose associative thinking complicates traditional confessional approaches.” DOOMSTEAD DAYS, by Brian Teare. (Nightboat, paper, $17.95.) Teare’s latest volume, composed largely while walking, addresses climate change, apocalypse and grief in poems that feel solitary but intimate. “In wandering, his poems deliberately cultivate attentiveness to the motions of mind,” Tess Taylor writes, reviewing the book alongside three other collections. “Teare’s voices let us weigh the insoluble questions of how to live as an ethical being in the face of violence and environmental collapse.”",The New York Times

2019,10 Teenagers Burned by Acidlike Liquid Thrown From Above at Raucous Party,"The teenagers, some of them students at Brooklyn Tech, had been partying in a rented basement room at a public housing complex in Manhattan’s East Village. [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] A party advertised on social media drew as many as 300 young people on Saturday night to a public housing complex in Manhattan’s East Village, where residents said partygoers paid $10 to enter a basement room usually reserved for tenant meetings. The music was blasting as the crowd, which included teenagers from an elite public high school in Brooklyn, spilled into the courtyard. Barely an hour had passed before residents of the development, the First Houses, called the police at about 10 p.m. But someone upstairs had decided to do something about it. White paint and a caustic chemical were poured from overhead, burning at least 10 of the teenagers in the courtyard, the police said on Sunday. Residents described a chaotic scene. “I heard a huge ruckus and when I looked out the window I saw a ton of kids below,” said Chaz Rosario, 30, who lives on the fourth floor. “I hadn’t seen anything like that here before. I didn’t know what was going on.” The victims, six girls and four boys between the ages of 15 and 18, were treated for minor burns at nearby hospitals, the police said. Valerie Vail, the mother of one victim, said many partygoers were students at Brooklyn Technical High School, including her daughter, a sophomore who she said was attending her first party as a student there. The attack left the girl with burns the size of dimes and quarters on her back, chest and arms, Ms. Vail said. She said her daughter had shown her photos of other partygoers who had large burns across their chests, necks and legs. After the paint and chemicals rained down, some partygoers rushed the East Third Street building’s front door and attempted to force their way in, slamming their fists against the door’s glass panes, cracking one, said Michael Strachan, 60, who lives in the building. One of the residents who had gathered in a first-floor hallway went to the door and showed her government identification to the young people through the glass, witnesses said. The group quickly scattered at the sight of the ID and the arriving police, who told them to back off. “It was nuts,” Mr. Strachan said. “I came home and there were all of these teenagers and smashed beer bottles everywhere, all of these cop cars were here, nobody knew what was going on.” Many of the injured students ran to a nearby deli and doused the burns with milk. Ms. Vail said she told her daughter over the phone to get in a cab headed uptown, but the police and ambulances swarmed as the girl was waiting with friends for a cab. Ms. Vail said that other parents of teenagers at the party had been told by the police that a man who lived in the building appeared to have thrown an orange-colored drain cleaner on the crowd below. The police would not confirm that information, or provide additional details. They said no arrests have been made. “We are shocked,” Ms. Vail said. “I try to teach my kid to be resilient, but it’s also traumatic and upsetting.” Several residents of the building said they overheard the teenagers telling the police and each other that the host of the party was a young man who had advertised the gathering on social media, with a $10 cover charge. Tenants said they do not believe the host lived in the building. The tenants’ association president, Heyward Walker, said on Sunday that he had not rented out the basement room, as some residents said they suspected, but he would not comment further about the incident. A spokeswoman for New York City Housing Authority did not respond to an email seeking comment on Sunday. On Sunday, a marked police sport-utility vehicle sat outside the building, where footprints outlined in white paint stained the stone pathway from the back of the building to its front gate. Cigarette butts and smashed Heineken bottles littered the ground and smudges of white paint were brushed against two green posts outside the front door, where one pane of glass remained cracked. Ms. Vail said she feared that some students who were injured had not been treated. “A lot of the kids were afraid to tell their parents and have not had help yet,” she said. “They’re just scared.” Mr. Rosario said the party shook the typically calm neighborhood. “I’m concerned because this is a gated community,” he said. “No one should have been in the gate to begin with unless they live here.”",The New York Times
2019,"10 Years of Photography, and Lens","lens A look back at a decade of The New York Times Lens column. When Lens kicked off 10 years ago this month, Instagram did not exist and smartphone cameras were relatively new and rarely used by serious photographers. Today, most readers view Lens on their phones. That’s but one of the tectonic shifts in photography as Lens followed monumental events like wars and the presidencies of Barack Obama and Donald J. Trump as well as the intimate stories of daily life told by people in their own communities. If Lens had a credo, it was this: Photography does not happen by itself; it happens because of photographers. That realization came at a time when advances in digital technology and platforms spurred both anxiety and layoffs among photojournalists as well as a drop in freelance editorial assignments. James Estrin envisioned an online destination that would highlight excellent photography and serious discussion of visual journalism, a mission that over the years expanded to include debates on important issues of accuracy, ethics and representation. After some research, James suggested to Michele McNally, then The Times’s director of photography, the idea of a photo blog. There were few such blogs at the time, and none with The Times’s reputation or reach. She agreed, though she also realized it could be too much for one person to take on. That’s when David W. Dunlap, then a Metro reporter with a keen interest in photography, came on board as the incipient blog’s co-editor. Josh Haner, who besides being a fine photographer — he would go on to win a Pulitzer Prize in 2014 — was conversant in the language of coders and designers, also joined the team as co-editor, setting up a simple WordPress blog for a one-week trial run. Michele wasn’t kidding about the amount of work involved. Lens took a year to get up and running — there were so many people involved in the planning that it took about four months to agree upon on a name. We settled on Lens, a name that had been previously used for a weekly photographic column from 2005 to 2008. Originated by Anne Cronin, then a metro editor, it featured projects by staff as well as freelance photographers. Lens finally went live five days a week with a sleek design featuring a dark background, slide shows and white type. The first post declared that Lens would showcase the work of Times photographers and also highlight the best images by photographers from other publications, wire services and agencies from around the web: “In time, we hope it will also become the center of a community of readers who are not just interested in photojournalism — in the broadest sense of visually chronicling the world around us — but actively involved in some way or other, whether professionally or informally.” It has. Lens has since grown to include photography that could be considered more broadly documentary or art and has also featured video. Over the course of the past decade, it has addressed ethical issues in conflict photography and revisited overlooked — or underappreciated — masters. Readers have also been invited to participate in Lens’s mission; several callouts were made to crowd source images in projects like “A Moment in Time.” When David left Lens, he was succeeded by David Gonzalez, a longtime Times reporter who had been a columnist and foreign correspondent, as well as a founding member of Seis del Sur, a Puerto Rican photo collective. A native Spanish speaker, he proved to be the point person for photographers from Latin America, a region that — along with Africa and Asia — had seen robust growth thanks to the accessibility of digital technology and platforms. More important, Lens became one of the industry leaders in the discussion over accurate representation, featuring the work of people telling the stories of their own communities. Narratives that for too long had been defined by outsiders began to be reclaimed by those whose lived experiences informed their photography. Lens’s commitment to these issues led it to become a co-founder of the New York Portfolio Review, which convenes a diverse group photographers, editors, curators and publishers for a weekend of critiques and panel discussions. The goal was for each participant to get not just advice, but also a chance to be published or exhibited. Above all, unlike other established reviews that charged to participate, the New York Portfolio Review was free, a decision born of the belief that money should not be an obstacle to finding new opportunities. This was largely made possible thanks to the time and talent of its co-founders at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York and United Photo Industries. None of this could have been accomplished without a series of intrepid producers: Kerri MacDonald, Matthew McCann, Whitney Richardson, Anjelica Bartkowiak and Matthew Sedacca Levine. To mark Lens’s 10th anniversary, we are featuring some of our favorite posts today and tomorrow. With more than 4,000 posts to choose from, the choices are admittedly personal. Consider this a mixtape by David Gonzalez and James Estrin. We’d love to hear which ones have been your favorites over the years. Follow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

2019,10 in Eastern Europe Are Charged in Malware Attacks in the U.S.,"Ten people have been charged in malicious software attacks on tens of thousands of computers that caused more than $100 million in financial losses, authorities in the United States and Europe said on Thursday. The malware, which enabled criminals in Eastern Europe to take control remotely of infected computers and plunder victims’ bank accounts, focused on a Washington law firm, a Texas church, a California furniture business and a Mississippi casino, among others, the Justice Department said. The defendants are from six countries and several of them are awaiting prosecution in Europe. An 11th defendant in a related case was extradited to the United States from Bulgaria in 2016 and pleaded guilty last month in federal court in Pittsburgh. He is scheduled to be sentenced Aug. 30. A federal grand jury in Pittsburgh charged the 10 defendants with conspiracy to commit computer fraud, conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. The Justice Department has pursued multiple malware prosecutions against foreign hackers in recent years, but the new case stands out as a model of international collaboration, said Scott Brady, the United States attorney in Pittsburgh. Instead of seeking the immediate extradition of the 10 defendants — an often cumbersome process that can take years of negotiations, even in countries that have treaties with the United States — prosecutors plan to first bring charges against several of them in Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. “It represents a paradigm change in how we prosecute cybercrime,” Mr. Brady said in an interview before a news conference in The Hague. The investigation grew out of the Justice Department’s dismantling in 2016 of a network of computer servers known as Avalanche that hosted more than two dozen types of malware. “For the past three years, we have been unpeeling an onion, as it were, that is very challenging to investigate and identify,” Mr. Brady said. The malware at issue in the current court case infected 41,000 computers, relying on spam emails disguised as legitimate messages or invoices, officials said. Once opened, the emails enabled hackers operating from Europe to record keystrokes from the victims’ computers, steal login credentials for bank accounts and wire money out of the accounts. Mr. Brady said that prosecutors always seek to recover stolen money, but such an effort was especially challenging in international cases of cybercrime. “Proceeds were converted to bitcoin,” he said, “and without the private key, it is really hard to identify and access, let alone seize, those accounts.”",The New York Times
2019,100 Years of Memorial Day Commemorations,"at war The Times’s At War editor digs through the archives, looking at Memorial Day coverage dating back to World War I. You’re reading this week’s At War newsletter. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox every Friday. Email us at atwar@nytimes.com. This morning, At War published an account by Luke Ryan about the day he lost his best friend and three other teammates to a buried explosive in Kandahar Province. They were killed on Oct. 6, 2013, the day before the 12th anniversary of the American-led invasion of Afghanistan. Publishing this on the Friday before Memorial Day had me thinking about the ways in which the country has commemorated this holiday in the past. I dug through The Times’s archives, looking at coverage that immediately followed the end of American wars. I found the same language, the same calls for enduring peace and the same questions raised about the condition of service members after they return home — talking points that have been recycled for the last century. Below are some excerpts that stood out to me. Despite the repetition and the hollow promises, I still find a bit of comfort in these words. Maybe 100 years from now, they will actually sink in. President Woodrow Wilson’s Memorial Day address, published May 29, 1919 Our thoughts and purpose now are consecrated to the maintenance of the liberty of the world, and of the union of its people in a single comradeship of liberty and of right. It was for this that our men conscientiously offered their lives. They came to the field of battle with the high spirit and pure heart of crusaders. We must never forget the duty that their sacrifice has laid upon us of fulfilling their hopes and their purpose to the utmost. This, it seems to me, is the impressive lesson and inspiring mandate of the day. New York Times editorial, published May 30, 1946 The fact remains that the war which was still going on, in its Pacific phase, a year ago today cost the lives of nearly three hundred thousand young Americans, and we do owe these dead men, and those who were wounded, and those who are still crippled and disfigured, not only honor but thought. They suffered, as those who went before them in the First World War suffered, in the hope that the war in which they were engaged would be the last war. The dead of the earlier war might be bitter indeed if they could know how lightly the cause they defended was thrown away. The living, even though they do not regret the risks they took and the hardships they endured, even though they are proud because what they did they did in purity of heart, have had reason to be bitter, too. We must have no more such bitterness. We must not again give justification for it. We must safeguard the peace this time. We can show our gratitude to those who died, our sympathy for those who still mourn, only if we dedicate ourselves to this purpose. Tom Wicker’s report on veterans’ mental health after Vietnam, published May 27, 1975 Memorial Day is supposed to honor the dead of the nation’s wars but it also is a better time than most to give some thought to war’s living wreckage. … Dr. Chaim Shatan, a psychoanalyst at New York University who has worked closely with 145 Vietnam veterans, believes that specific and unique psychological hardships were imposed on them by the kind of war they fought. For one thing, he thinks, the public has “no idea of the isolation, the utter isolation that these men experienced.” … Dr. Shatan and others say the Veterans Administration, which provided good psychiatric services after World War II, has not been so alert to the problems of PVS [post-Vietnam syndrome]. Worse, the V.A. does not treat any disorder that occurs two years or more after discharge; and in many cases PVS takes more than two years to affect a veteran obviously enough to require treatment. The result is that many Vietnam veterans are not getting the help and services they need, although they may have been as badly wounded as many of those who suffered physical injuries. Stephen Kinzer’s dispatch from Dohuk, Iraq, where American troops commemorated Memorial Day, published May 28, 1991 As the sun set over this Kurdish city today, American soldiers gathered on the terrace of an abandoned hotel for perhaps the first Memorial Day barbecue ever held in northern Iraq. Supplies arrived late in the afternoon aboard a Blackhawk helicopter flown from an American base in Turkey. There were hot dogs and hamburgers with all the fixings, steaks in barbecue sauce, chili beans and corn, salad, soft drinks and chocolate cake for dessert. … About 90 American soldiers have been in Dohuk for the last week under an agreement negotiated by United States and Iraqi authorities. The Americans hope that their presence will persuade fearful Kurdish refugees to return to their homes here and in surrounding villages. The strategy is working so far. About a third of the estimated 300,000 local residents have made their way back from the mountain hide-outs and refugee camps to which they fled after an unsuccessful revolt against the rule of President Saddam Hussein. No one knows what will happen here once the Americans withdraw. That was the topic of much discussion at tonight’s barbecue.

2019,12 Killed in Rampage at Municipal Center in Virginia,"VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. — A municipal building in Virginia Beach, Va., was turned into a scene of carnage on Friday afternoon after a longtime public utilities employee began firing indiscriminately at his co-workers with a handgun, the authorities said, killing a dozen people and injuring several others before dying after an extended shootout with the police. It had been nearing closing time in an office offering some of the most mundane functions of city government, such as paying water bills and applying for building permits, when the employee, who was identified by the police on Saturday as DeWayne Craddock, began stalking through several floors firing at his colleagues, the authorities said. The loud bursts of gunfire sent workers scrambling and barricading their office doors. [Update: 12 Virginia Beach shooting victims identified.] Zand Bakhtiari, 28, who works on the first floor of the city building where the shooting happened, looked out his window about 4 p.m. and saw people screaming and running. “I thought they were running to the scene of a bad car accident,” he said in a telephone interview late Friday. At that point, he had not heard any gunfire. But right after that, his boss, who had just left, called in an order to shelter in place: There was an active shooter. Mr. Bakhtiari and others in his office shut the door and got down. He then heard 50 to 60 gunshots. “It was a lot of shots,” he said. Five or 10 minutes later, a police SWAT team came and led them out. [Virginia beach shooting suspect: Who is DeWayne Craddock?] The identities of the victims were not immediately released nor was the motive of the attack. One of those injured was a police officer, who was saved by his bulletproof vest, said Chief James A. Cervera of the Virginia Beach Police Department, who said at an evening news conference that the scene could “best be described as a war zone.” Bodies were found on all three floors of the building, the chief said. One of the deceased was discovered outside in a car. He called the shooting a “devastating incident” that “none of us want to be here talking about,” adding that it was “going to change the lives of a number of families in our city.” Chief Cervera said the gunman, whom he declined to name, was carrying a .45-caliber handgun, with several extended magazines. He had a suppressor on the weapon to muffle the sound, the chief said. The gunman was wounded after an exchange of fire with the police, who later issued first aid on him. But he succumbed to his injuries. The shooting took place shortly after 4 p.m. within the sprawling Virginia Beach Municipal Center, a campus of city offices and agencies, including the Police Department. The attack unfolded on multiple floors in Building No. 2, which includes offices for planning and public works, among others, and is adjacent to City Hall. At the scene, bystanders fled for safety and officers converged in large numbers. “This is the most devastating day in the history of Virginia Beach,” Mayor Bobby Dyer said at an evening news conference. “The people involved are our friends, co-workers, neighbors, colleagues,” he continued before his voice trailed off and he bowed his head. Dale T. Gauding, a spokesman for Sentara Healthcare, said five patients were taken to Sentara Virginia Beach General Hospital. By The New York Times Another patient at Sentara Princess Anne Hospital was being picked up by helicopter and transferred to a trauma center at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital, he said. Details on their conditions were not immediately available. “This day will not define Virginia Beach,” a City Council member, Aaron Rouse, said at the news conference. “We will show the strength of our city.” Another Council member, Barbara Henley, told The Virginian-Pilot that she had been pulling up to City Hall when she heard police sirens and saw police cars. After initially thinking it was an accident, she heard a male voice shout “Get down!” and saw people scattering. “I was scared to death,” she said. All over Virginia Beach, residents were trying to process such horror on what had been close to a normal week. “Pleasantville is no more,” said June P. Kates, a former teacher and resident of Virginia Beach who lives in a retirement community nearby. She said she been to the municipal center many times. “It’s so sad. It’s just so sad,” she said. “I just think it’s the saddest thing I can imagine.” Eerily, the police had scheduled a community workshop for Saturday morning on how to prepare for a mass shooting. The “active threat citizens defense” event had 36 people scheduled to attend, according to the department’s Facebook page. “Having to face an armed individual with bad intentions is every person’s worst nightmare. You can’t stop crazy, you can only respond to it,” said a brochure for the workshop published by the local ABC News affiliate. “You don’t prepare for something like this,” said Mayor Dyer. “It’s a nightmare no one wants to actually live through.” Nothing like this has happened in Virginia Beach in the 40 years that Guy King Tower, a City Council member and retired lawyer, has been living there. “Nothing remotely like it, certainly in my memory,” said Mr. Tower, who has been living in the city since the 1970s but just joined the council a month ago. He was at the municipal center early Friday afternoon, but left before the shooting. He said that Building 2 — where the shooting occurred — is connected by a tunnel to Building 1, which is the main administrative office. He said that in addition to a dominant Navy presence, the area also has Marine, Army and Air Force bases. “This is a military town, and people deal with the wages of war on a pretty regular basis,” Mr. Tower said. “There are a lot of people here who have had loved ones in harm’s way. But certainly a mass murder had never happened that I can recall.” Earlier on Friday, Wave Church, one of the largest evangelical churches in the area with about 6,000 members, hosted a blood drive. Steve Kelly, the pastor, hoped that some of the blood from the congregation might be used to help victims. “One of our staff, his sister-in-law was in the building, hiding under a desk, texting us to pray for her,” he said. “She is traumatized, but she wasn’t injured.” The Kempsville Mennonite Church was hosting a graduation celebration for its high school seniors on Friday evening as the chaos unfolded just a few minutes up the road. William Yoder, 28, was one of the few people there to have heard about the shooting, because members of their community do not have televisions and many do not have smartphones. “It’s semirural in this area,” Mr. Yoder said. “The civic center is pretty close to farmland, a few neighborhoods. Most times it is fairly quiet.” “It is pretty shocking,” he added. OpinionGregory Gibson Opinion",The New York Times

2019,"12 Pop, Rock and Jazz Concerts to Check Out in N.Y.C. This Weekend","Our guide to pop and rock shows and the best of live jazz happening this weekend and in the week ahead. BROKEN SOCIAL SCENE at Webster Hall (May 16-18, 7 p.m.). The past couple of years have felt like an extended class reunion for indie rock groups from the 2000s, with bands like LCD Soundsystem, Fleet Foxes and the Strokes staging their comebacks. This Canadian collective, whose members include the singer-songwriter Feist and Emily Haines of the synth-pop group Metric, have returned with more vigor than most, releasing a full-length album and two EPs since 2017, following a seven-year lull. At their three-night stand in this recently reopened East Village club, expect to hear warm, fuzzy, guitar-driven tracks from both ends of their career, from 2002’s “Anthems for a Seventeen-Year-Old Girl” to 2017’s “Stay Happy.” websterhall.com GOOD MUSIC FESTIVAL at Barclays Center (May 11, 8 p.m.). At this early Mother’s Day celebration, delegates from two generations of female-powered R&B will share the stage. One of the evening’s performers, Erykah Badu — also known by her creative aliases Medulla Oblongata, Sarah Bellum, Analog Girl in a Digital World and Lowdown Loretta Brown — won the Grammy award for best R&B album in 1997 with her breakout effort, “Baduizm.” Her co-headliner, the quasi-anonymous singer H.E.R., snagged the same honor in February for her self-titled debut, an album packed with throwback slow jams, like “Focus,” indebted to the neo-soul style that Badu pioneered.917-618-6100, barclayscenter.com J.I.D at Irving Plaza (May 12-13, 7 p.m.). This Atlanta-born rapper’s moniker riffs on the word “jittery,” which his grandmother used to describe him as a child. The descriptor is equally fitting for his music, which favors dizzying triple-time delivery — as heard on songs like last year’s “Off Deez,” in which he trades verses with his label boss, J. Cole. J.I.D’s opener at Irving Plaza is Saba, a Chicago-based rapper who demonstrated a knack for exquisite, affecting storytelling on his 2018 album, “Care for Me”; also on the bill is Mez, a rapper from Raleigh, N.C., who recently made his directorial debut with Cole’s “Middle Child” video.212-777-6800, mercuryeastpresents.com NANA GRIZOL at Trans-Pecos (May 10, 8 p.m.). For more than a decade, this folk-punk band from Athens, Ga., has scrunched ambitious theses into charmingly earnest tracks. On their most recent effort, 2017’s “Ursa Minor,” the group’s frontman and primary lyricist Theo Hilton tackled subjects including gentrification and displacement (“Mississippi Swells”) and growing up queer in the South (“Photos From When We Were Young”). At this club in Ridgewood, Queens, they will receive support from, among others, Loamlands — an Americana group helmed by Kym Register, who sings about L.G.B.T.Q. issues with a warm Carolina twang on songs like “Little River.” thetranspecos.com THE WHO at Madison Square Garden (May 13, 7:30 p.m.). Fans of this British Invasion band should make their way to Midtown on Monday night to see them perform, possibly for the final time: Crossing the half-century mark in 2014 and down to two members from the original lineup, the group has hinted that their current tour may be their last. This go-round, Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey have a 52-piece orchestra in tow, poised to bring new life to their older material, including their classic anthem “Baba O’Riley.” They may also debut new material from a studio album — their first since “Endless Wire” from 2006 — due out later this year.212-465-6000, msg.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] XIU XIU at Le Poisson Rouge (May 12, 8 p.m.). Don’t expect a relaxing musical encounter with this experimental act. For nearly two decades, the duo of Angela Seo and Jamie Stewart have made music to barrage the senses. The group self-consciously takes pastiche to the extreme, drawing from a broad mix of influences that ranges from East to West, the 1950s to now and mainstream to experimental; released in February, their latest album, “Girl With Basket of Fruit,” is littered with tracks titled as chaotically as their contents demand, including “Pumpkin Attack on Mommy and Daddy” and “Scisssssssors.” On Sunday, they will perform with assistance from Thor Harris and Christopher Pravdica of Swans.lpr.com OLIVIA HORN JOHN ESCREET at the Jazz Gallery (May 11, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). The music of this keyboardist and composer is concerned with questions of sound and texture, density and motion. He allows those interests to lead him down a lot of different paths. Last year Escreet released “Learn to Live,” one of the more compelling electro-fusion records in recent memory. But he’s also fond of restless, freely improvised excursions, and that’s likely what is on the bill here, when he performs with two primo avant-garde improvisers: the saxophonist Evan Parker and the drummer Ches Smith.646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nyc NICOLE MITCHELL at the Stone (May 14-18, 8:30 p.m.). Mitchell, a flutist who was recently selected to head the University of Pittsburgh’s prestigious jazz program, has friends in many high places. One of the most esteemed performers and composers on the jazz avant-garde, she will gather a different group of collaborators every night during this five-day run. Highlights will include the trio appearing on Tuesday, with Val Jeanty on electronics and Chad Taylor on drums; Mitchell’s team-up with the Matthew Shipp Trio on Wednesday; and a group she’s calling Funkish — with André Lassalle, known as Dre Glo, on guitar, Jared Nickerson on bass and Calvin Gantt doing spoken word — on May 18.thestonenyc.com DAVID MURRAY WITH SAUL WILLIAMS at Birdland (through May 11, 8:30 and 11 p.m.). Among the most prolific tenor saxophonists of his time, Murray, 64, is always chasing after the next big idea. But he knows a good thing when he’s got it, so he has spent the past few years deepening his creative relationship with Saul Williams, a poet whose masterful volatility and political acumen make an excellent match for Murray’s incendiary improvising style. Here Williams joins Murray as he helms a quartet featuring excellent younger musicians: the pianist David Bryant, the bassist Rashaan Carter and the drummer Nasheet Waits.212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com JEREMY PELT at Jazz Standard (May 9-12, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Pelt’s trumpet tone can wander into the mist during a ballad, then come roaring out with a scorching solo when the energy rises. He spends a lot of time somewhere in between those two places on “The Rodin Suite,” a five-part work that dominates his most recent album, “Jeremy Pelt the Artist,” which came out earlier this year. While his nominal inspiration was the sculptures of Auguste Rodin, the musical influences are at least as apparent — particularly the 1970s fusion records of Herbie Hancock and Miles Davis. This weekend he appears with most members of the band that played on the album: Victor Gould on piano, Alex Wintz on guitar, Chien Chien Lu on vibraphone and marimba, Corcoran Holt on bass, Allan Mednard on drums and Ismel Wignall on percussion. 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com TERRAZA BIG BAND at Dizzy’s Club (May 13, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). This band’s natural home is Terraza 7, an intimate club in Queens where the 18-piece group has held down a monthly residency for the past four years, developing a repertoire of soaring, self-propelling original compositions and a tight group rapport. But on Monday they will venture into Manhattan to celebrate the release of their debut album at Dizzy’s. So unified has this band become that they recorded the entire record — an impressive document, featuring nine complex, splendidly woven tunes — in a single day at the recording studio. The album’s title? “One Day Wonder.”212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys BEN WENDEL at the Village Vanguard (May 14-19, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.). With his technical fluency, strategic melodic thinking and cleanly dusted tone, Wendel has become an idol to an entire generation of young tenor saxophone students. He’s perhaps best known for his work in the contemporary fusion band Kneebody, which released a new EP last week, but at the Vanguard this coming week, Wendel appears with the band from his most recent solo album, “The Seasons,” which collects 12 originals devoted to the months of the year. That group includes Gilad Hekselman on guitar, Aaron Parks on piano, Matt Brewer on bass and Eric Harland on drums.212-255-4037, villagevanguard.comGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO",The New York Times
2019,"12 Pop, Rock and Jazz Concerts to Check Out in N.Y.C. This Weekend","Our guide to pop and rock shows and the best of live jazz happening this weekend and in the week ahead. GEORGE CLINTON & PARLIAMENT FUNKADELIC at Rumsey Playfield (June 4, 6 p.m.). After more than a half-century in the music industry, Clinton, an Afro-futurist pioneer, is ready to hang up his bedazzled hat. With Parliament Funkadelic, an umbrella for the slew of musicians spinning through his orbit — who also make up two discrete sister groups, Parliament and Funkadelic — Clinton has departed on a “One Nation Under a Groove” farewell tour, named for the 1978 Funkadelic album that marked their commercial breakthrough. Proceeds from their stop in Central Park, at which their New Orleans-based funk disciples Galactic and others will also perform, will support SummerStage’s free seasonal programming.212-360-1399, cityparksfoundation.org THE GOVERNORS BALL MUSIC FESTIVAL at Randalls Island Park (May 31-June 2). New York real estate is some of the least hospitable to festival promoters; with Panorama on hiatus in 2019 and the Meadows dormant for the second year in a row, Governors Ball stands as the city’s sole major music festival this summer. As such, this iteration will feature some of the biggest names across a range of genres, including country-pop’s reigning queen Kacey Musgraves; the R&B chanteuses Jorja Smith and SZA; the rappers Vince Staples, Sheck Wes and Tyler, the Creator; and indie rockers like the Strokes and Mitski. Single-day general admission tickets remain available for all three dates, as do three-day passes.governorsballmusicfestival.com GLEN HANSARD at Beacon Theater (June 1, 8 p.m.). Though he is perhaps best known for his appearance in the Oscar-winning film “Once,” this Irish singer-songwriter’s discography is much denser than his filmography. Since the 1990s, he has helmed the Dublin-based folk-rock group the Frames, and, as the Swell Season, recorded with his “Once” co-star Marketa Irglova. Hansard is also an active solo artist whose most recent effort came out in April. Titled “This Wild Willing,” it sees him breaking from the restrained balladry of previous releases and experimenting with a wider range of musical textures, with help from the Iranian-born Khoshravesh brothers and a suite of familiar collaborators.212-465-6000, msg.com HOT 97 SUMMER JAM at MetLife Stadium (June 2, 6:30 p.m.). While Governors Ball draws crowds to the east of Manhattan throughout the weekend, a star-studded lineup across the Hudson River will pull some music lovers in the opposite direction on Sunday. As one of the first formatted hip-hop stations in the country, Hot 97 has been a distinctly New York institution since the early ’90s, when it first started hosting its annual Summer Jam. This year’s performers include Cardi B, the Bronx-born rapper behind ubiquitous hits like “Bodak Yellow” and “I Like It,” and her husband’s Atlanta-based trap group, Migos. Other notable names on the bill include Philadelphia’s Meek Mill and Houston’s Megan Thee Stallion.800-745-3000, metlifestadium.com LION BABE at Industry City (June 5, 7 p.m.). This electro-R&B outfit’s performance will kick off City Farm’s Summer Series, a lineup of outdoor music events at this commercial space in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, through September. This set also serves as an another kind of beginning for the duo, which comprises the producer and D.J. Lucas Goodman and the singer Jillian Hervey: It’s their first on the United States tour for their latest album, “Cosmic Wind.” From that record the single “Western World” feels particularly fit to herald the arrival of summer, with its deep-set bass groove and laid-back vocals that waft like a warm breeze.cityfarmpresents.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] MEMPHIS MINNIE: IN SEARCH OF THE HOODOO LADY at Waterfront Plaza at Brookfield Place (June 1, 6:30 p.m.). Sister Rosetta Tharpe, the trailblazing singer and guitarist, was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame just last year; the tardiness of this recognition signifies the extent to which black women’s contributions to rock have been overlooked. At this Lower Manhattan waterfront spot, the New York Guitar Festival will pay tribute to another underrecognized figure: Memphis Minnie, one of the first blues artists to go electric, and an influence on Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters. Performers at this free concert include the indie-turned-soul singer Nicole Atkins, the Canadian folk artist Kaia Kater, and Rachael & Vilray, a jazz duo featuring Lake Street Dive’s Rachael Price.212-417-2414, bfplny.comOLIVIA HORN JOANNE BRACKEEN AND LONNIE PLAXICO at Mezzrow (May 31-June 1, 7:30 and 9 p.m.). Brackeen is an inventive pianist and a vastly underrated composer, whose coarse but exuberant harmonies and irrepressible rhythmic intensity strike a special balance between the influences of Bill Evans, McCoy Tyner and Thelonious Monk. A recently inducted National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master, she performs here with Plaxico, a bassist whose flexibility will come in handy (over a more-than-30-year career he’s proved himself to be comfortable at the crossroads of avant-funk, hard-bop and Afro-Caribbean jazz). 646-476-4346, mezzrow.com RAVI COLTRANE at Birdland (June 4-8, 8:30 and 11 p.m.). A saxophonist of lissome grace, Coltrane has a talent for warping and curling his notes without sacrificing clarity — as if showing you a message that can only be read properly when seen through curved glass. At Birdland, he’ll be joined by a revolving cast of musicians in the prime of their careers: the pianist David Virelles, the bassist Dezron Douglas and the drummer Johnathan Blake. Not all of them will play at each show: The first night will feature just saxophone, piano and bass, and others will feature saxophone, piano and drums with no bass. 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com NICK DUNSTON at Roulette (June 4, 8 p.m.). Dunston is a young bassist with hungry ears and a commanding but wide-open style. Lately he’s become an indispensable player on the New York avant-garde, playing with the likes of Marc Ribot, the esteemed downtown guitarist, and Ches Smith, the top-flight drummer. For the past year Dunston has been a Van Lier fellow at Roulette; as part of that program he has written a multipart suite titled “La Operación,” an abstract meditation on issues of post-colonialism, sexism and necropolitics in late-20th-century Puerto Rico. He will debut the composition here, joined by the soprano vocalist Stephanie Lamprea, the alto saxophonists David Leon and Noah Becker, the fellow bassist Ben Rolston, and the percussionists Lesley Mok and Stephen Boegehold.917-267-0368, roulette.org MARK GUILIANA at the Village Vanguard (through June 2, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.). Last month, Guiliana, a drummer, released “Beat Music! Beat Music! Beat Music!” — the product of a yearslong foray into the nexus between live performance and electronic production. Using synthesizers, drum machines and acoustic instruments, he creates giddy music landing somewhere between the left-field hip-hop of the early 2000s and the 8-bit sounds of an Atari soundtrack. But Guiliana, who has brought his genre-agnostic approach to a vast range of projects (with the likes of David Bowie, Meshell Ndegeocello and Brad Mehldau), is equally dedicated to his so-called Jazz Quartet, a group of acoustic musicians comprising the saxophonist Jason Rigby, the pianist Shai Maestro and the bassist Chris Morrissey. Though its sonic palette is different, the quartet shares some head-bobbing proclivities with Guiliana’s “Beat Music” project. 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com KIRK LIGHTSEY at Nublu 151 (June 5, 8 p.m.). An 82-year-old pianist with a diaphanous harmonic sensibility and a redoubtable résumé (he toured and/or recorded with Dexter Gordon, Chet Baker and Woody Shaw, among countless others), Lightsey is now based in Paris and seldom performs on this side of the Atlantic. But on Wednesday he will make a rare New York appearance, playing a tribute concert to the trumpeter Jerry Gonzalez, his former collaborator, who died last year after a celebrated career at the intersection of Puerto Rican folklore, Afro-Cuban music and classic jazz, and who would have turned 70 on the night of this show. Lightsey will be at the helm of a quintet that includes Itai Kriss on flute, Santi Debriano on bass, Daniel Dor on drums and David Balilty on percussion. nublu.net JOEL ROSS’S GOOD VIBES at Jazz Standard (June 4-5, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Even before releasing a standout debut album earlier this month, Ross was already the most-chatted-about young musician in New York. Possessed of a bracingly forthright attack and a broad historic awareness, this 23-year-old vibraphonist can pull together elements of 1960s post-bop, 1990s neoconservatism and nouveau hip-hop fusion without forcing the issue. At Jazz Standard he will perform music from the new album, “Kingmaker,” with Immanuel Wilkins on alto saxophone, Jeremy Corren on piano, Kanoa Mendenhall on bass and Jeremy Dutton on drums.212-576-2232, jazzstandard.comGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO",The New York Times
2019,"12 Pop, Rock and Jazz Concerts to Check Out in N.Y.C. This Weekend","Our guide to pop and rock shows and the best of live jazz happening this weekend and in the week ahead. COMBO CHIMBITA at Elsewhere (May 4, 6 p.m.). This New York-based band’s trippy, experimental music is broadly inspired by the global south. Tapping into their Colombian roots, the four-piece harness the sounds and rhythms of cumbia and a plethora of other Afro-Latinx genres, like funana, kompa, salsa and reggae, to create dizzying, energetic songs that “imagine a future through music,” the bandmember Niño Lento said. The group’s new record, “Ahomale” — described as a “catharsis of divine feminine force” — is now out; they perform at this club in Bushwick, Brooklyn, on Saturday. elsewherebrooklyn.com IMOGEN HEAP at the Town Hall (May 7-8, 8 p.m.). In recent years, this pop pioneer’s celebrity has been magnified by those she’s inspired: Taylor Swift’s dream of collaborating with this British multi-hyphenate was realized on her 2014 track “Clean,” and Ariana Grande interpolated her song “Goodnight and Go” on last year’s “Sweetener.” Heap’s own work has established her as an innovator in musical technology: She has developed new instruments for gestural composition, and is a noted proponent of using blockchain to release music. This two-night engagement is part of a 40-city run, which includes the artist’s first North American tour in nine years. 212-997-6661, thetownhall.org ANOUSHKA SHANKAR at the Town Hall (May 5, 7 p.m.). A daughter of the sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar and the half sister of the singer-songwriter Norah Jones, this London-born composer comes by her musical gift honestly. Playing the instrument that her father famously helped introduce to Western popular culture in the 1960s, Shankar brings Indian classical music together with elements of pop, flamenco and electronic music; her most recent release, “Reflections,” is a greatest-hits compilation spanning her two-decade career. This performance in Midtown is part of a North American tour supporting the album. Shankar will perform its highlights, as well as music from her score for the Indian silent film “Shiraz.” 212-997-6661, thetownhall.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] JORJA SMITH AND KALI UCHIS at Madison Square Garden (May 3, 7:30 p.m.). This double bill is shared by two women whose soulful R&B vocals have earned each comparisons to Amy Winehouse. Smith’s rapid ascent from a Starbucks barista to a Grammy-nominated singer was aided by a feature on Drake’s 2017 album “More Life,” and cemented by “On My Mind,” her clubby garage track that gained traction later the same year. Uchis, the daughter of Colombian immigrants, also rose from humble origins, which fueled the anti-capitalist vitriol of her song “Your Teeth in My Neck.” Both women released standout albums last spring; expect them to perform highlights — including “Tyrant,” the Uchis track on which Smith features. 212-465-6000, msg.com SONGS FOR OUR PLANET at Brooklyn Bowl (May 8, 7:30 p.m.). The artists on the bill for this benefit concert make earthy, folk-influenced music — the sort that evokes campfires and mountain vistas. Fittingly, the showcase will support 1% for the Planet, an organization that certifies contributions to environmental nonprofits. The lineup includes the Lone Bellow, an Americana group from Nashville by way of Brooklyn, known for close-knit, three-part harmonies and emotionally invigorating performances. Hiss Golden Messenger — the country-rock group spearheaded by the songwriter M. C. Taylor, who delicately navigates matters of family and faith on songs like “Biloxi” — will also perform. 718-963-3369, brooklynbowl.com 37D03D at Pioneer Works (May 3-4, 7 p.m.). Headed up by Justin Vernon and members of the National, this musical collective and digital platform is committed to working collaboratively and keeping their events sponsor-free. Newly renamed and relocated from Berlin, their festival — formerly known as PEOPLE Festival — in Red Hook, Brooklyn, is the culmination of a five-day residency, during which members produce new work. Though the group’s egalitarian ethos generally prohibits any one act from being deemed a “headliner,” Pioneer Works has singled out as tentpoles performances by Big Red Machine (the duo of Vernon and Aaron Dessner of the National) and Boys Noize. pioneerworks.org OLIVIA HORN ‘AN AFTERNOON WITH MARY LOU WILLIAMS’ at Our Lady of Lourdes School (May 5, 4 p.m.). Williams was a brilliantly syncretic pianist whose self-possessed, physical style spanned swing, stride, gospel and bebop. She was also a devoted proponent of fellow musicians; in short, the breadth of her impact on jazz — in New York and beyond — is hard to estimate. In the later decades of her life, Williams became a devout Catholic, and Our Lady of Lourdes became a second home. This three-part celebration of her life includes a screening of the documentary “Mary Lou Williams: The Lady Who Swings the Band”; a conversation with the film’s director, Carol Bash; and finally a performance by the fine octogenarian pianist Bertha Hope’s hard-bop quartet. harlemrenaissance.org STEPHAN CRUMP’S ROSETTA TRIO at Birdland Theater (May 3-4, 9:45 p.m.). Crump plays the bass with an effortless balance of molten flow and forceful power. For a listener, the result is another kind of healthy tension: between dynamic uncertainty and deep reassurance. Crump is most recognized for his work alongside the pianist Vijay Iyer, but he is also a quietly industrious bandleader, with a range of his own projects. Earlier this year his Rosetta Trio — a group that grew from the trauma of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and features Liberty Ellman on acoustic guitar and Jamie Fox on electric guitar — released an enchanting album, “Outliers.” They will perform selections from that record here. 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com SATOKO FUJII at the Stone (through May 4, 8:30 p.m.). There is a winning clarity to Fujii’s playing, always guided by an equal focus on melody and texture. Last year, celebrating her 60th birthday, this pianist released a different album every month, each with its own identity. This week at the Stone, she is bringing her broad-minded approach to bear, playing on Thursday with the trumpeter Kappa Maki, the electronics artist Ikue Mori and the drummer Chris Corsano; on Friday with the bassist Chris Tordini and the drummer Devin Gray; and on Saturday with Maki, the keyboardist Al Martin and the drummer Andrew Drury. thestonenyc.com ‘MACHITO & THE IMPACT OF THE AFRO-CUBANS AT 80’ at Hostos Center for the Arts & Culture (May 2-4). In the middle of the 20th century, Manhattan’s Palladium Ballroom was the cradle of Latin-music innovation in the United States, and its most esteemed statesman was Francisco Grillo, the singer, percussionist and bandleader known as Machito. This three-day festival at the Bronx’s Hostos Center celebrates his life and legacy with a mix of performances, film screenings and educational programming. Things come to a head on Saturday: A family concert featuring the drummer, percussionist and educator Bobby Sanabria kicks things off at 11 a.m.; Mario Grillo, a son of Machito, will lead a workshop at 1:30 p.m.; and the Machito Orchestra will close the festival with a concert at 8 p.m. 718-518-4455, hostos.cuny.edu/culturearts BOBBY WATSON QUARTET at Smoke (May 2-4, 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m.). An alto saxophonist, Watson was part of Art Blakey’s epochal Jazz Messengers in the late 1970s and early ’80s, and in the years since he has carried on the famed drummer’s legacy as a practitioner of blues-rooted, straight-ahead jazz and a mentor to younger musicians. This weekend Watson brings his bubbling tone and slicing swing feel to Smoke, joined by the rising pianist Victor Gould, the bassist Curtis Lundy and the drummer Victor Jones. 212-864-6662, smokejazz.com DENNY ZEITLIN at Mezzrow (through May 4, 7:30 and 9 p.m.). There’s a happy blend of combustion and concision in the music of Zeitlin’s longstanding piano trio, which features the fabled bassist Buster Williams and the drummer Matt Wilson. Zeitlin has been stretching this classic format since the 1960s, when he first began making engrossing, harmonically striated, propulsive albums for Columbia Records. Criminally under-recognized, he has recently found a welcoming home at Mezzrow, where the 81-year-old musician (and clinical-psychiatry professor) now appears somewhat regularly. 646-476-4346, mezzrow.com GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO",The New York Times
2019,"12 Pop, Rock and Jazz Concerts to Check Out in N.Y.C. This Weekend","Our guide to pop and rock shows and the best of live jazz happening this weekend and in the week ahead. INNERVISIONS NEW YORK at Knockdown Center (May 17, 9 p.m.). This heady Berlin-based electronic imprint is a platform for the exacting curatorial vision of its founders, the producers Steffen Berkhahn (a.k.a. Dixon) and Kristian Rädle and Frank Wiedemann (of the duo Âme). In addition to managing a handful of releases each year, Innervisions travels the globe to produce unique musical experiences. The first stateside event of 2019 — which will set up shop in Maspeth, Queens, on Friday — is an eight-hour marathon showcase featuring performances by Dixon and Âme, as well as D.J. Koze, whose most recent album, “Knock Knock,” was one of the biggest critical hits of 2018. The French D.J. Jennifer Cardini and the Portuguese act Trikk will also appear.718-489-6285, knockdown.center JUICE WRLD at Hammerstein Ballroom (May 20-21, 8 p.m.). In many ways, this Chicago native, born Jarad Higgins, is the archetype of a SoundCloud rapper. At age 19, he signed with Interscope for a reported $3 million on the strength of a few self-produced tracks posted to the streaming site, including “Lucid Dreams.” Like many of hip-hop’s emerging stars, Higgins pledges little loyalty to any one genre; his songs bear the influence of his rap forebears as well as emo and pop-punk groups like Fall Out Boy. His recent sophomore album, “Death Race for Love,” debuted in the top slot of the Billboard 200; he will promote it during this two-night run in Midtown.646-293-1080, mc34.com PASSION PIT at Pier 17 (May 19 and 21, 7:30 p.m.). The release of “Manners” in 2009 introduced Michael Angelakos, the primary creative force behind this group, as a singular voice in glitch pop. Ten years later, Angelakos has finally come to appreciate the album that launched his career: “It takes time to fully enjoy records after you go through all that with them,” he recently told Billboard. He’s celebrating a decade of “Manners” with an 18-city tour, stopping at South Street Seaport on Sunday and Tuesday. Expect to hear the album’s biggest hits, like “Sleepyhead” and “Little Secrets.” Tuesday night’s show is sold out, but tickets are available on the secondary market.212-571-0910, pier17ny.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] RADIATOR HOSPITAL at Trans-Pecos (May 19, 8 p.m.). These mainstays of Philadelphia’s robust indie scene have spent the better part of a decade churning out pop-punk gems alongside offshoots from the same community — like Allison and Katie Crutchfield and Japanese Breakfast — who have gone on to grab larger, national spotlights. Radiator Hospital’s best-known songs, like “Cut Your Bangs” and “Our Song,” were recorded by a quartet, but with the new album, “Music for Daydreaming,” the project has been dialed back, honoring its roots as the solo endeavor of the singer-songwriter Sam Cook-Parrott. With Cook-Parrott playing every instrument himself, the record retains the scrappy charm and tender earnestness of previous releases.thetranspecos.com RODRIGO Y GABRIELA at Beacon Theater (May 18, 8 p.m.). For two decades, restless exploration has defined the life and music of this acoustic guitar duo. Weary of the Mexican metal scene where they got their start, the pair moved to Dublin on 1999 and took to busking on the streets; seven years later, their self-titled sophomore album debuted atop the Irish charts. Stylistically, it traversed flamenco, jazz and metal, and paid tribute to their rock influences with Metallica and Led Zeppelin covers. Their most recent album, “Mettavolution,” centers on another rock standard: “Echoes,” Pink Floyd’s psychedelic epic from 1971. On Saturday night at the Beacon, expect Rodrigo y Gabriela to play their version of the song, as well as other “Mettavolution” tracks.212-465-6000, beacontheatre.com TAMARYN at Littlefield (May 18, 10 p.m.). Witchiness is in vogue, and this New Zealand-born singer’s new album, “Dreaming the Dark,” is perfectly calibrated to appeal to the sensibilities of the modern mystic. Its creation was partly inspired by the collective therapeutic rituals she observed as child, and its visuals — like the campy, 1980s-prom-indebted montage in the video for “Angels of Sweat” — borrow from tarot iconography. Tamaryn’s musical influences include guitar-wielding goths (Nine Inch Nails, the Cure) and pop auteurs (Kanye West, Kate Bush); on this new record, she pushes her terrifically emotive voice to the foreground, suggesting her increasing devotion to the pop pantheon.littlefieldnyc.com OLIVIA HORN JOEY DEFRANCESCO WITH THE JAZZ AT LINCOLN CENTER ORCHESTRA at Rose Theater (May 17-18, 8 p.m.). DeFrancesco, a virtuoso soul-jazz organist, recently put out an album in a more mystical mode, “In the Key of the Universe” — inching closer than ever to the late-career sound of Dr. Lonnie Smith, jazz’s other premier organ player. The record features a few entrancing tunes recorded with Pharoah Sanders as a special guest, and it affirms DeFrancesco’s versatility and sensitivity as a bandleader. More evidence of that adaptability will be on display at Jazz at Lincoln Center, where he will be joined by the resident orchestra, performing selections from Duke Ellington’s “New Orleans Suite” and Oliver Nelson’s arrangement of “Peter and the Wolf” — two of the rare works in jazz that blend the Hammond B3 with a full orchestra. 212-721-6500, jazz.org THE GIL EVANS PROJECT at Jazz Standard (May 16-19, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Evans is the rare composer whose music doesn’t need any refurbishing or newfangled interpretation to sound contemporary. Ryan Truesdell, a young composer and arranger, has made it his mission to prove that point: He goes directly to Evans’s original big-band manuscripts — including some charts that haven’t been played in over 50 years — and restages them to full effect. On Thursday and Friday, Truesdell’s Gil Evans Project ensemble will perform selections from Evans’s tenure with the Claude Thornhill Orchestra in the 1940s. On Saturday and Sunday, the focus will fall on Evans’s better-known work of the 1950s and ’60s. 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com KATE GENTILE at iBeam (May 21-23, 8:30 p.m.). This drummer makes music that’s equally informed by doom metal, noise, math rock and heady contemporary jazz. Her 2017 album, “Mannequins,” arrived without much fanfare, but its coiled, seething compositions and tight execution announced Gentile as a young bandleader to watch. At this three-night run, she will debut three sets of new music, with pieces that interact across the suites. Some tunes are written as shadowy replicas of pieces that appear in a different set; others are electrified continuations of the acoustic music played in a prior suite. Gentile will tackle this ambitious music with her core ensemble: Jeremy Viner on clarinets and tenor saxophone, Matt Mitchell on piano and Prophet 6 synthesizer, and Kim Cass on acoustic and electric basses. ibeambrooklyn.com JOE LOVANO’S TRIO TAPESTRY at the Village Vanguard (May 21-26, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.). There’s a quiet bravado to Lovano’s playing — on both tenor and soprano saxophones — that allows him to make a home in almost any jazz style, from the freely improvised to the rigorously composed. The music of this new trio, featuring the pianist Marilyn Crispell and the drummer Carmen Castaldi, lands somewhere in the middle, but it leans toward the open-ended. Melodies glide and taper, textures rise and shudder and dissipate. At the Vanguard, the trio will draw selections from a fine debut album, “Trio Tapestry,” recently out on ECM. 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com GUY MINTUS at National Sawdust (May 19, 7 p.m.). Mintus, a 27-year-old pianist who hails from Israel, pours together a mixed brew of influences — Arabic maqam, Jewish folk song, Eastern European dance rhythms and, especially, classic hard bop — with such ebullient grace that you’d think they all originated in the very same place. At National Sawdust, he will play selections from his new album, “Connecting the Dots,” joined by the bassist Dan Pappalardo and the drummer Philippe Lemm. 646-779-8455, nationalsawdust.org BRANDEE YOUNGER AND FRIENDS at the Blue Note (May 21-22, 8 and 10:30 p.m.). Younger, a harpist, recorded the tracks on “Soul Awakening” back in 2012. But she was well ahead of the curve; the enchanting record, which is set for release next month, contains a mix of mystic inquisition and breezy swagger that feels wholly au courant in 2019. Apparently Beyoncé agrees: The audio from a performance Younger gave in 2013, for an NPR Field Recordings video, was recently featured in “Homecoming,” Beyoncé’s smash-hit Coachella documentary. At the Blue Note, Younger will appear over two nights with a small group, as well as a couple special guests: On Tuesday, she’ll be joined by the saxophonist Ravi Coltrane, and on Wednesday by the trumpeter Nicholas Payton. 212-475-8592, bluenote.net GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO",The New York Times
2019,"12 Pop, Rock and Jazz Concerts to Check Out in N.Y.C. This Weekend","Our guide to pop and rock shows and the best of live jazz happening this weekend and in the week ahead. BATHS at Mercury Lounge (May 29, 9:30 p.m.). Will Wiesenfeld, the L.A.-based musician behind this hypnotic electronic music project, draws inspiration from fiction: “I’m not as emotive with real world things as I am when I’m neck deep in anime, video games, books or comics,” he said in a press statement in 2017. It’s fitting, then, that one of Wiesenfeld’s most memorable songs is “Dream Daddy,” a lush, layered pop track that serves as the theme song for a video game of the same name. Selections like “Yeoman” from his most recent album, “Romaplasm” — with their ample whimsy and chiptune aesthetic — could easily be retrofitted for the same purpose.212-260-4700, mercuryeastpresents.com FANTASTIC NEGRITO at Brooklyn Bowl (May 30, 8 p.m.). Before adopting his current stage name, this singer was just Xavier, a mononymous performer with a million-dollar Interscope deal that resulted in a faltering debut album. In his lifetime, the 51-year-old Californian, born Xavier Dphrepaulezz, has undergone a number of rebirths: He also fronted a punk group called Blood Sugar X and performed under the moniker Chocolate Butterfly. Dphrepaulezz’s most recent renaissance arrived when his song “Lost in a Crowd” won NPR’s Tiny Desk Contest in 2015. The victory gave new visibility to his gritty take on the blues, best heard on songs like “An Honest Man.”718-963-3369, brooklynbowl.com FREE CAKE FOR EVERY CREATURE at Trans-Pecos (May 30, 8 p.m.). From their 2013 debut album to last year’s “The Bluest Star,” this Philadelphia indie-pop group’s songs about adulting, loving and mourning bristle with the quiet intensity of stolen glances in crowded rooms. In March, their frontwoman, Katie Bennett, announced that the group was ready to call it quits; they’ll perform the first of two farewell concerts in Ridgewood, Queens, on Thursday (the second is slated for May 31 in their hometown). Fans can expect to hear their most popular songs, like “All You Gotta Be When You’re 23 Is Yourself,” live for the last time.thetranspecos.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] THE MASQUERADERS at Littlefield (May 24, 9 p.m.). Back in 1968, this soul group from Dallas landed a minor hit with “I Ain’t Got to Love Nobody Else,” a tender ballad drenched in rich vocal harmony. While they continued recording through the 1970s, releasing two albums on Isaac Hayes’s Hot Buttered Soul imprint, the group was largely dormant after 1980. Then in 2017, they staged a comeback through a brief run on “America’s Got Talent.” The group’s appearance in Brooklyn on Friday night comes 50 years after their last performance in New York — at the Apollo Theater in 1969.littlefieldnyc.com XENIA RUBINOS at Murmrr Ballroom (May 29, 7 p.m.). On paper, this Brooklynite’s music seems dizzyingly multifaceted: She fuses elements of hip-hop, R&B, jazz, funk, soul and indie rock, while also nodding to Latin rhythms, inspired by her Cuban and Puerto Rican heritage. But the singer is always looking for ways to unify these many textures; on her most recent album, “Black Terry Cat,” she corrals her diverse influences in service of potent questions about race, labor and American identity. One highlight, “Mexican Chef,” delivers the memorable lyric “Brown raised America in place of its mom.” Rubinos’s performance at this ballroom inside a Brooklyn temple will follow a panel discussion about the music-streaming economy, presented by the Baffler.murmrr.com AARON TVEIT at Webster Hall (May 29, 9 p.m.). This singer and actor gracefully navigates between stage and screen. Known for roles like Gabe Goodman in Broadway’s “Next to Normal” and Enjolras in the 2012 film adaptation of “Les Miserables,” Tveit, a native of New York’s Hudson Valley, wields a titanic tenor. Unlike many fellow Broadway stars, he has yet to leverage his stage career as a segue into original music. At jukebox-style concerts like the one on Wednesday, he typically performs a mix of pop covers and show tunes, as heard on “The Radio in My Head,” his live solo album from 2013, which features songs by Joni Mitchell and Taylor Swift, and from “Rent” and “Carousel.”websterhall.com OLIVIA HORN URI CAINE at the Stone (May 28-June 1, 8:30 p.m.). Prodigiously gifted and bursting with vigor at the piano, Caine is the uncommon player who sounds just as deft on a deep groove, a classical minuet or a freely improvised odyssey. Highlights of his upcoming week at the Stone include a solo performance on Thursday, drawing from the second book in John Zorn’s epic “Masada” series, and his appearance on May 31 with a tango-inspired band featuring Mark Feldman on violin, Agustin Uriburu on cello, Julien Labro on bandoneon and Pablo Aslan on bass. thestonenyc.com BRIAN KROCK’S LIDDLE AND CAROLINE DAVIS’S ALULA at Nublu 151 (May 30, 8 p.m.). Krock and Davis are two rising alto saxophonists with expansive notions of what it means to write instrumental music for small ensembles, and both have excellent new albums out: Krock with Liddle, a quintet inspired by metal, European modernism and M-Base avant-funk, and Davis with Alula, a trio centered on interplay between her horn and a battery of analog synthesizers. And as it happens, each group features a different side of Matt Mitchell: He plays synths with Alula, and piano and Fender Rhodes with Liddle. nublu.net JASON PALMER at the InterContinental New York Barclay (May 23-24, 7 p.m.). A coolly exploratory trumpeter, with a great sensitivity across the full range of his horn, Palmer here takes charge of an all-star ensemble featuring the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner, the vibraphonist Joel Ross, the bassist Edward Perez and the drummer Kendrick Scott. The plan is that these shows on Thursday and Friday, presented in the InterContinental’s Presidential Suite with hors d’oeuvres served throughout, will be made into a live album; it will be Palmer’s second funded by Giant Step Arts, a new nonprofit organization that makes quality live recordings of contemporary jazz. The resplendent suite will provide a fitting backdrop to a performance of Palmer’s latest original music, inspired by the notorious robbery at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, which was once a ritzy private home. 212-906-3143, intercontinentalnybarclay.com KOJO ODU RONEY EXPERIENCE at the Blue Note (May 24-25, 12:30 a.m.). After sets on Friday and Saturday night from Chris Dave — the game-changing drummer whose footprints are all over the present-day sounds of pop, hip-hop and jazz — come late-night performances from a head-turning drummer one-third his age. The son of the saxophonist Antoine Roney, Kojo Odu Roney was already sensational enough at age 12 to be featured in a documentary that was broadcast on PBS. This March, almost two years later, Roney brought his splashy, Tony Williams-inspired drumming to the Blue Note for his debut as a leader there. He returns this weekend, leading a quartet; on Friday he’ll welcome the virtuoso turntablist D.J. Logic as a special guest. 212-475-8592, bluenotejazz.com DR. LONNIE SMITH at Birdland (through May 25, 8:30 and 11 p.m.). A National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master, Smith is the acting chairman of the board when it comes to Hammond B3 organ playing in jazz. From the 1960s on, he has treated R&B rhythm, church-derived harmony and the nondenominational, mystic mid-60s sound of John and Alice Coltrane as his guides toward a personal approach. In recent years he’s performed and recorded primarily with a classic organ trio (featuring guitar and drums), but this week at Birdland he is accompanied by the Jazz Orchestra of the Concertgebouw, the Netherlands’ eminent big band. 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com ALEXA TARANTINO QUARTET at Dizzy’s Club (May 28, 7:30 p.m.). Tarantino’s forthcoming debut album, “Winds of Change,” announces this young alto saxophonist as a composer of sharply plotted but gracefully unencumbered straight-ahead jazz and — for those who haven’t already caught her in her capacity as a busy side musician around New York — an announcement of her lovely, ardent way of improvising. At Dizzy’s, Tarantino celebrates the album’s release with the pianist Christian Sands, the bassist Joe Martin and the drummer Ulysses Owens Jr.212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO",The New York Times

Mary Elizabeth Winstead stars as a therapist mourning her husband (Colin Woodell, who also plays the husband’s twin). Reviewing the play’s New York premiere in 2007, Ben Brantley wrote that its initial mysteries spawn “other, deeper questions that stay with you into the night.” 212-246-4422, 2st.com ‘FAIRVIEW’ at the Polonsky Shakespeare Center (previews start on June 2; opens on June 16). Jackie Sibblies Drury’s radiantly uncomfortable play, winner of the 2019 Pulitzer Prize for drama, is ready to unnerve you all over again. Ben Brantley described this piece, now at Theater for a New Audience, as “a glorious, scary reminder of the unmatched power of live theater to rattle, roil and shake us wide awake.” 866-811-4111, tfana.org ‘LIFE SUCKS’ at the Acorn Theater at Theater Row (previews start on June 4; opens on June 16). A sort of adaptation of Anton Chekhov’s “Uncle Vanya” is definitely back for an encore run. In April, when reviewing this comedy of dreams deferred, Elisabeth Vincentelli praised the playwright Aaron Posner as understanding “full well that there is no date stamp on feeling stranded between regrets and hopes, between fancy dreams and the banality of existence.”wheelhousetheater.org ‘LITTLE WOMEN’ at the Cherry Lane Theater (in previews; opens on June 4). Meg, Jo, Beth (poor Beth) and Amy are taking their unparalleled sister act to Primary Stages. Kate Hamill, who has created lively versions of “Pride and Prejudice” and “Vanity Fair,” adapts the March sisters to the stage. Sarna Lapine directs, and Hamill stars as Meg, with Kristolyn Lloyd as Jo. 866-811-4111, primarystages.org ‘LONG LOST’ at City Center Stage I (in previews; opens on June 4). David and Billy are long-estranged brothers. Should they stay that way?

Annie Parisse and Alex Wolff also star. Daniel Sullivan directs for Manhattan Theater Club. 212-581-1212, nycitycenter.org ‘NOMAD MOTEL’ at Atlantic Stage 2 (in previews; opens on June 3).

Molly Griggs, Christopher Larkin and Samantha Mathis star.866-811-4111, atlantictheater.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] ‘PATHETIC’ at Abrons Arts Center (performances start on June 5). Racine’s “Phèdre,” a classical tragedy about a woman cursed with a catastrophic lust for her stepson, gets a makeover. Julia Jarcho’s new play for Minor Theater, designed by Ásta Bennie Hostetter, looks at the work through a prism of teen-girl high drama. The cast includes Linda Mancini, Jennifer Seastone and Ben Jalosa Williams. 866-811-4111, minortheater.org ‘PUBLIC SERVANT’ at the Clurman Theater at Theater Row (in previews; opens on June 6). Bekah Brunstetter has had dessert. Now she’s ready for a second course. Part of a trilogy that began with “The Cake,” this new play for Theater Breaking Through Barriers is about a county commissioner tasked with a small request. Geordie Broadwater directs. Christine Bruno, Chris Henry Coffey and Anna Lentz star. 212-239-6200, tbtb.org ‘UNDERGROUND RAILROAD GAME’ at Ars Nova at Greenwich House (in previews; opens on June 1). Ready for another round? This provocative performance piece, created and performed by Jennifer Kidwell and Scott Sheppard, returns to Ars Nova. This “in-all-ways sensational play,” Ben Brantley wrote in 2016, “is about finding ways to speak to one another about an unspeakable American institution a century and a half after its official end.”arsnovanyc.com ‘LUZIA’ at Citi Field (closes on June 9). This traveling Cirque du Soleil show, subtitled “A Waking Dream of Mexico,” goes to lay its head somewhere else. It combines striking costumes, lighting and puppetry with dazzling acrobatics. This spectacle, Elisabeth Vincentelli wrote, helps you understand how the company “has so successfully straddled art and business all these years.”cirquedusoleil.com ‘MAC BETH’ at the Lucille Lortel Theater (closes on June 9). Erica Schmidt’s playful riff on Shakespeare’s tragedy, which finds a group of schoolgirls staging the Scottish play, ends its bloody run. What’s powerful, Laura Collins-Hughes wrote, is “watching a group of girls meet Shakespeare on their own electric terms — with ferocity, abandon and the occasional wild dance break.” 866-811-4111, redbulltheater.com ‘NETWORK’ at the Belasco Theater (closes on June 8). Even when you’re mad as hell, you have to wrap it up sometime. Ivo van Hove’s reimagining of the 1976 Paddy Chayefsky movie finishes its Broadway run. If you love Bryan Cranston, catch it soon, because as Ben Brantley wrote, “if you’re a glutton for great, high-risk acting, you owe Mr. Cranston the courtesy — and yourself the thrill — of watching his self-immolation.” 212-239-6200, networkbroadway.com An earlier version of this article misstated the opening date for “Fairview.” It is June 16, not June 13.",The New York Times
2019,14 New Books to Watch For in May,"A new look at Harper Lee’s life, George Packer’s latest book and more. Welcome to May. It’s an especially big month for nonfiction titles, with George Packer’s new book, “Our Man” and Casey Cep’s highly anticipated book about Harper Lee. Fiction lovers, fear not: there’s a crop of intriguing debut novels, a new wartime story from Mohammed Hanif, and the long-awaited return of the writer Binnie Kirshenbaum. [ Want to keep up with the latest book news, reviews and features? Subscribe to our Books Briefing newsletter. ] Atkinson, a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer, looks at the roots of American independence in his new project. In this deeply researched book, the first volume in a projected trilogy about the Revolutionary War, he gives both the American and British perspectives. [ Read our review. ] When two sisters go missing on the Kamchatka Peninsula, on the eastern fringes of Russia, the disappearance rattles the region — and particularly, the women. This debut spans a year after the girls vanish, with a focus on characters who are connected by the mystery. [ Read our review. ] The farm of the title is really a “gestational retreat,” where poor women carry the unborn children of the superrich. For months, the “hosts” are kept on healthy diets, coddled — and watched closely by the Farm and its administrators — all with the promise of a generous bonus at the end. There are strains of “The Handmaid’s Tale” in this debut, which raises questions about class, surrogacy and exploitation. [ Read our review. ] In the years after “To Kill a Mockingbird” was published, Lee was enraptured by a shocking case in the 1970s: a preacher in Alabama accused of killing five people for the insurance money, the family member who eventually shot him dead and the lawyer who successfully defended them both. Lee had helped her friend Truman Capote with his seminal crime book “In Cold Blood,” and thought this case might give her a similar opportunity. But the book never came about. Cep unravels the story, offering new insight into Lee along the way. [ Read our review. ] This history examines nativist ideology in the United States starting in the 19th century until legislation that curtailed the immigration of “inferiors” was passed in the 1920s. Along the way, Okrent introduces readers to the swaths of Americans who believed in this point of view. By and large, they were wealthy and elite — and many of them were progressive. With the question of impeachment more timely than ever, Wineapple turns to the first presidential impeachment, of Johnson in 1868. A noted biographer, Wineapple brings the era and its personalities — Frederick Douglass, Ulysses S. Grant, Thaddeus Stevens — to life. We can’t afford not to be talking about domestic violence. Snyder argues that it has reached epidemic proportions in the country — it accounts for 15 percent of all violent crimes — with devastating effect. She combines her analysis with interviews with survivors, advocates, and occasionally, the perpetrators themselves. [ Read our review. ] The occasion of Greene’s memoir is heartbreaking: His 2-year-old daughter, Greta, was hit by a falling brick in New York, leaving her brain-dead. (A portion of the book was excerpted in New York last month.) While the book opens with the accident and the Greenes’ torment, there are flashes of hope as the family rebuilds after unimaginable loss. [ Read our review. ] In his new book, Packer, a writer for The Atlantic and the author of “The Unwinding,” delves into the history of Holbrooke, the swaggering, exasperating, larger-than-life diplomat who died in 2010. Going back to Holbrooke’s Vietnam days, Packer follows his career — including its peak, when he negotiated a peace agreement between Bosnians and Serbs during the Clinton administration — and isn’t squeamish about reporting on his affairs and relationships. But the book goes beyond a deep dive into its subject: Readers can learn a lot not only about Holbrooke himself but also about how American foreign policy has so often gone wrong. [ Read our review. ] Linda Taylor may be best known as the “welfare queen” Reagan criticized in the 1970s, accused of ripping off the government. But fraud may have been the least of her crimes: Levin uncovers a far darker past including possible kidnappings and murders. Fans of Kirshenbaum will be delighted to see her first new book in a decade. On New Year’s Eve, a writer has a nervous breakdown that sends her to a New York psych ward. Instead of the treatment her caregivers suggest, the writer watches her fellow patients instead, and begins work on a novel that examines how things got so bad. The book is a bitingly funny, and occasionally heartbreaking, look at mental illness, love and relationships, with Kirshenbaum’s familiar black humor. Hanif, the author of “A Case of Exploding Mangoes,” has written a war satire taking aim at the United States’ interventions abroad. After an American pilot crashes in the desert, he winds up taking refuge in the camp he was supposed to bomb. There, he meets Momo, a teenager ambitious and hungry for money-making schemes. That’s not all: His older brother has gone missing, his parents are squabbling and he’s fending off an aid worker who wants to study him for a project called the Teenage Muslim Mind. [ Read our review. ] This debut novel follows a Taiwanese immigrant family eking out a life near Anchorage, Alaska.

2019,15 Art Exhibitions to View in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to new art shows and some that will be closing soon. ‘SIAH ARMAJANI: FOLLOW THIS LINE’ at the Met Breuer (through June 2). Born in Iran, Armajani has been living in the United States since 1960. This retrospective ranges from work he did as a teenage activist in Tehran to models of the many public sculptures he has produced across America over the past five decades. It introduces us to a sharp social thinker, a wry (and increasingly melancholic) metaphysician, a plain-style visual poet and, above all, an artist-ethicist. “Bridge Over Tree,” Armajani’s wonderful large-scale sculpture presented by Public Art Fund at Brooklyn Bridge Park (on the Empire Fulton Ferry Lawn through Sept. 29) to coincide with the Met show, is well timed for our present era of sundering moral confusion and offers ways forward from it. (Holland Cotter) 212-731-1675, metmuseum.org ‘ARTISTS RESPOND: AMERICAN ART AND THE VIETNAM WAR, 1965-1975’ (through Aug. 18) and ‘TIFFANY CHUNG: VIETNAM, PAST IS PROLOGUE’ (through Sept. 2) at Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington. Everything in “Artists Respond,” a big, inspiriting blast of a historical survey, dates from a time when the United States was losing its soul, and its artists — some, anyway — were trying to save theirs by denouncing a racist war. Figures well known for their politically hard-hitting work — Judith Bernstein, Leon Golub, Hans Haacke, Peter Saul, Nancy Spero — are here in strength. But so are others, like Dan Flavin and Donald Judd and Barnett Newman, seldom associated with visual activism. Concurrent with the survey is a smaller, fine-tuned show by a contemporary Vietnamese-born artist, Tiffany Chung; it views the war through the eyes of people on the receiving end of aggression. (Cotter) 202-663-7970, americanart.si.edu ‘MATTHEW BARNEY: REDOUBT’ at Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven (through June 16). The wildly innovative sculptor and filmmaker, Yale class of 1989, heads back to the halls of ivy to present his first major project since the six-hour excremental eruption of “River of Fundament.” The exhibition shows Barney in a lighter, nimbler mode than he has displayed in years. The new film “Redoubt,” shot in his home state of Idaho, riffs on the myth of Diana and Actaeon; the goddess, here, is an NRA-approved sharpshooter, while the doomed voyeur is the artist himself, making plein-air etchings of Diana and her attendants. Related copper etchings appear in the show, and Barney has electroplated them over varying times, encrusting them with weird metal nodules. “Redoubt” lacks the operatic grandeur some of Barney’s fanboys prefer. But it’s the most emancipated work of his career, and it should make a star of Eleanor Bauer, the dancer and choreographer whom he has entrusted with the film’s most beautiful movement sequences. The film runs about two hours and screens on Saturday afternoons and on select weekdays; check the website for times. (Jason Farago) 203-432-0600, artgallery.yale.edu ‘CAMP: NOTES ON FASHION’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Sept. 8). Inspired by Susan Sontag’s famous 1964 essay, “Notes on ‘Camp,’” the latest spectacular from the Met’s Costume Institute attempts to define this elastic, constantly evolving concept, which leaves taste, seriousness and heteronormativity in the dust. The show researches camp’s emergence in 18th-century France and 19th-century England, examines “Sontagian Camp” and culminates in an immense gallery of designer confectionaries from the 1980s to now that calls to mind a big, shiny Christmas tree barricaded with presents. (Roberta Smith)212-535-7100, metmuseum.org ‘THE JIM HENSON EXHIBITION’ at the Museum of the Moving Image (ongoing). The rainbow connection has been established in Astoria, Queens, where this museum has opened a new permanent wing devoted to the career of America’s great puppeteer, who was born in Mississippi in 1936 and died, too young, in 1990. Henson began presenting the short TV program “Sam and Friends” before he was out of his teens; one of its characters, the soft-faced Kermit, was fashioned from his mother’s old coat and would not mature into a frog for more than a decade. The influence of early variety television, with its succession of skits and songs, runs through “Sesame Street” and “The Muppet Show,” though Henson also spent the late 1960s crafting peace-and-love documentaries and prototyping a psychedelic nightclub. Young visitors will delight in seeing Big Bird, Elmo, Miss Piggy and the Swedish Chef; adults can dig deep into sketches and storyboards and rediscover some old friends. (Farago) 718-784-0077, movingimage.us ‘LINCOLN KIRSTEIN’S MODERN’ at the Museum of Modern Art (through June 15). With George Balanchine, the indefatigable Kirstein (1907-96) founded the School of American Ballet and the New York City Ballet. But he was also an impassioned writer, collector, curator and devotee of photography who had much to do with MoMA in its early years. The museum commemorates his complex career with art, letters and ballet ephemera, drawn from its vast holdings. (Smith) 212-708-9400, moma.org ‘ALICJA KWADE: PARAPIVOT’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Oct. 27). This shrewd and scientifically inclined artist, born in Poland and based in Berlin, has delivered the best edition in five years of the Met’s hit-or-miss rooftop sculpture commission. Two tall armatures of interlocking steel rectangles, the taller of them rising more than 18 feet, support heavy orbs of different-colored marble; some of the balls perch precariously on the steel frames, while others, head-scratchingly, are squinched between them. Walk around these astral abstractions and the frames seem to become quotation marks for the transformed skyline of Midtown; the marbles might be planets, each just as precarious as the one from which they’ve been quarried. (Farago) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org ‘JOAN MIRÓ: BIRTH OF THE WORLD’ at the Museum of Modern Art (through June 15). Drawn mostly from MoMA’s unrivaled Miró collection, this fabulous exhibition is best when tracing the artist’s brilliant early twists on Modernism and their swift ascent to “The Birth of the World,” a 1927 masterpiece that presaged the drips and stains of radical painting two decades hence. Unappreciated in its time, it was barely exhibited until 1968. (Smith) 212-708-9400, moma.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] ‘MORONI: THE RICHES OF RENAISSANCE PORTRAITURE’ at the Frick Collection (through June 2). Moroni, among the best of underappreciated Renaissance painters, brought a new level of naturalism to his subjects, who included lavishly dressed aristocrats but also scholars and tradesmen. (See his depiction of an extraordinarily handsome, sensitive and contemporary-looking tailor.) We seem to be looking at real people as they existed, unidealized, meticulously observed and psychologically present, especially in their direct appraising gazes. A thrilling show. (Smith) 212-288-0700, frick.org ‘RADICALISM IN THE WILDERNESS: JAPANESE ARTISTS IN THE GLOBAL 1960S’ at Japan Society (through June 9). This sturdy addition to our story of the global 1960s, organized by the respected art historian Reiko Tomii, introduces American audiences to three bold positions in Japanese art — by one solo figure and two collectives who all worked far from the lights of Tokyo. Yutaka Matsuzawa, a Conceptualist with a Buddhist streak working in a forest near Nagano, made posters and mail art that aimed to imagine a world of total nothingness. The group GUN, in agrarian Niigata, produced breathtaking land art by filling pesticide sprayers with pigment and spewing color across fresh snow. And the Play, a collective in the Kansai region, sailed together on barges or built tree houses on hillsides to rediscover freedoms beyond social boundaries. The lesson: It’s not just the opposition of East and West that needs rethinking, but that of the metropolis and the sticks. (Farago) 212-715-1258, japansociety.org ‘SCENES FROM THE COLLECTION’ at the Jewish Museum (ongoing). After a surgical renovation to its grand pile on Fifth Avenue, the Jewish Museum has reopened its third-floor galleries with a rethought, refreshed display of its permanent collection, which intermingles 4,000 years of Judaica with modern and contemporary art by Jews and gentiles alike — Mark Rothko, Lee Krasner, Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman and the excellent young Nigerian draftswoman Ruby Onyinyechi Amanze. The works are shown in a nimble, nonchronological suite of galleries, and some of its century-spanning juxtapositions are bracing; others feel reductive, even dilettantish. But always, the Jewish Museum conceives of art and religion as interlocking elements of a story of civilization, commendably open to new influences and new interpretations. (Farago) 212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org ‘T. REX: THE ULTIMATE PREDATOR’ at the American Museum of Natural History (through Aug. 9, 2020). Everyone’s favorite 18,000-pound prehistoric killer gets the star treatment in this eye-opening exhibition, which presents the latest scientific research on T. rex and also introduces many other tyrannosaurs, some discovered only this century in China and Mongolia. T. rex evolved mainly during the Cretaceous period to have keen eyes, spindly arms and massive conical teeth, which could bear down on prey with the force of a U-Haul truck; the dinosaur could even swallow whole bones, as affirmed here by a kid-friendly display of fossilized excrement. The show mixes 66-million-year-old teeth with the latest 3-D prints of dino bones, and also presents new models of T. rex as a baby, a juvenile and a full-grown annihilator. Turns out this most savage beast was covered with — believe it! — a soft coat of beige or white feathers. (Farago) 212-769-5100, amnh.org ‘THE WORLD BETWEEN EMPIRES: ART AND IDENTITY IN THE ANCIENT MIDDLE EAST’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through June 23). The Met excels at epic-scale archaeological exhibitions, and this is a prime example. It brings together work made between 100 B.C. and A.D. 250 in what we now know as Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. In the ancient world, all were in the sphere of two competing superpowers — Rome to the west and Parthia to the east — and though imperial influence was strong, it was far from all-determining. Each of the subject territories selectively grafted it onto local traditions to create distinctive new grass-roots cultural blends. Equally important, the show addresses the fate of art from the past in a politically fraught present. (Cotter) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org ‘BETYE SAAR: KEEPIN’ IT CLEAN’ at the New-York Historical Society (through May 27). Saar has been making important and influential work for nearly 60 years. Yet no big New York museum has given her a full retrospective, or even a significant one-person show, since a 1975 solo at the Whitney Museum of American Art. As this exhibition demonstrates, the institutional oversight is baffling, as her primary themes — racial justice and feminism (her 1972 breakthrough piece, “The Liberation of Aunt Jemima,” merges the two by transforming the racist stereotype of the smiling black mammy into an armed freedom fighter) — are exactly attuned to the present. (Cotter) 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org ‘NARI WARD: WE THE PEOPLE’ at the New Museum (through May 26). The persistent and liberating message in Ward’s sculpture and room-size installations is that art can be made from virtually anything. In this midcareer retrospective, anything means old carpets, plastic bags, bottles, zippers, bed springs, keys and furniture. Although the exhibition includes a number of large installations, Ward is best as a creator of curious and discrete sculptures, ones that remind us that our world is filled with potentially magical objects. We enter museums expecting to be transformed, but if we shift our perspective and look around us, we’ll see that everyday life is really just art waiting to happen.

Jordan E. Cooper’s debut play, a comedy with turbulence, comes in for a landing. A series of vignettes, directed by Stevie Walker-Webb and inspired by the idea that African-Americans might decide to leave the United States en masse, the play is, as Jesse Green wrote, “thrilling, bewildering, campy, shrewd, mortifying, scary, devastating and deep.” 212-967-7555, publictheater.org ‘MRS.

2019,"15 Years Later, PEN World Voices Festival Is Still Trying to Unify the World","Books News The novelist Salman Rushdie co-founded the PEN World Voices Festival 15 years ago, when he was president of PEN America, but it has roots in a conference that occurred decades earlier. In 1986, more than 600 prominent writers from around the world, including Rushdie, gathered for a PEN Congress in New York City. “It was sort of exciting for a young writer to be there amongst all these giants yelling at each other,” Rushdie said. “There were lots and lots of really terrible arguments.” Women writers felt underrepresented in the conference’s panels. South African writers were upset that a government official who supported apartheid had been invited to speak. It was this sort of cross-cultural dialogue that Rushdie hoped to emulate when he started the PEN World Voices Festival in 2005, in the wake of 9/11 and amid a resurgence in isolationist attitudes. “We felt that that kind of distance between America and the world was not good for America, and not good for the rest of the world either,” Rushdie said. Since then, the festival has convened hundreds of authors and intellectuals from dozens of countries to sit in conversation with American writers. Every year, the festival — a week’s worth of public events across New York City — is organized around a theme tied to issues dominating public discourse. After Hillary Clinton’s loss in the 2016 presidential election, the following year’s events revolved around the subject of gender and power. Last year, following Donald Trump’s first year in office, the theme was “resist and reimagine,” and panelists discussed how other parts of the world had handled their own political unrest. Chip Rolley, the festival’s director, said his goal was to draw a connection between what we’re reading and “the stories in the news, the things we’re talking about to our friend over dinner, what we’re reading about on the subway station, the things we’re tweeting about.” The theme of this year’s festival, which kicks off Monday, is “open secrets,” with events devoted to exploring the positive and negative effects of the increasingly blurred lines between public and private information. Some of the events highlight social movements that have emerged anchored by personal testimony. “It Happened to Me” for instance, will bring together seven writers, poets and essayists, including the French memoirist Édouard Louis and the Japanese journalist Shiori Ito, to share personal traumatic experiences. “Siri, Where’s My Democracy?” will focus on the decrease of privacy online, with several journalists and a privacy expert discussing foreign intervention in the 2016 presidential election and what it means that our lives can now be monitored online. “It’s not about trying to hammer out an agreement or settle differences necessarily,” Suzanne Nossel, the chief executive officer of PEN America, said. “But rather using literature and dialogue as a way to shift perspective, spark new ideas and ways of thinking.” PEN America, founded almost a century ago, is both a literary and an advocacy organization, which means its content is “much edgier” and more political than that of many other literary groups, Nossel said. The organization’s international reach also allows the conference to introduce attendees to new writers. Ito’s book “Black Box,” for instance, has not yet been translated into English. “It’s oxygenating,” Nossel said, “to hear these different perspectives and to consider how our country looks from the outside.” The festival starts on Monday, and will close with a keynote lecture by the Indian writer Arundhati Roy at the Apollo Theater on May 12. More than 200 writers will participate, including Marlon James, Jennifer Egan and Masha Gessen. If in the past PEN World Voices was meant to unify American writers and intellectuals with the rest of the world, it’s now also trying to do the same within the United States’ borders. This year, for the first time, there will be additional days of programming in Los Angeles — part of an attempt to nationalize the festival, Nossel said. “After the 2016 election, there were threats that we were used to combating around the world, but we never thought we would encounter on our own doorstep,” she said, adding that it’s essential that we “keep the channels of connection and communication, people to people, alive.”",The New York Times
2019,"16 Years on ‘Avenue Q,’ Wrangling Puppets and Performances","Exit Interview Since 2003, Christine M. Daly had been the stage manager of the rowdy musical, which held its final performance at New World Stages on Sunday. On Sunday night, “Avenue Q,” the not exactly family-friendly puppet musical — with such lesson-imparting numbers as “The Internet Is for Porn” and “Everyone’s a Little Bit Racist” — closed after more than 6,500 performances, a six-year run on Broadway and nearly 10 years Off Broadway. As the show’s stage manager since its tryout run at the Vineyard Theater in February 2003, Christine M. Daly has wrangled puppets and performances, protected the director’s initial vision, and made sure everything has run smoothly, on and offstage. After a raucously applauded final performance at New World Stages, Ms. Daly talked about 16 years on “Avenue Q.” These are edited excerpts from the conversation. How are you feeling right now? I cried a little during the show. But I don’t think I’ll process it until I’ve been away for more than a week and I realize I’m not coming back from vacation. I’m a little bit relieved, too, because the whole thing is done. We got through it and everything went well. And I’m a little bit anxious about what comes next. Back in 2003, did you have any sense of how long you might work on the show? They had to talk me into doing it! The Vineyard Theater asked me three times because I had told them they didn’t pay well enough and I needed to make a living. I eventually said yes when they told me that Broadway producers were involved. We kind of knew, as long as things went well, that we would shift to Broadway. We knew we were a good show. But even then we were “the little puppet show.” Everybody was saying, “Oh, in six months we’ll be gone.” But the audiences took to it. The opening night on Broadway was amazing. It was 800 people and they loved us, and all of a sudden it was just that huge wave of sound and support. They were looking for something that was saying what we were saying, that opened conversations, that was promoting acceptance. Many, many nights it felt like a rock concert. It felt pretty boisterous tonight too. It felt like falling back into old rhythms. Maybe it was less comfortable for some of the people onstage. Tell us about the particular responsibilities of looking after a cast made of foam and felt. They get zhuzhed every show. Their hair is constantly being done. Kate has a human hair wig that has to be styled. Rod has a glue mix in his hair that has to be redone once in a while. On a daily basis, you’ll often use an eraser on the whites of their eyes. And you want to make sure that the actual pupils aren’t getting scuffed at all because they won’t be as bright to the audience. Anything to combat the smelliness that presumably creeps in? There’s a spray that we use, but there’s not a lot you can do about it. You cannot wash their insides. That’s the hard part. We are probably the biggest users of Purell in the Northern Hemisphere. I obviously have to ask you what the puppets get up to backstage. Oh god, what am I allowed to say? Well, I can say that there have been so many moments when a person who was down would have a puppet come up behind them and just give them a hug. But puppets can say things humans cannot. (Laughs.) There’s new harassment rules now that weren’t in place way back when we started. After all of these performances, were there any memorable mishaps? There was the show where we lost all the lights, apart from three spotlights. And the show where part of the ceiling of the Golden Theater fell in. We didn’t stop. The show is so good you could do it in a black box with work lights. Were there moments that you looked forward to in the show? It shifts as time goes by. I feel like when we started the show, “I Wish I Could Go Back to College” was my thing. When we moved here [to New World Stages in 2009], and I was pregnant with my daughter, “Purpose” — the whole number just spoke to me. At the very end of the show, when Princeton is alone on stage and he says, “Everything in life is only for now” — that is just brilliant. I just love it. That moment makes me very happy. And it has felt pretty, pretty perfect for some time now. Your daughter is not an appropriate age to watch the show, is she? Emily came to the show the first time when she was six weeks old. She knows every word. She’s convinced “porn” is short for “popcorn.” (Laughs guiltily.) When she’s older she’ll hate me. Any memorable audience interactions? We have lots of super fans who totally love the show. We had someone who came dressed as Lucy the Slut, including full pink face, the other day. We have lots of kids on the spectrum, and kids on the spectrum who have become adults, who love the show for the lessons it teaches. It has resonated with that group of people in a different way than it resonates with everyone else. But I think we all need puppets to tell us what to do. What will you miss the most? The feeling that if you work on this show for 2.3 seconds, you are part of the family. I’m a single mom, and it’s a hard business for parents being separated from their kids so much. So it was great to have a place where everybody understood that if you needed to bring your child to work that day, you brought your child to work. There was an understanding that we’re all working together to tell this story that teaches these lessons, and you can’t do that if you’re worried about what’s happening at home. I mean, every show becomes some sort of a family. But this felt deeper than that. You’re including the puppets in that? Absolutely. I will miss every single one of them.",The New York Times
2019,"16-Year-Olds Want a Vote. Fifty Years Ago, So Did 18-Year-Olds.","JAMESBURG, N.J. — Stuart Goldstein still has the red-and-white bumper stickers and other artifacts from 1969, when he helped persuade New Jersey lawmakers that 18-year-olds should be able to vote. He was 18 himself then, working with two other college students, David DuPell and Ken Norbe, to build a political network that grew to 10,000 volunteers. They took students to Trenton in busloads and even sneaked into a Richard Nixon rally seeking his support. Theirs was an early salvo in a movement that would end in 1971 with the ratification of the 26th Amendment, which lowered the voting age to 18 from 21. Fifty years later, there is a nascent movement to change the voting age again — this time to 16 — but there are some big differences between the efforts. Then, liberal and conservative activists united behind a powerful argument that went back to World War II, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt lowered the draft age to 18: Young people were being conscripted to fight America’s wars but couldn’t vote in its elections. Today, there is no similarly popular argument. Indeed, a recent poll found that 75 percent of registered voters opposed letting 17-year-olds vote, and 84 percent opposed it for 16-year-olds. In March, when Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts proposed a 16-year-old voting age amendment to House Democrats’ sweeping voting rights bill, it failed 126 to 305, with almost half of her fellow Democrats voting against it and only one Republican in support. Opponents in both parties have expressed doubts that 16-year-olds are mature enough to vote. But local, youth-led campaigns to lower the voting age have persisted since at least 2013, when Takoma Park, Md., gave 16- and 17-year-olds the right to vote in municipal elections. The New York Times recently spoke with activists from the movement 50 years ago, and people on different sides of the issue today, about the cause and the challenges of lowering the voting age. By the time New Jersey took it up in 1969, the voting age had been on the national radar for decades because of the draft. Through World War II, Korea and the early years of Vietnam, every president suggested it should change. But it didn’t — until the 1960s knocked American politics off its axis. The activism of the era made it easy to mobilize liberals and students, many of whom were already involved in the antiwar and civil rights movements. “People were pretty revved up during that time to get involved in something,” said Mr. DuPell, who started the New Jersey campaign and recruited Mr. Goldstein and Mr. Norbe to join him. But campus unrest and violent protests helped fuel pushback that they were too immature to vote. “It was kind of an uphill battle for us trying to convince people young people were responsible, because it was an era when, from a national political point of view, the national leaders were pitting young against old,” Mr. Goldstein, now 68, said. “Our thing was, ‘We’re going to try and work within the system.’ There was all this tumult going on across the country. We didn’t think that would help us convince people that they should lower the voting age.” In April 1969, the Republican-led New Jersey Legislature approved a state constitutional amendment to lower the voting age to 18. And when summer came, Mr. DuPell, Mr. Goldstein and Mr. Norbe went home to build their organization — they called it the Voting Age Coalition Inc. of New Jersey — and round up support for the voter referendum needed to ratify the amendment. They appointed county leaders, who appointed municipal leaders. They sold membership cards for a dollar and told the buyers to recruit 10 volunteers apiece. When President Nixon came to campaign for William Cahill, who was eventually elected governor, Mr. Goldstein and Mr. DuPell forged press credentials and sneaked into the rally with a sign seeking Nixon’s endorsement. Mr. Goldstein recalled that Secret Service agents carried him out, but their sign ended up in a front-page photo the next day. Similar efforts were bubbling up in other states. Sometime in the spring, a group of students in Ohio contacted the New Jerseyans and asked if they, too, could use the “Voting Age Coalition” name. By January 1970, students in 13 states were organizing to lower the voting age. Voters in New Jersey rejected their amendment, and the Voting Age Coalition started trying to lower the age to 19 instead. But it soon became clear that the momentum in Washington, driven by the combined force of the states, was building faster. It was then, after Congress passed the 26th Amendment in March 1971, that the grass-roots structure built in 1969 paid off. The Voting Age Coalition got New Jersey legislators to ratify the amendment, which swept across the country faster than any previous constitutional amendment, gaining the necessary support from three-quarters of the states in just 100 days and becoming law on July 1, 1971. Governor Cahill gave Mr. DuPell the pen he had used to sign it. While the upheaval of the 1960s was centered on college campuses, today’s activism is often found in high schools, and that shift has informed voting-age campaigns. Just as college students did 50 years ago, many high schoolers are pointing to broad social turbulence that affects them — gun violence, for instance — and are seeking to influence the political process by voting. They note that they are already involved through movements like March for Our Lives, which teenagers created after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Fla., in 2018. “So far as I’m concerned, there’s nothing charitable about this amendment,” Ms. Pressley said. “They have earned their right at the table.” This argument has been gaining some traction in liberal pockets of the country, but nationwide, it is not popular. Among Republicans, a common reaction to Ms. Pressley’s amendment was that it was a ploy to add Democrats to the electorate: Generation Z, which includes today’s 16- and 17-year-olds, leans much more liberal than older generations, especially on social issues. A broader objection concerns maturity. “We don’t allow a 16-year-old to buy a beer, and the decision making is because of their ability to reason at that age,” Representative Mark E. Green, Republican of Tennessee, said on the House floor in March. “And now the other side wants to grant a 16-year-old the ability to decide the future of the country. I think this is foolish.” Jennifer C. Braceras, a senior fellow at the conservative Independent Women’s Forum, argued in a Boston Globe op-ed that 16-year-olds “don’t have enough skin in the game.” “At 16, most kids have little awareness of politics, civics or American history, and they have little life experience to inform their decisions,” Ms. Braceras wrote, adding, “Most don’t even pay for their own cellphones — let alone groceries, rent, utility bills or property taxes.” About a dozen countries — including Argentina, Austria, Brazil and Ecuador — allow voting at 16, but the vast majority allow it at 18. Mr. Goldstein supports the current effort, though he said part of him worried that lowering the voting age to 16 could lead to 16-year-olds serving in the military. But Mr. DuPell was skeptical. At 18, “people are out of high school, they’re working, they’re drafted, they’re full participants in our society, and if you’re a full participant, then you should be allowed to vote,” he said, summarizing the argument 50 years ago. “I want to know what the rationale is.” As expressed by the teenagers leading local voting-age campaigns, the rationale is that between climate change, gun violence, student debt and other issues, they do have enough skin in the game. “The 16-year-olds right now will be the ones who live with the consequences of the choices the adults make right now,” said Vikiana Petit-Homme, 17, a high school senior in Boston who has been lobbying Massachusetts to let municipalities lower voting ages for local elections. They also note that 16 is when Americans can, in most states, work without a limit on their hours and drive. “A lot of 16-year-olds are working and getting taxed,” said Ema Smith, 19, a freshman at Yale who, in high school, helped lead a successful campaign to lower the voting age for local elections in Greenbelt, Md. “People tend to focus on at 18 you can join the military, but there are a lot of things happening at 16.” Advocates acknowledge that they lack broad public support, and that they are at a disadvantage compared with their counterparts 50 years ago because they don’t have the “old enough to fight, old enough to vote” argument. Still, Brandon Klugman, manager of the Vote16 campaign at Generation Citizen, which has aided local efforts in places like San Francisco and Washington, said that in 1939, support for lowering the voting age was near where it is now: 17 percent. By 1967, that number was 64 percent. “This is really early days for this conversation,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,"18 Schoolchildren Stabbed, and Girl and Man Killed, in Attack in Japan","KAWASAKI, Japan — A man stabbed at least 20 people, including 18 schoolchildren waiting at a bus stop, before fatally stabbing himself Tuesday morning, according to the school the children attended. One of the schoolchildren and a 39-year-old man died in the attack, in a suburb southwest of Tokyo. NHK, Japan’s public broadcaster, reported that all the children were girls. Citing the Kanagawa prefectural police, NHK named the girl who died as Hanako Kuribayashi, 11. The man who was killed was identified by the broadcaster as Satoshi Oyama, 39, a father and an official in the Foreign Ministry. The attacker, identified by NHK as Ryuichi Iwasaki, 51, stabbed himself in the neck and subsequently died, officials said. The attack took place in Noborito-Shinmachi town in Kawasaki City. Toshichika Ishii, 57, was sitting on a park bench near where the attack took place when he heard a child scream, “I’m scared,” and heard the attacker shouting in Japanese, “I’m going to kill you!” By The New York Times The attack took place as the children were at the bus stop waiting to take a school bus to Caritas, a local Catholic school, witnesses said. [Read our latest story on the Kawasaki, Japan stabbing attack.] Caritas is a private institution founded by Canadian missionaries, the only Catholic school in Kawasaki. It was founded in 1961 as a junior and senior high school. In 1963, it added elementary classes. In 2017, the school had 648 students and 51 teachers. After the attack, a steady stream of children were escorted away from Caritas by their parents, who had been told by school officials not to talk to reporters. One father, who had come to pick up his second-grade daughter, said his wife had seen news of the stabbing on television, and he had received a message from the school on Line, a Japanese messaging service, asking parents to pick up their children. “There was no reason given,” said the father, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “I just received a standardized alert asking us to pick up our children.” He said his daughter regularly rode the bus that was scheduled to stop at the site of the attack on Tuesday. Hiroaki Takamatsu, secretary general of Caritas elementary school, told reporters that the school will hold a meeting for parents and a news conference on Tuesday. “We don’t know details yet,” he said of the attack. “But with one death, I don’t have any words to say.” Violent crimes, particularly mass killings, are rare in Japan. Three years ago, a former employee of a center for people with disabilities rampaged through the facility in Sagamihara, leaving 19 people dead in the worst mass killing in Japan since World War II. The attack shattered the calm of the neighborhood just as the workday was beginning. Akino Kawato, 89, had just come out of her home to collect the newspaper down the street from the bus stop when she saw a man lying on his side steps from her door, apparently bleeding and unconscious. She also saw an injured young mother, along with her son, as she staggered into the parking lot of a nearby FamilyMart convenience store. She was quickly surrounded by passers-by who told her to “hang on.” While the victims waited for ambulances, three doctors from a family clinic rushed out to help them, Ms. Kawato said. Hideharu Nakajima, 79, was awakened around 7:45 a.m. by the panicked sounds of young girls screaming. Outside, he saw groups of girls huddled in fear and ambulances pulling up, and one man down on the ground across the street from his house, where a doctor was administering CPR. He also saw another man, bald and lying on the ground in a pool of blood close to the bus stop. The police were referring to this man as “the suspect.” Paramedics moved him onto a stretcher and he appeared to be conscious at the time. Tuesday’s attack occurred on the last day of President Trump’s visit to Japan. He and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe were visiting a Japanese military ship and greeting American troops as news emerged about the Kawasaki attack, which he addressed in remarks on the ship. “On behalf of the first lady and myself, I want to take a moment to send our prayers and sympathies to the victims of the stabbing attack this morning in Tokyo,” he said. “All Americans stand with the people of Japan and grieve for the victims and for their families.”",The New York Times
2019,1894: Serbia’s King Suspends Constitution,"International Herald Tribune [BY TELEGRAPH TO THE HERALD.] BELGRADE, MAY 21. — The suspension of the Constitution, which after the turn events have been taking for the last day or two has been foreseen, is now a fait accompli. In a proclamation by King Alexander to the people in which he points out in forcible terms the fault of the Constitution of 1888, His Majesty orders its suspension and puts in force in all its details the Constitution of June 29, 1869. The Nicolajevitch Ministry, which had handed in its resignation, is maintained in office by the King, who states that it enjoys his complete confidence. A second ukase, issued by the advice of the Ministers and in virtue of Article 56 of the Constitution of 1869, orders the abrogation of all the laws relating to the press, to communal Government and elections, in so far as they are in contradiction with the Constitution, and puts in force the former laws resulting from the Constitution of 1869. M. Nicholas Christitch, formerly President of the Council, and an intimate friend of King Milan, is named President of the new Council of State. M. Velkovitch is named Vice-President. M. Babovitch, President of the Court of Appeal, is named President of the new Cour de Cassation. M. Georges Stefanovitch is appointed President of the Cour des Comptes. In Radical circles it is alleged that the alleged anti-dynastic plot is only an invention of the Government in order to have a weapon against the Radical party. It is stated that the Government hopes to force it to abandon its attitude of reserve in order to have an excuse to annihilate it. The majority of the party maintains that it is absolutely loyal. — The New York Herald, European Edition, May 22, 1894",The New York Times
2019,19 Art Exhibitions to View in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to new art shows and some that will be closing soon. ‘ARTISTS RESPOND: AMERICAN ART AND THE VIETNAM WAR, 1965-1975’ (through Aug. 18) and ‘TIFFANY CHUNG: VIETNAM, PAST IS PROLOGUE’ (through Sept. 2) at Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington. Everything in “Artists Respond,” a big, inspiriting blast of a historical survey, dates from a time when the United States was losing its soul, and its artists — some, anyway — were trying to save theirs by denouncing a racist war. Figures well known for their politically hard-hitting work — Judith Bernstein, Leon Golub, Hans Haacke, Peter Saul, Nancy Spero — are here in strength. But so are others, like Dan Flavin and Donald Judd and Barnett Newman, seldom associated with visual activism. Concurrent with the survey is a smaller, fine-tuned show by a contemporary Vietnamese-born artist, Tiffany Chung; it views the war through the eyes of people on the receiving end of aggression. (Holland Cotter) 202-663-7970, americanart.si.edu ‘AUSCHWITZ. NOT LONG AGO. NOT FAR AWAY’ at the Museum of Jewish Heritage (through Jan. 3). Killing as a communal business, made widely lucrative by the Third Reich, permeates this traveling exhibition about the largest German death camp, Auschwitz, whose yawning gatehouse, with its converging rail tracks, has become emblematic of the Holocaust. Well-timed, during a worldwide surge of anti-Semitism, the harrowing installation strives, successfully, for fresh relevance. The exhibition illuminates the topography of evil, the deliberate designing of a hell on earth by fanatical racists and compliant architects and provisioners, while also highlighting the strenuous struggle for survival in a place where, as Primo Levi learned, “there is no why.” (Ralph Blumenthal)646-437-4202, mjhnyc.org ‘MATTHEW BARNEY: REDOUBT’ at Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven (through June 16). The wildly innovative sculptor and filmmaker, Yale class of 1989, heads back to the halls of ivy to present his first major project since the six-hour excremental eruption of “River of Fundament.” The exhibition shows Barney in a lighter, nimbler mode than he has displayed in years. The new film “Redoubt,” shot in his home state of Idaho, riffs on the myth of Diana and Actaeon; the goddess, here, is an NRA-approved sharpshooter, while the doomed voyeur is the artist himself, making plein-air etchings of Diana and her attendants. Related copper etchings appear in the show, and Barney has electroplated them over varying times, encrusting them with weird metal nodules. “Redoubt” lacks the operatic grandeur some of Barney’s fanboys prefer. But it’s the most emancipated work of his career, and it should make a star of Eleanor Bauer, the dancer and choreographer whom he has entrusted with the film’s most beautiful movement sequences. The film runs about two hours and screens on Saturday afternoons and on select weekdays; check the website for times. (Jason Farago) 203-432-0600, artgallery.yale.edu ‘CAMP: NOTES ON FASHION’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Sept. 8). Inspired by Susan Sontag’s famous 1964 essay, “Notes on ‘Camp,’” the latest spectacular from the Met’s Costume Institute attempts to define this elastic, constantly evolving concept, which leaves taste, seriousness and heteronormativity in the dust. The show researches camp’s emergence in 18th-century France and 19th-century England, examines “Sontagian Camp” and culminates in an immense gallery of designer confectionaries from the 1980s to now that calls to mind a big, shiny Christmas tree barricaded with presents. (Roberta Smith) 212-535-7100, metmuseum.org ‘THE JIM HENSON EXHIBITION’ at the Museum of the Moving Image (ongoing). The rainbow connection has been established in Astoria, Queens, where this museum has opened a new permanent wing devoted to the career of America’s great puppeteer, who was born in Mississippi in 1936 and died, too young, in 1990. Henson began presenting the short TV program “Sam and Friends” before he was out of his teens; one of its characters, the soft-faced Kermit, was fashioned from his mother’s old coat and would not mature into a frog for more than a decade. The influence of early variety television, with its succession of skits and songs, runs through “Sesame Street” and “The Muppet Show,” though Henson also spent the late 1960s crafting peace-and-love documentaries and prototyping a psychedelic nightclub. Young visitors will delight in seeing Big Bird, Elmo, Miss Piggy and the Swedish Chef; adults can dig deep into sketches and storyboards and rediscover some old friends. (Farago) 718-784-0077, movingimage.us ‘LINCOLN KIRSTEIN’S MODERN’ at the Museum of Modern Art (through June 15). With George Balanchine, the indefatigable Kirstein (1907-96) founded the School of American Ballet and the New York City Ballet. But he was also an impassioned writer, collector, curator and devotee of photography who had much to do with MoMA in its early years. The museum commemorates his complex career with art, letters and ballet ephemera, drawn from its vast holdings. (Smith) 212-708-9400, moma.org ‘ALICJA KWADE: PARAPIVOT’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Oct. 27). This shrewd and scientifically inclined artist, born in Poland and based in Berlin, has delivered the best edition in five years of the Met’s hit-or-miss rooftop sculpture commission. Two tall armatures of interlocking steel rectangles, the taller of them rising more than 18 feet, support heavy orbs of different-colored marble; some of the balls perch precariously on the steel frames, while others, head-scratchingly, are squinched between them. Walk around these astral abstractions and the frames seem to become quotation marks for the transformed skyline of Midtown; the marbles might be planets, each just as precarious as the one from which they’ve been quarried. (Farago) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org ‘MAYBE MAYBE NOT: CHRISTOPHER WOOL AND THE HILL COLLECTION’ at the Hill Art Foundation (through June 28). This foundation’s inaugural show presents more than a dozen paintings, works on paper and photographs by Wool, the painter who wrenched abstraction into the No Wave era. In a stenciled painting from 1989, the drippy black letters of the word “SPOKESMAN” are arranged three by three, filling the white aluminum background with the same deductive logic as Frank Stella’s early stripes. After making layered, silk-screened floral patterns in the 1990s, Wool became more gestural; three extraordinary paintings here from the 2000s, with cloudy spray-gun loop-de-loops and merciless erasures, exhibit a simultaneous love and doubt of abstraction that recalls the best of Albert Oehlen. His enthrallingly difficult later silk-screens cannibalize his own archive, discordantly remixing earlier works and treating paint as both material and information. (Farago) 212-337-4455, hillartfoundation.org ‘JOAN MIRÓ: BIRTH OF THE WORLD’ at the Museum of Modern Art (through June 15). Drawn mostly from MoMA’s unrivaled Miró collection, this fabulous exhibition is best when tracing the artist’s brilliant early twists on Modernism and their swift ascent to “The Birth of the World,” a 1927 masterpiece that presaged the drips and stains of radical painting two decades hence. Unappreciated in its time, it was barely exhibited until 1968.

This sturdy addition to our story of the global 1960s, organized by the respected art historian Reiko Tomii, introduces American audiences to three bold positions in Japanese art — by one solo figure and two collectives who all worked far from the lights of Tokyo. Yutaka Matsuzawa, a Conceptualist with a Buddhist streak working in a forest near Nagano, made posters and mail art that aimed to imagine a world of total nothingness. The group GUN, in agrarian Niigata, produced breathtaking land art by filling pesticide sprayers with pigment and spewing color across fresh snow. And the Play, a collective in the Kansai region, sailed together on barges or built tree houses on hillsides to rediscover freedoms beyond social boundaries. The lesson: It’s not just the opposition of East and West that needs rethinking, but that of the metropolis and the sticks. (Farago) 212-715-1258, japansociety.org ‘SCENES FROM THE COLLECTION’ at the Jewish Museum (ongoing). After a surgical renovation to its grand pile on Fifth Avenue, the Jewish Museum has reopened its third-floor galleries with a rethought, refreshed display of its permanent collection, which intermingles 4,000 years of Judaica with modern and contemporary art by Jews and gentiles alike — Mark Rothko, Lee Krasner, Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman and the excellent young Nigerian draftswoman Ruby Onyinyechi Amanze. The works are shown in a nimble, nonchronological suite of galleries, and some of its century-spanning juxtapositions are bracing; others feel reductive, even dilettantish. But always, the Jewish Museum conceives of art and religion as interlocking elements of a story of civilization, commendably open to new influences and new interpretations.

Everyone’s favorite 18,000-pound prehistoric killer gets the star treatment in this eye-opening exhibition, which presents the latest scientific research on T. rex and also introduces many other tyrannosaurs, some discovered only this century in China and Mongolia. T. rex evolved mainly during the Cretaceous period to have keen eyes, spindly arms and massive conical teeth, which could bear down on prey with the force of a U-Haul truck; the dinosaur could even swallow whole bones, as affirmed here by a kid-friendly display of fossilized excrement. The show mixes 66-million-year-old teeth with the latest 3-D prints of dino bones, and also presents new models of T. rex as a baby, a juvenile and a full-grown annihilator. Turns out this most savage beast was covered with — believe it! — a soft coat of beige or white feathers. (Farago) 212-769-5100, amnh.org ‘2019 WHITNEY BIENNIAL’ at the Whitney Museum of American Art (through Sept. 22). Given the political tensions that have sent spasms through the nation over the past two years, you might have expected — hoped — that this year’s biennial would be one big, sharp Occupy-style yawp. It isn’t. Politics are present but, with a few notable exceptions, murmured, coded, stitched into the weave of fastidiously form-conscious, labor-intensive work. As a result, the exhibition, organized by two young Whitney curators, Rujeko Hockley and Jane Panetta, gives the initial impression of being a well-groomed group show rather than a statement of resistance. But once you start looking closely, the impression changes artist by artist, piece by piece — there’s quiet agitation in the air. (Cotter)212-570-3600, whitney.org ‘JEFF WALL’ at Gagosian (through June 22). Rumination and risk-taking, in equal measure, mark this conceptual photographer’s spellbinding new exhibition. The show, Wall’s first at this Chelsea gallery since ending a 25-year run with the rival dealer Marian Goodman, feels decidedly introspective. Figures alone in contemplative trances, or alienated from their partners in scenes of evident tension, define most of the works. The encyclopedic visual literacy that has long characterized Wall’s pictures (with their compositional echoes of old master paintings) has been pared back, allowing more psychological complexity to emerge. Just as new is an emphasis on narrative and sequence; among the pieces are two diptychs and an enveloping, cinematic triptych. (Karen Rosenberg)212-741-1717, gagosian.com ‘THE WORLD BETWEEN EMPIRES: ART AND IDENTITY IN THE ANCIENT MIDDLE EAST’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through June 23). The Met excels at epic-scale archaeological exhibitions, and this is a prime example. It brings together work made between 100 B.C. and A.D. 250 in what we now know as Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. In the ancient world, all were in the sphere of two competing superpowers — Rome to the west and Parthia to the east — and though imperial influence was strong, it was far from all-determining. Each of the subject territories selectively grafted it onto local traditions to create distinctive new grass-roots cultural blends. Equally important, the show addresses the fate of art from the past in a politically fraught present. (Cotter) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org ‘SIAH ARMAJANI: FOLLOW THIS LINE’ at the Met Breuer (through June 2). Born in Iran, Armajani has been living in the United States since 1960. This retrospective ranges from work he did as a teenage activist in Tehran to models of the many public sculptures he has produced across America over the past five decades. It introduces us to a sharp social thinker, a wry (and increasingly melancholic) metaphysician, a plain-style visual poet and, above all, an artist-ethicist. “Bridge Over Tree,” Armajani’s wonderful large-scale sculpture presented by Public Art Fund at Brooklyn Bridge Park (on the Empire Fulton Ferry Lawn through Sept. 29) to coincide with the Met show, is well timed for our present era of sundering moral confusion and offers ways forward from it. (Cotter) 212-731-1675, metmuseum.org ‘MORONI: THE RICHES OF RENAISSANCE PORTRAITURE’ at the Frick Collection (through June 2). Moroni, among the best of underappreciated Renaissance painters, brought a new level of naturalism to his subjects, who included lavishly dressed aristocrats but also scholars and tradesmen. (See his depiction of an extraordinarily handsome, sensitive and contemporary-looking tailor.) We seem to be looking at real people as they existed, unidealized, meticulously observed and psychologically present, especially in their direct appraising gazes. A thrilling show. (Smith) 212-288-0700, frick.org ‘BETYE SAAR: KEEPIN’ IT CLEAN’ at the New-York Historical Society (through May 27). Saar has been making important and influential work for nearly 60 years. Yet no big New York museum has given her a full retrospective, or even a significant one-person show, since a 1975 solo at the Whitney Museum of American Art. As this exhibition demonstrates, the institutional oversight is baffling, as her primary themes — racial justice and feminism (her 1972 breakthrough piece, “The Liberation of Aunt Jemima,” merges the two by transforming the racist stereotype of the smiling black mammy into an armed freedom fighter) — are exactly attuned to the present. (Cotter) 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org ‘NARI WARD: WE THE PEOPLE’ at the New Museum (through May 26). The persistent and liberating message in Ward’s sculpture and room-size installations is that art can be made from virtually anything. In this midcareer retrospective, anything means old carpets, plastic bags, bottles, zippers, bed springs, keys and furniture. Although the exhibition includes a number of large installations, Ward is best as a creator of curious and discrete sculptures, ones that remind us that our world is filled with potentially magical objects. We enter museums expecting to be transformed, but if we shift our perspective and look around us, we’ll see that everyday life is really just art waiting to happen.

2019,19 Art Exhibitions to View in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to new art shows and some that will be closing soon. ‘SIAH ARMAJANI: FOLLOW THIS LINE’ at the Met Breuer (through June 2).

This retrospective ranges from work he did as a teenage activist in Tehran to models of the many public sculptures he has produced across America over the past five decades.

(Holland Cotter) 212-731-1675, metmuseum.org ‘ARTISTS RESPOND: AMERICAN ART AND THE VIETNAM WAR, 1965-1975’ (through Aug. 18) and ‘TIFFANY CHUNG: VIETNAM, PAST IS PROLOGUE’ (through Sept. 2) at Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington. Everything in “Artists Respond,” a big, inspiriting blast of a historical survey, dates from a time when the United States was losing its soul, and its artists — some, anyway — were trying to save theirs by denouncing a racist war. Figures well known for their politically hard-hitting work — Judith Bernstein, Leon Golub, Hans Haacke, Peter Saul, Nancy Spero — are here in strength. But so are others, like Dan Flavin and Donald Judd and Barnett Newman, seldom associated with visual activism. Concurrent with the survey is a smaller, fine-tuned show by a contemporary Vietnamese-born artist, Tiffany Chung; it views the war through the eyes of people on the receiving end of aggression. (Cotter) 202-663-7970, americanart.si.edu ‘MATTHEW BARNEY: REDOUBT’ at Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven (through June 16). The wildly innovative sculptor and filmmaker, Yale class of 1989, heads back to the halls of ivy to present his first major project since the six-hour excremental eruption of “River of Fundament.” The exhibition shows Barney in a lighter, nimbler mode than he has displayed in years. The new film “Redoubt,” shot in his home state of Idaho, riffs on the myth of Diana and Actaeon; the goddess, here, is an NRA-approved sharpshooter, while the doomed voyeur is the artist himself, making plein-air etchings of Diana and her attendants. Related copper etchings appear in the show, and Barney has electroplated them over varying times, encrusting them with weird metal nodules. “Redoubt” lacks the operatic grandeur some of Barney’s fanboys prefer. But it’s the most emancipated work of his career, and it should make a star of Eleanor Bauer, the dancer and choreographer whom he has entrusted with the film’s most beautiful movement sequences. The film runs about two hours and screens on Saturday afternoons and on select weekdays; check the website for times. (Jason Farago) 203-432-0600, artgallery.yale.edu ‘THE JIM HENSON EXHIBITION’ at the Museum of the Moving Image (ongoing). The rainbow connection has been established in Astoria, Queens, where this museum has opened a new permanent wing devoted to the career of America’s great puppeteer, who was born in Mississippi in 1936 and died, too young, in 1990. Henson began presenting the short TV program “Sam and Friends” before he was out of his teens; one of its characters, the soft-faced Kermit, was fashioned from his mother’s old coat and would not mature into a frog for more than a decade. The influence of early variety television, with its succession of skits and songs, runs through “Sesame Street” and “The Muppet Show,” though Henson also spent the late 1960s crafting peace-and-love documentaries and prototyping a psychedelic nightclub. Young visitors will delight in seeing Big Bird, Elmo, Miss Piggy and the Swedish Chef; adults can dig deep into sketches and storyboards and rediscover some old friends.

With George Balanchine, the indefatigable Kirstein (1907-96) founded the School of American Ballet and the New York City Ballet. But he was also an impassioned writer, collector, curator and devotee of photography who had much to do with MoMA in its early years. The museum commemorates his complex career with art, letters and ballet ephemera, drawn from its vast holdings. (Roberta Smith) 212-708-9400, moma.org ‘ALICJA KWADE: PARAPIVOT’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Oct. 27). This shrewd and scientifically inclined artist, born in Poland and based in Berlin, has delivered the best edition in five years of the Met’s hit-or-miss rooftop sculpture commission. Two tall armatures of interlocking steel rectangles, the taller of them rising more than 18 feet, support heavy orbs of different-colored marble; some of the balls perch precariously on the steel frames, while others, head-scratchingly, are squinched between them. Walk around these astral abstractions and the frames seem to become quotation marks for the transformed skyline of Midtown; the marbles might be planets, each just as precarious as the one from which they’ve been quarried. (Farago) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org ‘JOAN MIRÓ: BIRTH OF THE WORLD’ at the Museum of Modern Art (through June 15). Drawn mostly from MoMA’s unrivaled Miró collection, this fabulous exhibition is best when tracing the artist’s brilliant early twists on Modernism and their swift ascent to “The Birth of the World,” a 1927 masterpiece that presaged the drips and stains of radical painting two decades hence. Unappreciated in its time, it was barely exhibited until 1968.

This sturdy addition to our story of the global 1960s, organized by the respected art historian Reiko Tomii, introduces American audiences to three bold positions in Japanese art — by one solo figure and two collectives who all worked far from the lights of Tokyo. Yutaka Matsuzawa, a Conceptualist with a Buddhist streak working in a forest near Nagano, made posters and mail art that aimed to imagine a world of total nothingness. The group GUN, in agrarian Niigata, produced breathtaking land art by filling pesticide sprayers with pigment and spewing color across fresh snow. And the Play, a collective in the Kansai region, sailed together on barges or built tree houses on hillsides to rediscover freedoms beyond social boundaries. The lesson: It’s not just the opposition of East and West that needs rethinking, but that of the metropolis and the sticks.

(Cotter) 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org ‘SCENES FROM THE COLLECTION’ at the Jewish Museum (ongoing). After a surgical renovation to its grand pile on Fifth Avenue, the Jewish Museum has reopened its third-floor galleries with a rethought, refreshed display of its permanent collection, which intermingles 4,000 years of Judaica with modern and contemporary art by Jews and gentiles alike — Mark Rothko, Lee Krasner, Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman and the excellent young Nigerian draftswoman Ruby Onyinyechi Amanze. The works are shown in a nimble, nonchronological suite of galleries, and some of its century-spanning juxtapositions are bracing; others feel reductive, even dilettantish. But always, the Jewish Museum conceives of art and religion as interlocking elements of a story of civilization, commendably open to new influences and new interpretations.

The opening of the Brant Foundation Art Study Center in the East Village, with an exhibition of nearly 70 works by Basquiat created from 1980 to 1987, serves as a fitting temporary shrine for this Brooklyn-born painter, who became a global sensation in the early ’80s and died at 27 of a heroin overdose. Basquiat sprayed poetic, enigmatic graffiti on walls in downtown Manhattan before moving to canvas, dated Madonna before she was famous and made paintings with Andy Warhol. Part of a group of Neo-Expressionist painters who were largely rejected by critics, he was embraced by an influential audience and a surging art market and ended up creating a brand of African-American history painting that still resonates today. Tickets to the exhibition have sold out, but you can add your name to the wait list at the foundation’s website. (Schwendener) 212-777-2977, brantfoundation.org ‘GAME OF THRONES’ MUSEUM TOUR at the Rubin Museum (May 15, 6 p.m.). One of the main pillars of George R. R. Martin’s fantasy series is power. It is also this year’s theme at the Rubin. So as the HBO television series that Martin’s books inspired comes to a conclusion, the museum is conducting a tour on Wednesday through its current “Faith and Empire: Art and Politics in Tibetan Buddhism” exhibition, linking a handful of its centerpieces with “Thrones” plot lines and characters — from the parallels between the depiction of rebirth in “Wheel of Life” and the resurrection of Beric Dondarrion, Lady Stoneheart and Jon Snow to the copper statue of the Hindu goddess Durga slaying a demon and its similarities with female warriors such as Brienne of Tarth, Arya Stark and Lyanna Mormont. The tour is free with museum admission and will start promptly at the base of the spiral staircase on the first floor. (Danielle Dowling) 212-620-5000, rubinmuseum.org ‘FRIDA KAHLO: APPEARANCES CAN BE DECEIVING’ at the Brooklyn Museum (through May 12). This is not exactly an exhibition of Kahlo’s art — it contains just 11 paintings, from compelling self-portraits to ghastly New Age kitsch — but an evocation of an artistic life through her elegant Oaxacan blouses and skirts, not to mention the corsets and spinal braces she wore after a crippling traffic accident. Do her outfits have the weight of art, or are they just so much biographical flimflam? Your answer may vary depending on your degree of Fridamania, but the woven shawls and color-saturated long skirts here, as well as gripping photographs of the artist by Carl Van Vechten, Imogen Cunningham, Manuel Álvarez Bravo and other great shutterbugs, suggest Kahlo’s real accomplishment was a Duchampian extension of her art far beyond the easel, into her home, her fashion and her public relationships. Advance general tickets are sold out. A limited number of same-day, on-site timed tickets are available first come first served. (Farago) 718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org ‘MONUMENTAL JOURNEY: THE DAGUERREOTYPES OF GIRAULT DE PRANGEY’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through May 12). I’ve been half a dozen times at least to this buffed jewel of an exhibition, one of the most profound I have seen on the first years of photography and the legacy of 19th-century art in 21st-century life. In 1842, Joseph-Philibert Girault de Prangey set off on a three-year road trip and made the first-ever photographs of Athens, Cairo, Constantinople and Jerusalem. More than 100 of his precise, systematic daguerreotypes are here, their silver surfaces glistening under pin lights. Girault de Prangey’s understanding of photography as an archival project — a proto-Google Street View, made with a 100-pound box camera — comes through most strongly in his views of two destroyed buildings: the Tuileries palace in Paris, which was set ablaze in 1871, and the great mosque of Aleppo, Syria, which crumbled in 2013. And now, another daguerreotype of a ruined building embodies the melancholy of archival photography: Notre-Dame cathedral, whose Gothic expanses appear imperishable. (Farago)212-535-7710, metmuseum.org ‘TOLKIEN: MAKER OF MIDDLE-EARTH’ at the Morgan Library & Museum (through May 12). J. R. R. Tolkien did more than write books like “The Hobbit” and the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy; he invented an alternate reality, complete with its own geography, languages, religion and an era-spanning history. This exhibition of his artwork, letters, drafts and other material reminds visitors that the stories Tolkien wrote, however impressive, represent only a fraction of his efforts, and it highlights his unparalleled ability to create an immersive experience using only words and pictures. After a visit you, too, may find yourself believing in Middle-earth and the hobbits, elves, dwarves, orcs and wizards that live there. (Peter Libbey) 212-685-0008, themorgan.org",The New York Times
2019,1994 Was a Prison of My Own Making,"25 years ago was yesterday and a million years ago. CreditCreditPhoto Illustration by Tala Safie/The New York Times We tend to recall the past not on its own merits but in terms of what it lacked in retrospect. Virtually the entire period of planetary existence is lumped into the condescending unit “before Christ.” Our hominid ancestors are described not as astonishing animals that harnessed the destructive force of fire, but “prehistoric” — people who didn’t know how to write. In 2019, we remember 1994 as a time not with answering machines, a digital Encyclopaedia Britannica and the IBM Simon, but before Google, before texting and before iPhones. Why are we remembering 1994? Good question. It’s one I asked and was asked many times over the course of my experimental week attempting to live in 2019 like it was 1994. The best answer I got from my boss — that 1994 was 25 years ago — is, generally, not a sound enough reason to begin operating outside the norms of contemporary society at great personal inconvenience, but then again, few workplaces are as accommodating to caprice as The New York Times Styles section, in any year. Creative forces beyond my control had designated spring 2019 as the time to revisit Generation X. How are they doing? What are they doing? What do they remember? And what do they love? The answer is: 1994. Why? Because it was 25 years ago. I was four years old when the North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect, an iconic 25 years ago. I consider myself an average American, which is how I know the average American spent 1994 eating Dunkaroos in the back seat. Yet some Americans were not in the back seat: They were in the office. They were in brand-new restaurants that opened in 1994. They were in phone booths, not necessarily to urinate. They were smoking cigarettes — not on domestic flights under six hours, thanks to a then-recently-passed draconian law prohibiting this, but just about everywhere else. When they gazed at their hands, they saw not a bewitching black glass rectangle that would show them anything from anywhere in the world, but appendages resembling twin opaque flattened jellyfish with stick-like tentacles — i.e., hands. My assignment was to attempt, for one week, to live, 24/7, as if it were 1994. Or, rather, to pretend to inhabit a version of 2019 in which the evolution of technology and culture had ceased 25 years prior — an idea that melded the elegance of Einstein’s notions about time’s illusory nature with the perplexing militance of a living history flash mob of one. Under the terms of the exercise, I would 1994-ify everything within my purview. For instance, while I would not be required to pantomime working at a phantom New York Times office inside the dual-level bowling alley and entertainment complex that now occupies the site of the newspaper’s 1994 operations, I would avoid catching B trains to work since they did not stop at my neighborhood subway station in 1994. To the extent possible, I would use only products invented in or before 1994. I would dine exclusively at restaurants that opened that year or earlier. My irrational need to receive constant updates on all current events and internet gossip (normally fulfilled by compulsively checking my Twitter feed and remaining in round-the-clock text message communication with friends checking their own slightly different Twitter feeds) would have to be satisfied by the newspaper, the radio and network news. Read more about the tech, music, style, books, rules, films and pills that scream Gen X. Aside from figuring out how to get from anywhere to anywhere (which, I eventually discovered, was sadly nearly impossible in 1994), the most taxing element was preparation. At work, my primary tools would be paper — a kind of very, very thin, stiff, dry, fragile fabric for writing on — pens, and my landline desk phone. As a Styles section reporter working in 1994, I almost certainly would not have had personal internet access at work, so I would reduce my 2019 computer to word processor functionality — no email. I would also relinquish access to my workplace’s warren of internal online chat rooms, 29 of which I am currently a member — three of which might be described as having at least some relation to my actual job and two of which are dedicated to revealing locations of free food and leftovers inside the Times building. 1994 would extend to my personal life too. The day before my new year began, I made a list of those acquaintances with whom I had interacted at least twice over the past three weeks — about thirty in all — and emailed them a note explaining that, while I would be unreachable for the next week by email, text message, instant message, Instagram direct message, Twitter direct message, tagged tweet or tagged Instagram comment, I was not in danger, in rehab, or even out of town, and I would love to hear from them by phone (including at my work extension) if they were inclined to talk or make plans. (Few were.) I transformed my iPhone into a landline by disabling notifications for every application except calls, and leaving it plugged into a wall outlet in my kitchen. I printed out seven pages of phone contacts because I did not know any of my friends’ phone numbers, nor indeed the phone number of the man I have been dating for four years and am engaged to marry. I bought a genuine 1994 Radio Shack television set with a built in VCR on eBay. It arrived broken. A Radio Shack cassette tape recorder also purchased on eBay also arrived broken. 1994 was not that long ago, but everything from 1994 was broken, or seemed so. I fretted that the 1994 Sony Walkman I received was also broken because no music emanated from it when I turned it on, but then I discovered that the Walkman merely demanded headphones before it would play (static-clogged radio stations or a tape of loon calls I bought at a thrift store for a quarter). I worried that the alarm clock I bought as a stand-in for my phone alarm — a rotund plastic polar bear sunbathing in a lounge chair at what nearby signage indicates is the North Pole, holding a bottle of Coca-Cola in each hand, set atop a circular red digital clock base printed with the Coca-Cola Company logo — was broken, because I couldn’t get it to sound. The problem turned out to be a missing battery; it had been so long since I’d used an electronic with a battery cartridge I was intended to be able to open (or locate) that I’d almost forgotten to check. (I do suspect the artifact may still have been broken, because, although I eventually got it to sing “Coca-Cola’s always the one! Whenever there is fun there’s always Coca-Cola! Yeah!” on repeat, the bear never rotated slowly, the way it allegedly did on all the other 1994 suntanning-bear-enjoying-two-bottles-of-Coca-Cola alarm clocks for sale on eBay.) Because I couldn’t bear the idea of giving up even a single week of planning my wedding, I bought the 1994 Special Celebrity Wedding Issue of People magazine (which featured Marla Maples — married late December 1993 to the “tycoon” Donald Trump — on the cover) as well as the 308-page 1994 “Bride’s All New Book of Etiquette.” (Page 213: “‘Don’t DJ’s show up at parties in jeans, wearing gold chains?’ Simply specify that you would like the DJ to wear formal attire.”) I ordered the cheapest cookbook from 1994 I could find, which was titled “Cooking Light Cookbook 1994.” I borrowed a 1994 Zagat from a co-worker. To help me identify buildings it was safely 1994 to go into, I acquired “New York, a Guide to the Metropolis” a walking tour book published in 1994 that is still recommended reading (by the government of New York City) for individuals hoping to obtain an official sightseeing guide license. For entertainment, I bought the books “The Celestine Prophecy” and “Prozac Nation.” And for exercise, I purchased guided aerobic VHS tapes on eBay. Because of a 1994 Times trend story about humans using horsehair products, I purchased Mane & Tail shampoo and conditioner (which seem to be sold only in humongous horse sizes) at my local drugstore, as well as L’Oreal Paris True Match Foundation (debuted 1994), Maybelline Great Lash mascara (1971) and Noxzema Original Cleansing Cream (1914). I bought a 1,188 page 1994 manual with the deceptively simple name “Using the Internet,” which featured chapters like “BBS, UUCP, and Other Polled Services” that were incomprehensible to me, a person who exists more on the internet than in real life. The toughest thing about going to 1994 would be leaving behind my fiancé, Taylor, particularly as I would still be living in our shared apartment. Taylor was proud of my journalistic ambition — “This can’t affect my life. This cannot affect me. I’m not getting paid,” he said when I revealed the assignment — and he would, in many ways, bear the brunt of it. For a week, he and I would be unable to enjoy one another’s company while watching streaming and OnDemand TV programming in stunning 4K resolution, which made me realize the majority of our free time is spent enjoying one another’s company while watching streaming and OnDemand TV programming in stunning 4K resolution, the picture quality of which is sometimes so crisply detailed it borders on hallucinatory. All of our social plans would have to be decided in advance, since he would be unable to reach me unless I happened to be near the kitchen, at my desk at work or already with him. Most annoyingly for both of us, Taylor (along with everyone I encountered) would be banned from using his smartphone to inform me of the time, the forecast, directions, invitations, addresses, phone numbers, recipes, news he had learned from digital sources and the easily researched answers to any of my spontaneous questions. But back to the whole reason I agreed to the 1994 endeavor: cognitive dissonance that leaves me unable to calibrate effort and reward. In this instance, it manifested as a willingness to give up most of the things I enjoy about my life in order to buy Dunkaroos with company money. I had long since stopped seeing Dunkaroos (with that distinctive kangaroo mascot whose job or obsession it is to dunk small tasteless cookies into inch-deep depressions of chocolate icing) in grocery stores, but it was on Amazon I confirmed that the fertile green Earth I inhabited as a child is now a post-Dunkaroo apocalyptic wasteland. Currently, there is one product labeled “Dunkaroos” — in a highly unfamiliar and suspect Dunkaroo font — available on Amazon for the heart-attack-inducing price of $19.98. This appears to be an imported Australian variety of the snack distributed by a different company. (General Mills discontinued the original product years ago.) I investigated the possibility of purchasing Dunkaroos on the Dark Web, and discovered to my horror that three people in Australia had recently been charged with running a syndicate that moved roughly $12 million worth of drugs “disguised as candy” across the country. I envisioned myself ripping the foil from a pack of hard-won Dunkaroos and finding only LSD tabs inside. I couldn’t handle that kind of letdown. I resigned myself to purchasing only regulation 1994 Gushers and Fruit Roll-Ups. And then also the fake Dunkaroos, which were terrible. The first thing I noticed at midnight when the clock struck 1994 was the sudden silence in the room. The second thing was the deafening volume of my inner monologue. I was getting ready for bed, performing the half-dozen mostly mindless tasks that, because they occupy my hands, normally provide a treasured window for listening to an audiobook or podcast. As I smeared surprisingly solid and burning Noxzema cream across my cheeks, however, all I could hear were my own thoughts. Tedious thoughts. Thoughts about what I was doing at that very moment, what I would do in the seconds that followed and how loud my inner monologue was. I can’t live with this woman for a week, I thought, and it reverberated through my head like a shout. A couple days into the experiment, I would realize something even stranger: I no longer had any inner monologue at all. Every day in 1994, I woke up — “Coca-Cola’s always the one!” — and listened to the local jazz radio station while getting dressed in one of the 1994 period ensembles generously lent to me by a co-worker (a beige power suit with prominent shoulder pads one day; a silver vinyl miniskirt the next). About 20 minutes into my first morning, I learned from NPR that Julian Assange had been arrested in London, which is normally the kind of information I’d receive seconds after opening my eyes, while scrolling through my phone in bed half-asleep. In addition to providing brief news summaries, the radio was my primary source of weather forecast information. It was incorrect every single day, but never more so than the morning I embarked on a 35-block pilgrimage to visit Manhattan’s four remaining pay phones (all on the Upper West Side) and was forced to spend 20 minutes standing under scaffolding, filthy city rainwater soaking the pages of my handwritten observations. (“Pigeon in second booth.”) There were challenges indoors as well. At work, I discovered I had no way to access my voice mail because I had never set it up. (Since I never give out that phone number — since I did not even know that phone number — I had always figured I would not receive important calls on it.) I dialed the office helpline to ask for assistance resetting my PIN, and received the good news that a temporary password link had been sent to my email address. “I can’t access my email right now,” I said. “You’re locked out of that too?” the gentleman helping me asked. “No,” I said. “It’s on purpose.” Because I had presented him with a unique problem — not a person who was unable to access the link, but a person who refused to — we remained at an impasse for several minutes. People accepted “I am in 1994” as an excuse to varying degrees. The most common response was a burst of disbelieving laughter, followed by a declaration that that person was “actually kind of jealous” of my technology fast. A few people ignored the construct, continuing, I discovered later, to send me important, time-sensitive information in formats I was temporarily unable to receive (in effect creating their own false version of 2019 in which I was not inhabiting a false version of 1994). One person seemed to think I was lying to get out of looking at a dog’s Instagram account. The most time-consuming task of my week was identifying places to go, and figuring out how to go to them with paper maps. I spent hours methodically calling restaurants listed in the Zagat (under “Fireplaces,” for instance) to see if they still existed. They don’t. Or, anyway, most of them don’t. The majority of numbers just rang forever, although one call was answered with the confusing but chipper greeting “Hello, ‘Live’!” I had dialed a Chilean restaurant from 1994, and had reached an employee of “Live with Kelly and Ryan” at her desk. In the weekly allotment of time I normally spend half-browsing the internet while half-watching TV, I read three books. (“The Celestine Prophecy”: Didn’t expect it to be a guide to turning myself invisible. “Prozac Nation”: Exhausting. “The Bean Trees”: Introduced me to Coca-Cola cake.) I reorganized my dresser and my closet. Taylor and I went for walks. One evening, I even cracked open “Cooking Light” and prepared my sweetheart a complete meal called “Dinner for Your Sweetheart,” which was disgusting. I should have known it would be, because while light cooking is not a radical concept, many of the dishes depicted in this book were unrecognizable to me, a townsperson from the future. What is neon green and white and perfect for “Lunch After the Workout”? I still couldn’t tell you, despite scrutinizing the recipe. (Vichyssoise?) What is my “favorite ice milk”? What is “ice milk”? As I set to work preparing the bruschetta and “vegetable-cheese"" linguine the recipe described as “an elegant yet easy meal that’s simple enough to make after a day at work” (when “it’s just you and your beloved”), I learned that nutritious cooking in 2019 is a distant cousin of the 1994 version. Vegetables were sautéed in cooking spray. I was prohibited from adding salt to the pasta water, yet instructed to spread a thick mixture of goat cheese, Parmesan and “nonfat cream cheese product” over each slice of bruschetta. Because the linguine ingredients did not include salt, butter, olive oil or even garlic, it wasn’t clear to me what was supposed to add flavor to the pasta; the final answer appeared to be nothing. (Also, despite appearing in the “Quick & Easy” chapter, the recipe included a chocolate meringue dessert — topped with chocolate frozen yogurt and chocolate syrup — that, per the instructions, required over three hours to execute.) I dressed the noodles. I arranged strips of wet peppers into heart shapes on the pieces of bruschetta, as directed. I summoned my sweetheart. “What do you think?” I asked as we ate the warm-paper-flavored meal. “It’s not bad,” said Taylor. “It’s like they made something inherently kind of unhealthy, flavorless.” He advised me to add some of the leftover goat cheese to my linguine. “Is it good?” I asked, watching him do it. “Not really,” he said with a shrug, “but it gives it a taste.” I told him dessert would be ready shortly after 11 p.m. While I will stop at nothing to avoid making or receiving a phone call in 2019, phone conversations in my private 1994 provided valuable lifelines to the loved ones and entertainment news from which I had been cruelly severed. I felt adored when Taylor called me one morning at work to ask if I’d “heard the big news.” (“No!” I exclaimed. “I bet you didn’t!” he said, and hung up.) I teared up with gratitude when I arrived home to a friend’s detailed voice mail explaining that the television host Wendy Williams was filing for divorce, and how it was going. Contributing to my isolation was the fact that calls made from inside The New York Times office appear to originate from a spam number ending in “1234” — a detail I’d forgotten to warn people about beforehand, which resulted in most of my outgoing calls being ignored. The only person I ever managed to reach on the first try was my cousin, because she assumed I was a telemarketer and was going to let her baby daughter field the call since she enjoys babbling at the phone. By the fourth or fifth day of 1994, I’d stopped impulsively grabbing at empty spaces on my desk for my cellphone, but my reflex to quickly Google things never deteriorated. I began compiling my questions — a list of itches to be scratched at a later time — and spent the final day of my week at the Brooklyn Public Library, to see what percentage of answers I could find in books. About 17 percent, it turned out. While I was not able to learn the location of the nearest FedEx, the best-selling compact mirror of all time or the name of a green Chanel nail polish I had recently seen in a discount store, I did learn the ingredients in Coca-Cola cake, where Josephine Baker was born (St. Louis), and what happened to Joan Lunden after 1994. I had been introduced to the concept of Joan Lunden only a few days prior, via her 1994 workout tape “Workout America.” It opens with a clip montage of Ms. Lunden horseback riding, bungee jumping, ice climbing, fly fishing, ice skating, playing baseball, and, again, horseback riding, before cutting to her on set in a TV studio where she observes, “Boy, is life fun these days!” Then: “Hi, I’m Joan Lunden. You probably know me best as the co-host of ‘Good Morning America.’” I had not known Ms. Lunden was ever a co-host of “Good Morning America.” I had simply purchased her tape online because it was released in the correct year for my irreverent assignment. But, marching in time with Joan and her friends, alone in my living room, I discovered the only thing about 1994 I truly enjoyed: workout videos. I loved the inane prerecorded affirmations. I loved learning individual dance routine components and putting them all together at full speed. I loved the way Joan said, “and my personal favorite, papaya” when describing her refrigerator “filled with melons, and berries, and my personal favorite, papaya.” I copied down the Dewey Decimal number for her 2015 book “Had I Known,” and located it on a shelf. The subtitle took the wind out of my sails — “A memoir of survival.” In the first pages, I learned that Joan had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2014. The news made my silly assignment feel stupid. Impudent, even. Joan had seemed to delight in her health on the tape in 1994. Twenty-five years later, it was a success to be surviving. I left the library to head to dinner with someone I had never met at a place I had never been. On the subway, I realized I had forgotten to bring the notebook where, earlier in the week, I had written the restaurant’s address. I’m used to jotting everything down (typing it in the Notes app on my phone) because I have a terrible memory. I sat up in my seat and considered the situation. Apart from my initially cacophonous inner monologue, plus an hourslong stretch while looking for the phone booths when I could not stop thinking about the 1950 Lionel Hampton rendition of “Boogie Woogie Santa Claus,” my mind was dead quiet for the majority of 1994. I wasn’t bored. I was just thinking in a very straightforward way about whatever I happened to be doing at that moment. Out of this silence, out of some long-since-condemned corner of my hippocampus, the address surfaced. I was startled. I’d assumed my memory was an oubliette. All this time it was actually a sunken living room with built-in custom storage? I pictured my frantic brain. In 2019, it spent its days firing off repeated ALL CAPS bulletins of basic information into a nonstop podcast din. Could the mental screaming from day one have been the remnant of an adaptation — a way to break through my usual torrent of technology-enabled stimuli? Maybe the quiet hadn’t replaced my thoughts. Maybe my thoughts had just relaxed into their natural hushed state. 1994 was the time before the commotion. Or that seemed plausible, anyway. I couldn’t look it up.",The New York Times
2019,"2 Batsheva-Bred Choreographers, Speaking in Their Own Tongues","Critic’s notebook Shamel Pitts and Bobbi Jene Smith, veterans of Ohad Naharin’s company, showed their distinctive dance voices in New York performances. Fifteen years ago, the choreographers Bobbi Jene Smith and Shamel Pitts were classmates at Juilliard. Ms. Smith left before graduating to join the Batsheva Dance Company in Tel Aviv; Mr. Pitts arrived at the same company four years later. As friends, they collaborated on “Arrowed,” a project initiated by Ms. Smith in which they sit face to face and interrogate each other. The two left Batsheva not far apart, Ms. Smith in 2014, Mr. Pitts in 2016, to make work on their own. Their paths continue to align. Last weekend Mr. Pitts, who has been touring the world, returned to his native Brooklyn with “Black Velvet: Architectures and Archetypes,” a haunting duet with the Brazilian dancer Mirelle Martins, performed at BAM Fisher. And on Thursday Ms. Smith, who earned a devoted following as the enigmatic subject of the 2017 documentary “Bobbi Jene,” unveiled “Lost Mountain,” an impressive work of dance-theater presented by the La MaMa Moves! festival. With a shared history in Batsheva comes a shared challenge: to uncover a distinctive, personal voice. This is a test for any dancer who has worked extensively with one choreographer, but perhaps even more so when that choreographer is Ohad Naharin, Batsheva’s artistic leader, whose influence runs deep in those who perform his work and contribute to its creation. Yet while bearing the imprint of his unmistakable style — gooey and guttural, rooted in his signature movement system known as Gaga — Mr. Pitts and Ms. Smith have swerved into their own lanes. In “Black Velvet,” the second part of a trilogy, Mr. Pitts explores a partnership with Ms. Martins, whom he met while teaching Gaga in 2013. She had left a marketing job to study dance, a novice at 28; her work with Mr. Pitts introduced her to the stage. You would never guess this from her softly commanding presence in “Black Velvet,” which opens with the striking image of her perched on a tall pedestal, in a long black skirt that drapes to the floor. With her bare, bronzed torso and ghostly, mechanical gestures, she resembles a statue brought to life, especially as she begins, startlingly, to glide backward. (Mr. Pitts, we soon discover, is pushing her.) Under Lucca Del Carlo’s stark, nimble lighting, facets of their relationship flash into view, struggle mingling with care and curiosity. In a post-show talk, Mr. Pitts spoke about honoring “the black women in my life who have been my superwomen,” and Ms. Martins seems at times to play this vital yet supporting role, eclipsed by her partner’s sinuous intensity. (Mr. Pitts is a captivating mover.) Still, the two have a special chemistry, and after a wild, screeching climax that ends with the pedestal (a ladder) crashing to the floor, they land on equal ground. While Mr. Pitts found a collaborator from outside the Batsheva circle, Ms. Smith has continued working with alumni from the company, like Or Schraiber (her husband) and Ariel Freedman, two of the 10 formidable performers in “Lost Mountain.” Ms. Smith, five months pregnant and fearless as ever, also performs in the work. A dreamlike domestic drama, the exhilarating “Lost Mountain” recalls Pina Bausch more than Mr. Naharin in its surrealism and episodic structure. Ms. Smith has turned La MaMa’s cavernous Ellen Stewart Theater into a pressure cooker of a living room, making smart use of stairways and balconies. Dancers and musicians — including the cellist Coleman Itzkoff, the violinist Keir GoGwilt and the singer Asaf Avidan, who composed much of the score — share the space like one big dysfunctional family. Fights break out. Someone in a bear costume wanders through. The mundane — a series of weather reports, dryly delivered — bumps up against the violent and strange. In the figure of an older dancer, Marta Miller, you might glimpse a future Ms. Smith, looking back on many past lives. Black Velvet Performed May 9-12 at BAM Fisher, Brooklyn. Lost Mountain Through Sunday at La MaMa, Manhattan; lamama.org. Because of an editing error, a picture caption in an earlier version of this article misstated the surname of a dancer in Bobbi Jene Smith’s “Lost Mountain.” She is Ariel Freedman, not Friedman.",The New York Times
2019,"2 More Bodies Found After Alaska Plane Collision, Bringing Death Toll to 6","The United States Coast Guard said Tuesday that the bodies of two people missing after the midair collision of two small planes on Monday in a remote part of Alaska had been recovered, bringing the number of people killed to six. The collision, which happened at 12:12 p.m. on Monday and also injured 10 others, happened after one of the two planes descended by several hundred feet, officials said on Tuesday. The two small planes, which were carrying cruise ship passengers, crashed Monday as they approached the city of Ketchikan, a National Transportation Safety Board member, Jennifer Homendy, said at a news conference. “The preliminary data shows speed and altitude, but we don’t want to make any assumptions based on that,” Ms. Homendy said. “We still have to recover the planes and then we have to look at those, and it takes some significant work to understand how the two came together.” Ms. Homendy said both planes were flying over George Inlet about eight nautical miles from Ketchikan, which is a popular stop for cruise ships because of the extensive options for outdoor activities in the area. The passengers had been on a Royal Princess cruise ship that left Vancouver on May 11 for a seven-day “Voyage of the Glaciers” trip, the cruise line said. The plane that descended, a DHC-3T Turbine Otter, was carrying 10 passengers and a pilot on an excursion that was sold through the cruise line, Ms. Homendy said. It was returning from a tour of Misty Fjords, a national monument and wilderness area, Princess Cruises said in a statement. Ten of those people survived and one died, the company said. Ms. Homendy said investigators wanted to interview the pilot of that plane, who survived. The plane was operated by Taquan Air, a regional airline based in Ketchikan that offers sightseeing tours and regularly scheduled flights. “We are devastated by today’s incident and our hearts go out to our passengers and their families,” Taquan said in a statement on Monday. The other plane, a DHC-2 Beaver owned by Mountain Air Service, was carrying four passengers and one pilot, Ms. Homendy said. She said it was flying west-southwest toward Ketchikan at 106 knots, or roughly 125 miles per hour, at an altitude of roughly 3,300 feet. The collision happened at an altitude of between 3,200 and 3,300 feet, she said. The bodies of two passengers and the pilot, all Americans, were recovered overnight. The Ketchikan Fire Department identified the pilot on Tuesday night as Randy Sullivan. A fourth body was recovered Monday night, and two more bodies were recovered on Tuesday. Ms. Homendy said she expected investigators to spend between five and seven days at the crash site. “We will not be determining the probable cause of the accident in that time frame nor will we speculate on the cause,” she said. “We will however provide information that we are able to provide that is factual in nature.” Neither plane was equipped with cockpit voice recorders or devices to record flight data, nor were they required to be, Ms. Homendy said. Aaron Sauer, the N.T.S.B. investigator in charge, said the planes were “not in a controlled area” at the time of the crash, which meant their pilots were not required to be talking to an air traffic control tower. Ms. Homendy said investigators would examine how the pilots were trained, any medical issues they may have had and log books they kept. The investigation will also look into aircraft maintenance records, whether flight plans were filed with the Federal Aviation Administration, and whether the pilots had followed their company’s standard operation procedures, she said. Ms. Homendy also asked for any witnesses to come forward. “We have requested flight data from the F.A.A. including — we want to see if there were other planes operating in the area,” she said on Tuesday. More than 50 members of the Coast Guard were using helicopters and boats to search for the two missing people, said Lt. Brian Dykens, a Coast Guard spokesman. Mischa Chernick, a spokeswoman for PeaceHealth Ketchikan Medical Center, said on Tuesday that six patients who were admitted to the hospital were in fair condition, and four patients were evacuated to Seattle in stable condition. It was not immediately known what company had operated the smaller plane, a de Havilland DHC-2 Beaver. The larger plane was a de Havilland DHC-3 Otter. “All of us at Princess Cruises are deeply saddened by this tragic news and we are extending our full support to the investigating authorities as well as the traveling companions of the guests involved,” said Brian O’Connor, a spokesman for Princess Cruises. The cruise ship was scheduled to arrive in Anchorage on May 18, Princess Cruises said.",The New York Times
2019,20 Art Exhibitions to View in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to new art shows and some that will be closing soon. ‘SIAH ARMAJANI: FOLLOW THIS LINE’ at the Met Breuer (through June 2). Born in Iran, Armajani has been living in the United States since 1960. This retrospective ranges from work he did as a teenage activist in Tehran to models of the many public sculptures he has produced across America over the past five decades. It introduces us to a sharp social thinker, a wry (and increasingly melancholic) metaphysician, a plain-style visual poet and, above all, an artist-ethicist. “Bridge Over Tree,” Armajani’s wonderful large-scale sculpture presented by Public Art Fund at Brooklyn Bridge Park (on the Empire Fulton Ferry Lawn through Sept. 29) to coincide with the Met show, is well timed for our present era of sundering moral confusion and offers ways forward from it. (Holland Cotter) 212-731-1675, metmuseum.org ‘ARTISTS RESPOND: AMERICAN ART AND THE VIETNAM WAR, 1965-1975’ (through Aug. 18) and ‘TIFFANY CHUNG: VIETNAM, PAST IS PROLOGUE’ (through Sept. 2) at Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington. Everything in “Artists Respond,” a big, inspiriting blast of an historical survey, dates from a time when the United States was losing its soul, and its artists — some, anyway — were trying to save theirs by denouncing a racist war. Figures well known for their politically hard-hitting work — Judith Bernstein, Leon Golub, Hans Haacke, Peter Saul, Nancy Spero — are here in strength. But so are others, like Dan Flavin and Donald Judd and Barnett Newman, seldom associated with visual activism. Concurrent with the survey is a smaller, fine-tuned show by a contemporary Vietnamese-born artist, Tiffany Chung; it views the war through the eyes of people on the receiving end of aggression. (Cotter) 202-663-7970, americanart.si.edu ‘MATTHEW BARNEY: REDOUBT’ at Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven (through June 16). The wildly innovative sculptor and filmmaker, Yale class of 1989, heads back to the halls of ivy to present his first major project since the six-hour excremental eruption of “River of Fundament” — and shows Barney in a lighter, nimbler mode than he has displayed in years. The new film “Redoubt,” shot in his home state of Idaho, riffs on the myth of Diana and Actaeon; the goddess, here, is an NRA-approved sharpshooter, while the doomed voyeur is the artist himself, making plein-air etchings of Diana and her attendants. Related copper etchings appear in the exhibition, and Barney has electroplated them over varying times, encrusting them with weird metal nodules. “Redoubt” lacks the operatic grandeur some of Barney’s fanboys prefer. But it’s the most emancipated work of his career, and it should make a star of Eleanor Bauer, the dancer and choreographer whom he has entrusted with the film’s most beautiful movement sequences. The film runs about two hours and screens on Saturday afternoons and on select weekdays; check the website for times. (Jason Farago) 203-432-0600, artgallery.yale.edu ‘GAME OF THRONES’ MUSEUM TOUR at the Rubin Museum (May 3, 7 p.m.; May 15, 6 p.m.). One of the main pillars of George R. R. Martin’s fantasy series is power. It is also this year’s theme at the Rubin. So as the HBO television series that Martin’s books inspired comes to a conclusion, the museum is conducting a tour on Friday and May 15 through its current “Faith and Empire: Art and Politics in Tibetan Buddhism” exhibition, linking a handful of its centerpieces with “Thrones” plot lines and characters — from the parallels between the depiction of rebirth in “Wheel of Life” and the resurrection of Beric Dondarrion, Lady Stoneheart and Jon Snow to the copper statue of the Hindu goddess Durga slaying a demon and its similarities with female warriors such as Brienne of Tarth, Arya Stark and Lyanna Mormont. The two tours are free with museum admission; each will start promptly at the base of the spiral staircase on the first floor. (Danielle Dowling) 212-620-5000, rubinmuseum.org ‘THE JIM HENSON EXHIBITION’ at the Museum of the Moving Image (ongoing). The rainbow connection has been established in Astoria, Queens, where this museum has opened a new permanent wing devoted to the career of America’s great puppeteer, who was born in Mississippi in 1936 and died, too young, in 1990. Henson began presenting the short TV program “Sam and Friends” before he was out of his teens; one of its characters, the soft-faced Kermit, was fashioned from his mother’s old coat and would not mature into a frog for more than a decade. The influence of early variety television, with its succession of skits and songs, runs through “Sesame Street” and “The Muppet Show,” though Henson also spent the late 1960s crafting peace-and-love documentaries and prototyping a psychedelic nightclub. Young visitors will delight in seeing Big Bird, Elmo, Miss Piggy and the Swedish Chef; adults can dig deep into sketches and storyboards and rediscover some old friends. (Farago) 718-784-0077, movingimage.us ‘LINCOLN KIRSTEIN’S MODERN’ at the Museum of Modern Art (through June 15). With George Balanchine, the indefatigable Kirstein (1907-96) founded the School of American Ballet and the New York City Ballet. But he was also an impassioned writer, collector, curator and devotee of photography who had much to do with MoMA in its early years. The museum commemorates his complex career with art, letters and ballet ephemera, drawn from its vast holdings. (Roberta Smith) 212-708-9400, moma.org ‘ALICJA KWADE: PARAPIVOT’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Oct. 27). This shrewd and scientifically inclined artist, born in Poland and based in Berlin, has delivered the best edition in five years of the Met’s hit-or-(often-) miss rooftop sculpture commission. Two tall armatures of interlocking steel rectangles, the taller of them rising more than 18 feet, support heavy orbs of different-colored marble; some of the balls perch precariously on the steel frames, while others, head-scratchingly, are squinched between them. Walk around these astral abstractions and the frames seem to become quotation marks for the transformed skyline of Midtown; the marbles might be planets, each just as precarious as the one from which they’ve been quarried. (Farago) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org ‘JOAN MIRÓ: BIRTH OF THE WORLD’ at the Museum of Modern Art (through June 15). Drawn mostly from MoMA’s unrivaled Miró collection, this fabulous exhibition is best when tracing the artist’s brilliant early twists on Modernism and their swift ascent to “The Birth of the World,” a 1927 masterpiece that presaged the drips and stains of radical painting two decades hence. Unappreciated in its time, it was barely exhibited until 1968. (Smith) 212-708-9400, moma.org ‘MORONI: THE RICHES OF RENAISSANCE PORTRAITURE’ at the Frick Collection (through June 2). Moroni, among the best of underappreciated Renaissance painters, brought a new level of naturalism to his subjects, who included lavishly dressed aristocrats but also scholars and tradesmen. (See his depiction of an extraordinarily handsome, sensitive and contemporary-looking tailor.) We seem to be looking at real people as they existed, unidealized, meticulously observed and psychologically present, especially in their direct appraising gazes. A thrilling show. (Smith) 212-288-0700, frick.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] ‘RADICALISM IN THE WILDERNESS: JAPANESE ARTISTS IN THE GLOBAL 1960S’ at Japan Society (through June 9). This sturdy addition to our story of the global 1960s, organized by the respected art historian Reiko Tomii, introduces American audiences to three bold positions in Japanese art — by one solo figure and two collectives who all worked far from the lights of Tokyo. Yutaka Matsuzawa, a Conceptualist with a Buddhist streak working in a forest near Nagano, made posters and mail art that aimed to imagine a world of total nothingness. The group GUN, in agrarian Niigata, produced breathtaking land art by filling pesticide sprayers with pigment and spewing color across fresh snow. And the Play, a collective in the Kansai region, sailed together on barges or built tree houses on hillsides to rediscover freedoms beyond social boundaries. The lesson: It’s not just the opposition of East and West that needs rethinking, but that of the metropolis and the sticks. (Farago) 212-715-1258, japansociety.org ‘BETYE SAAR: KEEPIN’ IT CLEAN’ at the New-York Historical Society (through May 27). Saar has been making important and influential work for nearly 60 years. Yet no big New York museum has given her a full retrospective, or even a significant one-person show, since a 1975 solo at the Whitney Museum of American Art. As this exhibition demonstrates, the institutional oversight is baffling, as her primary themes — racial justice and feminism (her 1972 breakthrough piece, “The Liberation of Aunt Jemima,” merges the two by transforming the racist stereotype of the smiling black mammy into an armed freedom fighter) — are exactly attuned to the present. (Cotter) 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org ‘SCENES FROM THE COLLECTION’ at the Jewish Museum (ongoing). After a surgical renovation to its grand pile on Fifth Avenue, the Jewish Museum has reopened its third-floor galleries with a rethought, refreshed display of its permanent collection, which intermingles 4,000 years of Judaica with modern and contemporary art by Jews and gentiles alike — Mark Rothko, Lee Krasner, Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman and the excellent young Nigerian draftswoman Ruby Onyinyechi Amanze. The works are shown in a nimble, nonchronological suite of galleries, and some of its century-spanning juxtapositions are bracing; others feel reductive, even dilettantish. But always, the Jewish Museum conceives of art and religion as interlocking elements of a story of civilization, commendably open to new influences and new interpretations. (Farago) 212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org ‘TOLKIEN: MAKER OF MIDDLE-EARTH’ at the Morgan Library & Museum (through May 12). J. R. R. Tolkien did more than write books like “The Hobbit” and the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy; he invented an alternate reality, complete with its own geography, languages, religion and an era-spanning history. This exhibition of his artwork, letters, drafts and other material reminds visitors that the stories Tolkien wrote, however impressive, represent only a fraction of his efforts, and it highlights his unparalleled ability to create an immersive experience using only words and pictures. After a visit you, too, may find yourself believing in Middle-earth and the hobbits, elves, dwarves, orcs and wizards that live there. (Peter Libbey) 212-685-0008, themorgan.org ‘T. REX: THE ULTIMATE PREDATOR’ at the American Museum of Natural History (through Aug. 9, 2020). Everyone’s favorite 18,000-pound prehistoric killer gets the star treatment in this eye-opening exhibition, which presents the latest scientific research on T. rex and also introduces many other tyrannosaurs, some discovered only this century in China and Mongolia. T. rex evolved mainly during the Cretaceous Period to have keen eyes, spindly arms and massive conical teeth, which could bear down on prey with the force of a U-Haul truck; the dinosaur could even swallow whole bones, as affirmed here by a kid-friendly display of fossilized excrement. The show mixes 66-million-year-old teeth with the latest 3-D prints of dino bones, and also presents new models of T. rex as a baby, a juvenile and a full-grown annihilator. Turns out this most savage beast was covered with — believe it! — a soft coat of beige or white feathers. (Farago) 212-769-5100, amnh.org ‘NARI WARD: WE THE PEOPLE’ at the New Museum (through May 26). The persistent and liberating message in Ward’s sculpture and room-size installations is that art can be made from virtually anything. In this midcareer retrospective, anything means old carpets, plastic bags, bottles, zippers, bed springs, keys and furniture. Although the exhibition includes a number of large installations, Ward is best as a creator of curious and discrete sculptures, ones that remind us that our world is filled with potentially magical objects. We enter museums expecting to be transformed, but if we shift our perspective and look around us, we’ll see that everyday life is really just art waiting to happen. (Martha Schwendener) 212-219-1222, newmuseum.org ‘THE WORLD BETWEEN EMPIRES: ART AND IDENTITY IN THE ANCIENT MIDDLE EAST’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through June 23). The Met excels at epic-scale archaeological exhibitions, and this is a prime example. It brings together work made between 100 B.C. and A.D. 250 in what we now know as Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. In the ancient world, all were in the sphere of two competing superpowers — Rome to the west and Parthia to the east — and though imperial influence was strong, it was far from all-determining. Each of the subject territories selectively grafted it onto local traditions to create distinctive new grass-roots cultural blends. Equally important, the show addresses the fate of art from the past in a politically fraught present.

The opening of the Brant Foundation Art Study Center in the East Village, with an exhibition of nearly 70 works by Basquiat created from 1980 to 1987, serves as a fitting temporary shrine for this Brooklyn-born painter, who became a global sensation in the early ’80s and died at 27 of a heroin overdose. Basquiat sprayed poetic, enigmatic graffiti on walls in downtown Manhattan before moving to canvas, dated Madonna before she was famous and made paintings with Andy Warhol. Part of a group of Neo-Expressionist painters who were largely rejected by critics, he was embraced by an influential audience and a surging art market and ended up creating a brand of African-American history painting that still resonates today. Tickets to the exhibition have sold out, but you can add your name to the wait list at the foundation’s website. (Schwendener) 212-777-2977, brantfoundation.org ‘FRIDA KAHLO: APPEARANCES CAN BE DECEIVING’ at the Brooklyn Museum (through May 12). This is not exactly an exhibition of Kahlo’s art — it contains just 11 paintings, from compelling self-portraits to ghastly New Age kitsch — but an evocation of an artistic life through her elegant Oaxacan blouses and skirts, not to mention the corsets and spinal braces she wore after a crippling traffic accident. Do her outfits have the weight of art, or are they just so much biographical flimflam? Your answer may vary depending on your degree of Fridamania, but the woven shawls and color-saturated long skirts here, as well as gripping photographs of the artist by Carl Van Vechten, Imogen Cunningham, Manuel Álvarez Bravo and other great shutterbugs, suggest Kahlo’s real accomplishment was a Duchampian extension of her art far beyond the easel, into her home, her fashion and her public relationships.

The museum upends its cherished Modern narrative of ceaseless progress by mostly young (white) men. Instead we see works by artists 45 and older who have just kept on keeping on, regardless of attention or reward, sometimes saving the best for last. Art here is an older person’s game, a pursuit of a deepening personal vision over innovation. Winding through 17 galleries, the installation is alternatively visually or thematically acute and altogether inspiring.

In 1842, just a couple of years after Louis Daguerre unveiled the world’s first practical camera, Joseph-Philibert Girault de Prangey, a French aristocrat with a yen for experimental technology, set off on a three-year road trip, lugging a 100-pound kit as he took the world’s first photographs of Athens, Cairo, Constantinople and Jerusalem. More than 100 of Girault de Prangey’s precise daguerreotypes glisten here under pin lights, and his systematic photos of Islamic architecture, in particular, express how the new technology of photography could flit between art and science, and would soon become a tool of colonial rule. Girault de Prangey’s daguerreotypes were little seen before 2003, when his descendants put them on the market; their discovery was a landmark in the history of early photography, and this show is too.

2019,"2019 French Open: Nadal, Federer and Wawrinka Cruise Into Third Round","PARIS — Roger Federer, 37, joked to a stadium filled with screaming children that he’s “so super old.” Stan Wawrinka, 34, pulled a crying boy out of a crush of autograph-seekers in the stands. Rafael Nadal, about to turn 33, offered this advice to youngsters at his match who might be pondering a tennis career: “The main thing is: Don’t think about winning Roland Garros.” Schools in France are closed on Wednesdays, bringing out a younger, louder brand of fan to the French Open, and the three players, all of them champions of the clay-court major, seemed to appreciate the adulation from the little ones who attended their straight-set victories. It was fitting, too, perhaps, that Federer advanced to a third-round meeting against 20-year-old Casper Ruud, who is so much his junior that his father was in the field when Federer made his debut in Paris in 1999. “I know probably more about his dad,” Federer said, “than about him.” [French Open scoreboard: men’s singles | women’s singles] Federer, the tournament’s 2009 champion, who had not been in the field in four years, will be playing his third opponent in a row who is 25 or younger, after beating 144th-ranked Oscar Otte, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4, in the second round. Now Federer, the 20-time major champion, will take on Ruud, a Norwegian ranked 63rd. He is coached by his father, Christian, who told Casper he once practiced with Federer, although they never played. “Ever since I can remember, I’ve been watching Roger on TV,” said Ruud, who knocked off 29th-seeded Matteo Berrettini, 6-4, 7-5, 6-3. Then came this admission from Ruud: “To be honest, I’ve been a little bit more of a Rafa fan and Rafa guy.” Better hope no one tells Roger. Still, even if he always has preferred Nadal, Ruud described what comes next this way: “I’m playing one of the greatest champions ever of this sport on Friday, so I’m just superexcited for it. I can play loose and free.” Wawrinka, the winner in 2015 and the runner-up two years later, also had no trouble against a much younger foe Wednesday, eliminating 22-year-old Cristian Garín, 6-1, 6-4, 6-0. Afterward, Wawrinka came to the rescue of one of his tiniest fans, lifting him away from danger and offering a towel as a keepsake. “I took him out of that mess a little bit,” Wawrinka said. “He was in pain and sad.” Owner of three Grand Slam titles, Wawrinka will bring his signature backhand into what shapes up as a more competitive matchup against the two-time major semifinalist Grigor Dimitrov, who eliminated the 2014 United States Open champion, Marin Cilic, 6-7 (3), 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (2), 6-3, over nearly four and a half hours. Nadal’s form had not been up to his usual standards during much of the clay season: This was the first time since 2004 that he entered May without a title for the year. But he looked good while taking the title at the Italian Open this month, including a victory over Novak Djokovic in the final, and he has been close to untouchable so far as he seeks a record-extending 12th trophy in Paris. His latest tour de force was a 6-1, 6-2, 6-4 win over 114th-ranked Yannick Maden, a qualifier from Germany. O.K., so Nadal hasn’t really faced much of a test yet. Still, he is displaying the court-covering, ball-walloping style he has perfected, which could come in handy when he plays the 2016 French Open quarterfinalist David Goffin in the third round. “I don’t like the word ‘easy’ because when you win, it always looks easier,” Nadal said. While plenty of the sport’s big names still dot the men’s bracket, the women’s field keeps seeing top players depart. On Wednesday, fourth-seeded Kiki Bertens, a 2016 semifinalist who is considered a contender for her first major title, quit during the first set of her match against Viktoria Kuzmova because she was sick. Tears filled Bertens’s eyes as she described waking up at 3 a.m., feeling ill with stomach problems. “All night long, all day long,” she said. “I felt a little bit better before the match. I had some sleep, and I just wanted to give it a try. But then as soon as I start warming up right before the match, it started again. There was not any energy left.” Bianca Andreescu, an 18-year-old Canadian who was seeded 22nd, pulled out before her match against the 20-year-old American Sofia Kenin, citing an injured right shoulder that sidelined her from March until this week. Kenin will face the winner of Thursday’s match between Serena Williams and a Japanese qualifier, Kurumi Nara. Bertens and Andreescu join the two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova, who withdrew before her first match because of an arm injury, and the former No. 1s Angelique Kerber and Caroline Wozniacki, who both lost in the first round. Match Points Lucie Safarova, a runner-up to Serena Williams at the French Open in 2015, announced her retirement. Safarova, who achieved a career-best ranking of fifth that year, played her final match in Paris in the doubles draw with Dominika Cibulkova, losing to Sofia Kenin and Andrea Petkovic, 6-4, 6-0, in the first round. Safarova, 32, reached No. 1 in the doubles rankings and won five Grand Slam doubles titles. She also won the Fed Cup with the Czech Republic five times.",The New York Times
2019,2019 French Open: Naomi Osaka and Simona Halep Survive,"PARIS — After Naomi Osaka whipped a forehand well wide of the mark to put herself on the brink of being upset in the first round of the French Open on Tuesday, she spun toward her mother and her coach in the stands and flashed them a thumbs-up sign saturated with sarcasm. The errant shot had given Osaka’s opponent, Anna Karolina Schmiedlova of Slovakia, the opportunity to score a major upset on her upcoming service game. As Osaka openly fumed in front of the fans scattered about Philippe Chatrier Court, it seemed her dream of winning this year’s Roland Garros and her third straight Grand Slam title was about to come to an abrupt and sloppy end. “Do you guys see this amazing tennis I’m playing right here?” Osaka said later, explaining the message behind her sardonic hand gesture to her team. “I don’t even know what I wanted them to do.” But it was clear what she wanted to do, and she did it. After breaking back in the next game and winning a second-set tiebreaker, the top-seeded Osaka overcame her nerves and negative emotions to defeat Schmiedlova, 0-6, 7-6 (4), 6-1, and avoid a crushing defeat. After that, the only upward-pointing thumbs were for victory. “I felt kind of bad after I did it,” Osaka said. “It was more like, I had to put my emotions somewhere.” She advanced to a second-round matchup against Victoria Azarenka, who defeated Jelena Ostapenko, 6-4, 7-6 (4). Osaka wasn’t the only top player who had to suppress her nerves on Chatrier: Simona Halep, the No. 3 seed and defending champion, also required three sets, defeating Ajla Tomljanovic of Australia, 6-2, 3-6, 6-1. At last year’s French Open, Halep beat Sloane Stephens to claim her only Grand Slam title. When she returned on Tuesday, she said, she felt the weight of new expectations she carried with her onto the very same court. “But it’s a nice feeling,” she noted, “so, I can’t complain.” For the 21-year-old Osaka, the combination of soaring hopes and the chilly, windy conditions made her more nervous than she had ever been on court, she said. Clay has not been her best surface, and a year ago Osaka would not have dared to pine openly for the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen. But after she won last year’s United States Open and this year’s Australian Open in succession, announcing and then confirming her status as the world’s best player, Osaka has earned the right to publicly yearn for a third consecutive Grand Slam trophy — even though no one has ever won their first three major titles in a row. “I kind of want to win this one really bad,” she said Tuesday. For a while, it looked as if she wanted it so much that it was distorting her normally efficient play. Schmiedlova, ranked No. 90, wiped out Osaka in a 23-minute first set. Osaka went up, 3-0, in the second set, but Schmiedlova fought back and broke Osaka at 4-4 and again at 5-5, but her nerves tightened with the finish line in view. Once safely past the tiebreaker, Osaka cruised through the third set against a dejected Schmiedlova. “I had maybe a little bit too much respect for her,” Schmiedlova said. “Or, I don’t know. I got a little bit nervous.” Osaka committed 32 unforced errors in the first two sets, and just four in the third. More important, Osaka avoided becoming only the second top-ranked woman to lose in the first round; Angelique Kerber lost to Ekaterina Makarova in the first round in 2017. While not considered an expert on clay, Osaka is coming off some of her best results on the surface. She reached the quarterfinals in tournaments at Stuttgart and Madrid and was into the third round at another in Rome before she withdrew with a right hand injury (she said she felt no discomfort Tuesday). Ordinarily the winner of the two previous major tournaments would warrant attention as a strong favorite, but until Osaka proves she can go further than the third round — her previous best at Roland Garros — then Halep and the fourth-seeded Kiki Bertens will be favored ahead of her. Still, Osaka has something neither of those two have at the moment: the No. 1 ranking. This is the first major tournament in which she is the top seed and the top-ranked player in the world, and she wants to prove she can be an all-around player and win on clay — and win with her new coach Jermaine Jenkins, who replaced Sascha Bajin after the Australian Open. “I feel like I’m thinking too much about the number next to my name right now,” she said, adding, “I have never been in this position.” It is a good position to be in, even worthy of a thumbs up.",The New York Times
2019,2019 French Open: Osaka Escapes Again; Serena Williams Rolls,"PARIS — Naomi Osaka screamed, “Oh, my God!” after one shanked shot. She mouthed something and clasped her hands together, as if praying, after another. There were plenty of deep sighs and exaggerated eye rolls, too. The No. 1-seeded Osaka got off to a terrible start at the French Open again, never masking her frustration. After some slip-ups near the end, Osaka also prevailed again, displaying the grit and the groundstrokes that just won’t let her lose during what has become a 16-match Grand Slam winning streak. Osaka trailed by a set and a break on Thursday against the former No. 1 Victoria Azarenka in the second round at Roland Garros before coming back to win an entertaining matchup, 4-6, 7-5, 6-3, and prolong her bid for a third consecutive major championship. “I have this mind-set that I feel like I can win if it gets down to the wire,” Osaka said. “Like, if I have to break a person, I feel like I have the ability to do that. So I probably shouldn’t wait until the last minute.” [French Open scoreboard: Men’s singles | Women’s singles] In the first round, Osaka not only dropped the opening set but did so by a 6-0 score. This time, Osaka ceded the first four games against Azarenka and was responsible for their match’s first seven unforced errors. “Technically, like, she kind of killed me in the first set,” Osaka said, “and I just kept trying to find a way to stay positive.” The defending champion Simona Halep required that same sort of resolve to get through her own test, squandering a big second-set lead and three match points before holding on to beat 87th-ranked Magda Linette, 6-4, 5-7, 6-3. Halep, who said afterward that she felt a “little bit sick” and planned to “sleep all day tomorrow,” was up a set and 5-3 in the second before dropping four games in a row and being broken twice while serving for the match. Neither Osaka nor Halep managed to put on the sort of solid performance delivered by Serena Williams, who was barely bothered during a 6-3, 6-2 victory over the qualifier Kurumi Nara, or the top-seeded man, Novak Djokovic, who beat Henri Laaksonen, 6-1, 6-4, 6-3. Azarenka sought to control points with deep, attacking strokes and by going after Osaka’s backhand side. “I played very smart; I really played the right spots,” Azarenka said. “I was doing everything that I was supposed to do. And, especially, moving well and pushing her back.” Azarenka knows a thing or two about how to perform on the sport’s biggest stages. She won two titles at the Australian Open, reached two finals at the United States Open and was a semifinalist at Wimbledon and the French Open. She is currently ranked 43rd, though, because of time she missed over the past few seasons while pregnant and then dealing with a custody issue involving her son. So what, in terms of talent and tenacity, could have passed for a late-in-the-proceedings showdown at a major was held, instead, in Week 1. When Azarenka sprinted for a cross-court forehand winner that closed a 15-stroke exchange, she took a 4-2 lead in the second set after 77 minutes. She and Osaka played for more than an hour and a half after that, and Azarenka certainly had opportunities to edge even further ahead, including once when she had a break point to go up by 5-2 and serve for the victory but netted a forehand. Or the three times she was one point from leading by 5-3 but was broken there with her second double-fault of the game. Azarenka’s serve faltered down the stretch, and Osaka’s top-notch returning contributed to a key stretch in which she grabbed 9 of 11 games. “She has, obviously, a lot of confidence,” Azarenka said. Which Osaka should, of course, given that she won the U.S. Open in September and the Australian Open in January and is trying to become the first woman in tennis history to collect her first three Slam trophies in a row. “Today I kind of felt like a challenger,” she said. “Like, I know she went to the semis here before, so obviously she has a lot more experience here,” said Osaka, 21, who has never been past the third round in Paris but is 9-1 on clay in 2019 after entering the season with a 9-11 mark on the slow surface. “She won Grand Slams, and she was No. 1 way before I was. I’m still kind of new at this.” Dominic Thiem, the No. 4 seed in the men’s draw, overcame some trickery from Alexander Bublik of Kazakhstan and advanced to the third round with a 6-3, 6-7 (6), 6-3, 7-5 victory. Bublik surprised Thiem with an underhand serve in the first set and frustrated him with a series of drop shots, spins and volleys. But Thiem, a finalist last year at Roland Garros, recovered from a break of serve in the fourth set and then gave Bublik a taste of his own medicine on his first match point, producing a well-disguised — and successful — drop shot. Thiem will next face Pablo Cuevas, another master of trick shots. Cuevas was leading, 7-6 (3), 6-3, 2-1, when Kyle Edmund retired from their match because of a left knee injury. Eighth-seeded Juan Martín del Potro was also challenged, requiring nearly four hours to get by Yoshihito Nishioka, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, 6-7 (5), 6-2. The American teenager Amanda Anisimova pulled off an upset, defeating 11th-ranked Aryna Sabalenka, 6-4, 6-2. Anisimova, 17, also eliminated Sabalenka from the Australian Open, in the third round. Another teenager, Iga Swiatek, who turns 18 on Friday, knocked out 16th-seeded Wang Qiang, 6-3, 6-0, in under an hour to reach the third round of a Grand Slam tournament for the first time.",The New York Times
2019,2019 French Open: Upset of No. 2 Karolina Pliskova Opens Up the Women’s Draw Some More,"PARIS — A hard-to-predict French Open women’s singles tournament was thrown open even wider on Friday when second-seeded Karolina Pliskova was ousted before the event concluded its first week. Petra Martic, the No. 31 seed, dispatched Pliskova, 6-3, 6-3, in their third-round match on Philippe Chatrier Court, leaving the bottom half of the women’s draw with no seed higher than Sloane Stephens at No. 7. Only two players remaining on that side of the draw have won a Grand Slam tournament: Stephens and Garbiñe Muguruza, and they play each other in the next round. (Stephens won the 2017 United States Open, and Muguruza won the French in 2016 and Wimbledon in 2017.) “Draws are meant to fall apart,” Stephens said. While men’s tennis is top-heavy, with Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal or Roger Federer having won the last nine Grand Slam titles, the women’s game has far more variety. Eight women have won the last nine majors, and of the 12 premier tour events in 2019, there have been nine different winners. The top half of the draw, which plays its third-round matches on Saturday, still features such high-wattage luminaries as Naomi Osaka, winner of the last two Grand Slams; Serena Williams, winner of 23 majors; and Simona Halep, the defending French Open champion. Five of the top 10 seeds are still alive, but four of them are in the top half of the draw: No. 1 Osaka, No. 3 Halep, No. 8 Ashleigh Barty and No. 10 Williams. But with Pliskova’s loss on Friday and No. 4 Kiki Bertens’s withdrawal because of illness, the bottom half of the draw gained more uncertainty. There will be even more after either No. 7 Stephens or No. 19 Muguruza knocks the other one out on Sunday. Stephens, a finalist last year, beat Polona Hercog of Slovenia, 6-3, 5-7, 6-4, on Friday after failing to close out the match when serving for it in the second set. Muguruza is starting to flash the kind of elevated form that has led her to success at some major tournaments. Her winning percentage in tour events is .652, but in the majors, it is .741; at Roland Garros, she is 27-5. “I don’t know what is about French Open that gives me always a nice mood, and my tennis develops much better,” said Muguruza, who reached the semifinals in Paris last year. The results leave players like No. 12 Anastasija Sevastova of Latvia with a decent path to the semifinal. She saved five match points to defeat No. 20 Elise Mertens of Belgium, 6-7 (3), 6-4, 11-9, in 3 hours 18 minutes. Sevastova served well and played aggressively even on the match points, three of which she nailed with daring winners. In the fourth round Sevastova plays the unseeded Marketa Vondrousova, a 19-year-old from the Czech Republic, who beat No. 28 Carla Suárez Navarro, 6-4, 6-4. Sevastova, who lost to Williams in a U.S. Open semifinal last year, would not have to face a player ranked better than No. 31 until the semifinals, but she insisted that the draw was still difficult. “Everybody can play tennis here,” she said, “and there are so many young girls up and coming. Maybe they’re not seeded, but they play great on clay, like Martic.” Martic, a 28-year-old from Croatia, has 14 wins on clay this season, the most on the WTA tour. Pliskova, just two weeks ago, had won the Italian Open, the biggest clay-court title of her career. That victory vaulted her over Halep for the No. 2 spot in the rankings and at the French Open. Sevastova and Mertens captivated the crowd in the Suzanne Lenglen Court, many of whom were enjoying the match as an extended warm-up to Federer’s meeting with Casper Ruud, scheduled afterward on the same court. The earlier match was better, with Sevastova and Mertens pushing each other until Mertens finally cracked, allowing Sevastova to break her serve at 9-9 in the third. “At the end, you think, was she a worse player?” Sevastova said. “No. It is just a millimeter. It doesn’t make you a better or worse player. In the end, it’s a bit of luck.” Two matches from the top half of the draw needed to be concluded after they had been suspended on Thursday. No. 14 Madison Keys defeated Priscilla Hon, 7-5, 5-7, 6-3, and 27th-seeded Lesia Tsurenko, who turned 30 on Thursday, beat Aleksandra Krunic, 5-7, 7-5, 11-9. Tsurenko then revealed that she had been miserable the last few days, contemplating her tennis mortality. “I think the main mental problem yesterday was that I had a birthday, and I’m now 30,” she said. “I had so many things in my head that I would say it was one of the worst days of my life. I thought I will feel good, but actually I was not feeling well since the two days ago. I start to think about that I’m 30, and I don’t have much time left to play on tour and all this bad things.” Tsurenko is still alive in the draw, and even though her next opponent is Halep, there is still room for new winners in 2019.

2019,Country House Wins Kentucky Derby After Maximum Security Is Disqualified,"For the first time in the history of the race, the horse who crossed the finish line first was disqualified for interference and stripped of his title. LOUISVILLE, Ky. — This has not been horse racing’s finest hour: dead horses at Santa Anita Park and consternation among horse people that they can treat their athletes better but have failed to do so. It’s little wonder then that the 145th running of the Kentucky Derby on Saturday ended in astonishment, controversy and confusion. The Kentucky Derby, much like the Super Bowl, has become a place to see and be seen. Celebrities and wealthy people are everywhere, making the weekend a party with a race as the main distraction. On Saturday, Maximum Security won America’s most famous race on the track. Until he didn’t. For the first time in the history of the race, the horse who crossed the finish line first was disqualified for interference and stripped of his title, before a stunned crowd of more than 150,000. By all appearances, Maximum Security had outrun the field, remaining unbeaten and giving a hard-knocking trainer from the Mid-Atlantic, Jason Servis, and his up-and-coming jockey, Luis Saez, their first Derby victories. [A day later, people are still trying to figure out how horse racing moves on] But there was a problem — a big one. Maximum Security had jumped a puddle on the rain-soaked track and slid to the outside, not only impeding the progress of a rival, War of Will, but also forcing that colt’s rider, Tyler Gaffalione, to squeeze his knees and wrangle the reins just to stay aboard. So the racing stewards went to watch the video for five minutes, then 10 minutes, then nearly 22. “Leave it to the racing gods,” an increasingly anguished Servis said as he awaited the stewards’ decision. Not far away, Bill Mott, a Hall of Fame trainer, looked on placidly. His colt, Country House, had finished second. Mott was trackside and said on national television what horseplayers know, dread and curse on a regular basis. “There was definitely a foul in the race,” Mott said. “If this was a maiden claimer on a weekday the winner would come down.” Down came Maximum Security and up went Country House, a 65-1 improbable victor. It was not a popular decision, but it was a brave one that is certain to keep a battered old sport in the national consciousness for a little bit longer. Never before had a foul voided an apparent win at the Derby. One other horse has been stripped of victory: In 1968 a failed drug test led to the disqualification of Dancer’s Image days after the race, when Forward Pass was named the winner. This was the first Derby triumph for Mott, a horseman revered among his peers for being “half-horse,” as it was for Flavien Prat, a Frenchman who is now based in California. He has learned his lessons well here because it was his objection that set off the video scrutiny and ultimately changed (and made) history. After Maximum Security finished one and three-quarter lengths in front of Country House, it appeared the racing officials had either not seen the purported foul or did not think Maximum Security had kept a better horse from winning. But Prat protested — it is called an objection in racetrack parlance — meaning that the officials had to hear from him what happened and review the video. It was a crafty request, especially after Prat acknowledged that it was doubtful he and Country House were ever going to catch Maximum Security. “It kind of turned me sideways,” he said. “It was at the quarter pole and affected my momentum.” Mott, however, was more diplomatic about his rider’s complaint. “It may have affected it slightly, but it affected two other horses dramatically,” he said. Barbara Borden, chief steward for the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, would not take questions about the stewards’ decision, but said that they had determined that Maximum Security had “drifted out” and impeded Country House as well. The stakes were already high on Saturday for a declining sport that has quickly become an endangered one. Twenty-three horse deaths over a three-month span at Santa Anita Park in Southern California shut down racing there and produced calls to ban the sport. Here at Churchill Downs, 43 thoroughbreds were lost to racing injuries since 2016, an average of 2.42 per 1,000 starts, which was 50 percent higher than the national average during the same time. So it was with racing hearts and fraught nerves that the crowd of 150,729 sent off the field of 19 horses on a rainy day that left the racetrack as sticky as peanut butter and the horses and riders determined to find safe and strategic footing. It looked like Saez had guided Maximum Security to a winning path. He had the only undefeated horse in the field, and they bounded out of the gate and led the way into the first turn. The plan was to rocket Maximum Security to the lead and make the others catch him. If they could. He was in front through a fast half-mile of 46.62 seconds. Behind him, Prat and Country House were splashing along unhurried in eighth place. As Maximum Security turned for home, he skipped over a puddle, banging War of Will and setting off a chain reaction that broke the stride of Code of Honor and a couple of others. “My horse shied away from the noise of the crowd and may have ducked out a little,” Saez said. Mott believed him. “I don’t think Luis Saez did anything intentionally. He is an inexperienced horse,” said Mott, who considers Saez a friend. The trainer also knows Servis well. “My heart actually aches for them, but that’s the way it is,” he said. “I’ve been on the other end of it plenty of times, but just not in the Kentucky Derby.” As for Servis, he went from celebrating the biggest victory in his career to something close to despair. His younger brother John won this race with Smarty Jones in 2004 and now he was about to join him in the record books as the only brothers to train Derby champions. “I’m just trying to hold it together,” he said on television after he thought he had won. But the three stewards and, yes, the racing gods, decided he, Saez and a game Maximum Security belonged in the record books. “It’s tough,” Servis said. “It hasn’t sunk in yet, but it will.” Bettors call what Servis and Saez — and often themselves — endure a tough beat. This may be one of the toughest of all, one that the most casual horse fan will be talking about for years to come. Alas, it was someone else’s day. The record book will say that Country House won the mile-and-a-quarter race and collected a $1.86 million check for his owners and paid a whopping $132.40 for a $2 bet. “It’s bittersweet,” Mott said. Then he paused, and a smile crept into the corners of his mouth. “You always want to win with a clean trip and have the horse recognized as the great athlete that he is. So yeah, it diminishes it. I know they had a very tough decision. I wouldn’t want to be in their shoes. With all that said, I’m damn glad they put up our number.”",The New York Times

2019,"N.B.A. Draft Lottery Recap: Pelicans Win No. 1 Pick, and the Right to Select Zion Williamson","After months of breathless anticipation — and a race to the bottom of the standings by several teams — the New Orleans Pelicans shocked everyone by winning the N.B.A. draft lottery on Tuesday night, giving them the No. 1 pick in a draft that will include one of the most acclaimed prospects in league history: Duke’s Zion Williamson. For the Pelicans to win the lottery, the three teams with the worst records this season — the Knicks (17-65), the Cleveland Cavaliers (19-63) and the Phoenix Suns (19-63) — had to lose again. They each came into the night with a 14 percent chance of getting the top pick in a revamped system designed to reduce the value of finishing at the very bottom. The Knicks ended up with the No. 3 pick, the Cavaliers with No. 5 and the Suns with No. 6. New Orleans was tied for the seventh-best chance of getting the first pick — at just 6 percent — after finishing the season with a 33-49 record. Though not among the teams that appeared to tank for draft position, the Pelicans had trouble focusing all season because of drama surrounding a trade demand from their signature star, Anthony Davis. The question of what to do now about Davis — and possibly the rights to Williamson — will undoubtedly captivate the league in the lead-up to the draft at Barclays Center in Brooklyn on June 20. Regardless of whether New Orleans stays at No. 1 or trades the pick, the top choice in the draft will almost assuredly be used on the 18-year-old Williamson, a player who has received as much attention as any amateur since LeBron James went straight to the N.B.A. from high school in 2003. In an age in which 3-point-shooting skills seem to be valued above all else, Williamson is a throwback to a more rough-and-tumble era of the N.B.A. He stands 6 feet 7 inches and tips the scales at 280 pounds of sculpted muscle. He does much of his damage in the paint, using his power and his leaping ability to set up countless highlight-reel dunks. Williamson acknowledged the overwhelming hype while doing his best to appear humble ahead of Tuesday’s lottery. “The biggest challenge is just trying to live up to everyone’s expectations,” he said in an interview televised before the lottery. [The legend of Zion Williamson? That started long before he got to Duke.] The night could not have played out better for David Griffin, who was named the executive vice president of basketball operations for the Pelicans in April. Griffin’s previous team, the Cavaliers, got the No. 1 pick in the lottery three times during his tenure, and now the Pelicans, who have never advanced beyond the second round of the playoffs, have the top spot for the second time in their history. The first time was in 2012, when, while still using the nickname Hornets, they selected Davis. As the audience waited for Mark Tatum, the N.B.A.’s deputy commissioner, to announce the top four picks, Griffin stood onstage at the Hilton Chicago with the representatives of the three other teams that had yet to learn their fate. To his right loomed Patrick Ewing, the Hall of Fame Knicks center who was representing his former team, and to his left was Elliot Perry, a part-owner of the Memphis Grizzlies. After the No. 3 pick went to the Knicks, Griffin leaned into Perry to brace for the announcement of the runner-up. He celebrated as soon as the Grizzlies were named as the recipients of the No. 2 pick. “I think it’s just another positive event for us in what’s going to be — we hope — several that we stack together,” Griffin said immediately after the lottery. However enviable the Pelicans’ circumstances seemed in that moment, the team must resolve the complications of having a disgruntled superstar and the opportunity to pick Williamson, who plays power forward, the same position as Davis. Griffin has said since his hiring that he did not consider trading Davis a foregone conclusion and that he believes the addition of a player like Williamson could increase the odds that Davis chooses to stay. “I think if you look at the totality of where this organization is and where we’re going, we feel very strongly that we’re going be the environment he wants to be part of,” Griffin said. “And if we’re not, that’s fine. We can deal with it from there.” Whoever ends up with Williamson — be it the Pelicans or another team via trade — will get a terrific player on both ends of the court who became just the third freshman to win the Naismith Award, which recognizes the nation’s top college player. He averaged 22.6 points and 8.9 rebounds a game for the Blue Devils on their path to a round-of-8 appearance, with many feeling that the air drained out of the N.C.A.A. tournament when Duke was upset by Michigan State. Until that loss, the only thing that had slowed Williamson’s progress was a knee injury sustained when one of his sneakers split apart in the opening minute of a game against North Carolina in February. That moment, in which a shoe could not withstand the force of moving the giant player from side to side, seemed to bolster the Paul Bunyan-like hyperbole applied to Williamson, apparently without creating lasting physical problems for him. The overall lottery played out like this (with the picks from 15 to 30 coming in reverse order of the 2018-19 standings): 1. New Orleans Pelicans 2. Memphis Grizzlies 3. Knicks 4. Los Angeles Lakers 5. Cleveland Cavaliers 6. Phoenix Suns 7. Chicago Bulls 8. Atlanta Hawks (via Dallas) 9. Washington Wizards 10. Atlanta Hawks 11. Minnesota Timberwolves 12. Charlotte Hornets 13. Miami Heat 14. Boston Celtics (via Sacramento) In what should be viewed as a positive development by the league office, the fates of the Knicks, the Cavaliers and the Suns lent credibility to the new lottery system, which ended up flattening out the benefits of a bad record. This was the first draft under the new system, which team owners approved in 2017. In addition to lowering the worst team’s chance of getting the top pick to 14 percent from 25 percent, it gave every franchise aside from the three with the most losses a better shot at finishing high in the lottery. Ewing, who came to the Knicks as the No. 1 pick in 1985, the first year of the draft lottery, was unable to provide similar magic for a team that seemed to be pursuing the top pick so diligently that the director Spike Lee joked about it at this year’s Academy Awards. Instead it was Griffin’s Pelicans that came away with the biggest draft prize in 16 years. “This just jump-starts the process,” Griffin said while trying to play down his excitement. “It’ll be harder for me to mess it up than it would have been before this.”",The New York Times
2019,2019 Preakness: War of Will Wins in Dramatic Rebound From Kentucky Derby Loss,"BALTIMORE — The deep breaths came fast and furious in the opening moments of the 144th running of the Preakness Stakes, and for good reason: John Velazquez, a Hall of Fame jockey, was airborne one moment and in the dirt the next after his colt, Bodexpress, broke out of the starting gate like a rodeo horse rather than a thoroughbred. This old, tradition-steeped American sport could not withstand another catastrophe or controversy. Dead horses, too many of them, have drawn a bull’s-eye around its existence. A multimillion-dollar disqualification in the Kentucky Derby had first confused and then angered casual sports fans who tune in to horse racing for the five weeks in the spring that the Triple Crown commands their attention. Horse racing is on the ropes. Big time. When Velazquez rolled and then popped to his feet, thoroughbred lovers were given permission, for at least the next 1 minute 54.34 seconds, if not exactly to enjoy a horse race then at least to wish the horses a safe journey around Pimlico, a historic — read: dilapidated and old — racetrack. They did, and the middle jewel of the Triple Crown managed to deliver a satisfying, even redemptive story. The winner, War of Will, hugged the rail for most of the mile-and-three-sixteenths distance, just as he did in the Kentucky Derby, before scooting to the middle of the track and holding off the challenge of a long shot named Everfast. War of Will’s jockey, Tyler Gaffalione, rubbed his colt’s neck and trained his eyes between the horse’s ears. “I was just hoping we’d hold on,” he said. “I didn’t want to look back.” It’s easy to see why. Two weeks ago, beneath the twin spires of Churchill Downs, War of Will lost a chance at victory after tangling with Maximum Security as Gaffalione and his colt turned for home in the 145th running of the Derby, America’s most famous horse race. Maximum Security crossed the finish line first and appeared to be the emphatic winner until three Kentucky stewards, horse racing’s version of referees, ruled that the colt had jumped a puddle and impeded the progress of War of Will and two other horses. Maximum Security was disqualified, and his jockey, Luis Saez, was suspended for 15 days. In the days since, the owners of Maximum Security, Gary and Mary West, have filed a lawsuit in federal court asking that the disqualification be reversed. Mark Casse, the trainer of War of Will, took the Derby brouhaha in stride until the Wests and some of the betting public started pointing the fingers at Gaffalione and his colt. It did not sit well with Casse. “I felt joy and relief that we didn’t have the most disastrous incident in American horse racing history,” he said. Casse was right to be defiant. He thinks War of Will might have won the Derby. “If it wasn’t for the incident,” he said, “it would have been a great race down the lane.” He did not care if this year’s Preakness was a low-wattage affair. He didn’t care that Maximum Security was not here and that neither was Country House, the runner-up in the Derby that was declared the official winner. He was not going to apologize, either, that for the first time since 1951, the second leg of the Triple Crown did not include any of the first four horses that crossed the finish line in the Derby. “We just won the Preakness,” he said. “I really don’t care who was in it.” If Casse and Gaffalione felt as if they helped avert disaster in Kentucky and deserved some accolades at Pimlico, no one could blame them. Of late, any news about horse racing has been bad news. On Friday, a 3-year-old filly named Congrats Gal died soon after pulling up and finishing last in the Miss Preakness Stakes. Earlier that day at Santa Anita Park in Southern California, a 3-year-old gelding named Commander Coil became the 24th fatality at the racetrack since Dec. 26, a series of events that has twice led to the suspension of racing at the legendary track and threatened to close down the sport in the state forever. The fatality was the first since March 31 at Santa Anita, which announced a ban on the use of medication and whips on racing days after the 22nd death. “We’re looking at ourselves all the time of what we can do to improve, what the sport can do to improve,” said Tim Ritvo, chief operating officer of the Stronach Group, which owns Pimlico and Santa Anita. Ritvo knows the stakes are high, especially in California, where it takes just 600,000 signatures in a state of more than 39 million to get a ballot initiative before voters to decide if the sport should be banned. “We were really devastated and close to seeing racing go away,” he said. The record will show that War of Will earned a $990,000 first-place check for his owner, Gary Barber. He also rewarded his backers with $14.20 for a $2 bet. Someone asked Casse how much weirder this Triple Crown season can get. Doesn’t he just want to take his horse, and his victory, and go home? No, he said. “I think we’ve covered bizarre already, so no, I’m not worried,” Casse said, adding that if War of Will is healthy, he is on to the Belmont Stakes in three weeks. “This is the life we live each and every day.”",The New York Times

2019,"In Abortion Fight, 2020 Female Candidates Lead Call to Arms","For Senator Elizabeth Warren, the moment brought up memories of “back alley butchers” and “desperate women.” Senator Kamala Harris compared it to “a scene from ‘The Handmaid’s Tale.’” And Senator Kirsten Gillibrand warned about a “war on women,” calling for Americans to “fight like hell.” Female presidential candidates have charged into the battle over the new Alabama law that would, barring legal challenges, effectively outlaw abortions in the state, condemning it just minutes after the State Senate’s passage and continuing to sound the alarm as Gov. Kay Ivey signed it on Wednesday. Their swift responses were in contrast to those of two leading Democrats in the 2020 race, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who waited overnight to weigh in with their disapproval. “When I was growing up, people got abortions,” Ms. Warren of Massachusetts wrote on Twitter. “Some were lucky, but others weren’t. They all went through hell. Access to safe, legal abortion is a constitutional RIGHT. Full stop.” The repeated denunciations by the female candidates, in deeply personal terms that underscored the historic nature of six women running for president, not only intensified the spotlight on abortion policy but also raised questions about the role and influence of women in 2020. As candidates, volunteers and strategists, women powered the party’s gains in the 2018 midterms. Women are again expected to make up a majority of voters in next year’s Democratic primaries, placing them at the center of the political fight for the party’s nomination and the White House. Some Democrats believe that the abortion fight could rally female voters in 2020, but they are less sure that the issue will benefit the female candidates in the primary race. Jess Morales Rocketto, a Democratic operative and activist with Supermajority, a women’s political action group, applauded several of the female candidates for speaking out early and forcefully and said doing so could generate momentum for their campaigns. And she indicated that statements from Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg did not go far enough. “They should all understand it’s a five-alarm fire,” she said. But whether this issue transforms the standing of any of the female presidential candidates is another matter. “Whether or not that then makes people listen to her policy around infrastructure or something that isn’t seen as a quote-unquote women’s issue, I don’t know,” Ms. Morales Rocketto said. “I doubt it, to be totally frank.” Since the start of the primary contest late last year, Mr. Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont have topped national and early state polls, leaving the female candidates struggling to break into the double digits in polling. The abortion fight comes at a time when the women running for president are already grappling with fears among some Democrats that nominating a woman is too risky in 2020, given the imperative of beating President Trump. In interviews with voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, several pointed to the widespread recognition that women in politics are held to double standards compared with men on perceived characteristics like likability and toughness. Others are haunted by the Electoral College loss of Hillary Clinton, who has said she believes that sexism and misogyny contributed to the outcome. Often, Democrats argue for a woman on the ticket — as vice president. “Because of how bad it is right now I don’t think the country is ready to put a woman at the top of the ticket,” said Dee Jones, 72, a retired teacher from Deerfield, N.H. “But a vice president that’s a woman would be a nice change.” With the constitutional right to end a pregnancy at stake, the female candidates, including Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, saw an opportunity to cast themselves as champions of female voters, who intimately understand their fears of a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide. Ms. Gillibrand of New York announced that she would travel to Atlanta on Thursday to hold a round table with women at the Georgia State House. “Right now, the conversation about what women can do with our own bodies is being driven by too many male politicians,” she said. “It should be led by the actual experts: women and doctors. So I’m going to hear from the people most directly affected by abortion bans like Georgia’s.” Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey called on men to “speak out too.” “Not because women are our mothers, wives, daughters. Because women are people. And all people deserve to control their own bodies,” he tweeted. In emails and tweets to supporters, Ms. Harris of California and several other candidates solicited donations for abortion funds and other organizations that advocate women’s rights and access to health care. The measure was also assailed by Mr. Sanders, former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas and other candidates, who said the bill trampled on a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body. Several of the candidates used this week’s development in Alabama to speak more broadly about other policy and political matters, especially the judiciary. Mr. Sanders linked abortion access to his signature policy push, “Medicare for all.” “Abortion is health care,” he tweeted. “When we pass Medicare for All, we will be guaranteeing a woman’s right to control her own body by covering comprehensive reproductive care, including abortion.” Mr. Biden, meanwhile, offered one comment on the ruling, saying the Alabama measure and the fetal heartbeat bills passed by other states “clearly violate” the Supreme Court decision and “should be declared unconstitutional.” The former vice president, who once voted for a constitutional amendment that would have allowed states to overturn Roe v. Wade, has become more liberal on abortion rights over his four decades in office. “Roe v Wade is settled law and should not be overturned,” he wrote. “This choice should remain between a woman and her doctor.” Women are expected to make up a clear majority of voters in a Democratic primary — nearly 60 percent, according to Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who specializes in female voting behavior. But the evolution of abortion rights into a mainstay of the Democratic platform means the issue is unlikely to sway many votes in the primary, she said. “In a primary, Democrats assume all the candidate are very pro-choice so they would not see a distinction,” Ms. Lake said. “It’s disqualifying not to support abortion rights.” Strategists from both parties believe that the effects of the abortion ban could be far greater in a general election, when suburban women could, once again, emerge as a crucial swing voting bloc. While the push by Republicans to get the Supreme Court to reconsider the central holding in Roe v. Wade is likely to mobilize socially conservative voters who make up a key piece of their party base, it could turn off moderates and women. The Alabama law bans abortions at every stage of pregnancy and criminalizes the procedure for doctors, who could be charged with felonies and face up to 99 years in prison. It includes an exception for cases when the mother’s life is at serious risk, but not for cases of rape or incest — a subject of fierce debate among lawmakers in recent days. The procedure was not immediately outlawed, and it is far from clear when, or even if, the measure will ultimately take effect. While many conservatives cheered the new law, some Republicans expressed doubt that such a restrictive law would help the party politically in 2020. “It wouldn’t be a political winner among swing voters, that’s for certain,” said former Representative Ryan Costello, a Republican who represented a moderate suburban Philadelphia-area district through 2018. “Particularly among younger women, college-educated women, it could be an issue that they weigh a bit more heavily if something like this is front and center.” Other Republicans worry that the abortion fight is a distraction from the booming economy, an issue they would prefer to put at the center of the political conversation. Mr. Trump is running on the strongest economy of any president seeking re-election since Bill Clinton in 1996. The Alabama law represents the most far-reaching effort in the nation this year to curb abortion rights. Other states — including Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi and Ohio — have enacted restrictive bills, including so-called fetal heartbeat bills; these bills essentially ban abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, a time when many women do not yet know they are pregnant. “This plays against Republicans with the very voters they lost in the midterms,” said Rob Stutzman, a California-based G.O.P. strategist. “You have a lot of voters that may be nuanced in their perspective — they look at something like this and just think it’s a dramatic overreach.” That is the point Democrats plan to drive home to voters. In talking points circulated to supporters, the abortion rights organization Naral Pro-Choice America urged advocates to link the state bills directly to the White House, casting the measures as part of “Trump’s anti-choice movement” that is explicitly designed to “punish women.” “The G.O.P. has gone off the rails in terms of voters’ views on abortion,” Ilyse Hogue, president of the organization, said. “Women started to leave the party at record rates in 2018, and we’re going to make sure that trend continues well into 2020.”",The New York Times
2019,2020 Democrats Join McDonald’s Workers Striking Over Wages and Harassment,"As McDonald’s held its annual shareholder meeting on Thursday, several Democratic presidential candidates joined striking workers demanding a $15 minimum wage, union rights and better protection from sexual harassment. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont participated in a virtual forum with workers in Dallas, where the meeting was being held, and used his campaign email list to urge supporters to join workers at the picket lines. Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington spoke at a rally in Chicago; Julián Castro, the former housing secretary, made an appearance in Durham, N.C.; Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York joined workers in Des Moines; and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey called into a rally in Kansas City. “We’re here today to tell McDonald’s that it’s not acceptable to pay your workers a wage they can’t live on,” Mr. Castro said, adding that his campaign would boycott McDonald’s until it increased its minimum wage to $15 an hour, let workers unionize and addressed their complaints of sexual harassment. “I want to thank you all for using your voice and rising up to put pressure on McDonald’s to make that happen, because the only way that it’s going to happen is if we take action,” he said. Mr. Sanders focused sharply on the issue of wages, noting that McDonald’s reported $1.4 billion in profit in the last quarter of 2018 and paid its chief executive $22 million. “If McDonald’s has enough money to buy back $22 billion of its own stock,” he said on Twitter, “it damn well has enough money to pay all of its workers at least $15 an hour.” But by using his campaign’s huge email list to mobilize support for the striking workers, he went beyond the usual expressions of solidarity. Democratic candidates often show up at picket lines; several did so just last month when Stop & Shop workers went on strike. It’s also common enough for candidates to send out emails reiterating their support for workers. But they very rarely use their lists to encourage attendance at protests that are unrelated to their campaigns. Eleven other candidates — former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., former Representative John Delaney of Maryland, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Senator Kamala Harris of California, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas, Representative Eric Swalwell of California and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts — expressed support for the workers. Hundreds walked out on Thursday, and at least a handful of McDonald’s locations were closed for the day as a result. Labor has long been a powerful Democratic constituency, and unions’ endorsements — not to mention their money — can be highly influential, especially in primaries. And as Democrats try to win back some of the working-class voters who supported President Trump in 2016, many of them are presenting themselves as left-wing populist alternatives to Mr. Trump’s right-wing populism. With the Iowa caucuses more than seven months away, few of the big unions have settled on a candidate. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has received the only major labor endorsement so far, from the International Association of Fire Fighters. A $15 minimum wage, described as a radical proposal just a few years ago, has largely become a point of consensus among the Democratic candidates. Several cities and states are phasing it in; in some places, including New York City, it is already in effect. But the federal minimum remains $7.25, and while McDonald’s has stopped lobbying against legislation to increase it, it has not raised the bar for its own employees. The company argues that because most of its locations are franchises, it can’t mandate a higher minimum. McDonald’s is also under fire for its handling of sexual harassment. Just this week, the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund announced more than 20 complaints against the company, alleging not only sexual harassment but also gender-based discrimination, as well as retaliation when workers reported misconduct.",The New York Times
2019,2020 Democrats on Impeachment: Where They Stand,"[Update, May 29: After Robert S. Mueller III’s public remarks, more Democratic presidential candidates called for impeachment proceedings.] Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called for Congress to begin impeachment proceedings against President Trump after the release of the redacted Mueller report last month, arguing that Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, “put the next step in the hands of Congress.” But many of her competitors stayed quiet on the issue, amid fear that a failed effort would strengthen Mr. Trump’s re-election chances, and because voters were not clamoring for impeachment on the campaign trail. Many also argue that the Republican majority in the Senate is unlikely to vote to remove Mr. Trump, making a House effort to impeach him a moot point. [Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday that House Democrats were “not on a path to impeachment.”] Beto O’Rourke, former representative of Texas, had been among those who suggested that Mr. Trump’s fate was best left to voters. But now he is calling for Congress to move toward impeachment, arguing that Democrats should not worry that it would antagonize the president’s base. “If we do nothing because we are afraid of the polls or the politics, or the repercussions in the next election, we will set a precedent that, in fact, some people, because of the position of power and public trust that they hold, are above the law,” he said at a CNN town hall event in Iowa on Tuesday. Here’s a look at what the other candidates for the Democratic nomination have said about impeachment. Senator Kamala Harris of California has said that she thinks Congress “should take the steps toward impeachment,” though she was added that she was realistic about the probable outcome in the Senate. “I think we have very good reason to believe that there is an investigation that has been conducted, which has produced evidence that tells us that this president and his administration engaged in obstruction of justice,” she said at a CNN event last month. In the same vein, Ms. Warren has argued that “to ignore a president’s repeated efforts to obstruct an investigation into his own disloyal behavior would inflict great and lasting damage on this country.” Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts called for starting an impeachment inquiry on MSNBC on Tuesday. “We have a constitutional responsibility to act as a check on the executive,” he said, even if the effort does not succeed because of Republican opposition. Julián Castro, the former housing secretary and former mayor of San Antonio, said on CNN last month that “it would be perfectly reasonable” for Congress to begin impeachment proceedings. “It’s clear that Bob Mueller, in his report, left that in the hands of Congress,” he argued. Representative Eric Swalwell of California, who sits on the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, said on Twitter on May 6 that “impeachment may be the only road to save our country.” Wayne Messam, mayor of Miramar, Fla., supports impeachment as well. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has said that if Democrats focus on impeachment and the Mueller report for the duration of the campaign, at the expense of talking about issues like health care and climate change, it could work to Mr. Trump’s advantage. Who’s in, who’s out and who’s still thinking. Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii has said that she doesn’t think impeachment is the way to defeat Mr. Trump. On Fox News last month, she voiced concerns about the “continued divisiveness and putting partisan political interests ahead of the interest of the people.” Andrew Yang, a businessman from New York with a sizable online following, said on Twitter last month that his focus is on beating Mr. Trump at the ballot box “and solving the problems that got him elected in the first place.” Marianne Williamson, a self-help author who is calling for a “moral and spiritual awakening in the country,” has said that Mr. Trump is “goading us to impeach him.” Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey has said it is premature to discuss impeachment, since lawmakers still do not have an unredacted version of the Mueller report and Mr. Mueller has not testified on Capitol Hill since its release. “There’s a lot more investigation that should go on before Congress comes to any conclusions like that,” he said during a campaign event in Nevada last month. John Hickenlooper, the former governor of Colorado, also said last month that the decision to move forward with impeachment proceedings shouldn’t be made until Democrats receive an unredacted version of the report. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York told Politico this month that impeachment “should be left on the table,” but she also said that Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s efforts to slow the rush to impeach are smart. Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president, said in an interview with “Good Morning America” on April 30 that for now, Congress should continue its own investigations. But if the administration tries to block those inquiries, Congress would have “no alternative” but to “go to the only other constitutional resort they have, which is impeachment,” Mr. Biden said. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado said on “Face the Nation” on May 12 that he was “not ready to say the president should be impeached.” Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana did not answer directly when asked whether he supports impeachment during his first television interview as a candidate, conducted last week. “I support Congress doing full investigations as they should. That’s their job,” Bullock said. He added, “People are more worried about, ‘Am I going to be able to afford college? Is my kid going to get sick?’” John Delaney, a former congressman from Maryland, applauded Representative Justin Amash, a Republican from Michigan, for calling for Mr. Trump’s impeachment this week, without repeating the call himself. Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., said during a CNN town hall event last month that Mr. Trump had “made it pretty clear he deserves impeachment.” But he said he would leave it to lawmakers to “figure out.” Bill de Blasio, mayor of New York, said on WNYC last month that he was “worried about people putting a lot of energy into … hoping for an impeachment proceeding that is not on the horizon when we should be thinking about the issues facing us right now.” Most candidates have said they could reassess their views once the open investigations conclude. Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio, Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have said they are waiting for the investigations to play out. “There could come out new facts that would make impeachment a much more realistic and immediate option,” Mr. de Blasio said on WNYC. “But today it does not exist.”",The New York Times
2019,22 Art Exhibitions to View in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to new art shows and some that will be closing soon. ‘ARTISTS RESPOND: AMERICAN ART AND THE VIETNAM WAR, 1965-1975’ (through Aug. 18) and ‘TIFFANY CHUNG: VIETNAM, PAST IS PROLOGUE’ (through Sept. 2) at Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington. Everything in “Artists Respond,” a big, inspiriting blast of a historical survey, dates from a time when the United States was losing its soul, and its artists — some, anyway — were trying to save theirs by denouncing a racist war. Figures well known for their politically hard-hitting work — Judith Bernstein, Leon Golub, Hans Haacke, Peter Saul, Nancy Spero — are here in strength. But so are others, like Dan Flavin and Donald Judd and Barnett Newman, seldom associated with visual activism. Concurrent with the survey is a smaller, fine-tuned show by a contemporary Vietnamese-born artist, Tiffany Chung; it views the war through the eyes of people on the receiving end of aggression. (Holland Cotter) 202-663-7970, americanart.si.edu ‘AUSCHWITZ. NOT LONG AGO. NOT FAR AWAY’ at the Museum of Jewish Heritage (through Jan. 3). Killing as a communal business, made widely lucrative by the Third Reich, permeates this traveling exhibition about the largest German death camp, Auschwitz, whose yawning gatehouse, with its converging rail tracks, has become emblematic of the Holocaust. Well timed, during a worldwide surge of anti-Semitism, the harrowing installation strives, successfully, for fresh relevance. The exhibition illuminates the topography of evil, the deliberate designing of a hell on earth by fanatical racists and compliant architects and provisioners, while also highlighting the strenuous struggle for survival in a place where, as Primo Levi learned, “there is no why.” (Ralph Blumenthal) 646-437-4202, mjhnyc.org ‘MATTHEW BARNEY: REDOUBT’ at Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven (through June 16). The wildly innovative sculptor and filmmaker, Yale class of 1989, heads back to the halls of ivy to present his first major project since the six-hour excremental eruption of “River of Fundament.” The exhibition shows Barney in a lighter, nimbler mode than he has displayed in years. The new film “Redoubt,” shot in his home state of Idaho, riffs on the myth of Diana and Actaeon; the goddess, here, is an NRA-approved sharpshooter, while the doomed voyeur is the artist himself, making plein-air etchings of Diana and her attendants. Related copper etchings appear in the show, and Barney has electroplated them over varying times, encrusting them with weird metal nodules. “Redoubt” lacks the operatic grandeur some of Barney’s fanboys prefer. But it’s the most emancipated work of his career, and it should make a star of Eleanor Bauer, the dancer and choreographer whom he has entrusted with the film’s most beautiful movement sequences. The film runs about two hours and screens on Saturday afternoons and on select weekdays; check the website for times. (Jason Farago) 203-432-0600, artgallery.yale.edu ‘CAMP: NOTES ON FASHION’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Sept. 8). Inspired by Susan Sontag’s famous 1964 essay, “Notes on ‘Camp,’” the latest spectacular from the Met’s Costume Institute attempts to define this elastic, constantly evolving concept, which leaves taste, seriousness and heteronormativity in the dust. The show researches camp’s emergence in 18th-century France and 19th-century England, examines “Sontagian Camp” and culminates in an immense gallery of designer confectionaries from the 1980s to now that calls to mind a big, shiny Christmas tree barricaded with presents. (Roberta Smith) 212-535-7100, metmuseum.org ‘LEONARD COHEN: A CRACK IN EVERYTHING’ at the Jewish Museum (through Sept. 8). The curators of this show, John Zeppetelli of the Musée d’Art Contemporain de Montréal and Victor Shiffman, commissioned artists of various disciplines to develop pieces inspired by Cohen. Some are simple and quiet, like “Ear on a Worm” from the film artist Tacita Dean, a small image playing on a loop high in the space that shows a perched bird, a reference to “Bird on the Wire” from Cohen’s 1969 album “Songs From a Room.” Some are closer to traditional documentary, like George Fok’s “Passing Through,” which intercuts performances by Cohen throughout his career with video that surrounds the viewer, suggesting the songs are constant and eternal while the performer’s body changes with time. Taken together, the layered work on display has a lot to offer on Cohen, but even more to say about how we respond to music, bring it into our lives, and use it as both a balm and an agent for transformation. (Mark Richardson) 212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org ‘THE JIM HENSON EXHIBITION’ at the Museum of the Moving Image (ongoing). The rainbow connection has been established in Astoria, Queens, where this museum has opened a new permanent wing devoted to the career of America’s great puppeteer, who was born in Mississippi in 1936 and died, too young, in 1990. Henson began presenting the short TV program “Sam and Friends” before he was out of his teens; one of its characters, the soft-faced Kermit, was fashioned from his mother’s old coat and would not mature into a frog for more than a decade. The influence of early variety television, with its succession of skits and songs, runs through “Sesame Street” and “The Muppet Show,” though Henson also spent the late 1960s crafting peace-and-love documentaries and prototyping a psychedelic nightclub. Young visitors will delight in seeing Big Bird, Elmo, Miss Piggy and the Swedish Chef; adults can dig deep into sketches and storyboards and rediscover some old friends. (Farago) 718-784-0077, movingimage.us ‘LINCOLN KIRSTEIN’S MODERN’ at the Museum of Modern Art (through June 15). With George Balanchine, the indefatigable Kirstein (1907-96) founded the School of American Ballet and the New York City Ballet. But he was also an impassioned writer, collector, curator and devotee of photography who had much to do with MoMA in its early years. The museum commemorates his complex career with art, letters and ballet ephemera, drawn from its vast holdings. (Smith) 212-708-9400, moma.org ‘ALICJA KWADE: PARAPIVOT’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Oct. 27). This shrewd and scientifically inclined artist, born in Poland and based in Berlin, has delivered the best edition in five years of the Met’s hit-or-miss rooftop sculpture commission. Two tall armatures of interlocking steel rectangles, the taller of them rising more than 18 feet, support heavy orbs of different-colored marble; some of the balls perch precariously on the steel frames, while others, head-scratchingly, are squinched between them. Walk around these astral abstractions and the frames seem to become quotation marks for the transformed skyline of Midtown; the marbles might be planets, each just as precarious as the one from which they’ve been quarried. (Farago) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org ‘MAYBE MAYBE NOT: CHRISTOPHER WOOL AND THE HILL COLLECTION’ at the Hill Art Foundation (through June 28). This foundation’s inaugural show presents more than a dozen paintings, works on paper and photographs by Wool, the painter who wrenched abstraction into the No Wave era. In a stenciled painting from 1989, the drippy black letters of the word “SPOKESMAN” are arranged three by three, filling the white aluminum background with the same deductive logic as Frank Stella’s early stripes. After making layered, silk-screened floral patterns in the 1990s, Wool became more gestural; three extraordinary paintings here from the 2000s, with cloudy spray-gun loop-de-loops and merciless erasures, exhibit a simultaneous love and doubt of abstraction that recalls the best of Albert Oehlen. His enthrallingly difficult later silk screens cannibalize his own archive, discordantly remixing earlier works and treating paint as both material and information. (Farago) 212-337-4455, hillartfoundation.org ‘JOAN MIRÓ: BIRTH OF THE WORLD’ at the Museum of Modern Art (through June 15). Drawn mostly from MoMA’s unrivaled Miró collection, this fabulous exhibition is best when tracing the artist’s brilliant early twists on Modernism and their swift ascent to “The Birth of the World,” a 1927 masterpiece that presaged the drips and stains of radical painting two decades hence. Unappreciated in its time, it was barely exhibited until 1968. (Smith) 212-708-9400, moma.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] ‘PLAY IT LOUD: INSTRUMENTS OF ROCK & ROLL’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Oct. 1). Presented in collaboration with the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, this exhibition offers a vision of history in which the rock music that flowered in the 1960s and ’70s sits firmly at the center. The format of the rock band provides the structure of the show, with one room given over to the rhythm section and another showcasing “Guitar Gods.” Yet another room has a display highlighting the guitar’s destruction, with pieces of instruments trashed by Kurt Cobain and Pete Townshend. To the extent that it shifts focus toward the tools of the rock trade, the show is illuminating. Of particular interest is the room set aside for “Creating a Sound,” which focuses on the sonic possibility of electronics. The lighting in “Play It Loud” is dim, perhaps reflecting rock music as the sound of the night. Each individual instrument shines like a beacon, as if it’s catching the glint of an onstage spotlight. It makes the space between audience member and musician seem vast, but that doesn’t diminish the wonder of browsing the tools once used by pop royalty. (Richardson) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org ‘PUNK LUST: RAW PROVOCATION 1971-1985’ at the Museum of Sex (through Nov. 30). This show begins with imagery from the Velvet Underground: The 1963 paperback of that title, an exploration of what was then called deviant sexual behavior and gave the band its name, is one of the first objects on display. Working through photos, album art and fliers by artists like Iggy Pop, the New York Dolls, Patti Smith and, yes, the Sex Pistols, the exhibition demonstrates how punk offered a space for sexual expression outside the mainstream. In the story told by “Punk Lust,” much of it laid out in placards by the writer and musician Vivien Goldman, one of the show’s curators, graphic sexual imagery is a tool for shock that frightens away the straight world and offers comfort to those who remain inside. While some of the power dynamic is typical — underage groupies cavorting with rock stars — images from female, queer and nonbinary artists like Jayne County and the Slits make a strong case for sex as an essential source of punk liberation. (Richardson) 212-689-6337, museumofsex.com ‘SCENES FROM THE COLLECTION’ at the Jewish Museum (ongoing). After a surgical renovation to its grand pile on Fifth Avenue, the Jewish Museum has reopened its third-floor galleries with a rethought, refreshed display of its permanent collection, which intermingles 4,000 years of Judaica with modern and contemporary art by Jews and gentiles alike — Mark Rothko, Lee Krasner, Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman and the excellent young Nigerian draftswoman Ruby Onyinyechi Amanze. The works are shown in a nimble, nonchronological suite of galleries, and some of its century-spanning juxtapositions are bracing; others feel reductive, even dilettantish. But always, the Jewish Museum conceives of art and religion as interlocking elements of a story of civilization, commendably open to new influences and new interpretations. (Farago) 212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org ‘THE SELF-PORTRAIT, FROM SCHIELE TO BECKMANN’ at the Neue Galerie (through June 24). Self-portraiture can seem pretty narrow. But the 70-odd works in this exhibition, which run from a handful of delightfully exact Rembrandt etchings to Felix Nussbaum’s searing 1940 painting “Self-Portrait in the Camp,” ably demonstrate the genre’s universal scope: It’s a consciously constructed illusion of spontaneous self-revelation, a sincere put-on. And as such it’s a peek beneath the hood of art in general. (Will Heinrich)212-994-9493, neuegalerie.org ‘TOO FAST TO LIVE, TOO YOUNG TO DIE: PUNK GRAPHICS, 1976-1986’ at the Museum of Arts and Design (through Aug. 18). Many of the objects on display in this exhibition were first hung in record stores or in the bedrooms of teenagers. Posters promoting new albums, tours and shows are mixed in with album art, zines, buttons and other miscellany. Most of the pieces are affixed to the walls with magnets and are not framed, and almost all show signs of wear. The presentation reinforces that this was commercial art meant for wide consumption, and the ragged edges and prominent creases in the works make the history feel alive. (Richardson)212-299-7777, madmuseum.org ‘T. REX: THE ULTIMATE PREDATOR’ at the American Museum of Natural History (through Aug. 9, 2020). Everyone’s favorite 18,000-pound prehistoric killer gets the star treatment in this eye-opening exhibition, which presents the latest scientific research on T. rex and also introduces many other tyrannosaurs, some discovered only this century in China and Mongolia. T. rex evolved mainly during the Cretaceous period to have keen eyes, spindly arms and massive conical teeth, which could bear down on prey with the force of a U-Haul truck; the dinosaur could even swallow whole bones, as affirmed here by a kid-friendly display of fossilized excrement. The show mixes 66-million-year-old teeth with the latest 3-D prints of dino bones, and also presents new models of T. rex as a baby, a juvenile and a full-grown annihilator. Turns out this most savage beast was covered with — believe it! — a soft coat of beige or white feathers. (Farago) 212-769-5100, amnh.org ‘2019 WHITNEY BIENNIAL’ at the Whitney Museum of American Art (through Sept. 22). Given the political tensions that have sent spasms through the nation over the past two years, you might have expected — hoped — that this year’s biennial would be one big, sharp Occupy-style yawp. It isn’t. Politics are present but, with a few notable exceptions, murmured, coded, stitched into the weave of fastidiously form-conscious, labor-intensive work. As a result, the exhibition, organized by two young Whitney curators, Rujeko Hockley and Jane Panetta, gives the initial impression of being a well-groomed group show rather than a statement of resistance. But once you start looking closely, the impression changes artist by artist, piece by piece — there’s quiet agitation in the air. (Cotter) 212-570-3600, whitney.org ‘JEFF WALL’ at Gagosian (through July 26). Rumination and risk-taking, in equal measure, mark this conceptual photographer’s spellbinding new exhibition. The show, Wall’s first at this Chelsea gallery since ending a 25-year run with the rival dealer Marian Goodman, feels decidedly introspective. Figures alone in contemplative trances, or alienated from their partners in scenes of evident tension, define most of the works. The encyclopedic visual literacy that has long characterized Wall’s pictures (with their compositional echoes of old master paintings) has been pared back, allowing more psychological complexity to emerge. Just as new is an emphasis on narrative and sequence; among the pieces are two diptychs and an enveloping, cinematic triptych. (Karen Rosenberg) 212-741-1717, gagosian.com ‘THE WORLD BETWEEN EMPIRES: ART AND IDENTITY IN THE ANCIENT MIDDLE EAST’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through June 23). The Met excels at epic-scale archaeological exhibitions, and this is a prime example. It brings together work made between 100 B.C. and A.D. 250 in what we now know as Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. In the ancient world, all were in the sphere of two competing superpowers — Rome to the west and Parthia to the east — and though imperial influence was strong, it was far from all-determining. Each of the subject territories selectively grafted it onto local traditions to create distinctive new grass-roots cultural blends. Equally important, the show addresses the fate of art from the past in a politically fraught present. (Cotter) 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org ‘SIAH ARMAJANI: FOLLOW THIS LINE’ at the Met Breuer (through June 2). Born in Iran, Armajani has been living in the United States since 1960. This retrospective ranges from work he did as a teenage activist in Tehran to models of the many public sculptures he has produced across America over the past five decades. It introduces us to a sharp social thinker, a wry (and increasingly melancholic) metaphysician, a plain-style visual poet and, above all, an artist-ethicist. “Bridge Over Tree,” Armajani’s wonderful large-scale sculpture presented by Public Art Fund at Brooklyn Bridge Park (on the Empire Fulton Ferry Lawn through Sept. 29) to coincide with the Met show, is well timed for our present era of sundering moral confusion and offers ways forward from it. (Cotter) 212-731-1675, metmuseum.org ‘MORONI: THE RICHES OF RENAISSANCE PORTRAITURE’ at the Frick Collection (through June 2). Moroni, among the best of underappreciated Renaissance painters, brought a new level of naturalism to his subjects, who included lavishly dressed aristocrats but also scholars and tradesmen. (See his depiction of an extraordinarily handsome, sensitive and contemporary-looking tailor.) We seem to be looking at real people as they existed, unidealized, meticulously observed and psychologically present, especially in their direct, appraising gazes. A thrilling show. (Smith) 212-288-0700, frick.org ‘RADICALISM IN THE WILDERNESS: JAPANESE ARTISTS IN THE GLOBAL 1960S’ at Japan Society (through June 9). This sturdy addition to our story of the global 1960s, organized by the respected art historian Reiko Tomii, introduces American audiences to three bold positions in Japanese art — by one solo figure and two collectives who all worked far from the lights of Tokyo. Yutaka Matsuzawa, a Conceptualist with a Buddhist streak working in a forest near Nagano, made posters and mail art that aimed to imagine a world of total nothingness. The group GUN, in agrarian Niigata, produced breathtaking land art by filling pesticide sprayers with pigment and spewing color across fresh snow. And the Play, a collective in the Kansai region, sailed together on barges or built tree houses on hillsides to rediscover freedoms beyond social boundaries. The lesson: It’s not just the opposition of East and West that needs rethinking, but that of the metropolis and the sticks. (Farago) 212-715-1258, japansociety.org",The New York Times
2019,"22 Movies? This Marvel Universe Has 1,000 Chapters","Marvel Comics No. 1000, due in August, continues a story that began in 1939, with 80 creative teams for its 80 pages. Marvel Comics turns 80 in August. To celebrate, the company is releasing Marvel Comics No. 1000, which follows its heroes from Day 1 in 1939, long before they became the global entertainment phenomenon they are today. Each page of the comic will correlate to one year in Marvel history. Along the way, readers will see many of the marquee characters from the mighty Marvel universe like Captain America, Thor and Iron Man, and some less familiar ones, like Blue Marvel, Night Thrasher and the Three X’s. “This is by far the most complex and complicated and difficult book I’ve ever had to assemble,” Tom Brevoort, Marvel’s executive editor and senior vice president of publishing, said in a conference call with C.B. Cebulski, Marvel’s editor in chief. While most comic books are created by one writer and one art team, Issue No. 1000 will have 80 — one team for each of its 80 pages. The company began teasing the project in issues that arrived in stores this week: Comics on Wednesday featured advertisements with one, two or three names, along with the words “August 2019” against a background collage of historic Marvel covers. There was a lot of buzz among fans. Those named in the ads are contributors to the anniversary anthology, a group that includes both industry veterans and some new to comic books, like the filmmakers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller and the rapper Taboo of the Black Eyed Peas. Cebulski said the newcomers were recruited based on the fact that they made Marvel references over the years that were noted in-house. “Our characters are mentioned in so many different ways and in so many different mediums and we always keep track,” Cebulski said. “Now these distinguished individuals are able to contribute back to the comics they grew up on.” Marvel’s publishing history started on Aug. 31, 1939, with the arrival on newsstands of Marvel Comics No. 1. It was published by Timely Comics, a forerunner of Marvel. Namor, the Sub-Mariner, the android Human Torch (not to be confused with the 1961 Fantastic Four character with the same name) appeared for the first time — along with other characters, including a costumed detective named the Angel. The first panel of the story in No. 1000, which has a painted cover by Alex Ross, comes from that 1939 issue. It’s fitting, because the story reveals the mystery that propelled the Marvel universe from its inception and involves an artifact known as the Eternity Mask. Al Ewing, who is currently the writer of The Immortal Hulk, helped conceive the creative jigsaw puzzle that is Marvel 1000. His gift for intricacies can be seen in his You Are Deadpool comic, drawn by Salva Espin and Paco Diaz, which combined choose-your-own-adventure options and dice rolls to move readers through the story. He jumped at the chance to participate in the project. “This is the kind of honor that doesn’t really come that often,” Ewing said by phone. Comic-book historians may wonder how this is No. 1000 of Marvel Comics, given the history of the title. It was called Marvel Comics for the first issue and then became Marvel Mystery Comics and later Marvel Tales, until it reached issue No. 159, when it was canceled in 1957. While the industry sometimes engages in numerical gymnastics — with issues numbered zero or using decimal points — in this case, it is much simpler. Marvel wanted to give fans a tangible touch point for the 80th anniversary, Brevoort said. “More than anything, it was a symbolic thing.”",The New York Times
2019,25 Writers on Their Favorite Beach Vacations,"From paddleboarding in Colorado to bachata music in Puerto Rico, we asked writers to tell us what makes their beach vacations the best. The City Park and Beach on Lake Coeur d’Alene in Idaho.CreditCreditLeah Nash for The New York Times Choose any beach vacation town, and you can expect to find a few things — water, sand, probably ice cream, possibly a Ferris wheel. But it takes a little more to make a spot the kind of place that people from the nearest big town and beyond return to summer after summer, sometimes for generations. We chose 25 wildly different destinations around the country — from the comically perfect shore of the Florida Panhandle to Iowan lakeside Americana to the finicky coast of the Pacific Northwest — and asked writers who love them to explain their charms. West | Midwest | The Gulf | East | Puerto Rico The Washoe people have long revered Lake Tahoe, a sapphire bowl nestled on the border of California and Nevada. So, too, the climbers rocking the #vanlife, stand-up paddle boarders, mountain bikers, outdoor enthusiasts and families alike who flock to the largest alpine lake in the country. Much of the 72-mile shoreline is steep, boulder-strewn and thick with pine trees, making the sandy public beaches an even bigger draw. Favorites include Commons Beach and nearby Kings Beach, where I’ve skipped pebbles and pondered the granite peaks since childhood. Now my twin sons delight in the brisk waters too. Who goes there: Many visitors come from Northern California and Western Nevada, staying in vacation rental homes, funky motels or bougier options a short drive away at the mountain resorts of Northstar and Squaw Valley. Must-eat: The tangy, tender ribs at Moe’s Original Barbecue in Tahoe City. Grab a local microbrew and dine on the deck overlooking the lake. VANESSA HUA Packing for a beach weekend on this Marin County peninsula isn’t like packing for beach weekends back East. Yes, I always bring a bathing suit, maybe even a sundress, but I don’t always wear them. Woolly hats and hoodies and hiking shoes, though? Every time. Point Reyes isn’t for lazing in the sun (which is inevitably steamrollered by the fog anyway). It’s for braving the cold of the Pacific, trekking through herds of tule elk and slurping barbecued oysters on Tomales Bay. And on a rare superhot, Cape Cod-level-crowded Saturday: trying to find your friends, sans cell service, for sunset on Limantour’s endless stretch of sand. Who goes there: Yoga-bending and bay-swimming retirees; couples who consider kayaking more romantic than wine tasting; and families who’ve owned creaky cabins for generations. Must-eat: The owners of the famed Hog Island Oyster Farm in Marshall recently took over Tony’s Seafood down the road and are now serving their barbecued sweetwaters, and more, on the water (without the wind). RACHEL LEVIN Californians are spoiled for beaches, which might explain why, even when it’s 75 and sunny, there tends to be room to sprawl on the flat, wide stretch of sand that sits between Cabrillo Boulevard and the Pacific. Stearns Wharf, a 1,940-foot wooden pier that divides Santa Barbara’s east and west beaches, has a handful of seafood joints as well as a natural-history museum with an aquarium stocked with sharks, rays and sea urchins. But there could be another reason for the relative lack of crowds: the wealth of things to do a mere block from the ocean — fine dining, wine-tasting rooms and hawkers of upmarket street food abound in the “Funk Zone.” Who goes there: Angelenos seeking a break from gridlock, “nature lovers” and pinot-noir fiends who want a side of beach with their wine tastings. Transportation tip: If you’re coming from Los Angeles, skip the traffic and take the train — the Santa Barbara Amtrak station is a short walk from the beach. SHEILA MARIKAR In the summer, tourists from around the world crowd Rocky Mountain National Park, turning Colorado’s best-known getaway into an international traffic jam. For those looking for a quieter mountain escape — and a beach — there is Grand Lake. Located next to the southwest corner of the park, at more than 8,000 feet above sea level, the town sits on a large, deep lake surrounded by the Rockies. On offer: paddleboarding, kayaking, boating, fishing, swimming and hiking. Who goes there: Denver families; out-of-staters escaping Rocky Mountain National Park. Where to stay: Cabins, hotels and bed-and-breakfasts are all options, and the Western Riviera has lakefront access. For those who want an earthier experience, camp at nearby Lake Granby, where you can pitch a tent next to the beach. Uniform: This is not Aspen. Expect Birkenstocks and cowboy boots — and wet suits. The water can be icy. Travel tip: Drive the slow route in from Denver by taking U.S. 36 West to U.S. 34 West. This takes you onto Trail Ridge Road, a 40-mile stretch that climbs 4,000 feet in minutes and offers a sweeping view into the center of the Rockies. During a few summer weeks, you’ll find bursts of alpine wildflowers in red, pink and purple. JULIE TURKEWITZ Among the rolling scablands and flammable forests of the Inland Northwest, open water is as scarce as hoppy beer is ubiquitous. No wonder so many locals flee annually to Coeur d’Alene, where the lake is icy, the motorboats are loud and the vibe is about as chichi as North Idaho gets (think Jackson Hole for people who’d rather ride Jet Skis than horses). Once trafficked by miners and fur trappers, the 25-mile-long lake today attracts a more glamorous set: Last year TMZ dubbed it New North Hollywood after Kanye and Kim spent July 4 in one of the mansions that dot — some would say blight — the lake. Who goes there: Tatted-up teenagers from rural Idaho and R.V.-ing retirees share the lake with wealthy Californians who consider Lake Tahoe passé. Not that they actually rub shoulders — visitors to the lavish Coeur d’Alene Resort steer well clear of the plebes’ campgrounds — but, hey, we all pee in the same lake. Initiation rite: Cliff-jump into Lake Coeur d’Alene from the rocks along the Tubbs Hill trail. BEN GOLDFARB Do you have a favorite beach vacation spot? Tell us in the comments. Please include your recommendations for the best thing to do, where to stay and places to eat. Rainy day on the beach might sound like a recipe for a wistful afternoon of “Baywatch” reruns in the hotel room. But at First Beach, in La Push, in the far northwest tip of Washington State, wet weather and storms are part of the draw and the charm for a certain caste of beachgoer — I plead guilty — who likes the idea of hunkering down in the presence of nature in full. Huge logs snaggle the sand in some places, washed in by storms. Crashing waves draw people from hundreds of miles away just to sit in awe, or test their fortitude with a dip in the icy Pacific waters. Who goes there: Seattle-area residents, mostly. Where to stay: The Quileute Tribe has a resort with cabins, motel rooms and campsites right on the beach. KIRK JOHNSON Utah isn’t exactly known for its beaches — the last time the state had an ocean shoreline was 85 million years ago. But when I want to leave Salt Lake City behind and dig my toes into the sand, I drive two hours north through winding mountain canyons to get to Bear Lake, where Utahns flock as soon as the weather gets swimsuit-warm. I could keep driving — the lake straddles the Utah-Idaho border — but my favorite spot is Garden City, Utah. There’s plenty of public shoreline to claim a spot on the sand, throw out some shade (which you’ll definitely want to bring — the high-elevation sun can be brutal) and take a dip in the warm shallows. Who goes there: Beachgoers come up from Salt Lake City and the surrounding sprawl, filling up vacation rentals and nearby campsites. Where to stay: Bear Lake boasts multiple vacation rentals, but the most beautiful accommodations are in the nearby campgrounds. Sunrise Campground, on the Utah side, certainly lives up to its name. Must-eat: There’s hardly a better vehicle for Garden City’s famous raspberries than the milkshakes you’ll find at drive-ins along the lakeshore drag. RILEY BLACK Midwesterners have long “summered” in the charming town of Saugatuck, located on the southwest side of the mitten state, because of the lure of Lake Michigan. With rolling dunes and pristine shoreline, Oval Beach easily lends itself to hours of body surfing and paddle boarding. The town, an L.G.B.T.Q. mecca for the wealthy set (particularly from Chicago and southeastern Michigan), also boasts a thriving arts scene, thanks to a number of galleries and the century-old Ox-Bow, a school of art with a residency program, alongside the requisite Michigan fudge shop, five-and-dime and soda-fountain hangout. Who goes there: Sophisticated Chicago residents with second homes on the beach, Michigan families with three generations in tow and weekend visitors checking out the beach and bar scene. Where to stay: Lakeshore Lodging is the best bet for a house with your own beach access. Initiation rite: Stop by the Red Dock and enjoy a rum drink on Kalamazoo Lake. JENNIFER CONLIN Nestled on the shore of Lake Superior 40 miles from Canada, Grand Marais might not seem like an obvious choice for a beach vacation: The lake is frigid, and the shore is rock-strewn and wild. But what Grand Marais lacks in sand and cabanas, it more than makes up for with awe-inspiring beauty — there are few things as beautiful as a glittering Lake Superior sunrise, especially from Artists’ Point. The town is situated on the harbor, which provides the main access to the water and includes a pebbled shoreline that is often full of kids skipping stones and blissed-out parents watching the waves roll in. Make sure to stop in to Drury Lane Books or the North House Folk School, where you can take classes in anything from boat building to basket weaving. Who goes there: The main road into town can be busy on weekends, as crowds flock from the Twin Cities. Must Eat: For the love of God, visit World’s Best Donuts. PETER GEYE Sometimes drolly referred to as the “Iowa Great Lakes,” Okoboji, a resort region made up of a chain of lakes and a handful of towns near the state’s northern border, offers the perfect antidote to the “Midwestern work ethic.” The action is on West Okoboji Lake, where you can stroll past shops and restaurants, grab a tavern sandwich and onion rings and visit the vintage Arnolds Park Amusement Park, complete with a wooden roller coaster, the Legend, which opened in 1930. The park’s free beach is small but well loved, full of toddlers, high schoolers and grandparents wading, strutting or strolling in the sand. I’ve been returning to Okoboji since I was a kid, and now I take my own kids here — there’s a reassuring delight in returning to waters you’ll never grow out of. Who goes there: Farm kids, suburban families, boaters and other landlocked Midwesterners from Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota and South Dakota. Classic souvenir: Gear emblazoned with the logo of the (fictional) University of Okoboji. Must eat: The signature chocolate-dipped, peanut-encrusted ice-cream pop from the Nutty Bar Stand, open since 1945. ANNA BAHNEY Door County, which juts out into Lake Michigan like a finger, still retains a strong vibe of the low-key artists’ retreat that it was in the 1960s, when my grandparents first visited and began a family tradition of spending summers there. Sister Bay, on the west side of the peninsula, feels like a healthy mix of the midcentury and the new. The beach, in the heart of the village, is pocket-size (600 feet of shoreline), with a retro floating dock for diving into the bracing waters of Green Bay. Steps away is a nautical-themed playground, an outdoor band shell and a wood-fired pizza place, Wild Tomato. Get a pizza margherita to go, a bottle of sparkling rosé from the Door County Creamery and have a B.Y.O.B. feast at one of the picnic tables by the water. (This is Wisconsin. Outdoor drinking is absolutely fine.) Who goes there: Families with young children driving up from places like Madison and Chicago; day-trippers from Green Bay; retired locals who can deal with crowds. Initiation rite: Trying to catch a glimpse of the goats grazing on the grass-lined roof of Al Johnson’s, a 70-year-old Swedish restaurant across the street from the beach. JULIE BOSMAN Lake life in Oklahoma and Texas is a peculiar mixture of scenic country living and adrenaline-fueled debauchery. In no place is that lifestyle better exemplified than the tree-lined choppy waters of Lake Texoma, situated on the border of the two states. As a college student, I found it was easy to be drawn in by the bonfires, beer and euphoria on the Islands, a string of sandy bluffs in the middle of the lake where partygoers and thong enthusiasts anchor their boats in lines to make party-hopping easier. Along the sprawling lake’s snaking arms, you’ll find coves, bars, marinas and incredible barbecue (get the fried okra). The only rules: Wear a lot of sunscreen, and keep the cooler full of drinks and your boat full of gas — you never know what distant beach will be calling your name. Who goes there: College students on break and locals who call it a second home. Transportation tip: The lake itself is large, and renting a boat is a must. Mill Creek Marina is popular and closest to the action. GRAHAM LEE BREWER Galveston, situated on an island off the Gulf Coast of Texas, can be an easy place to take for granted. There are prettier beaches. But the island encapsulates the attributes I admire most about southeast Texas: clinging to history as hurricanes routinely try to wipe it off the map, yet adaptable enough to roll with whatever comes. Most visitors crowd the beach, stopping at the restaurants and kitschy shops along the Seawall. But to me Galveston’s greatest appeal comes when you step away from the beach and dive into a vibrant, quirky place where all sorts of cultures — Texan, Southern, Cajun, Mexican — tangle together. Tour the island’s enormous old mansions, stroll along the Strand (a stretch of art shops, boutiques, bars and restaurants) or take your kids to the pyramids of Moody Gardens, which hold an aquarium and a rain forest. Who goes there: Easily accessible — both geographically and financially — for families from across the Houston area and beyond, Galveston is a colorful playground for just about anyone. Must-eat: My family always piles into the tiny Texas Star Bakery to load up on strawberry and Mexican wedding cookies and empanadas. RICK ROJAS To many families in the Southeast, “going to the beach” means jumping into a sleek dreadnought of an S.U.V. and gliding toward the studiously laid-back stretch of Gulf Coast commonly known as 30A. Though some still refer to the Florida Panhandle as the Redneck Riviera, 30A — a string of upscale beach communities between Destin and Panama City Beach — has expunged, for better or worse, most whiffs of the classic workingman’s beach holiday. So instead of airbrushed T-shirts and Skee-Ball halls there are roasted-vegetable power bowls and a carefully curated Martha Stewart vision of beachiness. But the beach itself is still the real draw, replete with gentle, kid-friendly water in Rothko bands of blue, frolicking dolphins and white sand as fine as the all-purpose flour in the kitchen of a doting Southern mother. Who goes there: If you have a rooting interest in a Southeastern Conference football team, you’ve probably already been. Where to stay: Accommodations include the meticulously tasteful Seaside, (used as a Truman Show set!), and the austere, whitewashed development of Alys Beach, which feels like an Ayahuasca hallucination of Santorini, albeit with a donut truck. Must-eat: Skip the overpriced restos and head to Buddy’s Seafood Market in Santa Rosa Beach for sacks of fat, wild-caught Florida shrimp. RICHARD FAUSSET The Mid-Atlantic’s answer to Fire Island, Rehoboth Beach is a land of young men in skimpy swimsuits strutting alongside aging gay couples in matching boat shoes and pastel polos. It’s also a place where families find the nostalgic joys of an old-school boardwalk — where kids beg for saltwater taffy or another strip of Funland tickets while their parents plot a visit to Dogfish Head, an oddball destination brewery. At the end of the day, everyone crowds into the same festive, family-friendly gay bars and casual seafood restaurants, sunburned and sandy. Who goes there: The closest Atlantic beach town to the D.C. Metro area, Rehoboth has long been a gay getaway and an affordable option for vacationing families. Initiation rite: Happy hour is practically a sport in Rehoboth, where nearly every restaurant or bar offers a seafood special: raw oysters, buckets of crab legs or heaping bowls of steamed clams. FREDA MOON Mention Asbury Park to any Jersey Shore regulars of a certain age, and they’ll recall summer nights in packed clubs, sun-kissed skin glowing with the sheen of rock ’n’ roll sweat, hunting for a blessing from Bruce Springsteen, Steve Van Zandt or Southside Johnny. For a time, as this iconic city crumbled, those memories seemed confined to history. But visit Asbury Park now and see not just recovery but the Jersey Shore ideal: beaches packed towel to towel for 10 blocks, surfers picking waves off a jetty and a boardwalk lined with seafood restaurants, open-air watering holes, a lemonade stand and a taco joint. And on those perfect days, the twang of an electric guitar still seeps out from the Stone Pony and soaks up the boardwalk. Who goes there: Tattooed and trendy visitors from Brooklyn and Manhattan, who stay at the stylish new and renovated hotels, mix with a large local L.G.B.T.Q. community and a growing influx of Shore regulars who frequent smaller inns and Airbnbs. Rainy-day activity: Watching the wizards down at the Silverball pinball “museum” on the boardwalk, where you can play on machines dating back to the 1950s. Must-eat: Heaping, jaw-locking, fully dressed Italian subs from Frank’s Deli, a legendary Main Street mainstay. NICK CORASANITI Lodged like a piece of chewed taffy between the ocean and the Delaware Bay, the dune-wrapped coastline of the “other Cape” is a getaway from getaways. It catches dregs of traffic from Atlantic City and Wildwood — but is otherwise the calmest spot on the raucous Jersey Shore. Expect raw, low-frills excursions with wistful sunsets, winding climbs through a still-working lighthouse and crab-stuffed everything at the Rusty Nail beach shack. A two-mile promenade, built in the late 1800s, reveals the town’s resort-ier roots, complete with a family-run fudge shop, coin arcades and grande-dame hotels. Who goes there: A healthy mix of locals, East Coasters and Quebecois. Extended families snap up new-age villas and Victorians, but rows of one-room cottages — dubbed tiny houses — run plenty farther inland. Classic souvenir: Mine the bayside for “Cape May diamonds”: slick, quartz pebbles that the Kechemeche tribe once used for trade. PURBITA SAHA For over a century Oak Bluffs, on the north shoreline of Martha’s Vineyard, has been a summer-vacation locale for African-American families, with Inkwell Beach at the heart of the community. Today the town is a retreat of choice for both seasoned ladies with floppy straw hats and hip young families wearing Johnny Cupcakes T-shirts. During August, black leisure life is on peak display along Circuit Avenue, a folksy commercial cluster of seasonal shops and cafes, and Inkwell Beach becomes a fanciful illustration of bliss set by the Atlantic Ocean, as golden rays brush babies and chatter bounces off bold-hued umbrellas. I’m the mother sporting shoulder-length cornrows, facedown in a book. Who goes there: In addition to native New Englanders, you’ll find folks who hail from everywhere from the American South to Oakland, Calif. Must Eat: The whole fried clams from the takeout counter at Giordano’s Restaurant (a mainstay since 1930). Ordering a mess of slightly sweet hand-cut onion rings is mandatory. Classic souvenir: Original pieces from the art galleries situated in shingle-style houses or the nearby Chilmark flea market. NICOLE TAYLOR The stereotype of Old Orchard Beach, on Maine’s southern coast, is of a place crowded by schlubby Quebecois dads wearing ill-advised Speedos, sweeping powdered sugar from their chest hair after inhaling slabs of fried dough. Speaking as a schlubby dad who loves the place, I know this has basis in fact. Yet Old Orchard Beach’s unapologetic lack of pretense is part of its appeal. And there’s a seven-mile crescent beach, a charmingly dated amusement park and a spring-break-lite atmosphere on the 500-foot pier that’s lined with bars, restaurants and souvenir shops. Who goes there: Summer crowds descending from the north earned O.O.B. its nickname, “the French Canadian Riviera,” but the rows of rental cottages also fill with plenty of working- and middle-class New England families. Must-eat: Crisp, crinkly “pier fries” from the original Pier French Fries counter on Old Orchard Street. Naturally, you can get them as poutine. BRIAN KEVIN Four hours north of Manhattan, the “Queen of American Lakes” beckons all to its sun-dappled shores. The accessible southern terminus of Lake George, with kitschy arcades, wax museums and speedboats crowding the waterfront in the village of the same name, attracts the most tourists. My advice: Bypass it all and keep going north. On your way to Silver Bay, one of a handful of little towns that dot the northwest shores of the lake, you’ll pass through a time machine of sorts. Up here cellphone service is spotty, shops and restaurants are few and far between and the pleasures of lake life — naps on a sun-warmed dock, rowboat picnics, long swims in water so clean that it qualifies as drinking water — are of the old-school variety. Who goes there: Mostly middle-class families from the Northeast. Rainy-day activity: A fierce game of shuffleboard at the Y.M.C.A. compound, followed by a “Tongue Mountain” banana split at its general store. BONNIE TSUI While the Hamptons were sacrificed to the Kardashians and Real Housewives of New York City long ago, Montauk has managed to hold onto its laid-back vibe and blue-collar roots, despite an influx of noisy newcomers. Early-morning surfers grab breakfast burritos from the Ditch Witch food truck to beat waves of Brooklyn moms, hipsters and occasional celebrities. At the beautifully rugged Ditch Plains beach, old-school New York accents still drift by, though they’re disappearing fast. An active night-life scene means that some hotels (like the Memory Motel, which the Rolling Stones sang about in 1976) are better for drinking than for sleeping. Who goes there: Crowds from all of N.Y.C., though Williamsburg and Manhattan dominate. Must-eat: John’s Drive-In, est. 1967, for the Big John Burger and homemade ice cream (I’m partial to the mint-chip). Rainy-day activity: The local library, with an upstairs ocean view, has everything from yoga to children’s robot building. HELENE STAPINSKI Fire Island is a sliver of Eden just off Long Island, only a few dozen miles (and a ferry ride) from New York City but a universe away. It has historically been a refuge for gay and lesbian travelers, and as younger men my husband and I vacationed in the Pines, probably the Island’s best-known enclave. Since becoming parents, we’ve found the neighboring community of Cherry Grove, long a destination for lesbians, a little more welcoming. The beach is beautiful, clean and quiet, especially on weekdays. Rainy days or early mornings we stroll the circuit of elevated boardwalk that is the island’s artery, looking at the birds, butterflies and deer who really own the place. There’s nothing else to do, which is what makes it so perfect. Who goes there: Primarily — but not exclusively — queer travelers. Uniform: Anything goes. Shorts and flip-flops or full drag, daring bathing suits or partial nudity. There’s a prevailing attitude of come-as-you-are that’s truly wonderful. RUMAAN ALAM North Carolinians tend to be beach-loyal. The rest of the world stops anywhere from the Outer Banks to Calabash, but Tar Heels pick their spot — usually the one where their parents and grandparents went — and return every year like sea turtles. Swarmed by surfers, boaters and day-trippers, Wrightsville keeps its old-school feel, with a 700-foot pier, originally built in the 1930s. The town was walloped by Hurricane Florence last fall, but most stores and restaurants have reopened for summer. Who goes there: Roughly halfway between Maine and South Florida, the area gets visitors from the Northeast alongside loyal Carolinians. Locals joke that I-40 from Raleigh to the coast is so wide, smooth and fast because of all the state legislators who scurry to the beaches for long weekends. Must-eat: Hit Roberts Market, the tiny downtown grocery, for a tub of the best chicken salad in the South. It’s the perfect thing to tuck into a boat cooler. KATHLEEN PURVIS There’s a reason Folly Beach still proudly proclaims itself “the Edge of America.” Barely 20 minutes from Charleston’s Southern charms, this six-mile stretch of mossy oaks, ramshackle cottages and white sand is equal parts old Southern vacation retreat and hip, foodie-friendly surf town. Barefoot locals long ago recognized that this bohemian barrier island, former home of the “Porgy and Bess” co-writer DuBose Heyward, was worth protecting. They’ve zealously guarded the wizened trees that shade Folly’s interior and kept most of the beach open to surfers and surf schools — creating a distinctly Caro-Californian vibe. Who goes there: Charleston locals and tourists of every stripe, from Charlotte and Atlanta and some savvy escapees from New York. Initiation rite: A dolphin-gazing sunset dinner from the waterfront deck at Bowens Island — a fish-camp restaurant and bar a couple of miles up Folly Road. CHRIS DIXON Growing up in San Juan, I always loved the days my family would pack up our coolers for an outing to Luquillo Beach. Less than an hour’s drive east of the city center, the beach (its official name is Balneario La Monserrate) is still far enough from the hustle and bustle to conjure a world apart — half-moon shaped, ringed by palm trees, with friendly warm waters. We always returned home sunburned, exhausted and happy. Now it’s a regular stop during my visits back to the island, when my husband and I rent lounge chairs and umbrellas to read in the cool breeze and nap after sipping a rum-charged piña colada. It is home. Who goes there: Locals and tourists alike, often with kiddies in tow — and always someone with speakers loud enough to infuse patches of the beach with salsa, merengue and bachata music. Must-eat: Traditional fritters like bacalaítos (salt cod) and alcapurrias (green-banana dough with meat), from the strip of restaurants and food kiosks that stretches along Highway 3, known as Los Kioskos de Luquillo.

2019,3 Days in a Van With a Shakespeare Troupe: Daggers and Dunkin’ Donuts,"What was it like being a traveling player in Elizabethan times? Touring the northeast for months, the intrepid young actors from Shakespeare & Company find out. Jordan Mann, top, peeks from backstage before performing as Hamlet for an audience of mostly teenage mothers.CreditCreditGaia Squarci for The New York Times HOLYOKE, Mass. — The sword fight between Hamlet and Laertes needed to feel real, dicey, dangerous. But maybe not this dangerous. At Wistariahurst — a historic house museum here — a small playing area and slippery parquet floors made even a blunted weapon a menace. “Watch yourself,” Daniel Light said as he teasingly slid a dagger through an onlooker’s legs. Jordan Mann, who plays Hamlet, spritzed some hair spray on the bottom of her shoes to make them stickier. “Take it a little bit slower,” she advised. “Fast words. Slow footwork.” Elsinore had arrived here about an hour earlier, with Ms. Mann, Mr. Light and four fellow actors rattling up in a Ford Expedition and a dusty Econoline, carting curtains and cables into a high-ceilinged gallery. Every year since 1982, Shakespeare & Company has sent young performers on the road from early winter through late spring, for four months of Dunkin’ Donuts breakfasts, motel showers, flubbed lines, forgotten props, missed turnoffs, standing ovations and the chance to live with Shakespeare’s words a lot like the traveling players of 400 years ago would have. They perform a play somewhere new, and usually less treacherous, nearly every day. Earlier this month, I spent a few days with the 2019 troupe — Dara Brown, Caitlin Kraft, Nick Nudler and Kirsten Peacock were the others — as they tramped through four states, delivering their 90-minute “Hamlet.” By the time I joined them late one Tuesday night, in an otherwise deserted motel abutting a golf resort in western Vermont, they had played a private school in Connecticut the day before and a Vermont public school gym that afternoon. On Wednesday, they were at Vermont’s Long Trail School. On Thursday, after a night at Shakespeare & Company housing in Lenox, Mass., they went to Wistariahurst, performing for an audience of mostly teen mothers, then drove four hours south, with stops for gas and Popsicles, staying overnight at a Crowne Plaza in Saddle Brook, N.J. “This is where everyone in Saddle Brook has their prom,” Mr. Nudler announced as he pulled the van into the parking lot. At 5:20 a.m. they drove into New York City for a morning performance for high school students at Trevor Day School on the Upper East Side. They took audience questions, ate a quick cafeteria lunch, dismantled the set with preternatural efficiency. By noon they had packed every last ripped tarp and bloodstained poet shirt into the vehicles for the three-hour drive back to Lenox. This was #VanLife, Elizabethan-style. Shakespeare & Company has always had strong education programs, the tour among them. About 100 actors audition for it every year, heading to Lenox to deliver two contrasting Shakespeare monologues and answer a few questions. Every year the tour prepares a comedy and a tragedy (this year “Hamlet” alternates with “The Taming of the Shrew”). The directors of each play — Tom Jaeger and Kelly Galvin this year — not only have to figure out how to cast 30 or 40 roles with just six actors, but also divine who will work together best once the tour is up and running. Almost anyone can appear polite and friendly during a 15- or 20-minute audition. But who can manage it after weeks of little sleep and a punishing lack of privacy? “You want to pick people that are mature,” Kevin G. Coleman, Shakespeare & Company’s director of education said, when I called him a few days before joining. “Because the tour is profoundly stressful.” Maturity is relative. The actors tend to be young — this year’s troupe ranges from 22 to 31 — and unmarried. (Ms. Kraft is recently engaged.) They are hired to tour from January through May, break for a month, then reunite in July and perform one of the plays (this year, “Shrew”) back at the Lenox campus. Allyn Burrows, the theater’s artistic director, did the tour 30 years ago. “It’s a grueling, long commitment,” he told me. “A boot camp for 17 weeks.” But it was, for him, “one of the most challenging, most rewarding experiences I would ever have.” (I asked him if anyone famous had ever joined the tour. Oliver Platt. And maybe Bronson Pinchot, though he wasn’t completely sure.) The tour pays around $500 per week, plus free housing, travel expenses and a per diem for nights on the road. There are no personal days, no paid vacations, no health care, though most of the actors are young enough to be enrolled on their parents’ plans and others qualify for Medicaid. And there’s a chiropractor in Lenox, I was told, who will see you for $20. The cast convenes in December and rehearses for three weeks before a furlough for the Christmas holidays. In January, after several more weeks of rehearsal, the tour begins, sometimes with a few false starts. This year, on the first day, the Expedition’s brakes were on the fritz. So the actors piled into Ms. Kraft’s own car for the drive to Watertown, Conn. They made it. During the early weeks it can be hard to remember all the costumes and props and characters. Ms. Mann, who along with Hamlet portrays five characters in “Shrew,” recalled being backstage during that show and having to hiss at a cast member: “Who am I?” The whole cast still talks about the time they forgot the laptop that runs the sound cues and a volleyball decorated to look like the “Shrew” character Bianca. (When you have six actors and at least twice as many characters, you get creative.) Besides acting, everyone has extra jobs. Ms. Kraft is the road manager and looks after the sets. Mr. Nudler is the vehicle manager and oversees the lighting. Ms. Brown is the travel agent and liaises with each school. (Schools pay Shakespeare & Company $2,300 for a performance; for other venues the fee can go as high as $3,500. Financial aid is available.) At each new location, the schedule runs more or less the same. Arrive. Load in. Put up the set, a pipe-and-drape system of purple curtains and foam panels semi-convincingly painted like stone. Arrange the lights and sound. With that accomplished, the actors sit in a circle and plan for the day, trying to anticipate any hiccups. Then they “check-in,” a Shakespeare & Company practice in which each person expresses how he or she is feeling. An emotional safety valve, it helps to keep things civil. (What else keeps them from killing one another on the road? “State laws,” Mr. Light, who often plays villains, said.) The actors separate for individual warm-ups. They quickly restage the play for the space — some stages are wide, some are narrow, some are raked, some are flat, once they had to dodge a half-built set for “Cabaret” — and rehearse the fight scenes. This all takes about an hour and a half. Sometimes there’s a further break for lunch in the school’s cafeteria, sometimes they eat after. How are the cafeteria meals? Usually pretty good. “There are schools we go to where it’s a five-star buffet,” Ms. Peacock said back in the van one afternoon. Then it’s “half-hour,” when the cast goes quiet, hurrying backstage to dress for the first scene, arranging subsequent costumes, props and water bottles into tidy piles as the students file in. Just before Ms. Mann hits the first sound cue on the laptop, the six actors huddle together, murmuring, “Got your back.” The performance begins, sometimes for an audience of nine and once, in Worcester, Mass., for a crowd of 1,600. Students boo. They doze. They giggle. At Wistariahurst several took cellphone videos of the death scene. “I like the audiences when they’re fully reacting,” Ms. Kraft, who was on her second tour and specializes in clowns and queens, said the day before. “I’m not a movie screen.” I exchanged a few emails with Siobhan Keenan, a literature professor at De Montfort University in Leicester, England, and the author of “Travelling Players in Shakespeare’s England,” the classic of the field. She wrote that the tour “sounds great fun and perhaps not entirely different from what life was like for traveling players back in Shakespeare’s time!” Even the van has an analogue, in the horse-drawn wagon that players, like the ones who visit Elsinore in “Hamlet,” would have used to carry costumes and props. Traveling players were usually young members of established companies. They weren’t paid especially well; there are records of actors selling costumes to buy food. Performance locations varied, as did accommodations. Renaissance players could be beaten or jailed under a 1572 act targeting “rogues, vagabonds and sturdy beggars.” That’s not a real danger today, though a teacher did once catch Ms. Mann loitering with a dagger in her belt outside an auditorium (she had an entrance through the audience) and nearly took her to the principal’s office. Still, Renaissance players didn’t insist on a talkback after each show, a mix of actors’ prompts and audience questions. (The actors can tell which schools have taught “Hamlet” when a teen asks “Where’s Fortinbras?”) And traveling Elizabethan troupes didn’t lead workshops on the text, an optional add-on. The educational component isn’t why most of the young actors, some just out of college, others newly released from M.F.A. programs or Shakespeare & Company's own acting intensive, join the tour. They join because they want a job or to hone their craft or to see what it feels like to do a show 30 or 40 times instead of playing it over one weekend or because, as Mr. Nudler, who plays kings and knaves, said at dinner one night, “I had always kind of fantasized about this idea of acting on the road.” But the talkbacks and workshops are often why they return. Ms. Peacock, a British-American actress and the troupe’s leading lady, was back for a second season. “Last year’s tour was just such a rewarding experience,” she said. “Being able to take Shakespeare into schools and see the impact that it can have on young people, the conversations that they have.” At Long Trail School I watched as a dozen middle school and high school students, in bare feet and Birkenstocks, took ownership of Shakespeare’s verse. One three-person group reset some Act I lines in what seemed to be a dentist’s office (a robot was involved). Another group relocated the “Get thee to a nunnery” scene to an after-party at a mermaid prom. “Don’t stop mermaiding!” one of the students, Timur Langford, urged his colleagues. At Wistariahurst, the actors led a 45-minute workshop for students at the Care Center, an alternative education program for young mothers and women resuming an interrupted education. I stood with some of the women and their teachers as they worked this same scene. “Sounds like a breakup,” one young woman observed. “She got friendzoned,” another added. They came to Hamlet’s line, “I never gave you aught.” “That’s like the baby daddy saying he doesn’t want the baby,” a third said, delivering Ophelia’s line “You know right well you did,” as a snappy comeback. After the workshop, Pearl Manus, a student at the Care Center’s chapter of Bard Microcollege, talked to me about “Hamlet.” “Even though it’s a very old play there are still the same issues in contemporary life,” she said. “You don’t feel so alone.” She turned to Ms. Peacock, whom she’d seen as Desdemona in “Othello” last year. “I thought about how you died in two plays and you got slapped in two plays,” she said. “I was stronger. I didn’t cry this time around.” For the last performance of the week, at Trevor Day School, I watched from backstage, tiptoeing from one wing to the other while Claudius scrolled through his phone and Horatio quickly became Polonius and Ophelia undid her hair for the mad scene and Gertrude grabbed the skulls she needed for the gravedigger and Laertes checked the prop swords and Hamlet stripped down for the fight scene. The actors had performed the play almost 30 times by now and they had an ease with it, often lip-syncing each other’s lines backstage or breaking into aggressive dance moves before they had to scurry away for an entrance. I was a theater major in college and did some acting for a year or two after, and in the backstage jostle I remembered, acutely, why I’d loved it — the adrenaline, the manic camaraderie, the phenomenon of having so many eyes and ears trained just on you, the confidence that you could take strange words and make them brilliantly alive. I also remembered why I’m grateful not to do it anymore, for a lot of those same reasons. I also thought about something Mr. Coleman, the education director had said: how if you’re an actor on the tour, you’re falling in love with Shakespeare, yes, but “you’re falling in love with yourself. You’re discovering what you can do.” Which should go a long way toward making up for those early mornings and highway miles and terrible loneliness, even within the group. “Shakespeare allows you to grow and discover at every performance,” Ms. Mann said. Ms. Brown, the troupe’s youngest member, who plays little sisters and sidekicks, said, “It has taught me a lot about myself.” Over dinner, at the Saddle Brook Crowne Plaza, I asked the actors if they would do the tour again. “In a heartbeat,” Mr. Light said. “Yes,” Mr. Nudler said. “Yes, absolutely,” Ms. Peacock said. “It depends,” Ms. Mann said. “I’m too tired to answer that question right now,” Ms. Kraft said. Ms. Brown, who has been reading books about loneliness and now hates hotels, was the last to answer. “I totally would,” she said.

2019,3 Film Series to Catch in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to film series and special screenings happening this weekend and in the week ahead. All our movie reviews are at nytimes.com/reviews/movies. JEAN-CLAUDE CARRIÈRE at the Museum of Modern Art (through June 16). What connects filmmakers like Nagisa Oshima, Luis Buñuel, Jonathan Glazer and Julian Schnabel? The screenwriter and author Jean-Claude Carrière. He is perhaps most associated with absurdist conceits (in addition to his enduring collaboration with Buñuel, he also appeared as an actor in Abbas Kiarostami’s “Certified Copy”), but his astonishing range is revealed in this retrospective, which covers more than 50 years. On Friday, Carrière will introduce Louis Malle’s “May Fools,” Milos Forman’s “Taking Off” (showing with a short that Carrière directed) and Philip Kaufman’s screen version of “The Unbearable Lightness of Being.” On Saturday, he will appear with the director Volker Schlöndorff at “The Tin Drum” and “Circle of Deceit,” and on Sunday he will present Buñuel’s “The Milky Way.”212-708-9400, moma.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] FILMS FOR THE FAIR: THE WORLD’S FAIR AND THE CINEMA at Anthology Film Archives (through May 19). As demonstrations of the wonders of modern technology, the various world’s fairs have been showcases for advances in cinema — and were themselves documented by movies. This series highlights those confluences of art and science, such as a silent film of Fatty Arbuckle and Mabel Normand visiting the 1915 world’s fair in San Francisco (on May 18), proto-Imax shorts by Francis Thompson and the avant-garde filmmaker Alexander Hammid screened in 1964 and 1967 (showing in various compilations on Saturday, Sunday and Thursday) and groundbreaking work from the 1967 Montreal expo (on Saturday and May 19). The retrospective also features movies that have captured world’s fairs as they exist in memory, like the one from 1904 at the end of “Meet Me in St. Louis” (on Friday and Wednesday). 212-505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org RYUSUKE HAMAGUCHI at the Metrograph (May 10-17). It takes chutzpah to make a five-and-a-half-hour movie when you’re still emerging on the international scene, but that’s what this Japanese director did with “Happy Hour” (on Saturday), a film that devotes that time to observing the minute interactions that cause its characters to fall in and out of love. But “Happy Hour” wasn’t Hamaguchi’s first feature, and this retrospective, a warm-up for the release of his “Vertigo” riff “Asako I & II” on May 17, paints a fuller picture of his career with those two films and five others, including “Intimacies” (on Thursday), which, like “Happy Hour,” experiments with duration.212-660-0312, metrograph.com",The New York Times
2019,3 Muslim Workers at Amazon File Federal Discrimination Complaint,"SEATTLE — Three Somali women working for Amazon near Minneapolis have accused the company of creating a hostile environment for Muslim workers and of retaliating against them for protesting their work conditions, according to a filing submitted this week to federal regulators. In a letter with the filing, Muslim Advocates, a nonprofit legal organization representing the women, asked the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to investigate what they argue are “systemic violations” of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The law prohibits employment discrimination based on religion, among other things. The federal complaint is the latest escalation in an almost yearlong dispute between Amazon and East African workers in the area, which has one of the most organized groups of Amazon warehouse employees in the country. “We think an E.E.O.C. investigation is a key part of starting the process of holding Amazon accountable,” said Nimra Azmi, a lawyer on the case. An Amazon spokeswoman, Brenda Alfred, said in a statement, “Diversity and inclusion is central to our business and company culture, and associates can pray whenever they choose.” However, she said, “We respect the privacy of employees and don’t discuss complaints publicly.” In 2016, when Amazon opened a major fulfillment center in Shakopee, a suburb of Minneapolis, it recruited heavily from the region’s large immigrant population amid low unemployment. At one point it ran buses to the warehouse from a Minneapolis neighborhood known as Little Mogadishu. For more than a year, the Awood Center, a nonprofit focused on helping East African workers, has organized the employees around their concerns about the pace of work, accommodations for prayers and what they see as little opportunity for advancement to management. Awood has received funding from grants as well as the Service Employees International Union. Through a series of escalating actions last year, they became the first known group of workers in the United States to get Amazon management to negotiate. In December, a group protested outside one of the area’s mammoth warehouses. Local press reports estimated that 100 people had attended. And in March, a smaller group walked out on its shift for several hours. [Get the Bits newsletter for the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.] Muslim Advocates said it had been in touch with Awood since last summer to determine whether there was a legal challenge to raise. In the letter summarizing their claims, the women said they had faced retaliation since they were involved in the December protest. The workers said they had received difficult work assignments and improper warnings that could lead to firing. Amazon also had a “culture of surveillance after the protest,” Ms. Azmi said. Muslim Advocates has withheld the women’s names from the public, saying they fear further retaliation. One of the women agreed to be interviewed on the condition of anonymity. In the interview, the worker said that she had seen her manager looking at social media of the protests, and that he had then commented he noticed she had participated. Another time, a different manager took a photograph of her on his personal phone while she was working, she said, adding that when she complained, management played down her concerns. According to the letter, one of the other women “has had her everyday conversations repeatedly video recorded by her supervisors.” “There is zero tolerance for retaliation in the workplace,” Ms. Alfred, the Amazon spokeswoman, said. “We take any reports of retaliation seriously and look into all claims made by our employees.” Amazon gives the workers paid breaks to pray up to 20 minutes, as required by state law, but the employees are still responsible for maintaining the same “rate,” or how many items they must pack in an hour. Ms. Alfred said workers could take longer prayer breaks without pay, for which productivity expectations would be adjusted. Missing the rate can lead to write-ups and firing. The women said they and other Muslim workers feared taking time to pray, making it a “hostile environment” to be Muslim. Ms. Alfred said the company had worked hard to accommodate the annual observance of Ramadan, when many Muslims fast during the day. Amazon consulted Muslim employees and trained managers on the holiday as well as on safety for fasting workers. Employees can trade shifts to work at night, and they held a potluck at the start of the holiday. The workers say the pressure to produce is consuming. Amazon has been squeezing more profit out of its operations as growth has slowed. Last quarter, the company spent 4 percent less fulfilling orders than a year earlier, even as the number of units sold was up 10 percent. Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s finance chief, told investors that was largely because Amazon hired fewer workers as it added fewer warehouses than in recent years. “Right now, we are on a nice path where we are getting the most out of the capacity we have,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,3 Novels Explore the Abortion Debate,"Newsbook As several states, including Alabama and Georgia, move to restrict abortion, here are three novels that explore the wide range of perspectives on the issue — from evangelicals, abortion providers, women with unwanted pregnancies and more. RED CLOCKSBy Leni Zumas356 pp. Little, Brown & Company. (2018) This book follows four women in the near future, living in a small town in Oregon and grappling with new federal laws that have outlawed abortion and where single women are on the verge of being denied the right to adopt. Our reviewer called it a “lyrical and beautifully observed reflection on women’s lives,” adding that it offers “such a clear and well-constructed extrapolation of the current debate that I doubt any reader will need to suspend disbelief for even a moment.” A SPARK OF LIGHTBy Jodi Picoult384 pp. Ballantine. (2018) In Picoult’s most recent best seller, a routine day at a women’s reproductive health clinic turns tragic when a gunman opens fire and takes everyone inside hostage. The hostages include a 15-year-old girl named Wren, whose father ends up being the police hostage negotiator on the scene; an anti-abortion protester disguised as a patient; a nurse and a doctor; and a young woman who was there to get an abortion. It is told in reverse chronological order, giving insight into what brought these characters to the clinic. A BOOK OF AMERICAN MARTYRSBy Joyce Carol Oates736 pp. Ecco/HarperCollins Publishers. (2017) This story begins with a death: The evangelical Luther Dunphy shoots and kills Dr. Augustus Voorhees, an abortion provider, and their families are left to reckon with the aftermath. “America’s abortion war contains treacherous depths, and to Oates’s credit her book seeks to plumb them,” our reviewer wrote. “How, it asks, might we humanize extreme ideological positions? How might we subvert the divisiveness that so troubles the debate?” Through a menagerie of characters, Oates tackles these questions.",The New York Times
2019,3 of This Year’s Spelling Bee Winners Are Friends From Dallas,"When students from the Dallas area took the stage for a regional spelling bee this spring, the competition was so intense that officials ran out of words, had to resort to a written test and, in the end, decided to send three top spellers to nationals. That was just a preview of what was to come at the Scripps National Spelling Bee on Thursday. In a dramatic ending on live television, the prestigious competition announced that it had begun to exhaust its most challenging words and, shortly after midnight, crowned the eight remaining contestants co-champions — including the three from the Dallas area. [The National Spelling Bee, at a loss for words, honored eight champions.] The stunning twist was the first time the national bee, which in the past has experienced two-way ties, had seen such a logjam of competition. And it was the latest spelling victory for the Dallas region, which has emerged as something of a juggernaut in spelling in recent years. Last year, the top three finishers were all from Dallas suburbs. (The other winners this year were from Alabama, California, Maryland and New Jersey.) The unusually high representation from one area was made possible, in part, by a new invitational program that allows more students from around the country to compete in the Scripps bee. And while some regions sponsor just one student for the national competition, the local sponsors in Dallas have begun to send more than one because of the many high-quality candidates in the region. It’s unclear what makes Dallas unique or whether the past two years were simply a fluke. But Valerie Miller, a spokeswoman for the Scripps National Spelling Bee, said families had taken notice. “We’ve heard of some stories of families who move to the area knowing the competitiveness and the value the spelling competition is given in that area,” she said. Among this year’s eight champions, three live and attend schools in separate areas of the Dallas-Fort Worth region, a sprawling metroplex of more than seven million people. But they are no strangers. The students — Abhijay Kodali, 12, of Flower Mound; Rohan Raja, 13, of Irving; and Sohum Sukhatankar, 13, of Dallas — have gotten to know one another through competitions and have formed a friendship that spans from spelling to video games. When they see one another at contests, the boys often goof off together in their free time, said Rohan’s father, Raja Adaikalasamy. “They talk about video games, movies, ‘Hey what’s going on in your school?’ ‘This thing happened in my school,’” he said. He said the parents had gotten to know one another as well. “It’s very nice,” said Mr. Adaikalasamy, who works as a product manager for IBM. “You kind of relate to what each parent is doing and what they put into it, appreciating and recognizing. You just want everyone to do well.” “At the end of the day, these kids are not competing against each other,” he said. “They are just competing against the dictionary.” [There are 472,000 words in the dictionary. That may not be enough.] But there is little time to socialize outside of competitions. Abhijay, a middle schooler who placed third in last year’s Scripps National Spelling Bee, told CNN in an interview on Friday that he studied four to five hours on weekdays and, during competition season, up to 10 hours on weekends. “A little more, just depending on if I had any homework,” he said. At the Dallas Regional Spelling Bee in March, all three boys made it to the end, forcing a written test for 25 words. Abhijay got a perfect score; Rohan and Sohum each missed just one and tied for runner-up, according to the Dallas Sports Commission, which runs the regional bee. The scores were so close that the Dallas Sports Commission and another local sponsor, Golden Chick restaurants, decided to pay for all three students to go to nationals in Maryland. “That was unprecedented,” said Andrew Dockrill, the event manager for the Dallas Regional Spelling Bee. A few days later, he said, the commission took the three boys and their families to a Dallas Mavericks basketball game, where they appeared on the Jumbotron together. In nearby Fort Worth, which has its own regional competition, this year’s contest went through more than 60 rounds and also ended with a written exam, according to WFAA, the local ABC affiliate. In all, Texas sent 69 students to the national spelling bee this year out of the competition’s more than 500 contestants, more than any other state. A fourth student from the Dallas-Fort Worth area, Hephzibah Sujoe, 13, was one of the final 16 contestants, but was edged out before the final eight were crowned winners. Each of the eight remaining students earned $50,000 and a trophy. In an interview on Friday, Rohan said he planned to save the money for college. But in the short term, he had his sights set on a cellphone. “Earlier, I asked my mom like, ‘Mom, can you get me a phone?’” he recalled. “And she said, ‘If you can win the Scripps spelling bee, I’ll get you a phone.’ And then I did, so that worked well.” Abhijay, who got a German shepherd after placing third in Scripps last year, was hoping for another dog, but his parents said their hands were full for now. Sohum is hoping to get a cat, The Dallas Morning News reported. All of the students said they were glad that they were able to win together. “I’m really thankful I could have this experience,” Rohan said, “and it was really fun sharing it with them.”",The New York Times

2019,30 Dead and 200 Missing in Congo After Boat Sinks,"At least 30 people died and hundreds were believed missing after a boat sank over the weekend in a lake in the Democratic Republic of Congo, The Associated Press has reported. The boat sank after hitting bad weather on Saturday night in Lake Mai-Ndombe, nearly 300 miles northeast of the capital, Kinshasa, The Associated Press reported. Officials said on Sunday that more than 80 people survived but that 200 others were still missing. Simon Mboo Wemba, the mayor of Inongo, the provincial capital of Mai-Ndombe Province, told The Associated Press on Sunday that many of those aboard were teachers. He said they were traveling to collect their salaries by boat because local roads in that part of the central African country were so poor. Lake Mai-Ndombe is about 100 miles east of Yumbi, a town where violence between the Bununu and Batende ethnic groups flared a few weeks before the country’s presidential election in December, leaving nearly 900 people dead. Officials later discovered 15 mass graves and 43 single graves in the area.",The New York Times
2019,"30 Minutes Before Curtain: Hugs, Prayers, Laughter and Noise","the Tony Awards Things are tense and tingly enough before the curtain rises at any time of the year. What’s it like during prize season? The actor Bertie Carvel waiting for the curtain to go up at “Ink.”CreditCreditHeather Sten for The New York Times Makeup? Check. Wigs? Check. Stretching? Check. Teasing? Check. And, seriously, folks, moral support, too. We sent photographers to five Broadway theaters on Saturday night, May 4, to capture what it’s like backstage in the run-up to the Tony Awards. Here’s some of what they saw in the 30 minutes before curtain, as described by actors and others caught up in the whirlwind that only ends with the June 9 ceremony. Best Play Nominee James Graham’s boisterous look at Rupert Murdoch’s entry into the world of London tabloids features a cast of 18. “What can happen with a big company is that you find yourself onstage with someone who you haven’t actually seen yet that day. So I suggested during previews that we do a warm-up. It involves everyone standing in a circle, holding hands. You sort of start humming and making noises, and when everybody has looked at every other person in the eyes, directly, just for a second or two, we start making more noise. It ends up in a big roar, or cheer, and that gets everybody going.” — Jonny Lee Miller, who portrays the newspaper editor Larry Lamb. BEST MUSICAL NOMINEE Anaïs Mitchell’s folk-blues adaptation of the Orpheus and Eurydice myth features two pairs of lovers whose lives intersect in the underworld. The costumed seven-piece band never leaves the stage during “Hadestown,” and at the top of Act II its members even get a shout-out by name. Beforehand, the trombonist Brian Drye confines his noisy warm-ups to an alley next to the theater. Inside, the musical director and conductor Liam Robinson checks in on the cast’s vocal health, sometimes conveying a few notes to the band in the basement before they head onto the stage. “Just keeping the screws tight,” he said. Meanwhile, the Fates are conspiring. “We’re very close, and usually laughing a bunch,” said Kay Trinidad, one-third of the trio, who share a dressing room. “Don’t tell everyone — we’re usually the last ones to places,” she added. “We try to beat Patrick Page [a Tony nominee who plays Hades]. If Patrick is ahead of us, we’re really late.” BEST MUSICAL NOMINEE Three nominated performances highlight this high-energy bio-musical about the Temptations. “There’s two circles that happen. There’s one that’s a bit bigger, and that’s anyone who wants to pray before the show. Once places is called, the five of us, we enter from stage right and do a circle. We’re actually hugging each other. It’s like we link up emotionally so that we can link up onstage and carry the show collectively.” — Derrick Baskin, who portrays Otis Williams, the one living founding member of the Motown group. BEST MUSICAL NOMINEE A musical adaptation of the 1982 movie that resets the story in the fond-but-cynical world of musical theater. “I like to be made up very early. I like to get into character, put that wig on, put on those gorgeous Rita Marshall clothes. I go visit everyone. And then we make our way into Santino’s room, and we kind of converge there and find out, well, how’s your day? Santino is inevitably doing something like putting up a new picture, putting contact paper on his walls. Like he thinks he’s on ‘Extreme Makeover.’ It’s just kooky. But we love it, and we always make fun of him. And that’s how we get ready to go onstage.” — Julie Halston, who portrays a veteran producer. “It’s always a little weird when you realize that you are in a hotel, because if you go out one door the wrong way, you’re in the lobby. And I’ve done it.” — Ms. Halston on playing the Marquis Theater BEST Musical REVIVAL NOMINEE A powerful rethink of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical that starts in sunshine and ends in blood. James Davis, who plays the happy-go-lucky Will Parker, likes to touch base with his dressing-room-mate (and Tony nominee) Damon Daunno, who undergoes a dramatic arc as Curly. “We talk about whatever is on our mind and where we are emotionally,” Mr. Davis said. “It helps cleanse out for the intense three hours ahead of us.” In another dressing room, Will Brill, who portrays Ali Hakim, lubricates and combs out his mutton chops to look the right amount of smarmy. “Not as laborious a transformation as it should be,” he said. “It’s much like sports. We’re a team and we’re about to play this game together.” — Mr. Daunno",The New York Times
2019,"30 Years After Tiananmen, a Chinese Military Insider Warns: Never Forget","A former People’s Liberation Army journalist defied a political taboo to describe the bloody crackdown in Beijing and urge a national reckoning. Vehicles on fire on the night of the crackdown in Tiananmen Square in Beijing on June 4, 1989.CreditCreditPeter Charlesworth/LightRocket, via Getty Images BEIJING — For three decades, Jiang Lin kept quiet about the carnage she had seen on the night when the Chinese Army rolled through Beijing to crush student protests in Tiananmen Square. But the memories tormented her — of soldiers firing into crowds in the dark, bodies slumped in pools of blood and the thud of clubs when troops bludgeoned her to the ground near the square. Ms. Jiang was a lieutenant in the People’s Liberation Army back then, with a firsthand view of both the massacre and a failed attempt by senior commanders to dissuade China’s leaders from using military force to crush the pro-democracy protests. Afterward, as the authorities sent protesters to prison and wiped out memories of the killing, she said nothing, but her conscience ate at her. Now, in the run-up to the 30th anniversary of the June 4, 1989, crackdown, Ms. Jiang, 66, has decided for the first time to tell her story. She said she felt compelled to call for a public reckoning because generations of Chinese Communist Party leaders, including President Xi Jinping, have expressed no remorse for the violence. Ms. Jiang left China this week. [New documents show power games behind Tiananmen crackdown.] “The pain has eaten at me for 30 years,” she said in an interview in Beijing. “Everyone who took part must speak up about what they know happened. That’s our duty to the dead, the survivors and the children of the future.” Ms. Jiang’s account has a wider significance: She sheds new light on how military commanders tried to resist orders to use armed force to clear protesters from the square they had taken over for seven weeks, captivating the world. The students’ impassioned idealism, hunger strikes, rebukes of officials and grandiose gestures like building a “Goddess of Democracy” on the square drew an outpouring of public sympathy and left leaders divided on how to respond. She described her role in spreading word of a letter from senior generals opposing martial law, and gave details of other letters from commanders who warned the leadership not to use troops in Beijing. And she saw on the streets how soldiers who carried out the party’s orders shot indiscriminately as they rushed to retake Tiananmen Square. Even after 30 years, the massacre remains one of the most delicate topics in Chinese politics, subjected to a sustained and largely successful effort by the authorities to erase it from history. The party has ignored repeated calls to acknowledge that it was wrong to open fire on the students and residents, and resisted demands for a full accounting of how many died. The authorities regularly detain former protest leaders and the parents of students and residents killed in the crackdown. A court convicted four men in southwestern China this year for selling bottles of liquor that referred to the Tiananmen crackdown. Over the years, a small group of Chinese historians, writers, photographers and artists have tried to chronicle the chapters in Chinese history that the party wants forgotten. But Ms. Jiang’s decision to challenge the silence carries an extra political charge because she is not only an army veteran but also the daughter of the military elite. Her father was a general, and she was born and raised in military compounds. She proudly enlisted in the People’s Liberation Army about 50 years ago, and in photos from her time as a military journalist, she stands beaming in her green army uniform, a notebook in hand and camera hanging from her neck. She never imagined that the army would turn its guns against unarmed people in Beijing, Ms. Jiang said. “How could fate suddenly turn so that you could use tanks and machine guns against ordinary people?” she said. “To me, it was madness.” Qian Gang, her former supervisor at the Liberation Army Daily, who now lives abroad, corroborated details of Ms. Jiang’s account. Ms. Jiang shared hundreds of yellowing pages of a memoir and diaries that she wrote while trying to make sense of the slaughter. “More than once I’ve daydreamed of visiting Tiananmen wearing mourning clothes and leaving a bunch of pure white lilies,” she wrote in 1990. Ms. Jiang felt a stab of fear in May 1989 when radio and television news crackled with an announcement that China’s government would impose martial law on much of Beijing in an effort to clear student protesters from Tiananmen Square. The protests had broken out in April, when students marched to mourn the sudden death of Hu Yaobang, a popular reformist leader, and demand cleaner, more open government. By declaring martial law across urban Beijing, Deng Xiaoping, the party’s leader, signaled that armed force was an option. Researchers have previously shown that several senior commanders resisted using military force against the protesters, but Ms. Jiang gave new details on the extent of the resistance inside the military and how officers tried to push back against the orders. Gen. Xu Qinxian, the leader of the formidable 38th Group Army, refused to lead his troops into Beijing without clear written orders, and checked himself into a hospital. Seven commanders signed a letter opposing martial law that they submitted to the Central Military Commission that oversaw the military. “It was a very simple message,” she said, describing the letter. “The People’s Liberation Army is the people’s military and it should not enter the city or fire on civilians.” Ms. Jiang, eager to spread the word of the generals’ letter, read it over the telephone to an editor at People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s main newspaper, where the staff were disobeying orders to censor news about the protests. But the paper did not print the letter because one of the generals who signed it objected, saying it was not meant to be made public, she said. Ms. Jiang still hoped that the rumblings inside the military would deter Deng from sending in soldiers to clear the protesters. But on June 3, she heard that the troops were advancing from the west of the city and shooting at people. The army had orders to clear the square by early on June 4, using any means. Announcements went out warning residents to stay inside. But Ms. Jiang did not stay inside. She remembered the people she had seen on the square earlier in the day. “Would they be killed?” she thought. She headed into the city on bicycle to watch the troops come in, knowing that the confrontation represented a watershed in Chinese history. She knew she risked being mistaken for a protester because she was dressed in civilian clothes. But that night, she said, she did not want to be identified with the military. “This was my responsibility,” she said. “My job was to report major breaking news.” Ms. Jiang followed soldiers and tanks as they advanced into the heart of Beijing, bursting through makeshift blockades formed with buses and firing wildly at crowds of residents furious that their government was using armed force. Ms. Jiang stayed close to the ground, her heart pounding as bullets flew overhead. Bursts of gunfire and blasts from exploding gasoline tanks shook the air, and heat from burning buses stung her face. Near midnight, Ms. Jiang approached Tiananmen Square, where soldiers stood silhouetted against the glow of fires. An elderly gatekeeper begged her not to go on, but Ms. Jiang said she wanted to see what would happen. Suddenly, over a dozen armed police officers bore down on her, and some beat her with electric prods. Blood gushed from her head, and Ms. Jiang fell. Still, she did not pull out the card that identified her as a military journalist. “I’m not a member of the Liberation Army today,” she thought to herself. “I’m one of the ordinary civilians.” A young man propped her on his bicycle to carry her away, and some foreign journalists rushed her to a nearby hospital, Ms. Jiang said. A doctor stitched up her head wound. She watched, dazed, as the dead and wounded arrived by dozens. The brutality of that night left her shellshocked. “It felt like watching my own mother being raped,” she said. “It was unbearable.” Ms. Jiang has long hesitated to tell her story. The head injury she suffered in 1989 left her with a scar and recurring headaches. She was interrogated in the months after the 1989 crackdown, and detained and investigated twice in following years over the private memoir that she wrote. She formally left the military in 1996 and has since lived a quiet life, largely ignored by the authorities. In recalling the events over several interviews in recent weeks, Ms. Jiang’s voice often slowed and her sunny personality seemed to retreat under the shadow of her memories. Over the years, she said, she waited for a Chinese leader to come forward to tell the country that the armed crackdown was a calamitous error. But that day never came. Ms. Jiang said she believed that China’s stability and prosperity would be fragile as long as the party did not atone for the bloodshed. “All this is built on sand. There’s no solid foundation,” she said. “If you can deny that people were killed, any lie is possible.”",The New York Times
2019,"36 Hours in Bend, Ore. (and Environs)","This small, woodsy city is the perfect base for family fun, with enough hiking, fishing, biking, doughnut-eating and parental beer-sipping to keep everybody happy. Residents of Bend unite around the core conviction that they live in a beautiful place. But great beauty also inspires an undercurrent of concern that this mountain town’s natural splendor will be imperiled if too many people show up and spoil the place. A popular local bumper sticker reads, “Bend Sucks, Don’t Move Here,” and Visit Bend, the local tourism promotion board, has launched a campaign asking visitors to take “The Bend Pledge,” essentially warning them against rotten behavior with the lure of a free trip to — where else? — Bend. Once called Quelah, the Beautiful Valley, by Native Americans, central Oregon is home to the world’s last Blockbuster video store and it’s known for its proliferation of cannabis dispensaries and craft breweries. But drinking, smoking and renting videos aren’t the key attractions here. With all the opportunities to hike, bike, kayak, fish and daydream in the unspoiled nature that surrounds Bend, the place is a natural for family fun. Start with this kid-tested, parent-approved weekend and you might end up joining the crowd that hopes everyone else keeps out. There’s no better family-friendly introduction to Bend and its environs on a warm day than to float the Deschutes River. Rent a river tube from Tumalo Creek Kayak & Canoe ($16), and take the Ride the River Shuttle ($3, unlimited rides, June 15 to Labor Day), or walk to Riverbend Park, where you’ll float down to Drake Park and then take the shuttle back. Your lazy float will take you north through the Old Mill District, with its three towering smokestacks — a legacy of the competing lumber mills that once operated here — then through a narrow section of the river where you’ll float by the backyards of some lovely homes before ending up at pretty Drake Park, named after Alexander Drake, a Midwestern businessman who built a cabin here in 1900. After you clean up, treat yourself to a delicious almond cronut ($3.50), a doughnut-croissant hybrid at Too Sweet Cakes, owned and operated by the 25-year-old pastry chef prodigy Shelbi Blok. In 1905, the year the city was incorporated, Bend’s first doctor, Urling Coe, wrote in a letter that the town had two saw mills, eight all-night saloons with gambling, seven phone lines and a “lusty red-light district consisting of several shacks on the river bank,” frequented by “freighters, stockman, buckaroos, sheep herders, timber cruisers, gamblers and transients of all kinds.” The vibe these days is less raucous, but the walkable downtown’s two main north/south streets, Bond and Wall, still host much of the action. Downtown is particularly lively after work on the first Friday of each month, as child-friendly local businesses like Leapin’ Lizards Toy Company and Dudley’s Bookshop Café stay open late and frequently offer free wine and snacks for the First Friday Art Walk. Sit on one of the picnic tables with a view of Mirror Pond and the snow-capped Three Sisters peaks at Crow’s Feet Commons, a combination cafe, bar, bike and ski shop, and you’ll feel like you’ve landed on Bend’s front porch. The venerable Pine Tavern, established by a pair of enterprising women during the Great Depression, is a Bend classic, with an expansive patio overlooking Mirror Pond, curtained booths and a giant Ponderosa pine tree growing through the dining room. The happy hour bar menu specials are a good value, and their delicious, warm sourdough scones with honey butter, served after 5 p.m, are a bargain at 75 cents each. Children can feast on mac-n-cheese, chicken strips or grilled cheese for only $5.95. If you want something a bit less old school, try Bos Taurus, an upscale steakhouse that features premium meats from around the world, or Zydeco Kitchen & Cocktails, a busy, stylish spot where you can feast on grilled redfish ($27) while sitting at a sidewalk table enjoying the parade of people strolling by. Dinner runs about $20 to $30 without drinks at Pine Tavern or Zydeco, and about $30 to $50 at Bos Taurus. With nearly two dozen breweries in town, almost anytime is beer o’clock. Companies like Wanderlust Tours and the Bend Tour Company operate tours if you want to make the rounds. The tattooed, dog-owning parent set loves Crux Fermentation Project, which has a fenced yard and is pure Bend magic around sunset. For a taste of Bend history to go with your cream stout, head to the family-friendly McMenamins Old St. Francis School, an atmospheric complex built on the grounds of a former Catholic school that includes a small hotel, a cinema, an on-site brewery and restaurant, four intimate bars (including the hidden and aptly named Broom Closet bar) and, if you come a few hours earlier, a Turkish-style soaking pool where anyone can soak for $5 amid the fountains and ornate tiles depicting scenes with St. Francis. (Non-hotel guests can soak until 8 p.m., minors allowed until 6 p.m.; bring your own towel.) Hidden behind the main restaurant across a courtyard is Okanes, McMenamins’ most charming pub. Its namesake, Hugh O’Kane, was a 300-pound Irishman who traveled the world as a stowaway before founding Bend’s first hotel and saloon in 1905. Sit outside by the firepits, but don’t overlook the tiny pub’s stained glass windows and old church doors. Get to the Sparrow Bakery’s original location off the Bend Parkway early, before a line forms for ocean rolls ($4.50), Bend’s must-eat pastry. Made with hand-folded croissant dough and layered with sugar, vanilla and cardamom, it’s dense, rich and sensationally good. Sparrow’s treats are on sale at several other places in Bend, so if you’d rather enjoy your ocean roll with a view of the river, go to Looney Bean Coffee, and pair your roll with the Dirty Hippy, a chai tea latte with shots of espresso. If pastries aren’t your thing, get a mouth-watering, organic, free-range breakfast burrito ($6) and a dragon fruit smoothie ($5 to $8) from a drive-through (Life & Time:Free Range Fast Food). Then work off your breakfast on a Zagster bike share bike ($1.50 per 30 minutes, adult size only), or rent bikes of all sizes, as well as child trailers and buggies at Wheel Fun Rentals. Take a spin along the (partially) paved Deschutes River Trail or through the Drake Park Historic District to see some lovely homes, including the G.P. Putnam House at 606 Northwest Congress, which was once home to George Palmer Putnam. A New Yorker, Putnam came to Bend in 1909 at 21, became publisher of the local newspaper and then mayor in 1912 when the incumbent fell out a window to his death. He later married Amelia Earhart. Bend is more Mother Nature than museums, but you can enjoy both at the superb High Desert Museum (adults $17; children 3 to 12 $10), a 135-acre, indoor/outdoor museum in a woodsy spot south of downtown. The museum showcases the cultural and natural history of the Oregon High Desert, with an emphasis on Native American history and folklore, and animals that cannot survive on their own in the wild. Children will love the (injured) birds of prey, the desert tortoises, who inch around their habitat about as rapidly as some locals drive, and Pitch, Rogue and Brook, three musky-smelling river otters who showboat around their habitat like they’re auditioning to be reality TV stars. The experts at Visit Bend can help you narrow the dizzying number of outdoor activities and tour options, based on your tastes and fitness level. In town, a two-mile, round-trip hike (or drive) up 480-foot Pilot Butte offers panoramic views of the arid, sagebrush-dotted High Desert country to the east and the snow-capped mountains to the west. Families with younger children can cycle the closed-to-traffic road through Shevlin Park, one of the city’s prettiest green spaces. Farther afield, the trails at Dillon Falls and the North Fork trail at Tumalo Falls are photogenic, or you can cool off inside the Lava River Cave ($5), where it’s always 38 degrees. And don’t leave town without venturing out to Mount Bachelor, Bend’s premier ski resort, where in midsummer you can take the chairlift up to the 7,775-foot elevation Pine Marten Lodge ($20 adults, $14 youth 6 to 12), and have dinner or bomb down the 13 miles of downhill mountain bike trails. Cap off your afternoon of fun by driving along the Cascade Lakes Scenic Byway to idyllic Lucky Lake, where an easy one-mile hike through the woods earns you the right to take a blissful dip away from the summer crowds. The hamlet that grew up around the Farewell Bend Ranch was named Farewell Bend, until it was shortened by scrooges at the post office to Bend. You can learn about the city’s logging history by reading the interpretive signs along the Deschutes River Trail in Bend’s lively Old Mill District, where you’ll see the three smoke stacks that have dominated Bend’s skyline since the 1920s. For dinner, order the two-choice plate with kalbi beef and volcano chicken ($16.25) at the friendly Hawaiian restaurant Big Island Kona Mix Plate, or have the super-indulgent wagyu beef burger ($16) at the nearby Boxwood Kitchen & Supper Club, which also has a children’s menu with options like buttered pasta or cheeseburgers for $8. Bend is a long way from the Caribbean, but if you travel a mile west of the Old Mill District to Cuban Kitchen, you can play dominoes and tuck into down home Latin delights like thin cut palomilla steak or puerco asado ($12 and $13 with two sides; children’s meals are $7), lovingly made by the Aguilar family. A starter kit for escaping into the world. Bontà means “goodness” in Italian, but the term undersells how outstanding the gelato is at this popular local business. They vat pasteurize their milk and cream in house, ensuring that flavors like their Oregon hazelnut and peanut butter Theo fudge are intensely creamy. Before calling it a night, save time for a bit of family roistering at Worthy Brewing Company, which has its own “Hopservatory” — a research-grade telescope, manned by a “sky guy,” or teach your children how to play Tapper and Donkey Kong at the Vector Volcano Classic Arcade. Sisters is a charming ranch town north of Bend, originally called Three Sisters for the nearby peaks Faith, Hope and Charity, more prosaically known as North, Middle and South. The town is graced with Old West-style storefronts, a fun annual rodeo, and a hyper-abundance of outdoor activities in the vicinity. Start your day with a cup of what many consider central Oregon’s best coffee at Sisters Coffee, a block off the town’s touristy main drag, and across the street from Paulina Springs Books, arguably the region’s best independent bookstore. Then walk through town to Sisters Bakery, which has scones, doughnuts and other treats, and is housed in a 1908 building that was the town’s general store from 1925 to 1950. Try the superb marionberry or bacon-smoked cheddar scones ($4 and $4.50) or the double chocolate doughnuts ($1.25). Drive another 20 minutes north of Sisters to Camp Sherman, a delightful it’s-the-end-of-the-world-as-we-know it community of about 200 souls, deep in the woods, along the exceptionally pretty, spring-fed Metolius River, a fly fisherman’s dream. Kids love the Wizard Falls Fish Hatchery, where you can feed the rainbow trout for a quarter, and there are picturesque trails and campgrounds up and down the river, particularly Allen Springs and Lower Bridge. Wind up your weekend by checking out what may be the coolest general store in the West, the Camp Sherman Store & Fly Shop, which has been a hub of community life here since it was established in 1918. The place has everything from fly-fishing equipment to souvenirs to surprisingly tasty breakfast burritos. Vacation rentals are extremely popular in Bend. Look for a place with outdoor space that’s (preferably) walking distance to the Deschutes River. Prices start at about $150 a night for a single family home and go up depending on size, quality and season. The luxurious Tetherow Resort is a family- and dog-friendly golf resort on the way to Mount Bachelor that has a lovely heated pool that’s open year round. (Rooms from $159.) In Sisters, FivePine offers Craftsman-style cabins, stylish suites and complimentary bike rentals, next to a fine brewpub (Three Creeks Brewing Company) and the four-screen Sisters Movie House, where you can have draft beer and food delivered to your seat.

2019,36 Hours in Bordeaux,"In the heart of grape-growing country, this riverside city in France is especially appealing to those in the wine-sipping, food-loving crowd. Having long shed its reputation as a backwater, Bordeaux is still often overlooked by travelers intent on the Paris-Provence circuit. Nestled in verdant wine country and on the edge of leading oyster-producing areas, this elegant city on the Garonne River melds a history as a wealthy shipping center with a more recent resurgence in arts and infrastructure to make for a captivating — and mouthwatering — destination that’s easy to navigate on a system of modern trams. And with the high-speed rail service introduced in 2017, it’s just two hours southwest of the French capital. Shake off the travel dust and learn the lay of the land during an aperitif boat ride along the Garonne as it flows through Bordeaux before emptying into the Atlantic. The 90-minute cruise on the 74-passenger, steel-hull Sardane provides expansive views of the grand 18th-century architecture around the Place de la Bourse and its bronze and marble fountain of the Three Graces; the renovated former warehouses of the Quai de Bacalan; the soaring Cité du Vin (City of Wine) museum; and the engineering marvel that is the Jacques Chaban-Delmas vertical-lift bridge, all while you taste two or three local wines and nibble on cheese and charcuterie. Adults 28 euros, or about $31. Catch an A tram at the Pont de Pierre and cross to the right bank where you’ll find the Rocher de Palmer, a suburban arts and concert venue with eclectic offerings like jazz, rap, classical and world music. Prices generally range from about 17 to 27 euros. Then head back to Rue Notre Dame and a (pre-booked) table at Chez Dupont, on a narrow back street in the trendy Chartrons district, for a late dinner of classic French mains like steak frites, duck confit or lemon-butter sole. Dinner for two with wine is about 100 euros. Dive into the city with the ease of an electric bike on a private guided tour (two hours, 50 euros). Start early to avoid the height of vehicle and foot traffic, don the provided helmet, ride past the monumental Cathedral of St. Andrew and turn north through the Place des Quinconces. Let the engine help you up the slope of the Chaban-Delmas bridge and across to the less-developed right bank. Pause at Darwin, an urban renovation project, billed as a green-economy hub in former military barracks that now house a skate park, pop-up shops, beer gardens and an urban farm. Cross back over on the Pont de Pierre to the Water Mirror installation, an inch-deep pool that reflects the scene and the sky before erasing them in a cloud of mist. Replenish your energy by sampling canelé, the tiny, often rum-flavored, caramelized cakes that are a specialty of the Bordeaux region. Available in many patisseries, these chewy treats break out of the traditional mold at Auguste K., a canelé “boutique” that reaches beyond vanilla to flavors like lemon, orange, black cherry, chocolate and even gluten-free options. Grab a couple (typical price for the smallest: about 1 euro each) and enjoy with some French roast at a cafe in the nearby Place du Parlement. Feed the eyes, if not the wallet, with a shopping stroll along the Rue Notre Dame where the fashionistas head to Lily Blake or Zazie Rousseau for women’s ready-to-wear; Shoes Art for designer footwear and sumptuous scarves; and Coutume for an updated take on a hardware store. Learn French slicing and dicing techniques with a quick course (17 euros) at the Atelier des Chefs. Classes are held in a kitchen workspace at the rear of a culinary supplies shop and the results are devoured in an adjacent dining area with optional glasses of wine. Instruction schedule varies, so check in advance. A lunchtime “pause” class recently taught French and American participants how to make a chestnut risotto in a saffron-infused broth. Copies of the recipes are sent by email afterward. A starter kit for escaping into the world. For an up-close look at Bordeaux’s vaunted wines, splurge on a Wine Cab pickup near the opera house for an afternoon trip to the countryside in a London black taxi with a bilingual chauffeur/guide. Stop at centuries-old grand cru vineyards large or small (like the sleekly modernized Château La Gaffelière or the more rustic, but charming, Château Coutet), visit the musty caves or chat with vintners among the vines. Tastings are plentiful and you don’t have to worry about being a designated driver. A roughly four-hour trip for two, including a stop in the medieval village of St.-Émilion, is 450 euros. 8) 7 p.m. Starry, starry menu Invest in a white-tablecloth-and-chandelier experience at La Grande Maison’s two Michelin star restaurant inside a neoclassical mansion. A recent seasonal meal in the stately library began with glazed wild sea bass with razor clams and a cauliflower mayonnaise, and progressed to a scallop in a fine mousse with red endive and fresh walnuts, followed with a casserole of tender Iberico pork roasted with fragrant herbs. The meal ended with five samplings of designer desserts from the chefs Pierre Gagnaire and Jean-Denis Le Bras. The artistry of the food and the attentive service come at a price: A four-course tasting menu for one person is 145 euros. Want wines to match? Add another 95 euros. Stop for a nightcap at Le Vertige in the bustling St. Pierre neighborhood. This is a modern and bright wine bar with a welcoming atmosphere and a clever order-by-card system that lets you choose small, medium or large tasting portions from a row of wines in an upscale vending machine and pay accordingly. It’s a fun way to sample a pricey grand cru or two without buying an entire bottle. The city’s neighborhood markets and “brocantes” are great for finding upcycled souvenirs. Head to Place St. Michel where vendors set up tables or spread out carpets topped with what they hope you’ll see as second-hand treasures, which recently included vintage vinyl, ceramics galore and a silver-plated Servan comb and hairbrush set in its original satin-lined leather box next to an enamel-on-metal painting of someone’s favorite German shepherd. For 5 euros, climb 230 steps inside the bell tower of St. Michael’s Basilica for a drone’s-eye view of the action. With so much to take in at La Cité du Vin, this impressive museum, which opened in 2016, offers an array of self-guided, hourlong highlights tours to intrigue adults and children alike, helped by handy graphics and English translations. “The Essentials” tour, for example, includes a look at the history of winemaking and how Bordeaux — where winemaking dates to the ancient Romans — fits into that, and videos in which male and female winemakers from different countries talk about their terroir. The “Juniors” route for ages 7 to 12 includes a cartoon video of Romans shipping wine across the sea and a “buffet of the five senses” where sniff tests identify aromas and flavors found in wine. A 20-euro ticket also allows elevator access to the eighth-floor Belvedere observatory, including a taste of wine. Across the tram tracks from the wine museum is the Halles de Bacalan, an indoor-outdoor food court where two dozen vendors offer the region’s gourmet goods. Grab a platter of freshly shucked oysters and a glass of minerally white wine, or tastings of truffle and foie gras with a bold red. End with a cheese plate or a cup of intense chocolate mousse. (Expect to pay about 20 euros for a dozen oysters with wine.) Bordeaux has an abundance of rentals through companies like Airbnb and Homeaway. (Airbnb recently listed a one-bedroom apartment near the opera house for about $150 a night.) One independent option is a guesthouse called Chartrons Ecolodge (23 rue Raze; doubles from 125 euros). The building features lots of stone steps, ceiling fans, pine floors and antiques. Solar panels and energy-saving lighting add to the eco-credentials. An abundant breakfast featuring organic items is served in the covered courtyard. With a prime view of Place du Parlement, Villa Reale (9 Parliament Square; doubles from 300 euros) blends the comforts of a design-driven home with the convenience of being in the center of pedestrian-friendly action on a pretty square close to main tram lines. The 18th-century structure offers well-stocked kitchens in three air-conditioned suites. (Check the price list before popping those Champagne corks). La Course townhouse (69 rue de La Course; doubles start at 185 euros) is on a quiet street just steps from the green Jardin Public and the C tram that goes south to the Gare St. Jean. It’s a fine base for exploring boutiques and bars. There are bicycles, a small gym and steam room, and a wine cellar where tastings can be arranged. Some rooms have double sinks, large tubs or walk-in showers: one offers a skylight and a private rooftop pool. Follow NY Times Travel on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

2019,36 Hours in Dakar,"Get ready for late nights, baobab smoothies and cotton-candy sunsets in this sunny, surf-loving city on the coast of Senegal. The westernmost point of continental Africa, Dakar is a cosmopolitan desert landscape that juts into the emerald Atlantic. With its brightly painted minibuses, wooden boats and a flair for colorful fashion, the capital of Senegal is a paradise of cool. Men waddle down the road in wetsuits pulled to their waists and surfboards tucked under their arms. Women in mermaid-like dresses hawk sandwiches stuffed with egg, French fries and lentils that rival meals sold from any hipster food cart in New York City. Rooftop bars and restaurants abound, and many seaside establishments feature tidal pools and beach chairs for sunbathing. With nearly six months of sunny days and sweater-weather evenings, this city is one of the more comfortable in the region. Senegal’s culture of hospitality, known as teranga, offers a welcoming vibe — don’t be surprised if you are beckoned over by locals to share a meal or a gritty cup of cafe touba, the local pepper-and-clove flavored brew. Start your trip to one of the world’s hottest new surf spots with a dip in the ocean and a lesson from Ecole Surf Attitude. Private lessons come with a board and wetsuit, which you likely will need between December and May, and energetic instructors who will guide you through the choppy waves. Locations include the wide expanse of Yoff Beach or the waves off the tiny coastal island of Ngor, and vary depending on skill level, tides and wave forecast. Lessons start out with beachside stretching and a warm up. The course is great for beginners and even for young children, with patient instructors who will help steady the board to ensure you stand up and catch the buzz. Book in advance. A private lesson costs 25,000 West African C.F.A, or around $43. Hose off at the outside shower at Chez Fatou seaside restaurant and settle in for aperitifs and bowls of peanuts, the country’s main cash crop, to watch how surfing is really done. The outdoor restaurant offers a perfect view of one of Dakar’s toughest breaks where wave-riders deftly navigate black jagged rocks poking from the water. The bartender makes a strong, gingery Moscow Mule for grown-ups and a virgin mojito that is a hit with children. As the cotton-candy-colored sunset spreads across the horizon, don’t forget to try bissap, a bright, purple local nectar made from hibiscus flowers, or a baobab smoothie called bouye. Specialty drinks with alcohol are 5,000 C.F.A. Before the sun dips all the way, ditch the kids and grab a taxi, plentiful anywhere here, and tell the driver to drop you at Magic Land. Once you’re in the parking lot and looking straight at the oddball amusement park, wander to the right between the buildings where you’ll reach a ramshackle beach. Vendors there sell some of the best catch on the continent. Point to the fish you want and it will be grilled on the spot. The thiof, a type of white grouper, is particularly delicious and served smothered in a tart onion sauce with fries and salad on the side. Darkness will fall as you’re seated at a plastic table on a rocky, and not particularly pristine, beach, but one with a marvelous view, and a few stray cats. A meal for two is about 15,000 C.F.A., but prices are negotiable. If a fancy meal suits you better, head next door to the restaurants of the luxury Terrou-Bi Hotel and dine on European fare with a few local dishes by the impressively lit infinity pool with the sea in the background. If you want to dance with the locals, you’re going to have to stay up late. The dance party in Dakar doesn’t start until well after midnight in most clubs –—a fact made all the more impressive when you consider many Dakarois don’t drink alcohol. If you’re a night owl, head to Le Vogue, where you can lose yourself in a swirl of smoke from hookah pipes (called shisha here) until the crowds push onto the downstairs dance floor about 2 a.m. For an earlier night, swing by La Calebasse, a restaurant where the music often starts a couple of hours before midnight. There’s no cover charge for Le Vogue on Friday nights. Lulu Café is one of only a handful of venues in the city that serves decent espresso drinks. The breakfast menu offers pastries, fruit and homemade yogurt or an omelet and potatoes with sautéed vegetables. A full breakfast is about 8,200 C.F.A. Browse the selection of books on display from Senegalese intellectuals such as Boubacar Boris Diop or wander into the attached design shop where local painters and artisans sell funky duffle bags, crafts, rugs, mirrors, side tables and furniture. The shop has a section of unique toys and furnishings covered in fun, colorful wax-print fabric to upgrade any child’s bedroom. Head downtown to the continent’s newest and most impressive museum, the Museum of Black Civilizations. Set in a modern, new building constructed by the Chinese, the museum offers a wide selection of works, including tools from pre-modern times, and art and sculpture with postmodern themes. The collection can seem a bit haphazard, but the modern works, including photos and iron sculptures from West African artists honored during Dakar’s Biennnale, are not to be missed. Entry for adults is 2,000 C.F.A.; children's entry is 500 C.F.A. Pop over to Le Lagon 1 for lunch. Intended to replicate the feel of being on a luxury boat in the middle of the ocean, the restaurant could serve as the setting for a sequel to The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou. Set on a long dock, it’s stuffed with odd, 1970s-era sea gear. You’ll find shrimp, shellfish and other seafood galore on the menu, and can expect to pay about 9,400 C.F.A. for lunch. Bring a bathing suit to lounge on the private beach or rent a kayak nearby at the environmental organization, Oceanium. Head to the Soumbédioune market, where you’ll weave between the fishermen and their pirogues to aisles of treasures: carvings and jewelry and paintings under glass (a local specialty). Pick up fabric to drop at a tailor for your own creation. Popular patterns involve birds, further sealing Dakar’s image as a global hipster capital to fans of meme culture (“put a bird on it”). You’ll have to haggle for everything here, but don’t pay more than 2,500 C.F.A. for an easily packable bird-print tote bag. The boutique hotel Le Djoloff has a chalkboard menu that rotates each night, but often includes small, shareable plates of seafood or, on a recent night, a butternut squash sautee. You can order a Djoloff drink (a concoction of guava, ginger and bissap juice) for 3,000 C.F.A. A drink by the same name with alcohol, which involves lime juice, vodka, ginger and a mystery substance that turns the drink a neon blue color, costs 5,000 C.F.A. Pop downstairs to The Cave for a mellow night of jazz in a small, sit-down space. Reservations are recommended. Join the long line of locals at Graine D’Or, a heavenly bakery with rows of glistening pastries, including raisin rolls, puffy beignets, fluffy croissants, spears of bread and perfect pain au chocolat. Holiday seasons bring out child-sized chocolate Santa Clauses and Easter bunnies — this tolerant Muslim society adores Christian holiday icons. Pack a picnic of pastries and grab a cab to your next outing. A crispy baguette costs just 400 C.F.A. The Isle des Madeleines is a small national park island off the coast with emerald bays and rocky bluffs. A guide will tag along — no one is allowed on the island without one –—as you board a wooden boat, life vests provided. The island, with its few dwarf baobabs, is uninhabited. Trinkets, cash and milk are left as gifts for a genie said to live inside one baobab. Another octopus-like baobab looks like a monster sat on it. Tidal pools with starfish and translucent octopuses make for a magical children’s outing. Entrance fee is 1,000 C.F.A.; guide and pirogue are about 9,000 C.F.A. per group. The Mamelles Lighthouse, a restaurant and club set at the base of a lighthouse, offers one of the best views of Dakar from on high. You can tour the inside of the lighthouse before a breakfast of bread and pastries, juice, eggs and fried potatoes. Hop in the restaurant’s van to get to the windswept top. Brunch selections range from 8,500 C.F.A. to 17,500 C.F.A. (Weekend dancing at the lighthouse starts after 10 p.m. and caters to an expat crowd.) The ultra-modern Radisson Blu is attached to Dakar’s only shopping mall. The coastal location offers the opportunity for long walks or runs right out its front gate where throngs of locals jog each evening. Its large swimming pool is the perfect setting for an evening cocktail or two. Doubles start around 150,000 C.F.A. for weekend nights. Airbnb quality can vary dramatically in Dakar with lots of unfulfilled promises, but a sure bet is a room at the lovely Loman Art House Villa. Spacious rooms spill out onto art-filled spaces and offer a gorgeous swimming pool wrapped in an intricate metal sculpture created by the artist who runs the villa. She may even let you use her huge and tastefully decorated kitchen to make your own meals. Rooms start at $75. Follow NY Times Travel on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

2019,36 Hours in Melbourne,"How to spend a weekend in this coffee-sipping, culture-loving, boundary-pushing city in southern Australia. Pity Melbourne: After seven years of topping the Economist Intelligence Unit’s most livable city rankings, it was finally displaced last year by another coffee-loving city, Vienna. Despite being nudged down a notch to No. 2, Melburnians aren’t too worried. Though the city is currently grappling with issues related to being such a popular place to live — rapid growth, high property prices, congested roads — the city in the southeastern part of Australia continues to be the country’s capital for all things cultural. There are more festivals than can fit on a calendar; a thriving, boundary-pushing restaurant scene; and a commitment to the arts that will only deepen with the National Gallery of Victoria’s plans to build the largest contemporary art gallery in Australia by 2025. Melbourne may have lost its crown, but it still has its spacious Victorian-era parks, flat whites and famously sunny way of life. Situated on calm Port Phillip Bay, Melbourne doesn’t have Sydney’s surf culture, but the seaside suburb of St. Kilda comes close: palm-fringed beaches, daredevil kite-surfers and (usually) plenty of sun. Start with a stroll past the charming, old-school cake shops on Acland Street — the 85-year-old Monarch Cakes makes a chocolate kugelhopf with a recipe dating back to the cafe’s early days, while Europa Cake Shop serves up a fabulous poppy seed cheesecake and flourless orange cake. Afterward, head to the beach for a dip in the bay, or if the weather isn’t cooperative, pop into Pontoon, a sleek bar with an outdoor patio just steps from the sand, and sip a pint of Melbourne-brewed Stomping Ground pale ale (14 Australian dollars, or about $10) while watching the tattooed, bronzed beachgoers saunter by. The smell of smoke and crackle of firewood hits you the second you enter Matilda, opened last June by Scott Pickett, one of Melbourne’s most acclaimed chefs. Nearly everything at Matilda is cooked over fire or charcoal — the open kitchen, set right next to the front door, is equipped with an offset smoker, wood-fired oven, rotisserie and two fire pits, but there’s nary a gas stove in sight. And this wood-fired focus pairs well with a menu highlighting native Australian ingredients, from the grilled baby barramundi topped with a grenobloise made from salt bush, desert lime and lemon myrtle (44 dollars) to the grilled 21-day-aged Tasmanian porterhouse with a macadamia romesco (49 dollars). And though the Pink Lady apple tarte Tatin (22 dollars) is baked in a conventional oven, there is a fire element here, too — a gentle smoking of the vanilla ice cream on the side. Built in 1878, the opulent, bayfront Hotel Esplanade was the epicenter of society life in St. Kilda’s early days. The philanthropist Alfred Felton, a major benefactor of the National Gallery of Victoria, lived here for over a decade until his death in 1904, and throughout the 20th century, the hotel was a premier music venue, hosting everything from jazz and big band performances to disco nights. After falling into disrepair, the Esplanade (called “the Espy” for short) underwent an 18-month renovation and reopened in November to play music once again. There are now three stages in the sprawling complex — including one in the hotel’s ballroom, the Gershwin Room — and a full slate of events every weekend, ranging from up-and-coming Australian bands to more conceptual performance art shows. Upcoming shows include Sun Kil Moon (May 15) and Sydney singer Ruby Fields (May 28 to 30). 4) 8:30 a.m. Beyond flat whites Melbourne is an early-rising town, which is not surprising for a city that prides itself on its coffee. And when it comes to coffee, Seven Seeds, a roaster and cafe in a converted warehouse space just north of downtown, is brewing some of the best in the city. The cafe sources its beans directly from growers on scouting trips to places like Ethiopia, Guatemala and the Bolivian Andes and recently started publishing the “farmgate price” paid to growers in an aim for greater transparency. The filtered cold brews (5 dollars) are fantastic, served with cocktail-style blocks of ice, and the breakfast menu features standouts like crab scrambled eggs topped with a Sichuan pepper caramel sauce and cilantro and mint salad (24 dollars). Public tasting sessions are also frequently held on Saturday mornings to demonstrate the baristas’ brewing techniques. Known simply as the “Queen Vic,” the Queen Victoria Market is not only Melbourne’s largest open-air market, it’s also one of the oldest, with a more than 140-year history that earned it a place on Australia’s National Heritage List last year. The market is packed no matter what time you visit, so conserve your energy and focus on the colorful meat, fish and dairy halls. The smorgasbord on offer here includes everything from lamb, mint and rosemary sausages to Australian bush herbs, macadamia dukkah and all manner of local cheeses and sourdough breads. Snack here, or order a bowl of freshly steamed mussels (from 11 dollars) outside at The Mussel Pot, a market favorite. (Tip: If you’re in town midweek, check out the night market on Wednesday evenings during both summer and winter.) As far as origin stories go, few are as slickly produced as the tale of Melbourne’s beginnings at the Melbourne Museum (adults 15 dollars, children free). The extensive, interactive exhibition first takes visitors through the history of the original Aboriginal inhabitants of the region and details the devastating impact of the arrival of Europeans in 1835: Their numbers were decimated by disease, and their lands stolen. The story then continues through Melbourne’s early days as a gunslinging gold rush town and tracks its phenomenal growth in more recent years. Two other highlights: the Wild exhibition, which details how a menagerie of more than 600 animals has been impacted by climate change; and the gorgeous Forest Gallery, a canopied woodland of tree ferns, gum trees and other native plants, populated by the birds and fish that have always called this part of Australia home. The once-working class neighborhood Fitzroy is now the go-to spot in Melbourne for local designers. There are well-known Australian fashion labels to be found here, such as Kloke and Handsom, as well as Mud Australia, a maker of brightly colored porcelain. But independent designers have a space, too. Uscha stocks Japanese-inspired ceramics, woodwork and leather items made by local artists, while Third Drawer Down partners with established and emerging artists on exclusive designs for everyday items like mugs, tote bags and homewares. At Design a Space, more than 80 local clothing designers rent racks to display their creations, keeping 90 percent of profits from sales. And the weekly Rose St. Artists’ Market features more artists, designers, bakers and organic farmers, peddling their wares in a former junkyard. As Melbourne’s eating and dining scene has matured in recent years, one chef in particular has been at the forefront: Andrew McConnell, who now counts a stable of nine venues to his name. Opened in late 2015, the wine bar Marion has been one of the most popular because of its eclectic wine menu — categories range from skin-contact whites to “Everything in Moderation, including Moderation” reds (mainly easy-drinking reds) — as well as the delicious, well-priced bar food. The chef’s selection (65 dollars a person) offers a sampling of the greatest hits, among them the Hiramasa kingfish topped with preserved orange peel, pickled fennel, Espelette pepper, fennel pollen and flowers; and grilled cuttlefish with burned spring onion dressing, radish, fennel and fried curry leaves. A curious side note: a few window seats overlook the brick alley known as Deadman’s Lane, so named for the bodies that ended up here — either drunk or dead — during Fitzroy’s gangland days in the early 1900s. Few people know the ins and outs of Australia’s booming craft distilling scene like Seb Costello, founder of the Fitzroy cocktail bar Bad Frankie. Named after the former governor of Van Diemen’s Land (now Tasmania), Sir John Franklin, who banned small-batch distilling on the island in the early 19th century, the bar celebrates the best of modern Australian spirit-making, with a menu spanning some 500 local gins, whiskies, vodkas and even more obscure liqueurs like a South Australian rakia and Tasmanian absinthes. Mr. Costello’s love of Australia carries over to the bar menu of jaffles, an Australian toasted sandwich snack, as well as the wallpaper featuring photographs of vintage Australiana, including a few from his own family albums. Though Melbourne is a sprawling urban center, it’s easier than you think to get a taste of the Australian bushland on the bucolic Main Yarra Trail, which winds for more than 20 miles along the tranquil Yarra River. Rent a bike that can handle very moderate hills; Freddy’s Bike Tours & Rentals has road bikes for 30 Australian dollars per half day. Then, starting in the city center, pedal past the 19th-century boathouses in Alexandra Gardens (still in use by weekend rowers) and follow the trail as it loops through South Yarra, finishing at the Abbotsford Convent, now a creative space with artist studios, cafes and a monthly farmers market. The ride is well-marked and mostly flat, with plenty of shade provided by gum trees and lovely views of the river. If you’re lucky, you may even spot a platypus frolicking in the Yarra. After your ride, spend an afternoon at the farm. Next to the convent, the Collingwood Children’s Farm (adults 12 dollars, children 7 dollars) is a 40-year-old nonprofit institution that’s home to a menagerie of animals (Berkshire pigs, Anglo Nubian goats, to mention a few) on just under 10 acres of pastureland. Children can get up close and personal with the animals by joining farmers on the twice-daily feed walks, brushing the cows or petting the resident guinea pigs. Afterward, sit down to a leisurely breakfast at the Farm Café, a breezy, flower-filled restaurant with a farm-to-table menu featuring grilled South Australian sardines with ricotta, olives and heirloom tomatoes on toast (21 dollars) and slow-cooked beef meatballs with house-made labne and tabbouleh (21 dollars). The view of the cows and chickens says it all about Melbourne — this really is the good life. Once a criminal haunt in the 1930s, Fitzroy is now one of the city’s most fashionable corners. It is also conveniently located: Several tram lines offer easy access to the central business district, South Melbourne and St. Kilda. There are plenty of converted loft apartments and former worker cottages available on Airbnb for around 100 to 150 Australian dollars a night. Is it a hotel or a gallery, or both? The Olsen Hotel (637-641 Chapel Street, South Yarra, artserieshotels.com.au/olsen/), a 224-room property in South Yarra, is dedicated to the 91-year-old landscape artist, John Olsen, one of Australia’s most accomplished painters, with his works scattered throughout. Doubles from 185 dollars a night. Set above Matilda, United Places Botanic Gardens (157 Domain Road, South Yarra; unitedplaces.com.au) is a rarity in Melbourne — an upscale, 12-suite boutique hotel with designer touches, including custom-made brass lighting, locally made ceramics and artworks, and furnishings by the Spanish designer Patricia Urquiola. Doubles from 650 dollars a night. Follow NY Times Travel on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

2019,36 Hours in Milan,"Italy’s capital of fashion and design is expanding its horizons as new cultural projects open in former industrial zones. More than three years have passed since Milan hosted the 2015 World Expo, a six-month extravaganza that generated more than 20 million visitors, corruption inquiries and a budget that ballooned to some 2 billion euros (or more). So was it worth it? In addition to improving infrastructure, the city used the event to position itself as the gateway to Italy — a destination for more than just fashion, design and business. Visitors today will find cleaned-up canals and restored landmarks, as well as a panoply of projects in peripheral industrial zones that have stretched the city outward. Art and design are still driving forces in Italy’s fashionable second city, but an unlimited transit pass might now be a wiser investment than designer shoes. A five-story building clad in gold leaf welcomes visitors to Fondazione Prada, a new contemporary arts complex as notable for its world-class exhibitions as for its eye-catching architecture. Last year the opening of a nine-story tower marked the completion of the compound, a former distillery redesigned by OMA, the architecture firm co-founded by Rem Koolhaas. Tour the tower’s large-scale artworks — Jeff Koons’s tulips, Walter De Maria’s shiny Bel Airs, Damien Hirst’s disturbing black flies — along with temporary exhibitions, including a multimedia installation from the American artists Lizzie Fitch and Ryan Trecartin (through Aug. 5). Even the on-site cafe, Bar Luce, is worth a look; its retro décor styled by the film director Wes Anderson includes whimsical touches, such as a Steve Zissou-themed pinball machine. Admission, €15, or about $16.70. Aperitivo is the time to stimulate (yet not sate) the appetite before dinner. For an unconventional take on the tradition, head to Birrificio Italiano Milano, the first bar from an acclaimed microbrewery, which opened in 2017 with beautiful terrazzo floors and a dozen taps. Try the Flos Alba, a barrel-aged sour wheat beer, paired with cicchetti (Venetian tapas), such as bite-size, mortadella-stuffed brioche. Or join the boisterous local crowd at Lacerba, a bar that embodies Italy’s early-20th-century Futurismo movement, from the riotous décor — walls papered with vintage Campari posters, model buses and mini liquor bottles hanging overhead — to the innovative cocktails, such as the Spicy Negroni (mezcal, Campari, gin, vermouth and habanero bitters; €9). Tripe, horse, snails, spleen and grilled marrow scooped from the bone are all part of the successful formula at Trippa, an outstanding trattoria that opened in 2015. Sociable servers will suggest house specialties like fried tripe — crisp, generously salted and sprinkled with fresh rosemary — but recent highlights also included thick-cut Piedmontese beef tartare and pillowy pumpkin-stuffed tortelli. Reserve online in advance to secure a table in the warm dining room where saffron-yellow walls and dark-wood furnishings give the feel of a decades-old establishment. Dinner for two, about €80. End the evening in Zona Tortona, a former industrial zone where derelict factories have been reclaimed by creative Milanese. After dark, crowds convene at Base, a multipurpose cultural complex that opened in 2016 with art galleries, co-working offices, an artist-in-residence program, performance spaces and art, music and cinema events. Come for the live music, which migrates to the courtyard in warmer months and ranges from jazz jam-sessions and Italian hip-hop to the theatrical song-and-prose performance known as teatro-canzone. Milan has no shortage of excellent museums, from the Pinacoteca di Brera to the Triennale Design Museum, and the cultural offerings continue to grow. The Museo delle Culture, or Mudec, opened in 2015 in another Zona Tortona industrial complex, which was redesigned by the British architect David Chipperfield. Inside, temporary exhibitions on a wide range of topics — Maori art, Miró, Barbie and Banksy — explore the intersection of art, history and culture. Ascend the black stone staircase to the luminous second-floor atrium to tour the “Storie in Movimento” exhibition about the dual experiences of Peruvians in Milan and of Italians in Peru (through July 14; €14). The story of the innovative bistro 28 Posti begins with inmates from a nearby penitentiary, who handcrafted the wooden cabinets and tables. This socially conscious restaurant is also notable for its excellent natural wines and the creative cuisine of Marco Ambrosino, a young chef from Procida. At lunch, claim one of the 28 seats for a surprise three-course menu (€35), which recently included orbs of squash in fermented-orzo broth; flower-shaped turnips with aromatic herbs and black truffle; and a twist on pizza turca with a lamb-and-sweetbreads filling beneath grilled bread dusted with tarragon. A tour of the historic city center may begin on Piazza del Duomo, but it ought not end there. Walk west to Cinque Vie, an intersection of five streets since the Roman era, to explore a labyrinth of narrow, winding lanes that feel more Florentine than Milanese. Once home to traditional craftsmen and artisan studios, the neighborhood has recently evolved into a hub of small galleries, design studios and independent boutiques. One worth seeking out is Wait and See, an exuberant shop founded by Uberta Zambeletti, a stylist with a penchant for unknown designers and colorful textiles, from fuchsia faux-fur coats to rainbow-sequined skirts and sparkly leopard-print trousers. Even those unfamiliar with Parisi and Ponti will be impressed by the interior design showroom Nilufar Depot. The industrial space had been intended as storage for Nina Yashar, the city’s pre-eminent gallerist and furniture dealer, but now showcases a museum-like collection of midcentury rarities and contemporary gems. In a dramatic atrium ringed by three stories of black steel balconies, furniture scenes were recently set with pristine Paolo Buffa armchairs from the 1950s, modern brass pendants by Simone Fanciullacci, velvet-wrapped tables, and rare Brazilian wood furnishings by the modernist architect Lina Bo Bardi. Not all of Milan is sleek and chic. For proof, find your way to La Balera dell’Ortica, a sprawling dance hall complex on the eastern edge of the city that draws a wide cross-section of locals for dinner, dancing and bocce. The convivial atmosphere and dinner — three courses plus dessert, wine and water for €25 — are reminiscent of the countryside Italian festivals known as sagre. Expect kitschy red velvet curtains, neon disco-ball lighting and long communal tables that quickly fill with multigenerational families, birthday celebrants, and couples young and old. Before long, a cover band will be crooning “Volare, oh oh,” while hipsters and retirees battle for dominance on the adjoining bocce courts. Don’t try to resist the smooth “ballo liscio” music, which in summer lures spinning pairs onto the outdoor dance floor. A nightcap in Navigli needn’t involve navigating the crowded bars and cafes that line the neighborhood’s historic canals. A block from the bustle, find Iter, a laid-back cocktail bar that reinvents itself every six months with décor and drinks inspired by the staff’s globe-trotting trips. The most recent destination was Panama — note the hats on the wall — so sample a fresh, fruity cocktail like the Sipu (gin, purple corn, pineapple and lime; €8). Prefer that tipple to-go? Then try Backdoor 43, a 40-square-foot bar nearby where a masked bartender passes take-away drinks, like Il Conte Lucano (amaro, white wine, gin, tea, and bitters; €6), through a small slot window beside the canal. Fuel up for the day at Orsonero Coffee, a corner cafeteria that opened in 2016, serving velvety cappuccini made with beans from Gardelli, a top Italian roastery. Then proceed to La Vigna di Leonardo, a new museum across from Santa Maria delle Grazie (home of “The Last Supper”) that reveals Leonardo da Vinci’s interest in viticulture. Opened in 2015, the museum invites visitors into Casa Atellani, a residential palazzo dating to the 15th century that was carefully restored by the architect Piero Portaluppi. Audio tours begin in a courtyard with faded 16th-century frescos, and continue through ornate halls into a grassy garden, where Malvasia vines have been replanted on a plot that was once part of da Vinci’s own vineyard, a gift from his patron the Duke of Milan in 1498. Admission, €10. Sunday is market day for vintage and antique hunters, and the best place to unearth treasures is East Market, where hundreds of collectors, designers, artists and artisans regularly gather in a former aeronautics factory. Meet vendors devoted to vinyl, video games, vintage clothes, Italian antiques, modern art and even rare Lego sets. A bar, D.J. and food stalls sustain the energy all afternoon. Dates vary, so check the schedule in advance; on off weekends, the East Market Shop, which opened in November, offers an edited selection from the market’s stalls. Around the corner from the Duomo, Room Mate Giulia is an 85-room hotel that opened in 2016 with playful interiors by the Spanish architect Patricia Urquiola. The design-conscious property offers a cheerful mix of colors and patterns, from the lobby lined with local artworks to rooms outfitted with furniture from Cassina (Via Silvio Pellico 4; room-matehotels.com/giulia; doubles from about €250). Beside the city’s fashion district, the Senato Hotel is an elegant 43-room boutique property that opened in 2015 in a neoclassical palazzo that was formerly a private family residence. The architect Alessandro Bianchi designed the chic black-and-white interiors, which feature custom furnishings, Carrara-marble bathrooms and gilded ginkgo-leaf light fixtures from the Milanese artisan studio Bottega Gadda (Via Senato 22; senatohotelmilano.it; from €221). The lively Navigli neighborhood is a good choice for apartment rentals, which start around $70 on Airbnb. And top marks also go to Ostello Bello, a 50-bed hostel near Cinque Vie with some private rooms, lots of free food and social activities (Via Medici 4; ostellobello.com; from about €50).

2019,37 More Former Ohio State Athletes Sue the University in Sexual Abuse Case,"Thirty-seven former Ohio State athletes — a majority of them football players and all but one anonymous — filed a civil rights lawsuit on Wednesday, saying that university officials had “aided, abetted and actively concealed” sexual assaults by Richard H. Strauss during his nearly 20 years as a team doctor for the school’s athletic department. The lawsuit, the fourth of its kind against the university, is the first since Ohio State’s acknowledgment this month of the scope of Strauss’s abuse. The university released a 182-page report detailing — sometimes in graphic terms — how he had assaulted male athletes who were often sent to him for treatment of injuries or for preseason physical examinations. What sets this suit apart from the others is the inclusion of 26 former players from the school’s powerhouse football program. There are also seven wrestlers, a swimmer, a gymnast, a volleyball player and an athlete whose sport was not made public. “Now that some football players have come forward, from my perspective, this has gotten a lot more eyes and a lot more interest,” said Michael L. Wright, one of the lawyers who filed the lawsuit. He expects other football players to join the suit. The suit echoes the report the university commissioned, which found repeated cases of institutional failure that allowed Strauss to abuse at least 177 students. The report also said that dozens of Ohio State officials, including more than 50 athletic department staff members, were aware of the doctor’s actions yet did not act to stop them. Few of those officials were named in the report. In the suit filed Wednesday, 14 of the former football players said Billy Hill, a longtime O.S.U. athletic trainer, shrugged off complaints that Strauss had made them uncomfortable or abused them, sometimes with a joke. Some players said they had complained repeatedly to Hill, who responded, according to one player, by saying it was “not a big deal.” Hill, whose name is attached to an Ohio State scholarship for student trainers, died of a heart attack in 1995. Strauss, who was a professor at the school from 1978 to 1998, died by suicide in 2005. The athlete who revealed his name in the lawsuit is a former wrestler, Michael DiSabato, who estimated that he was abused 45 to 50 times by Strauss from 1987 to 1991. The suit says that university officials retaliated against DiSabato after he publicly discussed conditions at Ohio State, and it accuses one official of posting DiSabato’s Social Security number on social media. Wright, the lawyer, said he expected the lawsuit to eventually be rolled into the three others. If it eventually reaches court, he said he would aim to put coaches, administrators and others on the witness stand — including Jim Jordan, a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives who is a former Ohio State assistant wrestling coach. “We want to know what he knew, when he knew it and what he did with the information,” Wright said.",The New York Times

2019,4 Film Series to Catch in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to film series and special screenings happening this weekend and in the week ahead. All our movie reviews are at nytimes.com/reviews/movies. AN ALL-COLORED VITAPHONE SHOW at Film Forum (May 20, 6:20 p.m.). Instead of combining film frames with an optical soundtrack, Vitaphone, an early sound system, synchronized the moving image with a record. This program highlights a variety of shorts made with the system that were showcases for African-American artists, including Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway and Ethel Waters. The following week, on May 28, Film Forum will host a tribute to Ron Hutchinson, who died in February; he was a founder of the Vitaphone Project, a campaign to restore Vitaphone films.212-727-8110, filmforum.org DELANYMANIA at the Metrograph (May 17-19). The science fiction author Samuel R. Delany wrote the notes for this series, which consists of movies he saw early in life and considers to be influences. He was taken with the anti-ostracism moral of Joseph Losey’s “The Boy With Green Hair” (on Saturday and Sunday), for instance, because it spoke to the otherness he felt growing up gay. He remembers that “The Seventh Seal” (on Saturday) marked the end of his “paired moviegoing” with his father, “or any further appreciation on his part of why I liked movies or why I would want to occasionally make them,” Delany said in press materials. Also showing: a program of his own films (on Saturday), Jean Cocteau’s “Orpheus” (on Sunday) and Orson Welles’s “Touch of Evil” (on Sunday).212-660-0312, metrograph.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] EMOTIONAL TIME: THE FILMS OF HENRY JAGLOM at Spectacle Theater (through May 30). Jaglom, a gadflylike figure in the late career of Orson Welles, has spent more than four decades directing his own independent passion projects. His stature with critics may be shaky, but this program makes the case that there is artistry in his solipsism. The series leans heavily on the films he made in the 1980s, including “Can She Bake a Cherry Pie?” (on Tuesday and May 28); “Someone to Love,” which was Welles’s last film as an actor (on Wednesday); and “New Year’s Day” (on May 26).spectacletheater.com FIGHTING MAD: GERMAN GENRE FILMS FROM THE MARGINS at the Quad Cinema (May 17-23). The German filmmaker Dominik Graf (“Beloved Sisters”) co-directed a documentary called “Doomed Love: A Journey Through German Genre Film,” screening on Saturday and Wednesday, which presents what the Quad describes as an “alternative history” of 1960s and ’70s West German genre cinema — interesting films that aren’t helmed by such widely acclaimed directors as Herzog, Fassbinder or Wenders. Graf also co-programmed this series, designed to satisfy anyone whose appetite is whetted by his documentary. The series goes beyond the doc’s time frame, but among the offerings from that period are the true-crime thriller “Bloody Friday” (“Blutiger Freitag”), on Friday and Monday, and “Dead Pigeon on Beethoven Street,” an often inscrutable tongue-in-cheek mystery made by the American Samuel Fuller for West German TV, on Saturday and Wednesday. The film features, in heavy rotation, Can’s “Vitamin C,” later used to accompany similarly baffling proceedings in “Inherent Vice.” A companion series on Graf’s own films will play at Anthology Film Archives May 24 through June 2.212-255-2243, quadcinema.com",The New York Times
2019,4 Musicians Chart 100 Years in the Life of a Runaway Slave,"Esteban Montejo was over 100 before the world knew his story. Born a slave in Cuba in 1860, he escaped and lived for years in the jungle until slavery was abolished on the island in 1886. He fought in Cuba’s war for independence from Spain and lived through Castro’s communist revolution. His interviews with an ethnographer were adapted into a riveting account of his life, published in 1966. The German composer Hans Werner Henze read the book, visited Cuba, met Montejo — who lived until 1973 — and, with the writer Hans Magnus Enzensberger, swiftly created “El Cimarrón,” which will be performed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Friday and Saturday. A 75-minute “recital for four musicians” — baritone, guitarist, flutist and percussionist (who presides over dozens of instruments) — it tells Montejo’s story through music that’s vivid, seductive and otherworldly, sometimes forceful, sometimes delicate, the vocal line floating between musical pitches and speech. The soprano Julia Bullock is presenting the piece as part of her season-long Met residency, which has ranged through slave song arrangements, an evening revisiting Josephine Baker, Langston Hughes settings and the contemporary Nativity oratorio “El Niño.” As she mulled the season, she asked friends about projects they might want to present. Two of them, the director Zack Winokur and the bass-baritone Davóne Tines, had long been wanting to work on “El Cimarrón”; dealing with slavery and the black experience, and originating in oral testimony, the piece fit right in. Ms. Bullock, though, will be offstage. “In these early days of figuring out how to curate,” she said in an interview, “it’s easier to visualize things with my direct involvement. But I was so glad to let the bookend of this be in somebody else’s hands.” After developing the production last summer with the American Modern Opera Company, Ms. Bullock, Mr. Winokur and Mr. Tines sat down in the midst of the final rehearsals to discuss it. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. What happens in “El Cimarrón”? ZACK WINOKUR It’s all told through his words. Hearing the story out of his mouth is the most thrilling thing. The music serves to amplify it — like the best of opera, it uses every theatrical resource available to just tell the story. DAVÓNE TINES We see what the foundation of this person was, the heft and thickness of his life experience. We experience his genesis and a bit of his growth. All of that is very closely narrated. But we’ve also been talking about the prism of memory, and later in life his mental faculties disperse or go to a different place. WINOKUR He talks about slavery with a very dynamic and forceful musical language. Then he escapes into the woods and there are these extended beautiful sections when he’s just figuring out how to navigate, roping piglets, making fires, listening to the trees, eating honey and finding herbs and different flowers and just sort of sleeping and listening to the birds. JULIA BULLOCK The real sense of freedom he felt for the first time. TINES And you feel that musically, as well. You go from the stringent, forceful music of slavery to this really open, impressionistic music of the forest. WINOKUR He talks about how much he just loved the peace and quiet, even though there were moments of extreme anxiety. And you see his interaction when he hears about the end of slavery, which he does not believe could be real. He encounters a woman with two children who tells him yes, we’re really free. And he decides to go back and then when he re-enters and becomes a waged worker, you see his impression of progress; there’s a section called “Machines,” just looking at the production of sugar cane, and it’s completely mind-blowing to him. BULLOCK Mind-blowing because so many things had been based on rudimentary human labor. But with the ending of slavery, people were still essentially enslaved. The capacity of their lives was still cemented. WINOKUR There’s almost no space when he’s talking about slavery. It’s incredibly rhythmical; there’s no space between sections. TINES Or between words in sentences. WINOKUR And when he goes into the woods, there are extensive, like, seven minutes of listening to the birds and walking. TINES And then we get back to “Machines,” and it’s even more mechanized. As if nothing has been solved. That must have appealed to Henze, a passionate leftist, on a political level. That slavery and what followed were just different iterations of unequal power. TINES The machines are just stronger and louder. WINOKUR Part One is in a straight order, as described in the book. In Part Two, the libretto took a little more of a turn, and we sort of get Montejo’s thoughts on things. Like about women, and how much he missed them, and there’s a little moment of attempted bestiality with a horse in the woods. About the priests and then about the Americans when they come, and how disgusting they are. And then we end where he ended, when he was doing the interviews at 103, and the importance of friendliness and being with people. BULLOCK Also taking up arms for oneself. WINOKUR A really thrilling part of the show is the Battle of Mal Tiempo, which is where we watch him cut off the heads of colonizing Spaniards. BULLOCK At the end of the biography and the end of the piece Henze wrote, the sense is that moving into the future, “I’ve got my machete.” WINOKUR “I’ll be there for all the battles that are coming.” It’s an unusual instrumentation. WINOKUR The music is held together in all these thin and beautiful ways. It’s very fragile. There’s the militant idea, captured in the gigantic battery of percussion. There are Cuban styles mixed with Spanish styles and American styles for different moments. We get this “Oh! Susanna” on the melodica during the whole “Yankees” bit, which is one of the strangest colors in the show. The Spaniards and that colonizing force are represented in the guitar, the Spanish guitar. When Montejo is not actually speaking, his voice and the whistling in the forest, as well as when he meets other people and talks about women; that voice is carried in the flute. And the weather is the battery of percussion. BULLOCK Davóne, you had said, “Some of these things are so fractured, I’m not sure how to lay my voice into it.” How are you feeling? TINES I’m feeling good. We’ve gotten deeper and longer into it, and a lot of fractured or disparate parts of the voice in the piece are part of a range of expression that goes from the simplest and most direct speech to the most fragile singing. Sometimes full voice, but this isn’t a big sing; it’s more the color between speech and pitched production. Just this morning I was thinking about toward the end of the piece when things sort of taper down. It’s interesting to play within a smaller range and not have to be [singing a wild parody of modernist music] “I have to be so cra-zy.” WINOKUR It should be a range that feels like speech — heightened speech, but speech. A lot of recordings feel very formal, and that doesn’t seem like that was Henze’s intention. I wanted to get it back to its origin as a “recital for four musicians,” and a real chamber piece. Not only did I want the musicians to be implicated in the action and become characters in the piece, using their musical material, but I also wanted it to have the attention on each other that’s necessary in chamber music. BULLOCK That’s one reason I wanted to program this. Oftentimes when Henze is performed, people are wanting to show it is alternative. But I think Henze was trying to create a very human expression. An earlier version of this article and a photo caption misidentified the voice type of the singer Davóne Tines, who is appearing in “El Cimarrón” at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Though the work is written for the baritone range, he is a bass-baritone, not a baritone.",The New York Times
2019,4 Women With Lives Scarred by Genital Cutting: Could a Surgeon Heal Them?,"Over 200 million women and girls alive today have been circumcised. Four of them shared with The Times their pain, emotional trauma and sexual struggles — and their journey to feel whole. Saffiatu Sillah, whose circumcision caused her to endure agonizing pain during the births of her children, Mijan Kamara, foreground, and Jaria Kamara, asked a surgeon to help her.CreditCredit ­PHILADELPHIA — She called it her “deepest, darkest secret,” one she had never even shared with her husband. When Saffiatu Sillah was growing up in the West African nation of Sierra Leone, her clitoris was cut off in a ritual circumcision. She was left with scar tissue that caused pain during sex and agony during childbirth. After her second child was born, Ms. Sillah, a pharmacist then living in Philadelphia, searched for medical help. Dr. Ivona Percec, a plastic surgeon at the University of Pennsylvania, said she thought an operation could ease the pain but might fail to uncover any remnant of the clitoris beneath the scarring. “There might not be anything left,” Dr. Percec cautioned. But she was willing to try. “It’s like digging for buried treasure. Everyone thinks it’s just the little triangle that protrudes. That’s just the tip of it.” More than 200 million women and girls alive today have undergone genital cutting in 30 countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, ranging from nicks to extreme damage. Yet despite the extraordinary need for appropriate medical care, there has been little rigorous research on how surgeons can relieve enduring physical harm or improve sexual sensation. “They come to us seeking solutions that will optimize their health — both physical and psychosexual,” said Dr. Nawal M. Nour, an obstetrician-gynecologist who directs the African Women’s Health Center at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. “Presently, we are failing them because we lack the research that can guarantee their best outcome.” With Ms. Sillah’s operation in 2016, Dr. Percec joined a small but growing number of doctors worldwide performing such surgeries. The procedure, often called clitoral reconstruction or restoration, is viewed with caution and skepticism by some medical experts. The World Health Organization says that while there are some promising reports that the operation may relieve pain, there is not yet enough evidence of safety and effectiveness. The organization advises against raising unrealistic expectations, especially for women seeking sexual improvement. Still, demand for such operations is growing in the United States and other Western nations as more women who have been genitally cut move to countries where medical techniques are advanced, insurance often covers surgery, and women can make decisions about their bodies. Over the past two years, four women — a health professional, a hairstylist, a bus driver and Ms. Sillah, the hospital pharmacist — shared intimate details of their experiences, and one allowed me to be in the operating room during her surgery. They described physical and emotional traumas, struggles with ruined relationships and feelings of shame that they were not “normal.” All were patients of Dr. Percec (pronounced per-check). She regularly performs plastic surgery for medical or cosmetic reasons, including labiaplasty to reshape the inner labia, but until Ms. Sillah contacted her, she had never tried clitoral reconstruction on women who were cut. Her most complex patient so far is a health professional from Sudan, where 87 percent of women have been cut. Like many Sudanese women, this patient underwent the most extreme form called infibulation: Clitoris, labia majora and minora are severed, labia are repositioned and the vagina is sewn mostly closed, requiring surgical opening for childbirth. Infibulation makes urination, menstruation and sex arduous, and increases risks of pregnancy complications. The 30-year-old patient, who asked to be identified only by her initials, S.A., because relatives in Sudan were unaware of her 2017 surgery, said she was infibulated at age 9. She was told that it was needed to reduce sexual sensation and prevent promiscuity, and that “when you become tight, your husband will love you more.” In her 20s, she married a Sudanese-American man she met via Facebook. Her husband, A.A., 37, said he was determined to be sensitive about her discomfort so she could “be enjoying her wedding night without being scared.” Still, she said, for a while, sex hurt. She never had an orgasm. After she joined him in Pennsylvania, he encouraged her search for clitoral reconstruction. “My God, that place is really sewn up; how’s the baby going to come out?” he wondered. Dr. Percec cut through S.A.’s stitching and scar tissue, removed a large uncomfortable cyst that resulted from the circumcision, widened the vaginal opening and surfaced the remaining clitoris. S.A. so appreciated her new anatomy that she frequently looked at it with a mirror. After weeks of recovery she felt more sensation, and intercourse became more comfortable. “It was so tight,” said S.A., who has since given birth without complications. “Now, relations are much better.” “Yes, yes, yes, 600 percent,” her husband agreed. “There is a lot of change, not only from her side, but from my side because she gained confidence in herself, and now she’s more natural.” For Ms. Sillah, the trauma of circumcision began at age 7, when she was blindfolded and cut, causing “the most excruciating pain.” She was told, “This is what makes you a woman.” As her wound healed, her labia fused together, leaving a narrow opening. After joining her mother in New Jersey at 16, she held off on dating, fearing men would be appalled. When she finally had sex, she said, “it was so painful.” Two grueling childbirths drove her to seek surgery. Dr. Percec counseled Ms. Sillah, now 36, to inform her husband, Mtijan Kamara, about the operation — an emotionally difficult request because Ms. Sillah had told him before they married that she had not been cut. Although he was also from Sierra Leone, he was raised to oppose cutting. She had worried he would think less of her. Nervously, she disclosed the truth. “You sure?” he replied, surprised because, unlike some women who have been cut, she experienced sexual pleasure. He comforted her, saying, “You’re fine, leave it as it is.” But because she feared pain with future pregnancies, he supported her choice. After she awoke from surgery, Dr. Percec announced remarkable news: “I found your clitoris!” Ms. Sillah said she felt complete as a woman for the first time. “Like wow — I actually have a clitoris sitting there,” said Ms. Sillah, who now lives in Maryland. “I always had an orgasm but, oh my gosh, it’s so much better.” Genital cutting, also called female genital mutilation, is a centuries-old practice that varies by culture. International efforts to end cutting have been somewhat successful, but it persists in many countries. It often involves severing a girl’s visible clitoris, while the rest, several centimeters or more, remains beneath the surface. One pioneer of surgery to counteract the effects of genital cutting is Dr. Pierre Foldès, a French urologist, who helped found a humanitarian organization, Doctors of the World. He realized that the uncut clitoris was sealed underneath scar tissue, often pushed back and up, adhering to the pubic bone. He devised a technique to unearth the clitoral remnant and shift it into position by detaching connective tissue called a suspensory ligament. He says he has operated on about 6,000 women, mostly in France, and trained about 200 surgeons, primarily in Africa. He led the largest, most comprehensive study of clitoral reconstruction, involving 2,938 women from 1998 to 2009, although the study had significant limitations, including that he assessed his own work. Surgeons have developed techniques to restore the clitoris after genital cutting.

Longer-range results were assessed in a one-year checkup, which less than a third of the patients attended. Most reported “improvement, or at least no worsening, in pain and clitoral pleasure.” Sexual satisfaction varied. About a third of women who had never had orgasms reported experiencing them to some degree. But a few who already had regular orgasms reported less sexual satisfaction. Dr. Foldès said results had since improved, with re-hospitalizations rare and more women reporting positive outcomes. New data has not yet been published. Dr. Marci L. Bowers, a pelvic and gynecologic surgeon in Burlingame, Calif., visited Dr. Foldès and uses a similar technique, which she says she has performed on over 500 patients. She said she was asked to learn clitoral restoration in 2007 by Clitoraid, an organization that helps provide the operation in various countries as part of a religion, the Raëlian Movement. The group’s website, which promotes fund-raising programs like Adopt a Clitoris, says one of the movement’s principles is that humans were created by aliens from another planet: “Our body is their masterpiece and the pleasure we feel from it has a purpose.” The World Health Organization classifies four broad types of female genital cutting or mutilation. Clitoral hood Clitoris Possible cutting Labia minora Cutting Labia majora TYPE I (Clitoridectomy) TYPE II (Excision) TYPE III (Infibulation) TYPE IV Clitoral hood Clitoris Possible cutting Labia minora Cutting Labia majora TYPE I (Clitoridectomy) TYPE II (Excision) TYPE III (Infibulation) TYPE IV By The New York Times | Sources: Abdulcadir et al., Obstetrics and Gynecology; Arizona State University; World Health Organization Dr. Bowers, a transgender woman who has long performed genital reassignment surgery, says that while she is Clitoraid’s lead surgeon, she is not Raëlian. She described the religion’s founder, Claude Vorilhon, called Raël, by saying, “If the Man from Glad and George Jetson had a love child, this is the guy.” “Their organization is controversial, but the goodness is there,” Dr. Bowers said about Clitoraid, which refers some patients to her California clinic, where she has a yearlong waiting list for clitoral restoration. Dr. Bowers said that initially she did not always fully detach the suspensory ligament, and “I had quite a number of patients where the clitoris just retracted.” Now, she said, complications are rare, besides a few infections. About a third have emerged from surgery with an intact clitoris “like a pea in a pod,” and pain has been eased for patients whose constricted vaginal openings were previously “tearing and retearing during sex,” she said. “We get anecdotal nice stories of people having their first orgasm,” Dr. Bowers said. But, she added, some patients said their sexual enjoyment did not improve, and others reported “a sensation, but not the sensation.” Some experts are much more cautious about recommending or performing clitoral reconstruction. Dr. Jasmine Abdulcadir, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Geneva University Hospitals in Switzerland, trained with Dr. Foldès, but said she had agreed to requests for clitoral surgery for only about 15 women. She is a co-author of a review of clitoral reconstruction studies that concluded more evidence of safety and efficacy was needed. “Why do women have to be considered incomplete or sexually deprived?” she said. “Maybe the woman already has orgasms. She doesn’t have pain, but she wants the surgery to feel more like a woman.” Unless women are in pain, Dr. Abdulcadir requires they wait three months and undergo counseling and psychosexual therapy. After that, she said, less than a fifth choose surgery. Dr. Nour, at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, also prefers counseling over surgery, noting that “sexuality is so complicated.” She has referred a few patients to Dr. Foldès, but worries about nerve damage from surgery and discomfort from a resurfaced clitoris. She said she would consider supporting surgery for women who undergo counseling, understand the safety and efficacy risks and strongly believe they need reconstruction to feel complete. “If data clearly demonstrates that clitoral reconstruction is the best method, I’d be the first person to tell everyone to do it,” she said. Marian Gbaya’s experience shows that there is still much to learn about surgical methods and patients’ desires. Ms. Gbaya, now 27, initially accepted what she was told as a girl in Sierra Leone: that if her clitoris was not severed, she might become sexually promiscuous and men would think “you’re walking around with the dirty stuff that needs to be cut.” But at 20, soon after joining her mother and sisters in Columbus, Ohio, she began seeing things differently. At a Job Corps program, she heard young women discussing sex, mentioning the clitoris. “How come you still have that?” Ms. Gbaya says she wondered, keeping quiet because she had been told in Sierra Leone that if she disclosed her cutting “you will die.” Men she dated, she said, reacted harshly to her anatomy: “Can’t deal with that. I’m gone.” Her solution was to avoid sex. But while studying cosmetology and training in weight lifting, she increasingly felt her body was not whole. “I do beauty, I’m trying to be a body builder,” she said. “I cannot do that if I’m walking around with an insecurity.” Describing a 2017 consultation with Ms. Gbaya, Dr. Percec said: “I remember her specifically saying, ‘I don’t care if I lose pleasure. I just want to look normal.’” Ms. Gbaya’s clitoris and labia minora, the thin rim around the vagina, had been partly cut off. The sulcus, between the clitoris and labia majora, was gone, Dr. Percec said. Dr. Percec, director of basic science research in plastic surgery at Penn Medicine, has developed her own surgical approach, reusing scar tissue whenever possible, she said. Unlike Dr. Foldès, she does not cut the suspensory ligament, believing that her method better protects nerves and blood vessels. Yet she is also learning on the job. For example, until she can find a psychologist to help ease women’s post-surgical adjustment, she has started requiring patients to read books about intimacy and sex. With each of her 11 patients — from Delaware, Maryland, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania by way of Mali, Niger, Sierra Leone and Sudan, — Dr. Percec has adjusted her method. When her first patient, Ms. Sillah, remained in pain two weeks post-surgery, Dr. Percec began prescribing women an ointment with lidocaine. When another patient struggled with a dressing, Dr. Percec began sewing on gauze with dissolving stitches. Two patients needed additional surgery, one because her clitoris partially adhered again, possibly because her work uniform included snug pants, Dr. Percec said. Later, Dr. Percec began grafting fat into the labia, theorizing it would aid healing and add fullness to depleted tissue. She typically takes fat cells from patients’ bellies, but Ms. Gbaya’s muscled body had so little fat that it was taken from the thigh. Initially, Ms. Gbaya was enthusiastic about the results. She soon returned to the gym and experienced new feelings, she said, as if the clitoris were saying,“Hey, I’m here.” She began a new romance, and said that during sex “I do notice the sensation.” But eventually, she said, scar tissue formed back over the clitoris. She recently visited Dr. T. Wayne Bloodworth, a cosmetic and gynecologic surgeon who last year opened a nonprofit center in Johns Creek, Ga., that provides free clitoral reconstruction. Dr. Bloodworth, who trained with Dr. Foldès, said he excised Ms. Gbaya’s re-accumulated scar tissue, cut the suspensory ligament and anchored the clitoris using tiny stitches, steps he considers necessary to keep it from retracting. Ms. Gbaya says she is now “doing great.” Dr. Percec, whose hospital prevents her from waiving surgery fees, said she understood why Ms. Gbaya, who is uninsured, would go elsewhere. Had Ms. Gbaya returned for follow-up care, Dr. Percec said she might have prevented scar tissue buildup with a technique she incorporated in 2018: taking skin from inside the cheek and grafting it over the clitoris. “When you leave it uncovered like I was doing initially, letting it heal on its own, that raw surface can adhere to itself, forming scar tissue,” she said. “With any operation that we design, it’s going to be a work in progress, and it’s going to get better.” Before her surgery last year, Aminata Welcome, 33, who immigrated from Niger, talked with her preteen daughter, showing her drawings from a medical website. “I explained to her, ‘This is what a woman’s private part looks like versus someone who went through cutting, mutilation,” Ms. Welcome recalled. “‘As a baby, this happened to me. I’m missing this part. Yours is like this; Mommy’s looks like that.’” Ms. Welcome, a Philadelphia bus driver who regularly works nights, assured her that “medicine has come up with solutions, and I am getting fixed.” “Are you going to be O.K.?” her daughter asked. “Yes,” Ms. Welcome replied, “Mommy’s going to be O.K.” The morning of her operation, dressed in a black-and-gold abaya, she swept the air with orange-polished fingernails as she described how American men she dated after her divorce dumped her when they learned she had been cut. “I’ve been rejected three times because of it,” she said. One boyfriend asked if she was transgender. Another told her that “he likes to play with the clitoris, so if I don’t have one, he doesn’t know what he can do with me.” Heading to the surgery center, Ms. Welcome said, “I’m realistic that it’s never going to be like it never was cut away from me.” She shielded her eyes, praying silently. “This surgery is going to make me feel more like a woman.” In Operating Room 1, after Ms. Welcome’s anesthesia took effect, Dr. David Colen, the chief plastic surgery resident, scraped tissue from inside her cheek. “Cheek skin cells are closest to the skin cells over the clitoris,” Dr. Percec explained. She removed fat from Ms. Welcome’s abdomen with a syringe. Pressing the scar tissue, she said, “I can feel the clitoral remnant.” She sliced carefully. “There are 8,000 sensory nerves on the tip of the clitoris, as opposed to the tip of the penis, which has about 4,000,” she said. “But who’s counting?” Dr. Colen replied. An hour later, Dr. Percec unearthed about three centimeters of the clitoris. No labia minora remained. Dr. Percec stitched skin “to recreate the rim that was lost,” she said. The doctors placed the cheek-cell skin graft over the surgical opening and injected fat around it. After two hours in recovery, Ms. Welcome was discharged.

In a recent tweet meant to encourage people to pre-order her first novel, “Mostly Dead Things” (Tin House, June 4), she called the book her “gay Florida taxidermy baby.” The novel is narrated by Jessa-Lynn Morton, a Floridian fighting to keep her family’s taxidermy business afloat after the suicide of her father. Arnett’s first book, “Felt in the Jaw,” was a collection of short stories, and her novel has its origins in a story idea. “I had never thought of taxidermy as being funny, but looking at a lot of bad taxidermy was hilarious to me,” she said. “What if a brother and sister tried to taxidermy a goat for a friend? How hilarious would it be to have the goat just be totally ridiculous-looking?” That story stalled out, but Arnett said she had a hard time moving past the general idea, eventually creating new characters and embarking on the novel. Arnett has spent her career working in libraries, a vocation she has written about with great affection. Her enthusiasm for research came in handy while writing “Mostly Dead Things,” during which she watched “a million” YouTube videos about the craft at the story’s center. “All my browser windows other than Twitter were just really weird taxidermy websites,” she said. “People probably thought I was a serial killer.” The graphic nature of the fact-finding was a joy for Arnett, who described her fondness for things that are “very gross and visceral and tactile and about the body.” But the book is not all stitched-up pelts. Arnett is interested in writing about “how queerness functions inside a household,” and Jessa-Lynn’s efforts to understand her family, and her own emotional and sexual life, are the novel’s primary concerns — and they work in concert with the family business. “I was thinking a lot about how we try to preserve memories, and about specific nostalgia — wanting things to remain pristine,” Arnett said. “What is taxidermy other than that? Much of the time, a taxidermied animal is an animal someone hunted and killed, and the way they decide to pose them is a memory they’re creating. I think we do that with other people — family, romantic partners. We reconstruct.” — John Williams ‘a particular kind of black man’ When Tope Folarin, who was born in Utah to Nigerian parents, won the Caine Prize for African Writing in 2013, there was some controversy over whether he qualified as an African writer. It was a familiar quandary. His debut novel, “A Particular Kind of Black Man” (Simon & Schuster, Aug. 6), explores questions about belonging that he says have long been part of his life. The novel tells the story of Tunde Akinola, a Nigerian-American growing up in Utah, though he doesn’t stay there. Over the course of the novel, he moves from place to place, including Texas, Morehouse College in Atlanta and eventually Lagos, searching for connection and a sense of himself. “The book contains a number of realities,” Folarin said. “It’s a coming-of-age book. I think it’s also, in its own way, an immigrant story. But in the end it’s a book that’s obsessed with identity and identity construction — how we come to be as human beings.” Tunde’s life at times mirrors Folarin’s — part of the author’s childhood was spent in Texas, he studied at Morehouse and, aside from an early-childhood visit to Nigeria that he doesn’t remember, he didn’t see the country with his own eyes until he won the Caine Prize. But the book contains both “explicitly autobiographical” and wholly fictional material, he said, an advantage of the novel form, which, as he puts it, is “capacious enough to hold the real and unreal.” Folarin is a Rhodes Scholar who earned master’s degrees in comparative social policy and African studies. After Oxford, he worked in public policy and communications at Google’s London office before deciding to “give myself a shot as a writer.” He now lives in Washington, D.C., where he is a vice president at the nonprofit organization Local Initiatives Support Corporation and board chairman of the Institute for Policy Studies, a think tank. He is already at work on a second novel. Ultimately, Folarin said, Tunde’s struggle is about deciding who he wants to be — a successful black man who doesn’t threaten the status quo, or someone else? — and the structure of the book, with a conventional memoir-like beginning that shifts a few chapters in, parallels the protagonist’s journey. “I think in a weird way,” Folarin said, “the novel becomes aware of itself in the way I became aware of myself.” — Andrew LaVallee ‘Searching for Sylvie Lee’ In 2009, one of Jean Kwok’s brothers disappeared. A few days before Thanksgiving, her parents called her in the Netherlands, where she lives with her husband, to tell her they hadn’t heard from him in days. When he didn’t show up for the holiday, they feared the worst. “He would never, ever do that without telling us unless something had really gone wrong,” Kwok said. She jumped into investigation mode, talking to her brother’s friends and breaking into his email to look for clues. She learned he had bought a plane and taken off from Texas en route to West Virginia, where her parents now live, but had never landed. Eventually a search-and-rescue team found his body along with the plane’s wreckage in the woods of West Virginia. That experience provides the emotional backbone of her new book, “Searching for Sylvie Lee” (William Morrow, June 4). In the novel, Sylvie, the oldest child in a family of Chinese immigrants, goes missing. Sylvie is the family’s golden child; her younger sister, Amy, has always lived in her shadow. When Sylvie vanishes, Amy must help find her. “It’s very much a story about immigration and culture, and not truly knowing the people we love the most, and not being able to know them,” Kwok said. In many immigrant families, Kwok said, “the newer, younger generations don’t actually speak the same language as the parents, and so you end up with this tragic situation, where within the family you can’t fully communicate with each other.” To illustrate this point, she alternates between the two sisters and their mother’s perspectives, showing how their inner lives are obscured to one another by the language barriers that separate them. Amy’s dominant language is English; for Sylvie, it’s Dutch (she was partly raised in the Netherlands by her grandparents); and for their mother, Ma, it’s Chinese. Amy views Ma, at times, as a beloved but meek woman, but Ma’s inner dialogue presents a completely different person, one who is “rich, thoughtful, full, intelligent,” Kwok said. Most of Kwok’s family — she is the youngest of seven — emigrated to the United States when she was 5 years old. They lived in a roach-infested apartment in Brooklyn, and Kwok worked at a clothing factory from a young age, along with the rest of her family members. Her life changed when she was accepted to a prestigious New York City high school, and she later went on to study at Harvard and Columbia. Kwok credits her deceased brother with helping her break out of the family’s cycle of poverty. Once, after a long day of school and work, he came home with a gift. It was a diary, and he told her, “Whatever you write in this will belong to you,” she said. It inspired her to start writing. Despite her success, the educational spaces she reached did not always feel like home. “I do feel like, as an immigrant, you have to divide yourself into pieces,” she said. “Each world can only see a certain part of you.” Her book explores the mirage of the American Dream. Sylvie seems to have made it in every sense of the word, but Kwok’s story asks: What is the price of realizing this dream? And who must pay it? — Concepción de León ‘In West Mills’ De’Shawn Charles Winslow grew up in Elizabeth City, N.C., a small town that he left soon after graduating from high school. He only “started to think about home a little more,” he said, in 2008, as he approached 30. That’s also when he began writing, inspired by the “pretty unexpected” death of his father. Realizing he didn’t know much about the man, Winslow began studying the family’s history in order to write a work of nonfiction, but that study didn’t lead far. “There was no way for me to get the answers I needed, so fiction was the only way to go,” he said. Frustrated by the lack of discovery about his father’s life, Winslow turned his imaginative attention toward a woman he had known briefly when he was a child — his great-uncle’s girlfriend, whose nickname was Knot. She was an alcoholic, and died when Winslow was 10. “My mother left me with her for a couple of hours, probably when I was 8,” Winslow said. “Most people wouldn’t have left their child with Knot. But my mom knew her and trusted her. I’ll never forget that day. I remember her doting on me a bit. That’s probably what fascinated me — this other side of her that wasn’t about alcohol but about fixing me a sandwich.” Winslow, who now lives in East Harlem, attended the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, where he worked on what has become his debut novel, “In West Mills” (Bloomsbury, June 4). In the book, which spans the 1940s to the 1980s, a woman in North Carolina named Azalea “Knot” Centre battles alcoholism, various estrangements and her fraught romantic relationships with men. One platonic friend, a married man named Otis Lee Loving, stands by her throughout her hard times. Winslow didn’t do much research to recreate the book’s mid-century atmosphere, relying instead on his recollection of spending time with people like his grandmother. “I grew up in the households of 75-year-old women,” he said. “The dialect in the book comes from my memory of how they spoke.” Given his brief and early exposure to the real Knot, Winslow said the character in the novel quickly bloomed into someone else entirely. “The Knot in the book is a person I don’t know,” he said. But he wanted to do right by her. “I set out to show that a person with a big problem can also be much wiser than those of us that have less noticeable problems.” — John Williams",The New York Times
2019,"4 Years of College, $0 in Debt: How Some Countries Make Higher Education Affordable","When we asked people around the world what sort of financial burden they bore for their higher education, we heard how much it varies from country to country. Morehouse College’s 2019 graduates don’t have to worry about crushing student debt, since the billionaire investor Robert F. Smith pledged last week to pay it all off. Neither do graduates of colleges in countries that offer affordable tuition and generous stipends. As young adults wrestle with student debt in the United States, where it has reached $1.5 trillion, many recent graduates in some countries are debt free. When we asked people around the world what they paid for their higher education and how they financed it, we received nearly 800 responses from more than 40 countries. Below is a selection of the responses, which show how government policies can shape the personal and professional choices that young adults make as they begin their careers. The responses have been edited and condensed. If you attended college, how did you pay for it? Please tell us in the comments section. Denmark is among the countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that spend the most on postsecondary education, at 1.6 percent of its gross domestic product. (The United States allocates 0.9 percent of its G.D.P.) I attended the Technical University of Denmark from 2008 to 2013. All university is paid for by taxes. Books are maybe $500 per semester — lower than when I studied in the United States, but still a big expense. Students who don’t live with their parents get a monthly stipend from the government of about $900 for living costs. Some people get more (if you have a child, for example). If you become pregnant during university, you get a year of parental leave, and you continue receiving the stipend. The stipend goes for up to six years (one year more than a typical bachelor’s and master’s degree). You can work part time up to a certain limit and still keep the stipend, but if you work too much and earn too much money, you have to pay back the stipend. When we study abroad, we get to bring the tuition with us, and we apply for scholarships to pay other expenses like visas and plane tickets. I studied in Oregon for six months in 2011 and didn’t spend any of my own money. Starting out with no debt is a huge relief. We can start saving right away for other life choices. — Sofie Geertsen. Tuition: $0. Loans: $0. An increased emphasis on higher education attainment has led to 45 percent of Taiwan’s population aged 15 and older earning a technical college or university degree, a 10 percent increase over the last decade, according to the Taiwanese government. I graduated from National Taiwan University in 2012 with two majors. My tuition was about $375 per semester. The amount was just a fraction of my parents’ monthly salary, so they helped pay. Because I didn’t go into debt for college (who should, anyway?), I didn’t feel pressure to get a job immediately or feel the need for a high-paying one. Salary wasn’t my concern; I could do whatever I wanted for my career. — Hung-Yu Juan. Undergraduate tuition: $3,000. Loans: $0. Government grants help undergraduate students pay for living costs and education fees in Ireland. Some students have protested the contribution fees of 3,000 euros ($3,360) a year, calling for a publicly funded education system like those elsewhere in Europe. The government subsidizes undergraduate college education for European Union citizens, so technically my college degree was free. However, you’re required to pay a student contribution to your university, which works out to €3,000 annually, so I paid €12,000 for my degree. I was extremely fortunate that my parents had put aside college money since I was born, so they covered my tuition, from 2015 to 2019. They also paid for my rent and groceries. I worked throughout my degree to supplement additional costs. Because the cost of living in Dublin is super high, I was lucky to live in an accommodation that was pretty cheap, albeit gross. Because my parents paid for my degree, its cost did not affect my day-to-day life, but I definitely lived frugally. — Grace Browne. Undergraduate tuition: €12,000. Loans: $0. The Labour Party, led by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, initiated a policy in 2018 that eliminates fees for postsecondary students’ first year. The policy is scheduled to extend to three years by 2024. I’m in my third year of a six-year undergraduate medical degree at the University of Otago in Dunedin. My first year cost 7,000 New Zealand dollars ($4,600) and subsequent years cost 15,000 N.Z.D. Our government offers loans to all citizens, and residents who have been here more than three years. These loans cover full tuition (and they subsidize the rest of our fees, which, for medicine, are upward of 75,000 N.Z.D. a year). Students are also eligible for an additional loan or an allowance for living costs. After graduation you pay 12 percent on what you earn above 19,760 N.Z.D. (for me, on a base junior doctor’s salary of 56,000 N.Z.D. a year, I would repay about 4,500 N.Z.D. a year). As a student doing one of the longest, most expensive degrees and living away from home, my loan will be about 140,000 N.Z.D. when I graduate. However, our government administers our loans, and we don’t get charged interest (unless you leave the country for more than a year), so I have never felt like I’m being crushed by it. — Hannah Lochore. Undergraduate tuition: 82,000 N.Z.D. Loans: 140,000 N.Z.D. In Brazil, postsecondary education attainment increased to 17 percent of young adults in 2015 from 10 percent in 2010, according to the O.E.C.D. This is still one of the lowest rates among O.E.C.D. countries. Access to free public universities is extremely competitive, and the demand far exceeds the number of available spots. I graduated in 2013, and my college education cost about 100,000 Brazilian real ($25,000) for a full-time degree in economics. I studied at a private college through a scholarship program funded by the federal government called Prouni (basically meaning “university for all” in Portuguese). This program was developed to help students from poor families have access to university; once selected, you have to prove that your family’s income fits the criteria. The students are selected through a national exam that we take after high school. Even though there was no tuition, I had to move from the countryside to a city and support myself there. I attended a very expensive college, so I also had to deal with social differences because most of the students were from upper-middle-class households. — Bruno Henrique Ferreira Paulino. Undergraduate tuition: 100,000 Brazilian real. Loans: $0. In 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte signed the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act, which provides free tuition to state and local universities and colleges, as well as state-run vocational schools. I studied at the University of the Philippines Los Baños, a top institution in my country. For my first years, 2014 to 2016, the fees were based on my family’s socioeconomic status. The base fees were about $600 per semester. We were middle class and got a discount of 60 percent, so we paid about $240. After 2017, because my university is a public one, I enjoyed the benefits of tuition exemption. The costs affected my career a little. My practicum, the last requirement for my degree in nutrition, was the most expensive, about $1,400. My parents had a hard time attaining this. I will take the exam to be a nutritionist and dietitian in August. — Kiolo L. Belsonda. Undergraduate tuition: $1,440. Loans: $0. The Student Awards Agency Scotland, a government entity, covers the full fees of eligible Scottish and E.U. nationals who apply; the payments are sent directly to the college or university. To qualify, students must have chosen a course that is funded by the agency and meet certain residency criteria. The Scottish government also sets the tuition rate for these students. For the 2019-20 academic year, tuition is as high as 1,820 British pounds ($2,300), depending on the program. I’m a European citizen, so my undergraduate tuition at the University of St. Andrews, from 2012 to 2016, was paid by the Scottish government. My parents paid for my accommodation during those years, and I worked part time to fund all other expenses. Now, my integrated master’s and doctoral degree is funded through the United Kingdom-based Economic and Social Research Council, Scottish Graduate School of Social Science. This covers tuition and a stipend of about £1,200 a month, which I supplement with part-time teaching and research assistant work at the university, as well as a part-time job in a cafe. Because university was essentially free for me, I had a lot more freedom to pursue my interests, including further education and academic work. — Olga Loza. Undergraduate tuition: £7,280. Loans: $0. The share of Turkey’s population aged 25 and older that had earned a bachelor’s degree or the equivalent increased to 14.8 percent in 2016 from 7.3 percent in 2004, according to the Unesco Institute for Statistics. (In the United States, one-third of adults in 2015 had a bachelor’s degree or more education, according to the United States Census Bureau.) I attended Bilkent University in Ankara from 2006 to 2012 and didn’t pay for my undergraduate legal education. This was possible due to Turkey’s university entrance exam system. By ranking among the top 100 of more than 1.5 million exam takers, I attended a private university for free. Both state and private institutions are among the best-ranking universities in Turkey. State universities are usually free or have minimal tuition. To compete with state universities, private institutions offer tuition-free quotas. The government offers stipends to help cover living expenses. Based on the recipient’s income level, these monthly payments are either loans or grants. Exam takers who rank in the top 100 in different score categories receive three times this monthly amount regardless of their income level. This was how I covered my living expenses without burdening my parents. Going into law without any cost gave me the opportunity to attain higher middle-class income levels despite my parents’ low- to middle-class income level. — Mustafa Cetin. Undergraduate tuition: 225,000 Turkish lira ($37,000). Loans: $0. For the 2017-18 academic year, the average cost of undergraduate tuition for Canadian full-time students was about 6,500 Canadian dollars ($4,800), according to Statistics Canada, a government agency. In 2010, the most recent year with available data, half of all students who earned a bachelor’s graduated with debt; the average was 26,300 Canadian dollars. (In 2018, people in the United States with outstanding education debt typically owed between $20,000 and $25,000.) The cost of my bachelor’s degree from McGill University was about 6,000 Canadian dollars per year for four years, plus books, student fees and living expenses. In total, it was about 50,000 Canadian dollars for all four years. My parents and I had saved up for the cost of all school expenses. I worked during the summers to be able to pay for living expenses, and my parents helped me where they could so that I could focus on my studies without taking a part-time job during the school year. Because of the reasonable cost of the education, my parents’ forward-thinking approach and my decisions to work during the summer, I did not experience any financial hardships and I graduated without student debt. Graduating debt free allowed me freedom of opportunity and choice to find my own path and try out different jobs, including working abroad. I was also able to find the right fit and industry, and to walk away from companies and bosses who treat employees unfairly. — Casey Reynolds. Undergraduate tuition: 24,000 Canadian dollars.

2019,5 Cheap(ish) Things to Make the Perfect Pie,"The more comfortable you can get with the tools you own, the more you can spend time perfecting flavor rather than worrying about technique. About six weeks ago, a friend of mine convinced me to enter a local pie contest. I cannonballed into the challenge and discovered that my years acquiring better kitchen tools have really paid off. By the time the contest rolled round, I had made 12 of my salted cashew caramel apple pies, each time tweaking a few variables — ingredients, temperature, time — to perfect my recipe. The one constant were the tools I used. Making a great pie doesn’t take a lot of fancy equipment, but it does take some practice. The more comfortable you can get with the tools you own, the more you can spend time perfecting flavor rather than worrying about technique. If you’re a pie noob, Melissa Clark’s guide to making pie crust is a great place to start. She offers some genius tips, like her suggestion of using uncooked rice or dried beans (laid on a sheet of protective parchment paper or foil) as pie weights while blind-baking a bottom crust. I’ve added that to my piemaking tool kit alongside five other cheap (ish) things for upping my pie prowess. This collection was made in collaboration with Wirecutter, a New York Times Company that reviews and recommends products. Pie pan I own five pie pans for different kinds of pies. I use glass for shallow pies at low heat, and metal for blind-baked crusts that need to get extra brown. But my ceramic plate splits the difference: These tend to be deep dish and versatile enough for both high-heat fruit pies and slow-bake custard pies. Wirecutter recommends the Emile Henry 9-inch pie dish, which comes in classic oven-to-table colors, with a fluted lip for pretty edges. Grater If you don’t have a food processor, which I didn’t own for years, my favorite way to get butter into the right size chunks is by grating frozen sticks with a cheese grater, a method I first discovered through Cook’s Illustrated. This also works really well with vegan fats like Earth Balance and shortening, which can go soft faster than butter. Wirecutter recommends the Cuisipro Surface Glide, which has sharp, etched teeth for shredding rock solid butter well before it has a chance to melt. Bench scraper The trick to a flaky pie crust is to keep the flattened butter intact so you get layers instead of a crumbly crackerlike crust. This cheap tool is a kitchen workhorse that can help you lift a pie crust that’s sticking to your counter without warming it with your hands. Wirecutter recommends the OXO Good Grips Stainless Steel Multi-Purpose Scraper & Chopper, which is a generous six inches wide. Rolling pin Using a wide, heavy pin with a long, flat middle and no handles is a revelation, because crust rolls out more evenly and more quickly — crucial when you’re trying to work the dough as little as possible. Wirecutter recommends a Whetstone Woodenware pin handmade from hard maple in Indiana. It’s a little unwieldy and tricky to store because it’s so big, but once you get used to it, other pins feel like toys by comparison. Scale A digital scale will absolutely change how consistently good your pie is, not to mention your coffee, cakes or anything you put in the oven. With pies, whether a heavy-handed cup of flour or a too-fluffy cup of flour is used makes all the difference between a tough crust and a greasy dough. (Though you’ll still want to use a measuring spoon for the smaller amounts for ingredients like salt and spices.) Wirecutter recommends the incredibly affordable Escali Primo Digital Scale, which reads quickly in increments of one gram or 0.05 ounces.

New Yorkers might know Palamides as the voice of Buttercup on the Cartoon Network’s “Powerpuff Girls,” but they have never had the chance to see her comedic chops in person before now. Under the direction of Dr. Brown, Palamides won the best newcomer prize at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe for her 2017 show, “LAID,” a surreal, silly piece about ova and the dilemmas of motherhood. She followed that up last year with “NATE,” which allowed her to inhabit and explore toxic masculinity. Find out why Time Out Los Angeles named her a comedian to watch in 2019 as she stages each of these works over the next two weeks in their New York City debuts, with “LAID” showing at the Bell House from Tuesday to Thursday and “NATE” on June 11, 12 and 14. 718-643-6510, thebellhouseny.com WELLRED COMEDY TOUR at Carolines on Broadway (May 30, 7:30 p.m.; May 31-June 1, 7:30 and 10 p.m.).

This retrospective showcases a wide range of African-American filmmakers who made enduring work in the 1990s, whether it was Julie Dash with the ethereal period piece “Daughters of the Dust” (on Saturday), Kasi Lemmons with the child’s-eye Southern-gothic melodrama “Eve’s Bayou” (on Sunday, with Lemmons in person, and on Tuesday) or F. Gary Gray with the raucous comedy “Friday” (on May 10). The decade also saw the emergence of John Singleton, who died on Monday. His debut feature, “Boyz N the Hood” (on May 12 and 13) — which made him the youngest and first African-American nominee for a directing Oscar — will screen, followed by “Poetic Justice” (on May 15).718-636-4100, bam.org ABEL FERRARA UNRATED at the Museum of Modern Art (through May 31). Gritty New York movies don’t get grittier than Ferrara’s: His films teem with seedy cops and introspective criminals, and his sense of detail makes most other directors who worked in the city in the 1980s and ’90s look like tourists. MoMA’s career-spanning retrospective, which makes room for TV and documentary work and several rarely screened dramatic features, reveals his obsessive interest in guilt and culpability, which runs from his early exploitation effort “Ms. 45” (on Tuesday and May 11) through his career-defining “Bad Lieutenant” (on May 17 and 21) to “Welcome to New York,” his uncompromising film à clef about the Dominique Strauss-Kahn affair, which will play in its original 2014 premiere cut on Friday and May 18. On Saturday, Ferrara, who will appear at several screenings, will be present for a post-movie discussion of “King of New York” (also showing on May 28) with the filmmakers Josh and Benny Safdie — perhaps his closest contemporary heirs when it comes to using the city as a seamy backdrop.212-708-9400, moma.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] HANNAH FRANK’S ‘FRAME BY FRAME’ at Light Industry (May 7, 7 p.m.).

2019,5 Home Runs Aren’t Enough for the Mets Against the Tigers,"JaCoby Jones homered and drove in four runs, including a go-ahead double in the seventh inning, and Miguel Cabrera also connected as the visiting Detroit Tigers halted their nine-game losing streak on Friday night with a wild 9-8 victory over the Mets. In a back-and-forth slugfest between two teams swept by lowly Miami within the past week, Detroit blew an early 4-0 lead and later rallied three times from 1-run deficits. The Mets hit five home runs on a windy night at Citi Field, including a tiebreaking shot by the pinch-hitter Aaron Altherr against the winning pitcher, Buck Farmer (3-3), in his first plate appearance with the Mets. Amed Rosario, Adeiny Hechavarria, Pete Alonso and Wilson Ramos also went deep for the Mets. Cabrera reached base safely four times, delivered a sacrifice fly and went the other way for his 467th home run and second this season. Cabrera, a two-time M.V.P., had gone 81 at-bats without a long ball, since April 26, before connecting off an ineffective Noah Syndergaard to tie it at 5-5 in the fifth. Detroit got four hits from the No. 9 spot in the lineup, including a run-scoring single by the pinch-hitter Brandon Dixon in the seventh that made it 9-7. More stunning were two singles off Syndergaard (on pitches faster than 95 miles an hour) by Tigers starting pitcher Gregory Soto, who had never batted in the minors or majors before Friday night. Dixon’s hit followed Jones’s two-run double with two outs off Drew Gagnon (3-1). Jones also hit a two-run homer in the second against Syndergaard, who gave up six runs and 10 hits in five and a third innings. It was the most earned runs he allowed since he gave up seven in four innings at San Diego in June 2015. He has served up 10 homers in 69⅓ innings this season after permitting only nine in 154⅓ innings last year. Shane Greene got three quick outs for his 16th save in 17 chances, bouncing back nicely after giving up a go-ahead grand slam in the ninth inning of a 5-2 loss to the Marlins on Thursday that capped Detroit’s 0-9 homestand. That stretch also included a suspended game against Oakland that the Tigers are losing in the late innings. It will resume in September. The Mets were coming off a four-game sweep at home against Washington, a division rival.",The New York Times
2019,5 People Who Can Help You Love Your Body,"Learning to love your body — whatever shape or size you may be — is easier said than done, but these people are out to teach all of us that there’s no time like the present to fall in love with who you see in the mirror. Megan CrabbeCreditCreditTori Ferenc for The New York Times If you’ve ever been on a diet, you probably told yourself that as soon as you lost those pounds, you’d love your body. Maybe you did actually achieve that goal weight, or maybe you didn’t. But chances are, you didn’t end up with a long-lasting love for the way you look. Whether it’s weight loss or some other element of your appearance, you shouldn’t wait for some magical change to start loving your body. Loving your body as it is, regardless of your exercise routine or diet is one of those rare “life hacks” that doesn’t have a downside. But after a lifetime of wanting to be different, suddenly falling in love with what you see in the mirror isn’t so simple. So how do we learn to love our bodies, and who can teach us? Here are five people who have been down this road, learned to love their own bodies, and most importantly, are on a mission to help others learn to love themselves, too. If you’ve told yourself that you were too big/weak/out-of-shape/old to be an athlete, Mirna Valerio can change your mind. She’s an “ultramarathoner,” or someone who runs races longer than the traditional marathon race of 42 kilometers (or 26 miles.) She’s also the blogger behind Fat Girl Running and the author of “A Beautiful Work in Progress.” A health scare in 2008 inspired Ms. Valerio to pick running back up and she hasn’t stopped since. Running hasn’t transformed her physique, or turned her into a slender reed, but it doesn’t have to, and that’s the point. Her belief is that no matter what size your body is, it’s meant to move, and you shouldn’t feel as if you can’t do an activity or sport just because of how you look. “When people ask me how they can move their bodies more, I tell them to just start with a walk around the block,” she said, “and to notice how their feet feel, how their legs feel, how things look and smell. Movement is about so much more than losing weight.” Megan Jayne Crabbe was first introduced to the concept of loving her body at 21, seven years after an anorexia diagnosis. Even after being hospitalized and starting the road to recovery, Ms. Crabbe had hated how she looked. Then she stumbled across an Instagram post about body positivity. “The whole world opened up for me,” she said. “I didn’t want to spend the rest of my life hungry and hating my body and, until that moment, I didn’t think I had a choice.” Ms. Crabbe decided to start her own Instagram account to document her journey of healing. Four years and a million followers later, she has become one of most popular voices of the body positivity movement, sharing a mixture of personal stories, empowerment messages and occasional videos of her dancing around in her underwear. Ms. Crabbe also often encourages her readers to question why they don’t like their bodies. “When you think about the first time you thought your body was wrong,” she explained, “most likely you were a young child and the idea that some bodies are good and some are bad was told to you.” Her book, aptly called, “Body Positive Power: Because Life is Already Happening and You Don’t Need Flat Abs to Live It,” was published in September and tackles these topics. Zach Miko was an actor in New York City — and a lifelong dieter — when his agent sent him on a photo shoot for a modeling gig. The gig turned out to be for Target, which was looking for a plus-size male model to be the first they’d ever featured on their website. The incredible positive response to the campaign helped Zach become the first plus-size male model to be signed to a major modeling agency. These days, Mr. Miko is using his Instagram account and his podcast, Big Things with Zach Miko, to promote a lifestyle of self-love and self-worth. “I get an outpouring of love and support from guys who say that they feel a little bit better after seeing me in magazines,” he said. “It makes me wonder what my childhood would have been like if I had seen a person of size being represented as beautiful and desirable.” In response to the hundreds of messages he gets from men who ask how they can be more confident in their bodies, Mr. Miko tells them to stop apologizing for their bodies or making jokes at their own expense. “Take yourself seriously,” he said. “Post a photo of yourself doing something you love, or having a great time, and resist the urge to beat people to the joke. Who you are is not a joke.” Mama Cax, whose real name is Cacsmy Brutus, started her journey to loving her body at 17 years old, when a diagnosis of bone and lung cancer meant she had to have her right leg amputated. “Once I had my surgery, I felt like I would never be able to love my body,” she said. After struggling with depression and the mental exhaustion that came with constantly trying hide her prosthetic, she turned to social media to express herself. “I didn’t see body appreciation being shown to people with disabilities or people with scars, so I started sharing my story on Instagram. I was sharing for women who don’t see themselves as beautiful and don’t see their bodies celebrated.” Now, she is trying to raise the visibility of disabled bodies through her work as a model. Ms. Cax has walked in a fashion show at the White House, been selected as a face of Tommy Hilfiger, and most recently made her debut walking the runway at New York Fashion Week. She also shares her personal experiences on her blog. Ms. Cax tells her followers to be very intentional about who they follow on Instagram and other social media. “It’s very different to follow somebody who you want to look like — no matter how unrealistic that is — than to follow somebody who inspires you and makes you feel better about yourself.” Jes Baker delighted the internet in 2013 when she recreated an Abercrombie & Fitch photo shoot after quotes from 2006 made by the company’s then-CEO Mike Jeffries resurfaced addressing why they didn’t sell extra-large or above clothing. “Candidly, we go after the cool kids,” Mr. Jeffries said. “We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don’t belong, and they can’t belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely.” Outraged, Ms. Baker created “Attractive & Fat,” a series of photos featuring Ms. Baker in an Abercrombie and Fitch shirt, posing with a male model who gazes at her adoringly. The series got attention for highlighting how rarely popular media shows a large woman being desired by a thin man. “I decided the best way to approach purposeful exclusion was to create my own ads,” Ms. Baker said. “Images that looked like Abercrombie & Fitch’s but highlighted a plus-sized body instead. The world loved them and hated them; which is the best outcome I could have asked for. Those who have desperately wanted to see a larger body in mainstream situations were ecstatic and those who were disgusted by the faux campaign were forced to look at their bias.” Ms. Baker is the author of two books, “Things No One Will Tell Fat Girls,” and “Landwhale,” and writes about self-love and mental health. “People don’t realize that their obsession with physical health and beauty norms is taking a toll on their mental health,” she said. “What is it costing them to hate their body? Anxiety? Depression? How much happier would they be if they weren’t so focused on how they look? Not to mention the fact that our mental health directly impacts our physical health.",The New York Times
2019,5 Takeaways From 10 Years of Trump Tax Figures,"Since the 2016 presidential campaign, journalists at The New York Times and elsewhere have been trying to piece together Donald J. Trump’s complex and concealed finances. Now The Times has obtained 10 years of previously unrevealed figures from the president’s federal income tax returns. The tax numbers, for the years 1985 through 1994, paint a far bleaker picture of Mr. Trump’s deal-making abilities and financial condition than the one he has long put forth. [Read The Times’s investigation here.] Mr. Trump became an unprecedented president — a businessman and reality television star with no government experience — and he broke with decades-old presidential tradition by refusing to release his income tax returns. Questions about what secrets they may hold — about his recent business dealings and the sources of his financing — only intensified with the Russia inquiry, and the Trump administration is now locked in a battle with House Democrats demanding the last six years of the president’s returns. On Monday, the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said he would not give a House committee access to the returns. The newly revealed tax information covers an earlier period of Mr. Trump’s business career. And The Times did not obtain Mr. Trump’s actual tax returns. But it obtained printouts from his official Internal Revenue Service tax transcripts, with the figures from his federal tax form, the 1040, from someone who had legal access to them. They represent the fullest and most detailed look to date at the president’s taxes. And they show that during a tumultuous decade of fevered acquisition and spectacular collapse, Mr. Trump’s core businesses — largely casinos, hotels and retail space in apartment buildings — ran up $1.17 billion in losses. [Listen to an episode of “The Daily” on the tax information.] The White House’s response to the findings has shifted over time. Several weeks ago, a senior official issued a statement saying: “The president got massive depreciation and tax shelter because of large-scale construction and subsidized developments. That is why the president has always scoffed at the tax system and said you need to change the tax laws. You can make a large income and not have to pay large amount of taxes.” On Saturday, after further inquiries from The Times, a lawyer for the president, Charles J. Harder, wrote that the tax information was “demonstrably false,” and that the paper’s statements “about the president’s tax returns and business from 30 years ago are highly inaccurate.” He cited no specific errors, but on Tuesday added that “I.R.S. transcripts, particularly before the days of electronic filing, are notoriously inaccurate” and “would not be able to provide a reasonable picture of any taxpayer’s return.” Mark J. Mazur, a former director of research, analysis and statistics at the I.R.S., said that, far from being considered unreliable, data used to create such transcripts had undergone quality control for decades and had been used to analyze economic trends and set national policy. In addition, I.R.S. auditors often refer to the transcripts as “handy” summaries of tax returns, said Mr. Mazur, now director of the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center in Washington. In fact, the source of The Times’s newly obtained information was able to provide several years of unpublished tax figures from the president’s father, the builder Fred C. Trump. They matched up with Fred Trump’s actual returns, which had been obtained by The Times in the earlier investigation. If the new tax information does not offer a new narrative of Mr. Trump’s career, its granular detail gives a precise accounting of his financial failures and of the constantly shifting focus that would characterize his decades in business. Here are some key takeaways. “Trump: The Art of the Deal” came out in 1987. It became a best seller — and a powerful vehicle for the self-spun myth of the self-made billionaire that would ultimately help propel him to the presidency. Mr. Trump has long attributed his first run of business reversals and bankruptcies to the recession that hit three years later, in 1990. But the new tax information reveals that he was already in deep financial distress when his master-of-the-universe memoir hit the shelves. For Mr. Trump, the 1980s were a frenzy of acquisition and construction, buoyed by hundreds of millions of dollars of borrowed money. In 1985, for the first time, Forbes’s “rich list” included Mr. Trump individually, independent of his father. But his estimated net worth according to the magazine, $600 million, included the real estate empire Fred Trump still owned. With Mr. Trump’s vast debt and other expenses on his properties — among them Trump Tower and the Grand Hyatt hotel in Manhattan, and two Atlantic City casinos — his fortunes were already on the way down. In 1985, his core businesses reported a loss of $46.1 million; they also carried over a $5.6 million loss for earlier years. Because those businesses were generally created as partnerships, they did not pay federal income taxes themselves. Instead, their gains, and their losses, flowed onto Mr. Trump’s ledger. To put his results in perspective, The Times compared them with detailed information that the I.R.S. compiles on an annual one-third sampling of high earners. Most of them appeared, like Mr. Trump, to be businessmen who received what is known as pass-through income. For 1985, the I.R.S. information indicates this: Only three individual taxpayers in the sampling reported bigger losses than Mr. Trump. The tax results for the years that followed trace an arc of continued empire building — and gathering loss. He bought the Eastern Airlines shuttle for $365 million; it never made a profit, and he spent more than $7 million a month to keep it flying. His new Trump Taj Mahal Hotel and Casino, opened in 1990 with more than $800 million in debt, sucked revenue from his other casinos, pulling them along into the red. And so, year after year, Mr. Trump appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual taxpayer, according to the I.R.S. information on high earners — a publicly available database with taxpayers’ identifying details removed. Indeed, in 1990 and 1991, his core businesses lost more than $250 million each year — more than double those of the nearest taxpayers in the sampling for those years. The tax code allows owners of commercial property to write down the cost of their buildings — a valuable tax shelter known as depreciation. In “The Art of the Deal,” Mr. Trump cited one of his Atlantic City casinos to show how it works. Built for $400 million and depreciated at a rate of 4 percent a year, he said, it could allow him to shelter $16 million in taxable income annually. But Mr. Trump’s example, meant to demonstrate the magic of depreciation, shows something else: Depreciation alone cannot account for the hundreds of millions of dollars in losses he declared on his taxes. Business owners like Mr. Trump may also use their losses to avoid paying taxes on future income. Over the years, those losses rolled into a $915.7 million free pass, known as a net operating loss, that appeared on his 1995 tax returns, pages of which were mailed anonymously to The Times during the 2016 campaign. The new tax information shows how Mr. Trump’s net operating losses snowballed, reaching $418 million in 1991. That was fully 1 percent of all the losses that the I.R.S. reported had been declared by individual taxpayers that year. And the red ink continued to accumulate apace. In all, Mr. Trump lost so much money that he was able to avoid paying any federal income taxes for eight of the 10 years. For a time, Mr. Trump was able to stave off his coming collapse with the help of a new public role: He traded on his business-titan brand to present himself as a corporate raider. He would acquire shares in a company with borrowed money, suggest publicly that he was contemplating a takeover, then quietly sell on the resulting bump in the stock price. An occasional quote from a high-profile associate helped burnish the myth. “He has an appetite like a Rocky Mountain vulture,” his stockbroker, Alan C. Greenberg, told The Wall Street Journal in 1987. “He’d like to own the world.” From 1986 through 1989, Mr. Trump declared $67.3 million in gains from stocks and other assets bought and sold within a year. But ultimately, the figures show, he lost most, if not all, of those gains after investors stopped taking his takeover talk seriously. Amid the hundreds of figures on 10 years of tax transcripts, one number is particularly striking: $52.9 million in interest income that Mr. Trump reported in 1989. In the three previous years, Mr. Trump had reported $460,566, then $5.5 million, then $11.8 million in interest. The source of that outlier $52.9 million is something of a mystery. Taxpayers can receive interest income from a variety of sources, including bonds, bank accounts and mortgages. Hard data on the workings of Mr. Trump’s businesses is hard to come by. But public findings from New Jersey casino regulators show no evidence that he owned anything capable of generating that much interest. Nor is there any such evidence in a 1990 report on his financial condition, prepared by accountants he hired at his bankers’ request. Mr. Trump’s interest income fell almost as quickly as it rose. By 1992, he was reporting only $3.6 million.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Chris Hughes’s Call to Break Up Facebook: 5 Takeaways,"Opinion A co-founder is alarmed by Mark Zuckerberg’s power and wants to rein in the company. Chris Hughes, one of Facebook’s founders.CreditCreditDamon Winter/The New York Times The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook, pulls no punches in his essay for The Times Privacy Project, calling for a breakup of the company he helped launch from his Harvard dorm room 15 years ago. Here are some key points from his article. Mr. Hughes describes the breathtaking power that Mark Zuckerberg has amassed through a combination of market dominance and lack of regulatory oversight. “Mark’s influence is staggering, far beyond that of almost anyone else in the private sector or in government.” Mr. Hughes writes. Because Mr. Zuckerberg controls most of the company’s voting shares, Facebook’s board “works more like an advisory committee,” and he alone can decide how to configure the algorithms of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, determining who sees what. It’s a power that could be used to make or break rival companies or political candidates. The power of social media companies to rewire how humankind communicates was obvious. But the new tools had unintended consequences and soon started to alter society in alarming ways. “I’m disappointed in myself and the early Facebook team for not thinking more about how the News Feed algorithm could change our culture, influence elections and empower nationalist leaders,” Mr. Hughes writes. Mr. Hughes sets the power of Facebook in the context of a broader movement toward monopolistic consolidation. “In the past 20 years, more than 75 percent of American industries, from airlines to pharmaceuticals, have experienced increased concentration, and the average size of public companies has tripled,” Mr. Hughes writes. “The results are a decline in entrepreneurship, stalled productivity growth, and higher prices and fewer choices for consumers.” [Technology has made our lives easier.

Sign up for our limited-run newsletter.] No major social networking company has been founded since the fall of 2011. In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, as many as one in four Facebook users in the United States deleted the app from their phones, at least temporarily. But they often migrated to Instagram or WhatsApp, not realizing that both companies were also owned by Facebook. Mr. Hughes writes that Facebook’s ubiquity was a result of Mr. Zuckerberg’s drive to grow and the government’s unwillingness to do anything to stop it. “The company’s strategy was to beat every competitor in plain view, and regulators and the government tacitly — and at times explicitly — approved.” Now, Facebook isn’t checked by conventional market forces. “This means that every time Facebook messes up, we repeat an exhausting pattern: first outrage, then disappointment and, finally, resignation,” Mr. Hughes writes. The government has had an aversion stretching back decades to bringing antitrust cases. But the statutes are still on the books and could be used to rein in even the biggest tech giants. “We already have the tools we need to check the domination of Facebook. We just seem to have forgotten about them,” Mr. Hughes writes. Mr. Hughes’s call for breaking up Facebook may have greater resonance given the political moment. The Democratic senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has called explicitly for the breakup of tech giants including Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook. Another Democratic presidential candidate, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, has echoed Ms. Warren’s call, saying the country has a “monopoly problem.” Follow @privacyproject on Twitter and The New York Times Opinion Section on Facebook and Instagram.",The New York Times
2019,"50 Years On, the Art Ensemble of Chicago Is Still Transforming","Critic’s Notebook The Art Ensemble of Chicago was already six years into an acclaimed career when it had its first extended run at an American jazz club. In honor of the occasion — at the Five Spot in the East Village, late 1975 — the members of the group staggered theatrically onstage like drunks entering a two-bit casino. The trumpeter Lester Bowie, wearing a visor, tugged on a bottle of whiskey while he errantly dealt cards onto a table. The saxophonist Joseph Jarman and the percussionist Famoudou Don Moye limped in, clutching each other, swearing and drinking. Eventually the bassist Malachi Favors and the saxophonist Roscoe Mitchell arrived, and the casino act morphed into a five-man parley of percussion before the horn players finally took up their main instruments. The Art Ensemble never liked playing at places like the Five Spot, and its entry that evening was a way of sending up the institution of jazz clubs, which tended to give high black culture low-budget treatment. In March, in Knoxville, Tenn., Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Moye — now in their 70s — were joined by more than a dozen musicians as they strode onstage at the Tennessee Theater as part of the Big Ears festival. The broadly intergenerational band stood at attention, facing east, until Mr. Mitchell tooted a single note and the musicians snapped to their places. They opened their sheet music and looked out from one of the more majestic stages in the Southern United States. The Art Ensemble of Chicago is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, and last Friday it released “We Are on the Edge,” a two-disc collection of compositions new and old, including one studio disc and one captured live. The ensemble was a quintet throughout its classic era, and the current version (17 people on the album) is the largest in its history. The expanded format helps empower Mr. Mitchell, who has become a significant composer of chamber music in his own right, even if it alters some of the Art Ensemble’s old sonic identity. Even when the group had a steady lineup, its sound never stayed put, not even for a few minutes. Usually dressed in face paint and extravagant Pan-African outfits, the band taught audiences to listen for timbral interplay and variegated rhythm, and the way improvisers could follow each other in a leaderless weave. What it didn’t offer was lyrical melodies, classic song forms or easy-to-grasp solos. And along the way, the group always demanded that its work be treated as a form of art music. In the process, it has helped open up institutions to other, less Eurocentric approaches to performance. Explaining the group’s modus operandi, Mr. Moye said in an interview recently, “It was all based around the idea of expanding the standard instrumentation of piano, bass, horns, drums.” Then he went a step further: “Part of the commitment to multidisciplinary thinking was a commitment to independence.” The classic Art Ensemble featured just a few musicians playing a dizzying array of instruments; the current version is packed with people, but most of them stick to their primary axes. The diversity of texture and tone has expanded — particularly thanks to the addition of a string section — but the individual musicians don’t have as much room to move around freely. The pieces on the live disc have a surprising resemblance to the versions on the studio album. But all told, the record is a triumph, and if this isn’t what the original Art Ensemble sounded like, it is certainly the kind of experimental work it was trying to carve out space for. In the mid-1960s Mr. Mitchell became one of the earliest members of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, a seminal black musicians’ cooperative in Chicago that continues today. Even before it came together, he had been leading exploratory bands, drawing inspiration from the pianist Muhal Richard Abrams and his Experimental Band. Mr. Mitchell’s quartet would eventually become a collective, calling itself the Art Ensemble and then — after Lester Bowie pawned his furniture to fund a full-band move to France in 1969 — the Art Ensemble of Chicago. Once there, the group upset the expectations of European audiences accustomed to mainstream American jazz. But it also found those audiences willing to adapt. “It was a turning point for European views on African-American musical expression, because it was very different than the kinds of things that the musicians who had been going there before had done,” said George Lewis, a composer, performer and musicologist who wrote “A Power Stronger than Itself,” the definitive history of the A.A.C.M. “And it was a turning point for the musicians themselves, because they started to see how much their music could mean to the world.” The Art Ensemble found a regular home at the Lucernaire theater, performing multiple nights each week. The five musicians pooled the money they made, putting a little into a collective pot after every gig, and stayed contentedly in Paris for more than two years. The group made a number of albums for small labels during that time, many of which have withstood the test of time — particularly “Tutankhamun” and “People in Sorrow.” They set up the ensemble for a brief relationship with Atlantic Records upon its return to the United States in 1972, bringing the band its widest popular reach. In dealings with labels, as with venues, the Art Ensemble resisted manipulation or inadequate compensation. “We wanted to have more control over our own destinies,” Mr. Mitchell said in an interview, “because we had looked at what had happened to some of the great masters of our music, who were out there on their own and didn’t really fare that well.” At Big Ears in March, from the stage of the Tennessee Theater wafted buoyant grooves played by three double-bassists at once, and a shudder of rain forest sounds (this was some indistinguishable combination of Christina Wheeler’s electronics, Mr. Moye’s hand drums, and the small cohort of percussionists beside him). Eventually, Camae Ayewa, known as Moor Mother, began reciting poetry. If Jarman, a multi-instrumentalist and poet, used to recite verses that challenged the listener in a playful, quizzical fashion — like a free-jazz Dalai Lama — Ms. Ayewa was doing something else. Her voice swelled with strength and fury, and it came at you with the force of an arrow. “Take us back to our homeland,” she demanded. “Teach us our language.” Ms. Ayewa, whose career as Moor Mother has just taken off in the past few years, is among the youngest of the Art Ensemble’s new members. The group also includes Fred Berry, a trumpeter who played in Mr. Mitchell’s original quartet back in the mid-1960s, and Jaribu Shahid, who first joined the Art Ensemble in the mid-2000s. That was around the last time the group put out an album, and it seemed to be on indefinite hiatus until a return to the road — in sextet form — a couple of years ago. Asked what led him and Mr. Moye to bring on such a large team of new musicians, most of them from younger generations, Mr. Mitchell alluded to the importance of continued exchange. “The A.A.C.M. sparked a second generation of younger musicians,” Mr. Mitchell said, “and they’ve now become a part of us.”",The New York Times
2019,500 Days of Duolingo: What You Can (and Can’t) Learn From a Language App,"Free language learning apps often promise the world — but don’t expect fluency from one. Here’s what to expect before you sign up. If mobile language-learning apps are to be believed, it’s never been easier to pick up another language. Just spend 20 minutes a day with a few virtual flashcards and you’ll be fluent in no time! The reality is a lot more nuanced — and arguably more disappointing — than that. Apps like Duolingo, Memrise, and Babbel all promise to teach you how to read, write, or speak a new language, all from your phone. While they’re similar in concept, they differ a lot in the specifics: Duolingo offers a skill tree of lessons that use listening exercises, flashcards, and multiple choice questions to drill you on new words, phrases, and sentences. Most questions have a comment thread where users can discuss a particular question in detail. The service also has community features that let you connect with other people who are learning the same language you are. Memrise offers similar lessons to Duolingo, introducing new words and phrases with flashcards, listening exercises, and more. However, the app has a few unique features: on new words, you can write a note (called a “mem”) with anything that helps you remember the new word or phrase. These will appear later when you come across the word again. It also offers a feature called Learn With Locals, which pairs words with videos of native speakers saying the phrase out loud and demonstrating the phrase. For example, a speaker might shiver when describing cold weather. This helps connect words with their meaning. Memrise also offers more explanatory cards than Duolingo offers when introducing new or complex topics. Babbel is different from the other two. While it uses similar multiple choice or listening exercises as the others, it uses conversational examples to demonstrate how to use new words or phrases when speaking with another person. It also offers a speech recognition feature that lets you speak words back during an exercise instead of writing them out or answering a multiple choice question. This helps you learn how to pronounce words properly, or at least properly enough for your phone to recognize what you’re saying. Despite their differences, they have the same goal: use daily exercises on your phone to teach you an entire language. It’s an enticing promise, especially if you’re not already immersed in a culture or education system that will give you the exposure you need to pick up a second language. The question is, are they effective? After I accumulated a Duolingo streak in excess of 500 days — a feat that, thanks to the app’s notoriously insistent reminders, has now come to define my self-worth — I found myself in a better place to judge just how much an app alone can really teach you. The short answer is that you can definitely learn some things from an app, but if you want to become fluent in a language — or even conversational — they won’t be enough. The phrase “learning a language” is deceptively reductive. A language isn’t a singular monolith, but rather a complex interconnected system of components that build a way to communicate. The lexicon consists of the individual words, which speakers have to memorize. The syntax and grammar tell speakers how to properly structure those words in a sentence. Then there’s the writing system, which is the visual representation of words or sounds that allow words to be constructed (for example, in English, the writing system is the alphabet). For languages that have a different writing system, like Japanese, Russian, or Korean, language apps can be an excellent way to learn. Duolingo and Memrise both use a combination of flash card and simple matching exercises to train you to recognize symbols in a new writing system, while Babbel goes an extra step further with in-lesson explanations for how new symbols or sounds work. After a few weeks or months of consistently going through lessons, it’s feasible to learn every sound and symbol in a new writing system. You won’t be able to understand every word you can read, but you’ll be a lot closer than if you started from scratch. However, that’s only part of learning a language. Understanding the alphabet used in English doesn’t inherently mean you can understand French or Spanish, for example. These apps are also better at teaching basic conversational phrases that are useful when you’re traveling. When you visit a city in a foreign country, it’s helpful to learn a few phrases like “Where is the bathroom?” or “How much does it cost?” Using a phrase book to memorize these phrases in another language is a quick and dirty way to get the job done, but that’s not really “learning” the phrases, it’s just memorizing them. For example, consider the Italian phrase “Dov’è il bagno?” This phrase means “Where is the bathroom?” However, without speaking Italian, can you tell which part of that sentence is “bathroom?” Could you adapt the sentence to say “Where is the door?” or “Where is the hotel?” Language apps don’t just teach you whole sentences. Instead, they break down component parts of a sentence and teach you a few different variations so you understand what you’re saying and can adjust what you’re saying based on your situation. It’s a useful skill to have, especially when traveling. Most importantly, though, these apps are powerful reminders that learning a new language isn’t a part-time job. Duolingo has infamously persistent notifications that pester you to come back and give that adorable green bird attention every single day. The downside is that it can be tempting to gamify the experience, rather than actually learn. On particularly busy days, I’ve found myself redoing the earliest lessons just to keep my all-important streak going. Which leads to another important lesson: skirting the rules on a self-improvement project hurts no one but yourself. For as useful as learning a new writing system or understanding basic phrases can be, it’s only a small part of fluency in a language. What counts as “fluent” is a tough concept to describe, but the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (or CEFR) is a widely-accepted standard for approximating fluency. The six CEFR levels are necessarily broad and can overlap a bit, but here’s a (very) brief overview of what each means: At level A1, learners should know basic phrases, be able to introduce themselves and ask simple personal questions, and understand basic interactions if their conversation partner speaks slowly. Level A2 includes understanding common expressions, communicating about routine tasks, and describing simple aspects of the speaker’s background. Together, these two levels make up the Basic stage. Level B1 starts to introduce more complex ideas like explaining their opinions, dreams, and ambitions, or handling complex tasks while traveling. Level B2 expects speakers to be able to speak with native speakers of a language without straining, and have complex technical discussions related to their field of expertise. These two levels make up the Independent stage. Finally, a level C1 speaker should be able to communicate flexibly in social, professional, and academic settings, understand a wide variety of topics, and recognize implicit meaning. C2, the highest level, expects the learner to “understand with ease virtually everything heard or read,” and summarize information from different sources. Levels C1 and C2 make up the Proficient stage. If it’s not already obvious, language apps simply can’t get someone to level C2 — or anywhere close — on their own. There simply aren’t lessons to teach you, for example, how to have a complex conversation about banking regulations or astrophysics or whatever your field of expertise. It also means that if you stick solely to the lesson plans in each app, you won’t communicate with another person. By definition, these two limitations would rule out reaching even level B2. Some apps also have a hard time teaching complex grammar. In Japanese, for one small example, “particles” are core parts of a sentence that indicate how words relate to each other in a sentence. They’re usually written with the same symbols used to spell words — sort of like how “a” is both a letter, but also a word on its own — which can get confusing since Japanese doesn’t use spaces between words and symbols. Duolingo often just drops a new particle on you without much explanation of what it does or even that it’s a particle at all. Memrise handles this a bit better, with lessons dedicated to how certain particles and grammar work, but it helps to have external lessons, an instructor, or best of all a native speaker to help explain some of the finer points of nuance in a language’s grammar. Language apps also struggle with some of the unspoken aspects of communicating in a language. To focus on Japanese again, there are distinct levels of formality and politeness which dictate what form a word should take based on your relationship with the person you’re speaking to. So, for example, you may use one form of a sentence when speaking to a friend, but a more formal version when speaking to a boss. Furthermore, body language and posture can have a dramatic impact on how your speech is perceived, and language apps tend not to cover this at all. While understanding body language is not strictly a requirement of any CEFR level, it’s hard to navigate a conversation fluently without a general understanding of what certain gestures mean, or what actions are impolite. Most importantly, though, language apps are not other humans. It sounds like an obvious observation, but the entire point of learning a language is to communicate with other people. You can learn as many words or sentences as you want, but until you’re able to have a conversation with another person, you’ll never be fluent. Or, according to the CEFR model, you won’t even be halfway there. For that reason alone, learning a language with an app should be a starting point, not the end. If you make it through an entire Duolingo skill tree or a Memrise lesson plan, it might be time to upgrade to an in-person class, or you might want to find a native speaker to practice with.",The New York Times

2019,6 Evasive or Inaccurate Statements in Barr’s Senate Testimony,"Fact ChecK The attorney general made misleading and false claims about his handling of the special counsel’s report, his own previous comments and President Trump’s actions during the investigation. Attorney General William P. Barr appeared before Congress to defend his handling of the special counsel's report. Here is a fact-check of his comments. What Was Said Mr. Barr: “I asked him if he was suggesting that the March 24 letter was inaccurate and he said no, but that the press reporting had been inaccurate. And that the press was reading too much into it, and I asked him, you know, specifically what his concern was. And he said that his concern focused on his explanation of why he did not reach a conclusion on obstruction.” Mr. Barr sent a letter to Congress on March 24, describing what he said were the main conclusions of the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel. Concerned about Mr. Barr’s characterization, Mr. Mueller sent two letters to Mr. Barr, on March 25 and 27, that included the special counsel team’s own summaries of its report and requested that the Justice Department release them to Congress and to the public. Mr. Barr said that after he received the second letter, he spoke with Mr. Mueller. But regardless of what Mr. Mueller said privately — he has not given his account of the conversation — his letter took issue with Mr. Barr’s summary of the report, and made no specific mention of inaccurate news coverage. The summary Mr. Barr sent to Congress “did not fully capture the context, nature and substance of this office’s work and conclusions,” Mr. Mueller wrote in the letter dated March 27. “We communicated that concern to the department on the morning of March 25.” (The earlier letter has not been released.) Mr. Mueller again attached summaries of his report, and urged Mr. Barr to release them to the public. What Was Said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina: “Did you have a problem with the way Comey handled the Clinton email investigation?”Mr. Barr: “Yes. I said so at the time.” Mr. Barr has both criticized and supported the way James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, handled the agency’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email server. Mr. Comey announced in October 2016 that the F.B.I. had reopened the inquiry after discovering pertinent emails on a computer belonging to Anthony D. Weiner, who separated from his wife, a top Clinton aide, that August. In a Washington Post op-ed that October titled, “James Comey Did the Right Thing,” Mr. Barr said he did not always agree with claims made and actions taken in the investigation. But he argued that the F.B.I. and Mr. Comey did “nothing wrong” in announcing in July 2016 that the case had been completed. Given that previous announcement, Mr. Barr wrote, Mr. Comey “had no choice” but to disclose that the investigation had been reopened. After President Trump fired Mr. Comey in May 2017, Mr. Barr reversed course in a different Washington Post op-ed, casting Mr. Comey’s announcement in July 2016 as having “crossed a line that is fundamental to the allocation of authority in the Justice Department.” He also faulted Mr. Comey for acting unilaterally. (Mr. Barr wrote that he had assumed the Justice Department had authorized Mr. Comey’s actions, but he had since learned that this was not the case, leading him to characterize Mr. Comey’s conduct as “a grave usurpation of authority.”) What Was Said Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont: “My question was why did you say you were not aware of concerns, when weeks before your testimony Mr. Mueller had expressed concerns to you? I mean, that’s a fairly simple — ”Mr. Barr: “I answered the question, and the question was relating to unidentified members who were expressing frustration over the accuracy relating to findings. I don't know what that refers to at all. I talked directly to Bob Mueller, not members of his team. And even though I did not know what was being referred to, and Mueller had never told me that the expression of the findings was inaccurate — but I did then volunteer that I thought they were talking about the desire to have more information put out. But it wasn't my purpose to put out more information.” In testimony before a House appropriations committee in April, Mr. Barr was asked about reporting by The New York Times and others about unhappiness on the special counsel’s team over the way the attorney general had characterized its report. On Wednesday, Mr. Barr repeatedly defended those comments to the House committee and maintained that he was denying knowledge of the specific reports. This was misleading by omission, as Mr. Mueller had written to him twice and spoken with him about the investigators’ concerns. “Reports have emerged recently, General, that members of the special counsel’s team are frustrated at some level with the limited information included in your March 24 letter — that it does not adequately or accurately, necessarily, portray the report’s findings,” Representative Charlie Crist, Democrat of Florida, asked Mr. Barr in early April. “Do you know what they are referencing with that?” “No, I don’t,” Mr. Barr replied. “I think, I suspect, that they probably wanted, you know, more put out, but in my view I was not interested in putting out summaries or trying to summarize because I think any summary, regardless of who prepares it, not only runs the risk of you know, being under-inclusive or over-inclusive, but also, you know, would trigger a lot of discussion and analysis that really should await everything coming out at once.” Asked by lawmakers last month whether he had heard from any of the investigators, Mr. Barr evaded the question and said that the article was “sourced through associates of some of the people who worked on the Mueller report.” What Was Said Mr. Barr: “Yeah, he fully cooperated.” Mr. Barr’s statement was in reference to a question about whether Mr. Trump had fully cooperated with the special counsel’s inquiry. Mr. Trump did not assert executive privilege during Mr. Mueller’s investigation, as Mr. Barr correctly noted. But Mr. Trump also declined to sit down for an interview with investigators. And in his written responses, the president stated on more than 30 occasions that he had no memory of what they were asking about, while other answers he provided were “incomplete or imprecise,” according to the special counsel’s report. The report also documented at least 10 potential episodes of obstruction, including attempts to end the inquiry or remove Mr. Mueller. What Was Said Mr. Leahy: “Mr. Mueller found the written answers to be inadequate. Is that correct?”Mr. Barr: “I think he wanted additional, but he never sought it.”Mr. Leahy: “And the president never testified.”Mr. Barr: “Well, he never — he never pushed it.” Whether Mr. Mueller “pushed” hard enough for an in-person interview with Mr. Trump is subjective, but Mr. Mueller did seek it. “Beginning in December 2017, this office sought for more than a year to interview the president on topics relevant to both Russian election interference and obstruction of justice,” according to the report. It goes on to document the office’s repeated efforts and to note that Mr. Trump declined. The investigators wrote that they had considered issuing a subpoena for Mr. Trump’s testimony, but decided against it because a legal battle would delay the investigation and because they had adequate information from other sources. What Was Said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas: “In this case the president was relying at least in part on a recommendation by the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein arising out of Rod Rosenstein’s critique of Mr. Comey’s conduct in holding that press conference, releasing derogatory information about Secretary Clinton but then announcing that no reasonable prosecutor would bring charges against her. Is that right?”Mr. Barr: “That’s right.” Despite Mr. Cornyn’s and Mr. Barr’s claims, Mr. Trump himself has said multiple times that a May 2017 memo written by Mr. Rosenstein, which recommended the firing of Mr. Comey based on his handling of the investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s emails, was not a factor in his final decision to dismiss Mr. Comey. “He made a recommendation, but regardless of recommendation I was going to fire Comey, knowing there was no good time to do it,” Mr. Trump said in an NBC News interview in May 2017. “And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.” Mr. Trump repeated this rationale, though less emphatically, in an interview with The Times in July 2017: “And he gives me a letter, O.K., he gives me a letter about Comey. And by the way, that was a tough letter, O.K. Now, perhaps I would have fired Comey anyway, and it certainly didn’t hurt to have the letter, O.K.” In a September 2018 interview with Hill.TV, Mr. Trump expressed regret that he had not fired Mr. Comey sooner: “I should have fired him the day I won the primaries. I should have fired him right after the convention.” Waiting to remove Mr. Comey, Mr. Trump suggested, was the “one mistake” of his presidency. Mr. Mueller’s report also noted that Mr. Trump “decided to fire Comey before receiving advice or a recommendation from the Department of Justice.” Based on interviews with former White House aides, the investigators reported that Mr. Trump had already written his letter firing Mr. Comey before telling Mr. Rosenstein to draft his recommendation. “The White House Counsel’s Office agreed that it was factually wrong to say that the Department of Justice had initiated Comey’s termination,” according to the report.

2019,6 Simple Tips to Get Into R.V. Travel,"Travel Tips Recreational vehicles offer travelers the thrill of the open road and the comforts of home. Here’s how to get started. Recreational-vehicle travel is on the rise and not just with baby boomers. With the growth of peer-to-peer rental companies like RVShare and Outdoorsy, R.V. travel has become more accessible — and more appealing — to vacationers of varying ages and budgets. Over the last six months, Outdoorsy’s bookings have shot up more than 300 percent among global users, the company said, with half of those users under the age of 40. Similarly, Kampgrounds of America’s latest North American Camping Report noted millennials and Gen Xers now account for 70 percent of R.V. users. If you’ve never traveled by motor home or R.V., or thought it wasn’t for you, here are a few tips to set the wheels in motion. Freedom, flexibility and an immersion in nature are just a few appealing perks of R.V. travel. Visiting multiple destinations without having to pack and unpack, traveling with a pet, the lure of the open road and kitchens for those with dietary restrictions are also big advantages. Boondocking, or dry camping, lets travelers park almost anywhere without sacrificing comforts like shelter and a bed. “It’s a happy medium between a hotel and tent camping,” said Jon Gray, RVShare’s chief executive. R.V.s have also become a popular choice for people attending festivals, tailgating at sporting events or staying near family during the holiday season, he added. Traditional rental firms offer a service that’s similar to renting a car, while peer-to-peer services are more akin to Airbnb, said Kevin Broom, a spokesman for the RV Industry Association. “When renting from owners, look closely at the details,” he advised. Take time to read customer reviews, check the age of the vehicle and make sure it’s well maintained. “Companies like Cruise America, El Monte RV and Apollo tend to have lower insurance deductibles than renting a privately owned vehicle,” said Deborah Trevino, a Virtuoso travel agent, “but rental prices are typically less in the sharing economy because you’re not renting from a franchise.” For travelers uncomfortable driving larger R. V.s, peer-to-peer rental websites provide search filters for owners who are willing to deliver and set up trailers at a location selected by the renter. Your budget, destination and the number of travelers are the biggest factors in determining what size and model is best for your trip. “A couple visiting several locations and driving lots of miles may want a smaller motor home with better fuel economy,” Mr. Broom said. “A family with children may want a larger R.V. with slide outs and more sleeping areas.” GoRVing is a website that compares features of various RV types and has a “Find My RV” tool to help select the right fit, while the CompactAppliance website outlines the pros and cons of the different categories. (Most states do not require a special driver’s license for R.V.s.) Motor homes, or motorized R.V.s, come in three different classes based on size and amenities. Towable R.V.s, such as conventional travel trailers, fifth-wheel trailers, truck campers, folding camping trailers and sport utility R.V.s, require a vehicle to pull them. If you have the right vehicle to pull it, a towable R.V. is a great option because you have a car for exploring, Mr. Gray said. “Campervans with four-wheel drive are popular among millennials because they’re ideal for driving in off-grid locations,” said Jeff Cavins, chief executive of Outdoorsy, based on his company’s data. “The Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, Winnebago Revel and the Sportsmobile Classic 4 by 4 are all top sellers.” “Map out your route in advance,” Ms. Trevino said. “Smaller roads may not be equipped to accommodate heftier R.V.s.” She recommends becoming a Good Sam Club member ($29/year) to access its web-based trip planner, which has helpful filters for low-clearance avoidance and options to bypass highways and tolls. For a $26.99 yearly subscription, the app CoPilotGPS offers R.V.-specific navigation (trucker maps and R.V.-specific GPS devices provide similar information), while Roadtrippers.com is a free resource for plotting R.V. routes and calculating travel time, mileage and estimated fuel cost. It’s crucial to reserve campgrounds in advance, especially during summer months and other peak travel periods. Websites like Reserve America, Roverpass, Campendium and Recreation.gov provide lists of campsites available across the country. “We recommend first timers to stay at a fully-loaded R.V. park or campground like Kampgrounds of America and Yogi Bear’s Jellystone Park Camp-Resorts, which offer full hookups, dump stations and staff on site,” Mr. Gray said. When renting a rig, request detailed instructions from the owner or rental company how to use the R.V.’s systems, including the generator, air-conditioning, leveling, slide outs, electric and entertainment, as well as how to empty waste tanks and refill fresh water. Typically, the owner or rental company will conduct a walk-through orientation with the vehicle’s renters. Most rental companies offer roadside assistance in their pricing, and extended roadside service, for nonmechanical mishaps like misplacing your keys, is also available. Make sure to take the vehicle for a test drive to get comfortable turning, parking and towing it. Some R.V. owners provide free bedding, towels and kitchen essentials, while others offer housekeeping kits and outdoors equipment at a cost; inquire ahead of time. “Many customers opt to have their R. V.s supplied with groceries and camping gear like kayaks, fishing poles and a grill, so all they need to do is arrive with their suitcase,” said Mr. Cavins. If you’re stocking the vehicle yourself, RV-camping.org provides a helpful checklist, broken down into categories from toiletries and clothing to kitchen supplies and tools. Of course, most items can be purchased on the road if you don’t want to buy them before you leave. 2 PLACES AND MUCH, MUCH MORE Follow our 52 Places traveler, Sebastian Modak, on Instagram as he travels the world, and discover more Travel coverage by following us on Twitter and Facebook.

2019,6 Things That Calendars From the Special Counsel’s Office Tell Us,"The Mueller team got to work quickly, newly disclosed calendars show. But prosecutors made time for cake, too. WASHINGTON — The office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was shrouded in secrecy. But details are seeping out now that the investigation is over, and more were revealed on Tuesday in dozens of pages of calendars and a few text messages from one of Mr. Mueller’s top prosecutors, Andrew Weissmann. The conservative group Judicial Watch, which has sought to undermine the inquiry, obtained the calendars through the Freedom of Information Act and released them, claiming the calendars show how Mr. Weissmann was determined to build a team of Democrats to investigate Mr. Trump. There is no evidence of that. But the calendars do offer a look at the prosecutors’ daily lives in one of the most high-profile federal investigations in American history. [Read the calendars here.] Mr. Mueller had to hire quickly, and he delegated the responsibility to Mr. Weissmann, one of his earliest and most senior hires. Some candidates were interviewed by phone, according to Mr. Weissmann’s schedules, and some traveled to Washington to meet with him and another of Mr. Mueller’s senior deputies, Jeannie Rhee. On the calendars, only the names of some prosecutors hired are shown: Andrew D. Goldstein, Lawrence Atkinson, Kyle Freeny and Greg D. Andres. As the team took shape, the office held a meet-and-greet. [Meet the special counsel’s prosecutors] Mr. Mueller’s longtime aide Aaron M. Zebley functioned as a kind of steward or superintendent of the investigation. A former counterterrorism agent and Mr. Mueller’s chief of staff when he was the F.B.I. director, Mr. Zebley was one of Mr. Mueller’s first hires. The two kept offices next to each other at WilmerHale, the law firm where they worked as partners in the years leading up to the Russia investigation, and even wear the same kind of pinstripe suits and Casio watches. Behind the scenes, Mr. Zebley had a direct hand in briefing senior Justice Department officials on the investigation. In Mr. Weissmann’s calendars, Mr. Zebley’s initials appear 111 times and are marked next to dozens of meetings, suggesting he may have taken the lead in running them. The entries include the office’s team meetings and preparations for grand jury appearances. The team also held a daily “ops” meeting at 5 p.m. in what they called the Sequoia Room. (The other meeting rooms were Elm and Maple.) The routine was similar to Mr. Mueller’s time at the F.B.I., when he gathered senior aides for “closeout” meetings at the end of the day, according to Matthew G. Olsen, who worked as special counsel to Mr. Mueller there. One of the ensuing controversies of the Mueller report stems from investigators’ decision not to make a determination about whether President Trump obstructed justice, citing “difficult issues” of law and fact surrounding the question. As early as four months into the investigation, the calendars show, the team may have already been grappling with those difficulties. On Sept. 14, 2017, the investigators met to discuss “law issues” in the Maple conference room. The calendars provide no indication of what issues were discussed. Mr. Mueller’s investigation exposed the culture in Washington of lobbying on behalf of foreign governments for big paydays. Early on, his investigators seized on a law rarely used and long viewed as toothless — the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, which requires anyone working to advance a foreign government’s interests to register with the Justice Department. Mr. Mueller’s team, as well as other federal law enforcement officials, pursued numerous FARA cases. And the calendars show the special counsel’s investigators were interested early on: On Day 2 of the entries — June 6, 2017 — Mr. Weissmann had a “meeting with FARA counsel.” According to the calendars, the team worked a lot. Weekend meetings and calls are scattered throughout. Holiday meetings are as well — including two on the Fourth of July — but those could be the byproduct of digital calendars that schedule weekly meetings in perpetuity without taking holidays into account, rather than actual meetings. A spokesman for the special counsel did not say whether individual meetings took place. Like office drones throughout the government and corporate America, the special counsel’s team regularly held small celebrations. Early on, in August 2017, investigators marked August birthdays with “goodies at the table” near the desk of Peter Carr, the special counsel’s spokesman. Days before the Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his deputy Rick Gates were indicted in October 2017, a farewell party for a colleague was scheduled at the same time as the regular Team Manafort Meeting. The office had a “Progressive Potluck Holiday Party” that December. Other calendar entries: “Let’s eat cake” for birthdays in January 2018, a spring fling potluck that April, and a joint Marine Corps birthday and Veterans Day celebration in November 2017. (Mr. Mueller is a decorated Marine Corps veteran.)",The New York Times
2019,"6 Years After Hurricane Sandy, Here’s What They Came Up With: Really Big Sandbags","City officials will install the sandbags as the first line of defense against storm surges in part of Lower Manhattan. [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] After Hurricane Sandy devastated New York in 2012, city officials considered some drastic responses to storm surges, like long concrete sea walls and tall earthen berms. But as the seventh hurricane season since then approaches, the city is relying on something more modest as the first line of defense against another inundation of Manhattan: a row of glorified sandbags. In the next few months, the city’s Office of Emergency Management plans to oversee the installation of four-foot-tall sacks of soil along the East River esplanade, from Wall Street to just north of the Brooklyn Bridge. For up to five years, they essentially would form the only barrier to keep water from again rushing into the low-lying neighborhoods around the South Street Seaport. City officials say they are a temporary step while permanent solutions to New York’s vulnerability to big storms are still being planned and debated. But the barriers have already provoked derision. “Six years of studying it and you come up with sandbags? Really?” said Marco Pasanella, whose family owns a 180-year-old building with a wine shop that faces the river on South Street. He said he felt no less vulnerable than he did on the night that Sandy flooded his shop and left the district without power for two weeks. Along with the doubts about their effectiveness, the barriers have also been panned as unsightly interlopers along a stretch of waterfront popular with pedestrians and bicyclists — one woman called them “atrocities.” They will cover only about one mile of the waterfront, leaving the area below Wall Street unprotected, possibly for another decade or longer. Officials have admitted that they do not have a plan for protecting much of the financial district, which is home to about 100,000 people and accounts for one of every 10 jobs in the city. They have concluded that Lower Manhattan is simply too congested, with 18 subway lines and a tangle of utilities running beneath its warren of narrow streets, for land-based defenses like fences that flip up from the ground. Instead, they have a more ambitious vision and have begun planning to extend the shoreline of the island into the water to serve as a bulwark against rising sea levels and storm surges. But making more of Manhattan will take a lot of time and money. In the meantime, the financial district will rely on a combination of commercial products that are typically used as temporary protections against flooding that look like they come from Home Depot: Hesco barriers and plastic tubes known as Tiger Dams. The barriers are wire-mesh frames that can be filled with sand or gravel and linked together to form a low wall. They have been used to hold back raging rivers in many parts of the country, but emergency management officials said they were not aware of any other city using them in the way New York is. “We’re in the Wild West of adaptation where it’s like anything goes,” said Robert Freudenberg, vice president for energy and environment at the Regional Plan Association. “It comes down to the need to do something soon. Sometimes that looks a little uglier than the visions that are laid out.” The city installed similar barriers in the Red Hook neighborhood of Brooklyn and Astoria in Queens, where they either abut buildings or are tucked against or behind fences. In Manhattan, however, they would stick up prominently between a busy street and the promenade. After being set up, they would eventually be decorated by artists in a process city officials call “beautification.” Not everyone who has beheld them agrees. “I saw the barriers in Red Hook, and they are not attractive,” said Catherine McVay Hughes, a former chairwoman of Community Board 1, which encompasses the financial district and the seaport. “They’re not contextual with the South Street Seaport.” The barriers would be “atrocities,” said Alice Blank, a TriBeCa resident who heard city officials present their plans to the community board at a recent meeting. “I guess what they were saying is, we’re going to put down these unsightly blocks and we’re going to paint them in the fall.” City officials said the barriers can last up to five years and are worthy stopgap measures. “Our goal is to bridge the gap between the current hazard and permanent mitigation,” said Benjamin Krakauer, an assistant commissioner at the Office of Emergency Management. While they seem like a makeshift solution to protecting urban centers, New York is not the only city to deploy them — other cities, including New Orleans and Los Angeles, have also used the barriers as temporary fortifications. They filled gaps in levees in New Orleans as Hurricane Katrina approached in 2005. In Los Angeles, the United States Army Corps of Engineers installed a three-mile line of them on a bank of the Los Angeles River out of concern about flooding from El Niño storms in 2016. But after complaints from cyclists and equestrians about the barriers blocking access to a bike path and horse-riding trails, the Corps removed many of them after the El Niño threat had passed. Other coastal cities facing similar challenges to New York, however, have opted not to use the barriers. In Charleston, S.C., where flood prevention is a top priority, Mayor John J. Tecklenburg said the city plans to raise its sea wall by three feet and fit it with tracks for glass plates that could add an additional two and a half feet. But, the city’s chief resilience officer, Mark Wilbert, said the city had not turned to Hesco barriers because “there’s got to be a start and a stop on them, and where it stops the water will come around.” In Lower Manhattan, the stopping point will be Wall Street. The barrier wall will start just north of the Brooklyn Bridge at Catherine Slip and extend nearly a mile to Wall Street. Along the way, there will be about 18 gaps, mostly for pedestrian access to the riverfront. When a storm threatens, the Tiger Dams will be moved from storage in Brooklyn and filled with water to cover the gaps, Mr. Krakauer said. That makeshift wall would not hold back a storm like Sandy, whose surge rose six and a half feet as it swamped the historic Seaport district and destroyed one of its main attractions, Pier 17. But city officials told the community board that there had not been a storm since that would have triggered the deployment of the Tiger Dams. In other areas of Lower Manhattan, the city’s Economic Development Corporation identified different ways of defending against big storms, at a cost of about $500 million. Planning is underway for the installation of gates that would flip up along the esplanade north of the Brooklyn Bridge, underneath the elevated Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive. Along the Battery and in Battery Park City, esplanades would be raised. But Elijah Hutchinson, vice president for resilience at the development corporation, said in a recent presentation that for the seaport and the financial district, “we don’t have a plan.” City officials are embarking on the more sweeping plan of extending the shoreline of Lower Manhattan by as much as 500 feet, a project that Mayor Bill de Blasio said could cost $10 billion and would take at least six years to complete. The city hopes to hire a team to design that extension by fall. But with no source of funding identified for the project, the plan could involve allowing developers to build on the landfill to help pay for it, city officials said. Until then, a big section of the Lower Manhattan waterfront will not have so much as a row of big sandbags to protect it, a void that has left downtown residents and merchants feeling vulnerable, Ms. Hughes, the former community board chairwoman, said. “Clearly, this interim plan has a big gap between Wall Street and the Battery,’’ she said, “and that gap also needs to be addressed.” An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the flip-up flood gates the city planned to install north of the Brooklyn Bridge would attach to the underside of the elevated Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive. The gates may rise up beneath the highway, but they will not attach to it.",The New York Times

2019,7 Recent Netflix Comedy Specials That Are Worth Your Time,"For many comedians, a Netflix special has supplanted the traditional late-night talk show set as the big ticket to success. The streaming service’s global presence helps comedians build fan bases all over the world, which keeps them busy with live shows in far-flung locations. In 2018, Netflix announced a major expansion of its comedy slate — including releasing 47 specials from a globe-spanning roster of comics in a single day. The trends in stand-up specials have continued apace this year, including extremely pregnant comics baring (and bearing) it all, and popular sets that may or may not qualify as stand-up comedy. It’s a lot! Here’s a little something to help you sift through the most recent crop. If you grew up quoting Adam Sandler’s ’90s comedy albums like “They’re All Gonna Laugh at You!” and “What the Hell Happened to Me?,” you’ll probably swoon over his latest special, the comedian and actor’s first new hour of stand-up since 2004. “100 Percent Fresh” is Sandler at his best, combining frat-boy crudeness with tender vulnerability alongside hilarious song sketches (“My kid’s only got one line in a play,” he rages in a grunge-style tune). The hour splices together different performances from a variety of venues, often cutting from one to the next the second a bit veers in a different direction and ends on a twist. “100% Fresh” also includes the tear-jerker tribute to Chris Farley that Sandler recently performed on “Saturday Night Live.” Watch on Netflix. True to its name, Ellen DeGeneres’s triumphant return to stand-up opens with an extended riff on just how relatable she is, her nearly-half-a-billion-dollar net worth notwithstanding. “Yes, I’m enjoying it,” she cops, and she’s just charming enough that you don’t begrudge her a cent. (All right, maybe I begrudge her a couple hundred mil.) DeGeneres doesn’t exactly shy away from the spotlight — her syndicated talk show is in its 16th season — but “Relatable” finds her opening up about her breakthrough success in the ’80s, coming out in the late ’90s and the perils of fame. Her thesis is that despite differences in gender, sexual orientation or income, we’re all essentially the same. And yes, she dances. Watch on Netflix. [Interested in getting more suggestions on what to watch? Sign up for the Watching newsletter, which we send out every Monday and Friday.] In “Growing,” Amy Schumer’s second stand-up special for Netflix, the comic’s maturation as a performer is evident — particularly in her facial expressions, which often add a visual punch line to her jokes. Schumer, newly married, is hugely pregnant in the special, and she’s as open about the physical realities of pregnancy as she was about her former life as a prolific party girl. Since abandoning her brilliant Comedy Central sketch series “Inside Amy Schumer,” Schumer has gone from America’s foremost single gal to something more complicated. The scale of her fame has inevitably dislodged her underdog persona, and accusations of joke-stealing and white-girl cluelessness have dogged her for years. But “Growing” is a refreshing return to form for Schumer, particularly after a few years of mostly bland Hollywood blockbusters. Watch on Netflix. Demetri Martin is a self-referential, think-y kind of comic, and “The Overthinker,” as the title suggests, is the epitome of his shtick. A voice-over track of Martin’s inner monologue sporadically interrupts his set, a running self-commentary on the performance. (He uses the narration sparingly enough that it doesn’t get annoying.) On the surface, neither Martin nor his act appear to have changed much: He’s still incorporating visual gags like his signature flip-chart bit, still posing seemingly unanswerable questions and wordplay conundrums — and, at 45, he still looks like he could plausibly live in his parents’ basement. But it’s a testament to Martin’s joke-writing skills that, 20 years into his career, he can still find new and surprising ways to turn the most granular observation into a punch line. Watch on Netflix. Netflix was all over last year’s Just For Laughs comedy festival in Montreal, taping dozens of half-hour specials for its international series “Comedians of the World.” Nearly 50 comics representing 13 regions are featured, including the Canadian-born, London-based Mae Martin (find her routine under “U.K.” in the drop-down menu). In her special, Martin tells the story of her childhood obsession with Bette Midler and her growing realization that she has an addictive personality. The set — which also deals with Martin’s entry into the comedy scene as a young teenager, an early drug habit and dating both men and women — seems to have at least partly inspired a new comedy series Martin is creating for the British channel E4, which will co-star Lisa Kudrow as her mother. Watch on Netflix. One of the first comics to tape a Netflix special way back in the olden times of 2013, Iliza Shlesinger filmed “Elder Millennial” in a retired aircraft carrier in Alameda, Calif. (“I do a lot of U.S.O. tours,” she explained.) Like Schumer, Shlesinger uses her new special to reflect on her changing priorities now that she’s no longer a single twenty-something. Newly engaged, Shlesinger dispenses advice on sex and dating, which is delivered at a rah-rah empowering pitch even as it hews pretty close to traditional standards and gender roles. Still, Shlesinger has a habit of changing course just when you least expect it, and she backs up her observations with some killer impressions. Watch on Netflix. O.K., this one is not strictly a stand-up special. Brené Brown is a research professor at the University of Houston who studies shame and vulnerability; she’s known for her best-selling self-help books and her viral 2013 TED Talk, “The Power of Vulnerability.” “Call to Courage” is essentially an hourlong motivational speech, but the very funny Brown employs a lot of the tools of comedy to engage her audience. Like a stand-up, she uses personal anecdotes to make universal observations about how fear and shame can cripple us. She’s good at dramatizing her inner monologue, and at making the audience feel as if she’s one of them. And like pretty much all the other comedy routines on this list, Brown’s speech is a form of therapy for the masses, in which we watch someone expose themselves for our own catharsis.

2019,7 Things to Do With Your Kids in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to cultural events in New York City for children and teenagers happening this weekend and in the week ahead. ‘AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS’ at the New Victory Theater (May 10, 7 p.m.; May 11, 1 and 7 p.m.; May 12, noon and 5 p.m.; through May 19). Laura Eason, a playwright and screenwriter who usually targets the over-17s (“Sex With Strangers,” “House of Cards”), adapts Jules Verne’s 1873 earth-trotting adventure for the younger crowd. Phileas Fogg, an English eccentric, bets that he can circumnavigate the globe in under three months, by train, boat and the occasional elephant. In this high comedy production from New Vic Theater Staffordshire, directed by Theresa Heskins, Andrew Pollard stars as Fogg and Michael Hugo as Fogg’s inestimable valet Passepartout. Six other actors play more than 120 characters. (That’s overpopulation for you.) The show is recommended for ages 7 and up. 646-223-3010, newvictory.org ECOLOGICAL CITY: PROCESSION FOR CLIMATE SOLUTIONS at various locations (May 11, 11 a.m.-5 p.m.). A long walk for a good cause, this free climate action, organized by Earth Celebrations, asks New Yorkers large and small to wander through the gardens and waterfronts of the Lower East Side. (The parade begins at the Sixth Street Community Center and concludes at East River Park.) To make the walking a little more lively, giant puppets will come along, too, and in collaboration with 50 community group partners, there are 20 site-specific performances — a culmination of six months of workshops — encompassing music, dance, theater and poetry. Participants are asked to transform into garden, river and climate-solution spirits and imagine a sustainable future. earthcelebrations.com/ecological-city-project THE KIDS FOOD FESTIVAL at Brookfield Place (May 11-12, 10 a.m.-4 p.m.). If your children have finally reached the stage at which they’ll condescend to eat something more exotic than a chicken nugget, or even if they won’t, you can encourage them to go on a culinary adventure. At this event, created in collaboration with the James Beard Foundation and now hosted by Brookfield Place, children and their parents can try a yoga class, sample snacks at various booths, attempt the Balanced Plate Scavenger Hunt and cook things like summer quinoa salad, rainbow pancake pops, avocado chocolate mousse and, courtesy of Grandaisy Bakery’s piccolo pizzaiolo session, a white pizza with pecorino. kidsfoodfestival.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] LIFT OFF: A WATERFRONT KITE FESTIVAL at Brooklyn Bridge Park, Pier 5 (May 11, noon-3 p.m.). Brooklyn Bridge Park Conservancy has the world on a string. For anyone who dreams of recreating the final scene of “Mary Poppins” or has a thing for aerodynamic lift, the conservancy offers this swooping, soaring, plunging festival, the first of its spring and summer offerings. At this free event, the kites will be accompanied by stilt walkers, live musicians and projects centered on S.T.E.A.M. (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) concepts, like designing wind mobiles and spiral wall hangings. B.Y.O.K. (bring your own kite) or just buy one there. brooklynbridgepark.org PEN NEXT GENERATION NOW at Town Stages (May 11, 12:30-6 p.m.). As part of the PEN World Voices Festival, PEN America is offering workshops, story times and panels for children who can read and those who are still just getting the hang of their ABCs. Curated by Meg Lemke, the event includes activities like a Drag Queen Story Hour with Miz Jade; a creative workshop with Spellbound Theater, “Today I Will Be Fierce!”; a comics carousel; a comics and graphic novel workshop; a conversation with writers of young-adult books; a reading and a mural painting; and the Make a Book With 826NYC! workshop, which transmutes ideas into published texts. worldvoices.pen.org SHEEP SHEARING FESTIVAL at the Queens County Farm Museum (May 11, 11 a.m.-4 p.m.). Many of us like to start the summer with a new haircut — sheep, especially. At this annual festival, they get buzzed, yarn gets dyed, wool gets spun, quilts get quilted, and children get to ride around in hay-filled wagons, rock out to the bluegrass band Coyote & Crow and maybe adopt a worm. For the grown-ups, the Bridge & Tunnel Brewery offers a beer garden. 718-347-3276, queensfarm.org TEEN ARTS WEEK at various locations (May 13-19). Today’s teenagers will take over the world eventually. This new festival gives them a head start.

The free events — some of which you can register for online — include a poetry workshop at the 92Y, a night of social justice at the Point CDC in the Bronx, aerial and circus arts at Streb in Brooklyn, a new earth ceremony and the creation of a mandala at the Snug Harbor Cultural Center in Staten Island, and a choose-your-own arts adventure at the Jamaica Center for the Arts in Queens. 212-415-5768, 92y.org/teen-arts-week",The New York Times
2019,7 Things to Do With Your Kids in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to cultural events in New York City for children and teenagers happening this weekend and in the week ahead. FAMILY SATURDAYS: CAPTIVATING CHOREOGRAPHY at the David H. Koch Theater (May 25, 11 a.m.). Children are natural dancers, but many may not understand the term “choreography” or the techniques artists use to pair movement and music. Here, they’ll get a lesson from the experts: members of New York City Ballet. Hosted by Daniel Ulbricht, a principal dancer and the creative director of the Family Saturdays series, the program will introduce the work of some of the company’s most influential choreographers. Recommended for those 5 and older, the hourlong presentation will feature excerpts from the troupe’s spring season repertory, including Jerome Robbins’s “Dances at a Gathering,” George Balanchine’s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” Alexei Ratmansky’s “Concerto DSCH” and Justin Peck’s “The Times Are Racing.” Young balletomanes can even learn a few steps themselves.212-496-0600, nycballet.com FLEET WEEK ACTIVITIES at various locations (through May 27). Memorial Day weekend is a time to honor not only fallen military heroes, but also the men and women who currently serve. Celebrated annually, Fleet Week focuses on the armed forces’ maritime branches, with family events showcasing the work of the United States Navy, the Marine Corps and the Coast Guard. Among the highlights are ship tours at piers in Manhattan, Staten Island and Brooklyn; and a military island in Times Square, with attractions that include daily Navy band concerts and, on Friday and Saturday, a dive tank where children can observe Navy divers and learn about their gear. On Saturday, the Marine Corps will host Marine Day in Prospect Park in Brooklyn, with interactive displays, a mixed-martial-arts program and military dogs. On Sunday, Fleet Week at Liberty State Park in Jersey City will feature music, exhibits and demonstrations, as well as youth and family running events. (All activities are free except the Jersey City runs, which also require preregistration; a full Fleet Week schedule is on the website.)fleetweeknewyork.com ‘I MIGRATION’ at the Waterfront Museum and Showboat Barge (May 23-25, 7 p.m.; May 26, 3 and 7 p.m.; May 27, 3 p.m.). Most Americans have ancestors who arrived from somewhere else. At a time when the word “immigrant” has become politically charged, this stage production — presented in Red Hook, Brooklyn, on a converted 1914 railroad barge within view of the Statue of Liberty — explores what it means to be a citizen in a nation of multiple heritages. Directed and developed by Reg Flowers, the artistic director of Falconworks Theater Company, in collaboration with the composer Alex Siesse, the choreographer Thaddaeus Abbott and the cast, the show uses original music, images, historical sources and the words of immigrants past and present. Recommended for theatergoers 10 and older, it also involves the audience in its inquiry.718-624-4719, waterfrontmuseum.org ‘PIP’S ISLAND’ at 400 West 42nd Street (ongoing). “To the lighthouse!” is the rallying cry for participants in this immersive theater spectacle, but the show is nothing that Virginia Woolf might have imagined. A fantasy adventure that invites children to become little Indiana Joneses, “Pip’s Island,” which opened for a limited New York run in December 2016, is now back for an open-ended stay in an even more elaborate production. Created by Walter Krudop and the siblings Rania Ajami and Rami Ajami, the hourlong experience enlists theatergoers in a mission to help save the island’s lighthouse, its energy source, from the clutches of a cackling villain. Along the way, children encounter characters that include Pip and Finn, the story’s heroes, and Pebble, its heroine, who has regrettably little to do. Young attendees, however, have plenty: Walking, crawling or frolicking through a succession of detailed environments, they collectively execute simple challenges to advance the plot. Filled with puppetry, animations, animatronics, lighting effects and digital flourishes, the show is like a high-tech “Sleep No More” for 4- to 10-year-olds.888-718-4253, pipsisland.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] ‘RICITOS AND THE 3 BEARS’ (‘RICITOS Y LOS TRES OSITOS’) at Teatro SEA (May 25 and June 1, 11 a.m.). Theatrical adaptations of fairy tales often try to subvert expectations, either by modernizing the stories or by adhering to the works’ sometimes morbid original versions. Teatro SEA, the Latino theater for children, takes an entirely different approach: It gives the narratives some Spanish twists. In its musical interpretation of “Goldilocks and the Three Bears,” the heroine, Ricitos, still has that yellow hair, but she speaks two languages, and when she enters the animals’ home, she doesn’t taste their porridge but their sancocho (stew). With Latin ballads and new costumes, this bilingual revival teaches both good manners and a little Spanish vocabulary.212-529-1545, teatrosea.org STORYTELLING: DESIGN AND MAKE YOUR OWN BOOK at Brooklyn Historical Society Dumbo (May 25, 10:30 a.m.-1:30 p.m.). The Brooklyn shoreline may not resemble a Caribbean beach, but the two will overlap, at least imaginatively, in this program at the historical society’s Dumbo branch. Michael Manswell, artistic director of Something Positive Inc., a nonprofit devoted to Afro-Caribbean culture, will visit the society’s “Waterfront” exhibition, where he and a drummer will perform stories from the African diaspora that feature marine spirits and other fantastical beings. The event, which is free but requires preregistration, will invite children to create and decorate their own books as well as explore the show. The “Waterfront” displays offer opportunities to touch and smell coffee beans and other imported goods, make videos reflecting the maritime past and dress up like the female welders of the Brooklyn Navy Yard during World War II.bhswaterfrontstorytelling.eventbrite.com ‘A YEAR WITH CHILDREN 2019’ at the Solomon R.

Yet more than a hundred young New Yorkers make that leap every year as a result of Learning Through Art, a program in which teaching artists from the museum work with students who are in the second through sixth grades in 12 public schools throughout the five boroughs. Each spring, the Guggenheim displays select pieces that pupils created during the artists’ residencies in its “A Year With Children” show, which this year addresses questions like “How can art empower communities?” Expect installations, found-object works, poetry and prints, as well as paintings and sculptures.212-423-3500, guggenheim.org An earlier version of these listings misspelled the surname of one of the creators of “Pip’s Island.” He is Walter Krudop, not Kudrop.",The New York Times

Maybe your children would rather watch cartoons than listen to classical music, but really there’s no need to make it an either-or situation. This concert from the New York Philharmonic and Warner Bros. celebrates the classical tunes expropriated by a certain wascally wabbit, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig and Elmer Fudd. The program includes music from Strauss, Wagner and Smetana, as well as “The Warner Bros. Fanfare,” “The Merrie Melodies Theme” and the “That’s All Folks” signature closing sequence.

The program is recommended for everyone ages 4 and up. 212-875-5656, nyphil.org CHILDREN’S FESTIVAL at the National Museum of the American Indian (May 18-19, 11 a.m.-5 p.m.). This museum will devote its 21st annual festival for young people to the Taíno, the indigenous tribe of the Caribbean. Inspired by its current exhibition “Taíno: Native Heritage and Identity in the Caribbean,” the festivities will include dancing with Irka Mateo, stories from Bobby Gonzalez and craft projects such as maraca making, hammock weaving and button decorating. (You can take home some of these projects, though probably not the hammock.) Also, a museum educator will be on hand to tell children which Caribbean foods they can find at the corner store. americanindian.si.edu CRAFT IN FOCUS FESTIVAL at Industry City (May 18-20, 11 a.m.-6 p.m.). Turn your children into makers at this Brooklyn festival celebrating all things woven, hammered, chiseled, soldered, hand sewn, hand shaped, hand dyed, hand carved and hand printed. Workshops for children and families include Silkscreen Printing for Kids from Project K!D, Relief Printmaking for Families from the 92nd Street Y Art Center and Kids! Make Your Own Flashy, Vibrant Robot! from Koko NYC. Though the Make Your Own Chocolate Creations class is for adults only (no fair!), there is a demonstration of Stroopwaffel making, and children can join Koko NYC in building an off-the-grid Tiny House.

With water births much in vogue, you and your family might be curious about how sea creatures handle labor, delivery and the early years. And, hey, do you think whale songs send baby whales to sleep, too? The latest event in this science series should have answers. Under the blue whale in the Hall of Ocean Life, scientists will discuss the intimate lives of mollusks, sea horses, sea turtles and jellyfish. A touch tank will hold sea stars, sea urchins and anemones. The Central Park Zoo will provide a live penguin show. And children can play interactive games, including a nest-building exercise. The program is free to members or with museum admission. 212-769-5100, amnh.org PROSPECT PARK SPRING FLING at Prospect Park (May 17-19). Having weathered March winds and fended off April showers, you might as well enjoy the results. This weekend the Prospect Park Alliance offers a slate of athletic, cultural, artistic and plant-based events. Friday’s roller disco party is for parents only, but on Saturday children can enjoy bird watching, a cookout, an 1860s-style exhibition baseball game and a performance by the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theater. Sunday offers Smorgasburg, a trail run, paper flower making, a reading of “The Misanthrope,” a volunteer cleanup and the Spring Fling Fair at the Prospect Park Children’s Corner. On both days there’s a nature walk at the Audubon Center and the Wild and Woolly Festival at the zoo. prospectpark.org STATUE OF LIBERTY MUSEUM OPENING WEEKEND at Liberty Island (through May 19, 8:30 a.m.-5 p.m.). Huddled masses yearning to breathe free now have a new place to congregate. The three gallery spaces of this new museum, which opens on Thursday, include an immersive theater, which traces the statue’s origins and offers a virtual fly-through of its interiors; an engagement gallery that explores how the statue, designed by the sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, was constructed; and an inspiration gallery that displays the statue’s original torch, which was replaced in 1986. Admission is free with a ferry ticket to Liberty and Ellis Islands. statueoflibertymuseum.org STORY PIRATES at the Cherry Lane Theater (May 18, 11 a.m.).

2019,7 Venezuelan Military Officers Die in Helicopter Crash,"CARACAS, Venezuela — Seven Venezuelan military officers were killed on Saturday when their helicopter crashed while heading to a state where President Nicolás Maduro appeared alongside troops, days after the political opposition had called in vain for a military uprising. The helicopter hurtled into a mountain outside Caracas in the early hours of an overcast day. An investigation was underway. The armed forces said in a statement that the copter was heading to San Carlos in Cojedes State, where Mr. Maduro appeared on Saturday at a military academy to oversee training exercises. It was an effort to demonstrate the armed forces’ loyalty to him after a small group of security forces turned against him earlier in the week in the failed attempt by the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, to overthrow the government. On board the helicopter were two lieutenant colonels as well as five lower-ranking officers. The statement did not say if the copter was part of the presidential delegation. The critical role of the Venezuelan military in the country’s political crisis was on display on Saturday as Mr. Maduro tried to portray strength by joining troops at the military academy while Mr. Guaidó attempted to woo the armed forces by urging supporters to take to the streets. National television showed Mr. Maduro wearing a camouflage hat as he shook hands and exchanged fist bumps with security forces. He later watched troops engage in a shooting exercise. “Loyal forever,” Mr. Maduro bellowed to a crowd of cadets in green uniforms. For his part, Mr. Guaidó told backers to go to military garrisons to persuade forces to turn against Mr. Maduro, whose years in office have been marked by escalating hardship in a country that was once one of the wealthiest in Latin America. Some demonstrators handed over printed documents to the police, saying the military’s role in helping Venezuela emerge from an “unsustainable” situation was vital. But the police burned the papers with a lighter. “They think it’s a joke. They don’t take us seriously. They’re not listening,” said one demonstrator, Andrea Palma.",The New York Times
2019,"71-Year-Old Woman Is Killed, and Her Husband Is Wounded, in Stabbing Attack","Maria Rodriguez was found dead on Saturday in her Brooklyn home, and her 87-year-old husband, who uses a wheelchair, was wounded in the attack. [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] A routine visit by a home attendant led to a gruesome discovery over the weekend in Brooklyn, where a woman was killed and her husband was wounded in a knife attack, the police said. The woman, Maria Rodriguez, 71, had been stabbed several times in the torso and died in her home, according to the police. Her 87-year-old husband, who uses a wheelchair, was stabbed in the chest and slashed across the arm. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center, where he remained in serious condition on Sunday. Investigators were looking to speak with the couple's 55-year-old son, Oscar Rodriguez, Jr., who checked himself into a nearby hospital’s psychiatric ward on Saturday, according to a police official. No arrests had been made by Sunday evening and the police did not offer a motive for the attack. On Saturday, the home attendant called the couple’s family after no one answered the door to their duplex on Garden Street in Bushwick. An in-law, Artelio Reyes, 63, crawled through a window and made the gruesome find, then called the police around 6:50 p.m. The couple’s home was cordoned off with police tape on Sunday and an officer stood guard at the door. As neighbors passed the house, they expressed shock. “For something like this to happen it’s just unreal,” said Felix Peralta, 42. “She was a precious old woman, very generous, very kind.” Ms. Rodriguez was the third person killed this year in Bushwick, although murders in New York are down so far this year, according to police statistics. Neighbors said Ms. Rodriguez was a soft-spoken woman who could be found feeding pigeons every morning either on her stoop or in the grassy patch outside her home. Her husband used a wheelchair to get around and rarely left the house, said Roselin Hu, 64, whose sister lives next door. Vivian Green, 60, who lives across the street, said she exchanged greetings with Ms. Rodriguez on her way to the supermarket in the morning. “She spoke to everybody,” Ms. Green said. “She was nice to everybody.” Phone calls to relatives of the couple went unanswered on Sunday. Mr. Reyes declined to comment. Mr. Rodriguez purchased the brick-front duplex in 2004, according to property records. The couple lived below a second-floor unit that they rented to tenants. The house sits in a row of seven similar houses, each facing a small patch of grass with trees that line the sidewalk. A waist-high black metal gate separates the house from the sidewalk and gray concrete steps lead up to the front door.

2019,"75 Years After D-Day, Planes Fly Off for ‘Never Seen Before’ World War II Commemoration","The historic aircraft are part of the “D-Day Squadron” that left Sunday for a weeklong, trans-Atlantic flight in preparation for the commemoration of the 75th anniversary of D-Day. [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] OXFORD, Conn. — Dave Hamilton’s most notable flight was 75 years ago, when he was just 21 years old. It was just after midnight on D-Day, and he was carrying 18 Allied paratroopers to the area behind Omaha Beach. The sky was full of planes that night as the young pilot encountered gunfire and nearly collided with a church before making his way back to England. “I didn’t know a lot and boy, I learned in a hurry, I can tell you that,” said Mr. Hamilton, who grew up in Tuxedo, N.Y. Mr. Hamilton — now 96 years old and living in Prescott, Ariz. — was back in a World War II troop carrier on Saturday, this time flying as a passenger in a formation flight over New York City with more than a dozen warbirds. The planes roared down the Hudson River and around the Statue of Liberty before returning for the night to Waterbury-Oxford Airport in Connecticut. The attention-getting display was a final practice run for owners of the historic aircraft, who left Sunday to fly to Europe together as the “D-Day Squadron.” The Douglas DC-3 aircraft and C-47 Dakota transports are headed on a weeklong, trans-Atlantic flight culminating June 5, when the pilots will meet up with a dozen European Dakotas and together cross the English Channel to Normandy for the ceremony commemorating the June 6, 1944, military landing. The flight from America, in many ways, is a journey into the past: The planes will stop for fuel in Newfoundland, Greenland, Iceland, Scotland and England, retracing the route used when the planes were brought to the European theater during World War II. “There have not been this many Dakotas crossing the Atlantic since the war,” said Steve Lashley, the director of communications for the D-Day Squadron. “People are going to be able to look up and see something they’ve never seen before.” Saturday’s display was just a fraction of the size of the aerial armada on D-Day, when more than 800 Dakotas and other aircraft filled the sky. “That’s why we’re doing this mission, we’re bringing history to life,” said Andy Maag, who is flying a C-47 named That’s All, Brother. Standing beside one of the restored twin-engine Dakotas at Waterbury-Oxford Airport, Mr. Hamilton was wearing khaki pants, a military cap and an Eisenhower jacket that displayed his many medals. He held a cane that seemed as much for swagger as for support, and he laughed at the suggestion that he was an object of living history, asking, “Am I a symbol?” His companion, Kay Nehring, told him that, yes, he was — and a celebrity, too. “It’s like showing up with the World War II version of Elvis,” Ms. Nehring said of her outings with Mr. Hamilton. During the war, Mr. Hamilton was trained in England as a pathfinder, a designation for specially trained paratroopers and their pilots. Mr. Hamilton made a few practice jumps before commanding the flight that delivered his fellow pathfinders to the battlefield. His plane, one of the first in France on D-Day, was hit by gunfire. “They put about 200 holes in my airplane and they didn’t break a cable, they didn’t hit anybody,” he said. But as he prepared to fly back to England, he said his co-pilot warned him, “You better lift your right wing. You’re going to take the steeple off the church of Sainte-Mère-Église.” Members of the D-Day Squadron noted the inexorable loss of veterans like Mr. Hamilton, and the importance of marking the 75th anniversary of the World War 11 landing. “This is our last chance to honor the members of the greatest generation while they’re with us,” Mr. Lashley said. “The 80th will be too late.” The planes in the D-Day Squadron, some of which started as DC-3 airliners that the military converted to troop carriers, are all owned by nonprofit organizations or individuals. The total cost of the voyage is estimated to be about $3 million, including fuel costs of about $2 million, said Eric Zipkin, whose Tunison Foundation owns one of the C-47 planes, the Placid Lassie. A group of people associated with the airplanes is funding the trip, Mr. Zipkin said. Each of the airplanes departed with extras of everything that could break or need replacement, from tiny gaskets to large tires. Extra time was built into the schedule, too. While most of the plane’s flight controls are 1930s-era technology, the latest navigation and communication equipment with its colorful displays peek out amid the circular analog dials on the flight decks. Every airplane is equipped with life rafts and survival suits. “This is dangerous,” said Len Roberto, a member of the board of directors of the Connecticut Air and Space Center. “It is not an easy journey in a 75-year-old airplane.” While the focus is on the veterans and the airplanes they flew, Gregory Crouch, a West Point graduate and the author of “China’s Wings,” which showcases the use of C-47 and DC-3s during the war, points out that tributes like this are especially important in today’s political climate. “Our modern politics are so divisive. We have a hard time feeling like we’ve got anything in common with the other side, let alone like we’re on the same team,” Mr. Crouch said. “But what a spectacular combined effort World War II was, both domestically and internationally. We built this incredible alliance that fought for the future of civilization. And won.”",The New York Times
2019,8 Classical Music Concerts to See in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to the city’s best classical music and opera happening this weekend and in the week ahead. ARCANGELO at Zankel Hall (May 10, 7:30 p.m.). This British period-instrument ensemble, under the direction of Jonathan Cohen, has made quite the name for itself in nine short years. Here they play trio sonatas by Bach and Buxtehude, weaving them in between Handel’s nine German Arias, sung by the soprano Joélle Harvey.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org CALIDORE STRING QUARTET at the Rose Studio (May 16, 6:30 and 9 p.m.). The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center continues steadily to increase the amount of new music in its diet, and this excellent quartet should prove strong advocates for Wolfgang Rihm’s String Quartet No. 3, Joan Tower’s “Red Maple” and Mark-Anthony Turnage’s “Massarosa,” which receives its world premiere and, like the Tower, is written for quartet and bassoon, here played by Peter Kolkay.212-875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org ‘EL CIMARRÓN’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (May 10-11, 7 p.m.). It’s a tribute to the socially conscious, artistically collaborative vision of the soprano Julia Bullock that her season as an artist in residence at the Met includes these concerts of Henze’s, the title of which translates to “The Runaway Slave.” Bullock does not perform; instead, relish the singing of Davóne Tines, a breakout bass-baritone, alongside Emi Ferguson on flute, Jonny Allen on percussion and Jordan Dodson on guitar. Zack Winokur directs. 212-570-3949, metmuseum.org IESTYN DAVIES AND THOMAS DUNFORD at Zankel Hall (May 16, 7:30 p.m.). There are flashier countertenors around than Davies, who appeared on Broadway to sing Handel in “Farinelli and the King,” but none I would rather hear. Appearing with a leading lutenist, he sings Purcell, Handel and Dowland.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org DOVER QUARTET at Weill Hall (May 10, 7:30 p.m.). This fine young string quartet probably ought to be gracing a more prominent Carnegie Hall stage than the smallest of its three, but that just means you have the chance here to hear them in a more intimate setting. They play Tchaikovsky’s String Quartet No. 3, Bartok’s String Quartet No. 3 and Dvorak’s String Quartet No. 14.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] ANGELA HEWITT at the 92nd Street Y (May 11, 8 p.m.; May 14, 7:30 p.m.). Hewitt concludes the third season of her four-year traversal of Bach’s keyboard works with these two concerts. The first, on Saturday, looks at his seven Toccatas; the second, on Tuesday, includes three of the English Suites.212-415-5500, 92y.org EVGENY KISSIN at Carnegie Hall (May 16, 8 p.m.). This Carnegie mainstay, rightly famed for his technique, gives a recital of three Chopin Nocturnes, Schumann’s Piano Sonata No. 3, selections from the Debussy “Préludes” and Scriabin’s Piano Sonata No. 4. Expect encores by the dozen.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org ‘KOPERNIKUS’ at the Issue Project Room (May 15-16, 7 p.m.). The International Contemporary Ensemble and the choral group Meridionalis join forces to perform the only completed opera by Claude Vivier, a composer who was murdered at 34 in 1983 and who remains “more heard about than heard,” as my colleague Zachary Woolfe has aptly put it. Sergio Policicchio provides the video for what the composer called a “ritual opera of death,” and Sebastián Zubieta conducts, under the auspices of the Americas Society.212-249-8950, as-coa.org/events/kopernikus",The New York Times
2019,8 Dance Performances to See in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to dance performances happening this weekend and in the week ahead. HADAR AHUVIA at Danspace Project (May 30-June 1, 8 p.m.). When Israel became a state in 1948, creating fresh folk dances was one way it forged a sense of unified national identity. Ahuvia, who was raised both there and in the United States, has used Israeli folk dance as an entry point to examine and critique that process and its impact on Palestinians. She continues this inquiry in “The Dances Are for Us” alongside other dancers with varying relationships to Israel. Here, she also expands her scope to look more broadly at the role folk traditions play in constructing nation building. 866-811-4111, danspaceproject.org AMERICAN BALLET THEATER at the Metropolitan Opera (through July 6). After a week of showcasing the more serious, probing side of its resident choreographer, Alexei Ratmansky, Ballet Theater serves up one of his more frothy and whimsical creations: “Whipped Cream,” a 2017 work inspired by a 1924 ballet that is literally about a kid in a candy store. In the tradition of “The Nutcracker,” the tasty treats dance. Beginning on Thursday, the company takes a stylistic about-face with the start of its Twyla Tharp program, comprising “The Brahms-Haydn Variations,” the virtuoso “In the Upper Room” and the Beach Boys escapade “Deuce Coupe.” 212-362-6000, abt.org DANCEAFRICA at the BAM Howard Gilman Opera House (May 24, 7:30 p.m.; May 25, 2 and 7 p.m.; May 26-27, 3 p.m.). Twenty-five years ago, hundreds of thousands were murdered during the Rwandan genocide, devastating a country and a culture. In 2006, the Inganzo Ngari dance company was founded to pass down Rwandan folk dance traditions, partly as an act of rebuilding. The troupe will headline the 42nd annual DanceAfrica festival, which this year spotlights Rwanda and its remarkable rejuvenation. In addition to indigenous dances, like the intore warrior dance, Inganzo Ngari will perform with the BAM/Restoration Dance Youth Ensemble. To show off the country’s more contemporary side, the actor and poet Malaika Uwamahoro will deliver a spoken-word component. 718-636-4100, bam.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] GRAHAM 2 at Martha Graham Studios (May 30, 7 p.m.; through June 2). Talented students from the Martha Graham School make up this pre-professional troupe, and many of them go on to join the main company. For Graham 2’s spring season, those dancers tackle more than a half-century of Graham’s work, from 1929’s “Heretic” to 1981’s “Acts of Light.” Also on the program are excerpts from Graham’s “Embattled Garden,” the recently revived romantic romp “Secular Games” and a new dance by the French choreographer Brice Mousset. 212-229-9200, marthagraham.edu/graham2 SIN CHA HONG at La MaMa’s Ellen Stewart Theater (May 25, 7 p.m.; May 26, 3 p.m.). The 13th annual La MaMa Moves! Dance Festival features eclectic local and global artists and is curated, as it was from the beginning, by Nicky Paraiso. This week Hong returns from South Korea to New York, where she spent 20 years dancing and choreographing. On this visit, she brings “Mirror,” a work in which she wonders, “Who am I?” It’s a question she poses to the audience as well, and one she attempts to answer through quiet, contemplative gestures in a minimalist American modern dance tradition that is also shaped also by Korean folk dance and her years of studying meditation in India. 212-475-7710, lamama.org NIALL JONES at the Chocolate Factory (May 27- June 1, 8 p.m.). Jones’s new work, “Fantasies in Low Fade,” explores ideas about temporal and spatial transitions and human proximity by allowing the audience to experience both. Viewers begin in the Chocolate Factory’s basement to observe Jones and two other performers up close before being guided upstairs to two distinct areas, each with its own unique visual design and expressive, sometimes intense lighting. The process of moving through the space, inhabiting its changing scenes and many moods, is meant to evoke the shifting nature of social life. 718-482-7069, chocolatefactorytheater.org LIMÓN DANCE COMPANY at the Joyce Theater (May 29, 7:30 p.m.; May 30-31, 8 p.m.; through June 2). This company, founded in 1946, preserves the works of José Limón, the Mexican-born pillar of American modern dance. This season’s offerings include “The Moor’s Pavane,” a 20-minute take on “Othello” from 1949 that is one of Limón’s most enduring works, and “Psalm,” an ensemble work from 1967 that was revamped in 2002. Joining these are “The Weather in the Room” by the company’s artistic director, Colin Connor, and “Radical Beasts in the Forest of Possibilities” by Francesca Harper. 212-242-0800, joyce.org NEW YORK CITY BALLET at the David H. Koch Theater (through June 2). After a few more performances of the “All Balanchine” program, which includes “Scotch Symphony” and “Sonatine” (Friday and Saturday evening), and another program called “Symphonic & Electronic,” with works by Balanchine and Justin Peck (the Saturday and Sunday matinees), City Ballet heads into the final stretch of its spring season with performances of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” beginning on Tuesday. Balanchine’s 1962 take on Shakespeare’s rom-com features a beloved patchwork score by Felix Mendelssohn, as well as all the requisite fairies, frolicking and enchanting pas de deux that remind us how well ballet is suited for conveying the meeting of magic and love. 212-496-0600, nycballet.com",The New York Times
2019,8 Dance Performances to See in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to dance performances happening this weekend and in the week ahead. AMERICAN BALLET THEATER at the Metropolitan Opera (through July 6). What hasn’t Alexei Ratmansky choreographed? For the time being, his ballets monopolize the repertory — and that’s not a bad thing. Friday and Saturday feature the final presentations of his staging of “Harlequinade,” a comic ballet in the commedia dell’arte tradition, inspired by the archival notes of Marius Petipa. On Monday, the company’s spring gala, which celebrates his 10th anniversary as the artist in residence, offers his “Serenade After Plato’s Symposium” and the premiere of “The Seasons.” The following day showcases a Ratmansky triple bill with “Seasons” and more new works: “Songs of Bukovina” and “On the Dnieper.” 212-362-6000, abt.org DANCE PARADE at Broadway and 21st Street (May 18, 1 p.m.). The 13th annual celebration of all forms of dance — more than 100 genres are included — is presided over by this year’s grand marshals: Bill T. Jones, Baayork Lee, Louis Mofsie and D.J. Dara. At 12:35 p.m., in advance of the march, a traditional Native American Circle Dance will be led by Mofsie, who is the director of the Thunderbird American Indian Dancers. Afterward, paraders will work their way down Broadway and across Eighth Street to Astor Place, where there will be a grandstand for brief performances, and then head to Tompkins Square Park for many more. There will be five stages throughout the park, along with free lessons from 3 to 7 p.m. danceparade.org NIC KAY at Abrons Arts Center (May 23-25, 7 p.m.). As part of an ongoing meditation looking at ideas surrounding the notion of recovery, this dance artist unveils “You Black + Bluised [Exercise 5 in Getting Well Soon].” The project will take place in three sections and be performed over three evenings as “Prayer,” “Protest” and “A Pieace.” The exercises referred to in the title of the work, which is partly inspired by the center’s architecture, come to life in different forms: movement, installation, games, endurance, ritual, poetry and collective action. Here, the choreographer asks, How can a performance serve as a space for a reparative action? 212-598-0400, ext. 1422; abronsartscenter.org LA MAMA MOVES! DANCE FESTIVAL at La MaMa’s Ellen Stewart Theater (through May 26). The festival continues with more provocative choreography, including Dan Safer’s “Surveys the Prairie of Your Room” (on Saturday and Sunday) and Jesca Prudencio’s “Calling: A Dance With Faith” (on Thursday and May 24). Safer explores the potential for action in transitional spaces, while Prudencio presents a dance-theater work that features Ping Chong & Company and focuses on the life of two Muslim women as they contend with their faith and pursuit of dance. And in a special event, Yoshiko Chuma hosts a discussion, “Secret Journey: Stop Calling Them Dangerous No. 2,” for which she is joined by the choreographer, composer and performer Adham Hafez to talk about oppression, marginalization, prejudice and profiling. It will be held at Movement Research on Saturday and Sunday. 212-352-3101, lamama.org LIGIA LEWIS at Performance Space New York (May 21-22, 7 p.m.). In “Minor Matter,” the first of two presentations by this Berlin-based choreographer, the color red takes prominence during an exploration of the space between love and rage. The second installment in Lewis’s “Blue Red White” trilogy, the work looks into the notion of black life within the frame of a theater’s black box. A dance for three, it opens with an invitation to enter a place of not knowing through a reading of excerpts from Remi Raji’s poem “Dreamtalk.” Ligia’s third piece in the trilogy, “Water Will (in Melody)” — a melodrama in black and white — will follow at the theater on May 28 and 29. performancespacenewyork.org NEW YORK CITY BALLET at the David H. Koch Theater (through June 2). This weekend coincides with the return of the principal Amar Ramasar, one of two dancers who was fired for sharing sexually explicit photos of female dancers and was then reinstated to his position at City Ballet by an arbitrator. He appears opposite Sara Mearns in George Balanchine’s “Brahms-Schoenberg Quartet” (the matinees on Saturday and Sunday). On Friday night, a relatively fresh cast of Jerome Robbins’s “Dances at a Gathering” takes the stage with debuts by four of the finest dancers in the company: Unity Phelan, Anthony Huxley, Russell Janzen and Joseph Gordon. The coming week affords more chances to see Robbins’s masterpiece, along with Balanchine’s “Stars and Stripes.” 212-496-0600, nycballet.com GILLIAN WALSH at Performance Space New York (May 17-19, 4 p.m.). In “Fame Notions,” this choreographer contemplates the American dancer. For Performance Space’s No Series, which celebrates the act of refusal, Walsh is compelled to create new spaces for collective experiences with dancers and audience members alike. Her research has included interviews with dancers about their desires and disappointments; five of them are featured in this slow-paced, meditative work, in which audience members are free to come and go. performancespacenewyork.org ANN LIV YOUNG at 109 St. Nicholas Avenue, Apt. 2L, Bushwick, Brooklyn (May 23, 6-10 p.m.; through May 31). This choreographer and performance artist opens her Brooklyn apartment to audience members for “Antigone,” her latest evening-length work, which has recently toured Europe. Here, Young’s point of departure is Bertolt Brecht’s 1948 version, which explores, among other things, social resistance and the current political climate. There will also be plenty of her honest and brash commentary, along with guest performers — such as the Naysayers playing music in her bathroom. Young, as Antigone, will be joined by Daniel Borg, Lucie Strecker and, in select performances, her daughters, Lovey and Akiko Guerrero. eventbrite.com",The New York Times
2019,8 New Books We Recommend This Week,"Editors’ Choice Those who forget history are … in luck, actually. This week’s recommended reading includes refreshers on everything from the settling of Polynesia to Brooklyn’s past as a queer enclave to the impeachment of Andrew Johnson in 1868. There’s art history, in María Gainza’s autofiction about an Argentine critic; and literary history, in Casey Cep’s riveting account of the true-crime story that Harper Lee was never able to write; a fictional look back at Palestine in the early 1900s; and a nonfiction analysis of European history from 1950 until the age of Brexit. It’s a list that might appeal to the heroine of Binnie Kirshenbaum’s novel “Rabbits for Food,” were she not sidelined by a crippling depression: “Bunny’s range of interests,” Kirshenbaum writes early in the book, is “varied: history, politics, antiques, animal rights, psychology, fashion, and literature, serious literature, although now she is interested in nothing.” This novel isn’t about history per se, but that line — with its hint that we live at the edge of nihilism, and that all of our distractions are just so much scaffolding against the void — surely gets at one of history’s recurring themes, and one of the reasons we turn to it in the first place for edification and consolation: because we have survived so much (history tells us), and here we are. Gregory CowlesSenior Editor, BooksTwitter: @GregoryCowles THE IMPEACHERS: The Trial of Andrew Johnson and the Dream of a Just Nation, by Brenda Wineapple. (Random House, $32.) The latest from the award-winning Wineapple is about the first impeachment trial in the United States, in 1868, when Andrew Johnson, who ascended to the presidency after Abraham Lincoln’s assassination, was nearly voted out of office. (The House overwhelmingly gave him the boot; the Senate saved him.) Wineapple started to research this book six years ago; she briefly mentions Presidents Nixon and Clinton but not the current occupant of the White House. “She doesn’t have to,” our critic Jennifer Szalai writes. “The relevance of this riveting and absorbing book is clear enough, even if Wineapple’s approach is too literary and incisive to offer anything so obvious as a lesson.” FURIOUS HOURS: Murder, Fraud, and the Last Trial of Harper Lee, by Casey Cep. (Knopf, $26.95.) Cep’s remarkable first book is really two: a gripping investigation of a rural Alabama preacher who murdered five family members for the insurance in the 1970s, and a sensitive portrait of the novelist Harper Lee, who tried and failed to write her own book about the case. “It takes Cep about five pages to eliminate from the reader’s mind the possibility that the source of Harper Lee’s literary problems was lack of material,” Michael Lewis writes in his review. “This story is just too good.” In Cep’s probing of “another writer’s failure to write,” he adds, “her book makes a magical little leap, and it goes from being a superbly written true-crime story to the sort of story that even Lee would have been proud to write.” SEA PEOPLE: The Puzzle of Polynesia, by Christina Thompson. (Harper/HarperCollins, $29.99.) Mystery has long attended the inhabitants of the Pacific’s far-flung islands: Where did they come from, when did they get there, and how? Thompson explores these questions, with a particular focus on the early Polynesians’ incredible navigational skills, and “succeeds admirably,” Simon Winchester writes in his review. The book, he says, makes a “fascinating and satisfying addition to an already considerable body of Polynesian literature.” WHEN BROOKLYN WAS QUEER, by Hugh Ryan. (St. Martin’s, $29.99.) This boisterous history captures the variety and creativity of the sexual outsiders who congregated around the economic hub of the Brooklyn Navy Yard, a flourishing center of gay life from the middle of the 19th century until well into the 20th. Caleb Crain’s review calls it “an entertaining and insightful chronicle … enhanced by original research in newspaper archives, unpublished letters and collections of ephemera.” THE GLOBAL AGE: Europe 1950-2017, by Ian Kershaw. (Viking, $40.) At a time of uncertainty and harsh political division, Kershaw’s book offers valuable evidence that Europe’s recent history was a period of enormous accomplishment, both politically and economically, achieved against obstacles that make many of today’s troubles seem minor by comparison. “Kershaw reminds us that the Continent has faced other large challenges in the postwar era and survived,” Michael A. McFaul writes in his review; “that some long-term trends of peace, prosperity and democracy are both robust and remarkable; and that individuals have agency, and can alter the course of events — they are not mere expressions of those events.” THE PARISIAN, by Isabella Hammad. (Grove, $27.) This strikingly accomplished first novel, set in the early 20th century and modeled in part on the life of the author’s grandfather, captures the fate of a European-educated Arab, a man divided, like his native Palestine. Our reviewer, Christopher Benfey, calls it “a deeply imagined historical novel with none of the usual cobwebs of the genre,” and says that the book has “an up-close immediacy and stylistic panache … all the more impressive coming from a London-born writer still in her 20s.” RABBITS FOR FOOD, by Binnie Kirshenbaum. (Soho, $26.) After a New Year’s breakdown, the heroine of this furious comic novel checks into a Manhattan mental hospital and starts taking notes. “Kirshenbaum doesn’t trivialize mental breakdown. She makes Bunny’s debilitation raw and worrying, and not without its insights,” Lucy Ellmann writes in her review. “Being incarcerated paradoxically forces Bunny to reconnect with other people and her own mind. She’s alert to the sanity of the insane, and the ineptitude of most of the staff.” A bracing humor balances the despair. OPTIC NERVE, by María Gainza. Translated by Thomas Bunstead. (Catapult, $25.) In this delightful autofiction — the first book by Gainza, an Argentine art critic, to appear in English — a woman delivers pithy assessments of world-class painters along with glimpses of her life, braiding the two into an illuminating whole. “María’s store of information about painters and their lives can make reading the book feel, delightfully, like auditing a course,” John Williams writes in his review. The book, he adds, “consistently charms with its tight swirl of art history, personal reminiscence and aesthetic theories.”",The New York Times
2019,8 Things to Do With Your Kids in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"BORDERS & BELONGING at Public School 10 (May 4, 2-4 p.m.). Books can build bridges even when politicians want to erect walls. This Brooklyn presentation, recommended for ages 9 to 12, features the children’s author Matt de la Peña, who is the American son of a Mexican father, and New York State Assemblywoman Catalina Cruz, who was born in Colombia and now represents a district in Queens. De la Peña, whose works include the young-adult novel “Mexican WhiteBoy” and the Newbery Medal-winning picture book “Last Stop on Market Street,” will talk about his heritage and writing, while Cruz will relate her experiences under the Obama administration’s policy Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Then Jennifer Szalai, a book critic for The New York Times, will moderate a discussion on immigration, inclusiveness and the unifying power of storytelling.ps10.org HOLI HOORAY! at the Brooklyn Children’s Museum (May 4, 11 a.m.-4 p.m.). If you feel that your life needs a little brightening, this event is for you. Celebrating Holi, the Hindu festival of color, the day will begin with Jai Jai Hooray’s “Holi on the Block!,” performed by Ajna Dance Company and Raga Kids. This piece portrays the Hindu deities Radha and Krishna as Brooklyn schoolchildren who combat bullying with a creative use of color. The schedule will also include Bollywood dance classes, vibrant art projects, a South Asian rooftop bazaar and Indian foods. The fun all culminates with a Holi tradition: tossing fistfuls of pigmented powder. This will happen outdoors at 3 p.m., rain or shine, after a happy procession to Brower Park. Parents can rejoice, too: The museum sells only nontoxic, washable powder.718-735-4400, brooklynkids.org INVENTGENUITY FESTIVAL 2019: FLIPNYC at Dock Street School (May 5, 11 a.m.-4 p.m.). They might be the tallest tales ever told. The Inventgenuity Festival, dedicated annually to engineering, art and creativity, will focus this year on producing two gigantic flip books: early forms of animation whose illustrations appear to move, in cartoonlike fashion, when the pages are rapidly turned. Presented by Beam Center, a Brooklyn-based educational nonprofit, Inventgenuity invites children 8 and older to trace and color 200 images for the enormous volumes, which will be operated with solar-powered cranks. Working with teenage Beam Center Fellows, who have already started the wiring and welding, those attending the festival (it’s free but registration is required) will complete the books in collaboration with the architect Chee-Kit Lai and the artist Ebony Bolt. Young visitors can also participate in workshops to make night lights, shadow puppet theaters, sound-emitting greeting cards, miniature flipbooks and other projects. In June, the huge finished books will animate a whole neighborhood: They go on display in Dumbo, Brooklyn. 347-470-6747, beamcenter.org LINCOLN CENTER’S 60TH-ANNIVERSARY BLOCK PARTY at the Lincoln Center Campus (May 4, 10 a.m.-2:30 p.m.). Not all events at Lincoln Center are appropriate for children — Wagner’s “Ring,” anyone? — but those in this celebration should suit almost any age. Kicking off a series of programs that commemorate the complex’s 1959 groundbreaking, this free festival will involve all 11 of the center’s organizations and take place both outdoors and in. (Tickets for indoor events will be distributed, first come first served, starting at 10 a.m. at Josie Robertson Plaza.) Performances with particular child appeal include the opening ceremony, featuring Native American dancers; a concert by Falu Shah and her band, who will offer South Asian music from her young people’s album, “Falu’s Bazaar”; high-energy dance from Step It Up NYC, whose members are ages 10 to 20; and “American Journeys,” an interactive concert about immigration by the New York Philharmonic’s teaching artists.

Once a year, the tracks of this decommissioned Brooklyn subway station come roaring back to life. That will happen at this Sunday morning benefit, when the museum will offer shuttle rides between its platform and the Hoyt-Schermerhorn station on R-1/9 cars, 1930s models with rattan seats and ceiling fans. In addition to traveling in their great-grandparents’ style, children can play with model trains, get their faces painted, pose for family portraits inside the conductor’s cab of a stationary vintage car and work on their own subway projects: glass-tile mosaics and a large collaborative map. And where else can you expect breakfast to include cake?718-694-1600, nytransitmuseum.org SPRING INSECT DAY at Wave Hill (May 4, 10 a.m.-2 p.m.). Don’t they rule the season, anyway? Seriously, though, this Bronx public garden has good reason to honor insects, which play important roles in the Hudson Valley ecosystem. During its first three hours, this bug celebration will include a drop-in family art project (also offered on Sunday), in which children can learn about moth caterpillars and make their own model cocoons, enclosing within each a message about change. Throughout the day, an insect command post, organized by the entomologists and educators Lawrence Forcella and Lindsay Velazco, will display various species (both live and preserved), along with cocoons and chrysalides. At 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., Forcella will also lead insect expeditions in which young investigators (the recommended ages are 8 and older) can search the grounds for residents like spiders, butterflies, centipedes and woodlice.718-549-3200, wavehill.org ‘SILENT VOICES: LOVESTATE’ at the New Victory Theater (May 2, 7 p.m.; May 4, 2 and 7 p.m.; May 5, noon and 4 p.m.). Don’t be misled by the adjective in the title. In this 70-minute program, the members of the Brooklyn Youth Chorus, ages 12 to 18, will be singing their hearts out about the issues that matter to them most: sexism, racism, economic inequality, climate change. They do, however, see their mission as communicating the concerns of groups that may feel silenced, like minorities and migrants. This third installment of the series Silent Voices incorporates the choristers’ own spoken-word texts as well as music commissioned from prominent composers like Nico Muhly, Paola Prestini, Toshi Reagon and the Pulitzer Prize winners Caroline Shaw and David Lang. The young people’s most important message? Listen.646-223-3010, newvictory.org URBAN WILDLIFE FESTIVAL in Highbridge Park (May 4, 1-4 p.m.). Although New York City’s most visible population is two-legged, plenty of four-footed friends share its streets and parks. The Urban Park Rangers, who are celebrating 40 years of public service, will serve as animal ambassadors at this free event, where they will show tortoises, a skunk, a porcupine and an opossum, as well as various birds of prey. Children can observe the creatures close up and learn the best places to spot them, as well as how to coexist with them safely. Young attendees can also enjoy music and games.212-304-2277, nycgovparks.org",The New York Times
2019,"Opinion | 80,000 Deaths. 2 Million Injuries. It’s Time for a Reckoning on Medical Devices.","Patients suffer as the F.D.A. fails to adequately screen or monitor products. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. When the Food and Drug Administration announced last month that it couldn’t guarantee the long-term safety and efficacy of vaginal mesh products — medical devices that have been on the market for decades — the collective response from tens of thousands of women harmed by the products sounded something like this: Duh. The mesh, which is used to hold pelvic organs in place when muscles become too weak to do the job, has long been tied to life-altering injuries, including nearly 80 deaths as of 2018. In the past decade, seven companies have spent a collective $8 billion to resolve more than 100,000 patient claims — making litigation over vaginal mesh (or pelvic mesh, as it is sometimes called) one of the largest mass tort cases in United States history. As those lawsuits have made clear, most of these medical devices were approved for market with nearly no clinical data. It seems incredible that products meant to reside inside the human body would be used on patients without any proof of safety or efficacy. But thanks to regulatory loopholes and lax oversight, most medical devices are poorly vetted before their release into the marketplace and poorly monitored after the fact. Problems can take years to emerge and can be impossible to correct, in part because permanent implants are not easily extracted from the body. (Removing mesh from pelvic tissue has been likened to removing chewing gum from long, thick hair). When trouble does arise, device makers often equivocate, regulators dither and patients seeking redress are forced into lengthy and expensive court battles. In the end, faulty products can remain on the market for years. The F.D.A. finally pulled the remaining vaginal mesh products off the market last month (although most companies had already stopped selling them because of all those lawsuits). But on Thursday, the agency said it would not ban a breast implant linked to a rare form of cancer and so many other side effects that doctors have coined a new term — “breast-implant illness.” Like mesh, the breast implant was approved years back, based on meager safety evidence. Regulators now say there is not enough proof of harm to justify reversing that decision. The risks of waiting loom large: In the past decade, nearly two million injuries and more than 80,000 deaths have been linked to faulty medical devices, many approved with little to no clinical testing, according to a global investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. Women are particularly well acquainted with this cycle. Essure, a permanent birth control device consisting of two metal coils injected into the fallopian tubes, has been linked to autoimmune disorders and more than 800 pregnancy losses. The product was pulled from the market last year —  by the device maker, which cited declining sales, not by the F.D.A. And the power morcellator — a spinning blade that shreds uterine tissue so it can be more easily extracted from the body — has proved deadly for some women, whose cancer was spread by the device. As The Times has reported, the morcellator was widely used for 20 years before regulators realized there was a problem. But that’s not to suggest that only women are affected: There have been metal hips that released poisonous debris into the body, implantable defibrillators that shock people at random (causing indescribable terror) and artificial heart valves with questionable shelf lives. In operating rooms, there have been staplers that misfire; temperature control machines that spray bacteria into open chest cavities; and robotic surgeons that slap, burn and, in some cases, maim patients. In every one of these cases, a combination of dubious regulatory approvals, skimpy post-market surveillance, and faltering responses from regulators caused irrevocable harm that might have been avoided. After searing investigations by journalists and patient advocates, the F.D.A. has promised to make “transformative” changes to medical device regulation. But so far, the agency’s suggestions have been meager at best. And in the meantime, regulators have accelerated the device approval process, not slowed it down. Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, head of the agency office in charge of device regulation, has suggested that the benefits of bringing innovative products to market quickly are worth the increased risks. It’s true that devices have restored hearing, vision and the ability to walk and have provided many other benefits to millions of people. But the drive to innovate does not justify the growing catalog of medical device disasters. Patients should not have to wonder whether devices will save their lives or destroy them. Reasonable changes could greatly improve the current system. Tighten approval standards. Regulatory loopholes — some of which date to the dawn of device regulation and were not meant to be permanent — enable companies to bring new or “updated” medical devices to market without testing them in human trials first. Companies need only to convince regulators that their products are similar to ones that are already approved, even if the other products are decades old or were subsequently pulled from the market. Eight years ago the Institute of Medicine advised the F.D.A. to abolish at least one of these loopholes, what’s known as the 510(k) pathway. It’s past time for the agency to heed that advice, and to ensure that no medical device intended for permanent residence inside a human body is used on patients without first being rigorously tested. Fix post-market surveillance: Industry proponents say that medical devices can be brought to market quickly and safely by having companies conduct rigorous testing after products go to market instead of beforehand. But companies often fail to complete such studies, even when they’re ordered by regulators. What’s more, device makers frequently skirt rules requiring them to report publicly all incidents of malfunction, injury or illness — often through mechanisms that the F.D.A. itself created. And after years of wrangling, the industry and its regulators have still not fully put a system in place to better notify patients of product recalls and other safety issues. The F.D.A. has vowed to fix some of these lapses. They’ve promised to abolish reporting exemptions — as detailed by Kaiser Health News — that keep safety issues hidden from the public and to promote breast implant registries that monitor patient outcomes. That’s a good start, but more can be done. An industry that prides itself on innovation, and earns some $400 billion in annual revenue, should be well equipped to build a global medical device registry where patient outcomes for all medical devices are openly monitored, and where doctors and patients can log concerns and obtain information. Loosen industry’s grip. Dr. Shuren reportedly referred to device makers, not consumers, as his office’s main customers at a recent industry gathering. As misguided as that statement may sound, he’s not wrong: The medical device industry funds 35 percent of the office’s work, and by law, that funding is contingent upon the agency’s approving devices quickly, and through the least restrictive pathway possible. It’s not solely those laws that give medical device makers influence over regulators. The industry maintains a well-oiled revolving door with the F.D.A. — as The Associated Press has noted, the last four people to hold Dr. Shuren’s position have gone on to lucrative industry gigs. Device makers also spent more than $300 million lobbying Congress in the decade ending in 2017, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. What’s more, they pay doctors and hospitals hundreds of millions in consulting fees every year, according to the National Center for Health Research. None of this violates any rule, but all of it contributes to the current crisis. Medical institutions and professional societies should establish, or amplify, guidelines discouraging such payments. Stronger laws that provide more funding for the work of device regulation — so that the F.D.A. is not as reliant on industry dollars — would also help the agency to fulfill its mission.

This week, Oberfelder concludes her trilogy examining the biological wonder and symbolic meanings of our bodies. In 2013, she focused on the heart in “4Chamber” and, in 2017, turned to the head in “The Brain Piece.” Her latest, “Madame Ovary,” explores gender and the anatomy of sex, using Flaubert’s “Madame Bovary” as a point of reference to track how far we have and have not come in conceptualizing gender and its social role. Oberfelder’s multimedia approach includes dance, film, spoken word and an original score by Missy Mazzoli. 212-226-0051, theflea.org PARSONS DANCE at the Joyce Theater (May 14-15, 7:30 p.m.; May 16-17, 8 p.m.; through May 26).

The participants are Daniel Lepkoff and Sakura Shimada, whose work explores the practice of physical communication; Kota Yamazaki, who performs a solo that references his recently completed “Darkness Odyssey” trilogy; and Doug LeCours, who does a duet with Anna Witenberg in which their bodies become atoms that attract, repel and collide. cathyweis.org VANGELINE THEATER at Theater for a New City (May 16-18, 8 p.m.; through May 19). Tatsumi Hijikata, a pioneer of the haunting postwar Japanese performance art butoh, once said, “Since the body itself perishes, it has a form. Butoh has another dimension.” That idea of disappearing and tapping into another realm was a catalyst for “ɪˈreɪʒə (Erasure)” by the New York-based butoh artist Vangeline. In the hourlong solo, she attempts to render herself symbolically invisible so as to allow room for women who have been erased throughout history. The intention, she writes in an artist statement, is that they may then “come back and dance through me.” 212-254-1109, theaterforthenewcity.net An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of Sunday on Broadway’s founder.

Jennifer Berry Hawes, an award-winning journalist for the Charleston-based Post and Courier, covered the tragedy extensively, and drew on her long relationships with the families in writing this book. “Hawes is a poised writer and a patient observer,” our critic Parul Sehgal writes. “Her primary interest is in the lives of the survivors and the families of the victims, ‘the people who will live this story forever.’” THE BRITISH ARE COMING: The War for America, Lexington to Princeton, 1775-1777, by Rick Atkinson. (Holt, $40.) This first volume in a planned trilogy offers a Tolstoyan perspective on the American Revolution, presenting a conflict that will be new to many readers, one that was ugly, savage and often barbaric. “To say that Atkinson can tell a story is like saying Sinatra can sing,” our reviewer, Joseph J. Ellis, writes. “Lurking behind all the assembled evidence, which Atkinson has somehow managed to read and digest in a remarkably short period of time, is a novelistic imagination that verges on the cinematic. Historians of the American Revolution take note. Atkinson is coming.” FEAST YOUR EYES, by Myla Goldberg. (Scribner, $28.) This ambitious novel about a pioneering midcentury photographer, facing obscenity charges for pictures of her half-dressed daughter, draws from the real-life careers of Sally Mann, Diane Arbus and Berenice Abbott. “Goldberg’s passionate depiction of Lillian rings heartbreakingly true at a moment when discussions of emotional labor dominate certain sectors of the media,” Joanna Rakoff writes in her review. “Though the novel’s plot hinges on the obscenity trial, its most powerful moments arrive in the form of Lillian’s wrenchingly intimate reflections in her journal, from devastating accounts of watching her daughter sleep to poignant descriptions of her artistic process.” THE OCTOPUS MUSEUM: Poems, by Brenda Shaughnessy. (Knopf, $25.) In her capacious fifth collection, Shaughnessy turns largely to prose poems to envision a near future ravaged by climate change, in which humans have wrecked the environment and ceded control of their destiny to “the Octopodes,” a conglomerate of semi-benevolent cephalopods. “If they are often bleak, Shaughnessy’s poems are also very funny,” Elisa Gabbert writes in her review, identifying the book’s central question as what we owe our children and humanity writ large. “Shaughnessy can also write the kind of line that is confusing in its beauty, whose beauty exceeds its sense, which is the thing I go to poetry for — lines that can be read and reread without exhausting their potential meaning.” THE FARM, by Joanne Ramos. (Random House, $27.) Ramos’s debut novel imagines what might happen were surrogacy taken to its high-capitalist extreme: Clients pay for “hosts” to carry their children, and those hosts move to a facility named Golden Oaks for the duration of their pregnancies. The book follows four women in what amounts to a group portrait of female striving — for survival, for status, for purpose. “‘The Farm’ may be an ‘issue’ book, but it wears the mantle lightly,” our reviewer, Jen McDonald, writes. “Ambiguity may be the point. Ramos’s characters articulate both sides of the surrogacy argument.” SWIFT: New and Selected Poems, by David Baker. (Norton, $26.95.) Covering nearly 40 years of work, this career retrospective reveals Baker as a peerless poet of the natural world who never stops trying to see things as if for the first time. “Transience and interconnectedness are his big themes,” Eric McHenry writes in his review. “All of Baker’s poems are rich in observation, imagination and memory. … In his best poems, generously represented here, he builds something lovely and durable from that brokenness.” A WOMAN OF NO IMPORTANCE: The Untold Story of the American Spy Who Helped Win World War II, by Sonia Purnell. (Viking, $28.) You’ve probably never heard of Virginia Hall, the coolheaded, one-legged operative who infiltrated Vichy France, but her story deserves to be celebrated. Purnell’s excellent biography should help make that happen. “If Virginia Hall herself remains something of an enigma — a testament, perhaps, to the skills that allowed her to live in the shadows for so long — the extraordinary facts of her life are brought onto the page here with a well-judged balance of empathy and fine detail,” Mick Herron writes in his review. “This book is as riveting as any thriller, and as hard to put down.” GHOSTS OF GOLD MOUNTAIN: The Epic Story of the Chinese Who Built the Transcontinental Railroad, by Gordon H. Chang. (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $28.) A work of history and remembrance, bringing to light the arduous and often tragic work of Chinese immigrants on America’s transcontinental railroad. “While the contours of this history may be familiar, the lived experience of the Railroad Chinese has long been elusive, partly because no sources written in their own hand survive,” Andrew Graybill notes in his review. “Chang thus looks elsewhere for information about their daily lives — how they dressed, what they ate, when they rested — making use of photographs and material objects, in addition to newspaper accounts and business records. From this intrepid research, a composite portrait begins to emerge.” THE COOK, by Maylis de Kerangal. Translated by Sam Taylor. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $20.) The protagonist of de Kerangal’s latest novel is a preternaturally talented young chef learning his craft. Nancy Kline, reviewing the book alongside two other French novels, calls it “slim, bountiful, beautifully written and gorgeously translated. … De Kerangal takes us through different kitchens, geographies and individuals in the life of young Mauro, whose art is profoundly social (cooking is completed in other people’s mouths) yet whose gift isolates him.” The novel’s “intimate yet distant narrative voice,” Kline adds, “reflects the human condition itself.”",The New York Times
2019,9 New Books We Recommend This Week,"Editors’ Choice The other day, comparing notes on the books that have kept us company lately, some of us realized that things had somehow taken a very sinister turn. (Murder, extinction, bubonic plague and “The Handmaid’s Tale.” And we weren’t even asking Marilyn “I’m down with cannibals” Stasio.) Consider this week’s list of recommended titles a kind of penance, then. It’s May, after all, and in this part of the world the trees have started budding and the birds that aren’t extinct have started singing. What better time to read Ali Smith’s novel “Spring,” which balances its political anxieties with emotional complexity and a warmth appropriate to the season? Continuing with fiction, you might pick up Stewart O’Nan’s character study “Henry, Himself,” or settle in with Julie Orringer’s historical novel “The Flight Portfolio,” about Varian Fry’s exploits saving dissidents from the Nazis. Jennifer duBois is back, with a novel about a talk-show host who goes too far, and Laila Lalami sets her latest novel in the towns of the Mojave Desert, where a hit-and-run death ties together the stories of nine very different characters. The more-or-less-good vibes continue in nonfiction, with Paul Mendes-Flohr’s consideration of the great religious philosopher Martin Buber; Oliver Sacks’s vivacious final essays; Sheri Berman’s cleareyed analysis of European democracy and its fitful gains; and a look back at the 2008 financial crisis by the economists who did most to save us from the brink of disaster. Just don’t ask them about the future. Gregory CowlesSenior Editor, BooksTwitter: @GregoryCowles SPRING, by Ali Smith. (Pantheon, $25.95.) “Spring” is the third novel in a projected seasonal cycle that began with “Autumn” in 2017 and continued last year with “Winter.” It is largely about Richard, a filmmaker in his late 60s, an old lefty trying to make sense of the new world. “This is the most political book thus far in this earthy and humane series,” our critic Dwight Garner writes. “Its heart is worn far out on its sleeve. It beats arrhythmically somewhere down near the knuckles.” THE FLIGHT PORTFOLIO, by Julie Orringer. (Knopf, $28.95.) Orringer dramatizes the story of Varian Fry, the real-life journalist who in World War II rescued more than 2,000 European dissidents and artists. In addition to recounting his daring work, the novel also delves into Fry’s inner life, giving him a back story that likewise involves chasing and elusion. Our reviewer, Cynthia Ozick, calls it a “sympathetic and prodigiously ambitious novel” and applauds Orringer’s feel for the period: “Her landscapes regularly rise to a Keatsian sensuousness. Her Marseille breathes as a city breathes.” THE SPECTATORS, by Jennifer duBois. (Random House, $27.) This satirical novel, set in the heyday of afternoon talk shows, charts the woes of a confrontational TV host who may have inspired a mass shooting. Filled with small accumulating pleasures, the book offers readers a peek at television’s grimier specifics. “What a good surprise it is,” Ken Tucker writes in his review, to “read a novel about a TV star that feels just right. … DuBois’s mastery of such details earns our trust as she expands “The Spectators” into a billowing meditation on the responsibility of public figures to contribute something worthwhile to the culture. Although her book takes place decades ago, duBois’s message has a contemporary urgency as well.” HENRY, HIMSELF, by Stewart O’Nan. (Viking, $27.) A novel that uses short vignettes to capture a year in the life of the Pittsburgh man whose shadow loomed over two of O’Nan’s earlier novels. Most of us know people like Henry from the outside; the gift of O’Nan’s fiction is to immerse us deeply in his essence. “This is a novel that charms not through the complexities of its plot but through its subtle revelations of character and the human condition,” Dominic Smith writes in his review. FIREFIGHTING: The Financial Crisis and Its Lessons, by Ben S. Bernanke, Timothy F. Geithner and Henry M. Paulson Jr. (Penguin, paper, $16.) Three of the officials most responsible for dealing with the 2008 financial crisis explain what they got right, what they got wrong and the reforms they believe are still needed. “Most of the book is concerned with the increasingly desperate efforts … to prop up financial dominoes before they could topple and collapse the whole system,” our reviewer (and Op-Ed columnist) Paul Krugman writes. One of its scarier conclusions, he says, is that “we seem to have learned the wrong lessons from our brush with disaster. As a result, when the next crisis comes, it’s likely to play out even worse than the last one.” THE OTHER AMERICANS, by Laila Lalami. (Pantheon, $25.95.) The violent death of a Moroccan immigrant in a California desert town entangles a diverse cast of characters — his widow, his daughters, a detective, an Iraq war vet and an undocumented worker — in this timely and eloquent novel, Lalami’s fourth. The title “perfectly sums up a unified disunity: an America suspicious of its own body politic,” Madeleine Thien writes in her review. “With each chapter narrated by a different character, the novel feels fascinatingly encased in a superstructure made of glass. Much can be seen, but the world is crucially divided.” EVERYTHING IN ITS PLACE: First Loves and Last Tales, by Oliver Sacks. (Knopf, $26.95.) In this last, posthumous book, a collection of previously uncollected and/or unpublished essays, Sacks’s lens expands from memoir and clinical tales to a helter-skeltering of topics. “Life bursts through all of Oliver Sacks’s writing,” our reviewer, Daniel Menaker, writes. “He was and will remain a brilliant singularity. It’s hard to call to mind one dull passage in his work — one dull sentence, for that matter.” MARTIN BUBER: A Life of Faith and Dissent, by Paul Mendes-Flohr. (Yale University, $26.) Buber was one of the greatest religious thinkers of the 20th century. This intellectual history describes his powerful commitment to dialogue, and the need to recognize the authenticity and legitimacy of the other whom we address. Our reviewer, Robert Alter, writes that “Mendes-Flohr, a distinguished scholar of German-Jewish intellectual life, has written a scrupulously researched, perceptive biography of Buber that evinces an authoritative command of all the contexts through which Buber moved.” DEMOCRACY AND DICTATORSHIP IN EUROPE: From the Ancien Régime to the Present Day, by Sheri Berman. (Oxford University, $34.95.) The progress of European democracy, this history shows, has been less a steady march than a series of faltering steps in which gains are often followed by losses. “Berman makes the case clearly and convincingly,” Max Strasser writes in his review. “Moreover, at a moment when hyperventilating over the decline of democracy has grown into a veritable intellectual industry, her long-view approach comes across as appealingly sober.”",The New York Times

2019,9 Things We Still Want to Know Now That ‘Game of Thrones’ Is Over,"This article contains spoilers for the series finale of “Game of Thrones.” We couldn’t expect every question to be answered, every subplot to be resolved, every character to get a proper goodbye. But Sunday’s “Game of Thrones” finale certainly tried to tie a bow on as much of the story as possible. Still, a lot of questions were left unanswered — fodder, perhaps, for any “Game of Thrones” sequels that may arise in addition to the prequels. (Arya west of Westeros? John north of the North?) Here are a few we’re still wondering about. [Read the recap of the “Game of Thrones” series finale.] “There’s still a Night’s Watch?” Jon Snow asked Tyrion when he learned he was being banished to the Wall. Fair question. The White Walkers are wiped out. The wildlings are allies. The Wall is destroyed near Eastwatch, and the various castles along the Wall are unmanned. Is there any point in restoring them? Eastwatch at least, given its seaside location, could be rebuilt as a port town and trading center. In any case, it’s not entirely clear what someone sentenced to the Night’s Watch might be required to do. What is its function now beyond leading the Free Folk home? We got to see Ned Stark’s companion Howland Reed only in the Tower of Joy flashback, and we heard about his legendary exploits only when Bran Stark discussed them with the Three-Eyed Raven and the Reed siblings. What happened to that guy? In addition to being one of the few people in Westeros who knows Jon Snow’s true parentage (not from a vision, but from lived history), Lord Reed is also a loyal vassal to House Stark — so loyal that his children, Jojen and Meera, risked their lives to help Bran on his mystical journey. And yet House Reed was absent from the discussions about defending Winterfell, and it hasn’t been heard from since Bran brushed off Meera with barely a thank you. We’re still wondering about Jojen’s visions, which suggested a fiery exit for Bran and Meera: “This isn’t the end,” he said. “Not for you. Not yet.” [Fans of ‘Game of Thrones’ griped about the finale’s pointy end.] Very late in the game, we got a brief mention from Varys that there was a new prince of Dorne. But who is he? How did he come to power when all the men in the Martell line were thought to have been assassinated by Ellaria Sand and the Sand Snakes? That’s true of all the men mentioned in the show. But there are more in the books, among them Quentyn Martell. Since the show didn’t properly identify this new prince, are we expected to assume that it’s Quentyn? Varys never got to learn what the voice in the flames said when a sorcerer used his body parts in a magical ritual. Kinvara once offered to tell him, but never did. And now we’ll never know. We never really got to visit many of the places in this world, but of the few we did, it would have been nice to learn what happened to a few of the locals we met along the way. In Pentos, for example, did Illyrio Mopatis, who hosted Viserys and Dany in Season 1 and Varys and Tyrion in Season 5, regret supporting a Targaryen restoration? In Qarth, did Quaithe, who seemed to have the power of premonition, ever take one last mystic look at Dany? In Braavos, did Jaqen H’ghar, who taught Arya much of her craft, ever hear about the exploits of his favorite pupil? In Meereen, did Daario Naharis succeed in keeping the peace, despite having no real interest in doing so? Did Salladhor Saan ever recover the ships that Stannis borrowed? So many of these ancillary characters and their subplots were discarded by the show as it narrowed its focus and lost interest in the lands across the Narrow Sea. Back in Season 6, Arya wondered, “What’s west of Westeros?” and now that is her destination. Anything across the Sunset Sea is uncharted territory. The only known voyage there in the books was led by Elissa Farman, whom Dany had to thank for her dragon eggs, which Elissa stole from Dreamfyre to finance her trip. Elissa long believed that there were undiscovered lands west of Westeros, and her crew first sailed south by southwest and found three exotic islands. She then headed west and was never seen again. Her ship, however, was spotted many years later in Asshai, which suggested that it might be possible to reach Essos by sailing west from Westeros. Perhaps one of the prequel successor shows will clear this up. Or maybe Arya will get her own spinoff. Despite not having mentioned his wife for many years, Davos is still a married man as far as we know. Effectively, he abandoned his wife to go off to war with Stannis, then with Jon Snow, then with Dany. But did he return home to her after the Battle of Blackwater to share her grief over the death of their only son? No. Before he joined Stannis in Braavos, did he send a raven to let his wife know when he’d be home (and perhaps surprise her with his newly acquired literacy)? No. When Jon Snow first took him to Dragonstone to meet with Dany, did Davos ask that they take a slight detour so he could check in at home? No. (Although he did find time to flirt with Missandei.) In all his travels back and forth across the continent, did Davos express concern for his wife at all? No. Isn’t it strange that a man who cares so deeply for others — treating Shireen like a daughter, Gendry like a son — never brings up his own family? We can only imagine the reception when he finally goes home. Among his many exploits, Sam Tarly killed a White Walker, and then a Thenn, and then stole several books from the restricted section of the Citadel library. Did the maesters ever notice they were missing? Will he face any repercussions for this theft? Did becoming grand maester erase his late fees? Also, if Sam helped Archmaester Ebrose write “The Chronicles of the Wars Following the Death of King Robert I,” now titled “A Song of Ice and Fire,” why wouldn’t Tyrion be mentioned? It seems that much of what we’ve learned about the true history of Westeros may remain hidden from its people. The baker at the Inn at the Crossroads knows how to bring people together. Will he ever get to play the game of scones?",The New York Times
2019,9 Things to Do With Your Kids in N.Y.C. This Weekend,"Our guide to cultural events in New York City for children and teenagers happening this weekend and in the week ahead. CARNIVAL AND SCIENCE SPECTACULAR at the Staten Island Children’s Museum (June 1, 1-5 p.m.). What do amusement park rides have to do with science education? That’s easy: They allow you to experience the laws of physics directly. But such entertainments are only part of the fun at this annual museum fund-raiser. This year’s event will also include robotics teams, a solar-operated racecar, a mobile STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) wagon and Mad Science’s chemistry show “Spin, Pop … Boom!” You can also expect the clowns Watson and Christine to demonstrate science’s sillier side.718-273-2060, sichildrensmuseum.org JACKSON GALAXY’S CAT CAMP at the Metropolitan Pavilion (June 1, 10 a.m.-7 p.m.; June 2, 9:30 a.m.-6 p.m.). This is not a place where you can leave your feline friends to make lanyards and toast s’mores. It is, however, a place where pet lovers can make kitten condos and learn the secrets of cat behavior from experts like Galaxy, known for his television show “My Cat From Hell.” Although some special events are already sold out, general admission tickets will still get you entry to a feline adoption center (both days) and more than 20 presentations, including the child-friendly Telling Your Cat’s Story (on improving your photography and video skills, on Saturday) and the Science of a Happy Cat (on Sunday). Young visitors ages 9 to 15, when accompanied by an adult, can also register for Saturday’s cat yoga sessions, which include 25 minutes of playtime with kittens. (A full schedule is on the website.)catcampnyc.com ‘IOLANTHE’ at the Riverside Theater (May 30, 7 p.m.; June 1, 11 a.m.). It’s not easy to find opera productions whose casts are made up entirely of children, but Amore Opera takes this bold step every year, often adjusting keys and harmonies for young voices. Now this small company is closing the season with a 90-minute version of Gilbert and Sullivan’s “Iolanthe,” performed by and for kids. A work in which the worlds of fairies and politicians meet — and, not surprisingly, collide — this comic love story is also a cautionary tale about not jumping to conclusions.866-811-4111, amoreopera.org KIDSFILMFEST at the Made in NY Media Center by IFP (June 1, 1 p.m.). You can always count on this show of short films to feature unusual characters. This year’s slate of a dozen works includes Don DiNicola’s “Space Germ,” which follows the journey of a micro-organism; Barbara Brunner’s “Miles Away,” in which the protagonist’s best friend is a tree; and Chadwick Whitehead’s “Gum and Sauce Go to Skill School,” whose heroes are just what the title says. Part of the otherwise grown-up Brooklyn Film Festival, the event also offers works by unusual directors, like American schoolchildren and the Australian teenager James Baras-Miller, who is returning with the further adventures of his cinematic villain, Octavius, a teddy bear. Children can meet some of the filmmakers in a post-screening Q. and A., as well as examine some of their materials, like storyboards.kidsfilmfest.org MEET THE FISHES at the River Project Wetlab, Pier 40 (June 4, 4-7 p.m.). Although you may not be able to shake hands with the creatures at this get-acquainted event, you can certainly touch some of them. Sponsored by the River Project, a marine science station in the West Village, Meet the Fishes signals the start of seasonal research. Children can go on tours of the Wetlab’s river water aquarium; view plankton under a microscope; observe a living, growing oyster reef; and reach into a touch tank to handle crabs, snails and other invertebrates gently. The celebration will offer refreshments and raffles, as well as visits by special guests: diamondback terrapin turtles, from the Turtle Conservancy, and Big, a nearly two-pound oyster that is the largest found in New York Harbor in a century.212-233-3030, riverprojectnyc.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] READING INTO HISTORY FAMILY BOOK CLUB (June 1, 2-4 p.m.) and LIVING HISTORY: MEET SYLVIA RIVERA (June 1-2 and 29, noon-4 p.m.) at the New-York Historical Society. Children can easily identify with protesting, yet they may not be aware of some of the protests that have had more than familial rules at stake. These programs at the society’s DiMenna Children’s History Museum focus on activists, one fictional and one real. On Saturday, the book club, geared toward ages 9 to 12, will host a discussion with the author Ellen Klages, who this year won the society’s Children’s History Book Prize for her novel “Out of Left Field.” Klages’s heroine, Katy Gordon, battles a decision to bar her from joining Little League in 1957 because she’s a girl. In Living History, the actor and educator Summer Minerva will portray Sylvia Rivera, a transgender gay rights advocate who participated in the 1969 Stonewall uprising. In honor of Pride Month, Minerva will recall Stonewall, deliver one of Rivera’s speeches and answer questions about Rivera’s life.212-873-3400, nyhistory.org TEENS TAKE THE MET! at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (May 31, 5-8 p.m.). There’s nothing hostile about this takeover. Held twice a year, these free festivities welcome adolescents — attendees must be 13 to 18, with a school ID — to occupy the museum for an evening of workshops, performances, demonstrations and exploration. As always, some programs relate to the museum’s exhibitions: In conjunction with “Camp: Notes on Fashion,” teenagers can design totes and participate in vogueing workshops.

Most of us have been to science fairs, but this annual extravaganza is far from typical: In addition to intriguing exhibits, it offers young people opportunities to collaborate with professional researchers. This year, some of the apprenticeship programs haven’t yet sold out — students in Grades 5 through 8 can still apply to work with agricultural scientists, a genetic counselor and a biologist — and even younger enthusiasts can attend Cool Jobs, where, for instance, they’ll learn what it takes to investigate swarm behavior in insects or the effects of music on human emotions. The festival also offers free presentations, like Women in Science: Lab Tours for Girls, which will take participants (registration is required) into the work spaces of female scientists at N.Y.U. The other free events include the Great Fish Count, a daylong project to document local species; Saturday Night Lights: Stargazing in Brooklyn Bridge Park, a chance to commune and observe with astrophysicists; Science and Storytime, a presentation of children’s book authors; and City of Science, the huge concluding exposition.

2019,Opinion | A $40 Million Experiment,"The larger meaning of the surprise Morehouse gift. Opinion Columnist This article is part of David Leonhardt’s newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday. “This could be the start of what’s known in Econ as a ‘natural experiment,’” Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Sunday, referring to the announcement that a billionaire would wipe out the student debt of every graduating senior at Morehouse College this year. “Follow these students & compare their life choices [with] their peers over the next 10-15 years.” It’s a great point. Ocasio-Cortez supports ideas like free four-year college and universal debt forgiveness. Other people (including me) are more skeptical, arguing that such plans disproportionately benefit the affluent. But much of the debate is unavoidably theoretical. No one knows exactly how a universal debt forgiveness program would really play out. Maybe it would be a big handout to future financiers, lawyers and software engineers and wouldn’t have much influence on the careers that college graduates chose. Or maybe it would free many more people to enter professions that they would prefer, if only they didn’t have to pay off their loans. Likewise, no one knows how much student debt affects other decisions, like retirement savings and homeownership. [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] The Morehouse gift — from Robert F. Smith, a technology investor — is too small (and non-random) to answer these questions definitively. But it will likely offer some insight. “Smith is, in addition to helping individual students, funding the biggest test of the effects of student loan forgiveness we’ve seen to date,” Dylan Matthews of Vox wrote yesterday. “That enables economists (like those at Morehouse, perhaps) to conduct an analysis 10-15 years from now comparing the incomes, indebtedness, graduate attainment, etc. of members of the class of 2019 to those of the classes of 2018 and 2020.” I remain doubtful that universal debt forgiveness is the best use of government resources, because I think it’s too skewed toward the upper middle class. But I’m open to the idea that it will have bigger, more positive effects than I expect — and open to changing my opinion if so. Related: “A lone billionaire — or a gaggle of billionaires — will never be enough to solve our growing student loan debt crisis,” Issac Bailey writes for CNN. “We should celebrate what Smith did, not just for those 400 Morehouse students, but for the rest of us. He laid bare how we got here — and how far away we are from righting the ship.” Anand Giridharadas says that if Smith truly cared about inequality, he would do more than give a roughly $40 million gift. He would stop supporting a tax loophole that benefits him and other wealthy investors. “An affordable college education should not require an act of largess,” writes The Times editorial board. “It should not require our applause. It merely requires adequate public investment, funded by equitable taxation.” If you are not a subscriber to this newsletter, you can subscribe here.

2019,"A Ballot Measure Could Help Los Angeles Schools, but Will Voters Support It?","California Today Good morning. (Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.) Today, we have an update on the Los Angeles teachers’ strike, part of a series of protests by educators that have rippled across the state this year. The dispatch comes from my colleague, Jennifer Medina: When L.A. teachers went on strike earlier this year, public opinion seemed to swing in their favor. Drivers honked enthusiastically when they passed by schools crowded with protests, presidential candidates backed the teachers’ demands, and celebrities took it as an opportunity to decry longstanding underfunding of California public schools. The strike ended with a deal brokered by Mayor Eric Garcetti to cap class sizes and hire more nurses, librarians and counselors at schools throughout the district. Now comes the test: Are taxpayers willing to fork over more money for the Los Angeles Unified School District with a parcel tax? The agreement between the teachers’ union and school district officials relied on finding an additional $403 million to pay for the plan. Despite California’s liberal reputation, the state lags far behind other states in education spending. And while school officials continue to press Sacramento to increase funding, several school districts have approved local tax increases to pay for public schools. Getting voters to the polls can be difficult in the best of circumstances. It may prove herculean next Tuesday, when Measure EE — as the 16-cents-per-square-foot parcel tax is officially called — is the only issue on the ballot. The measure would generate $6 billion for Los Angeles schools in the next 12 years. In addition to the teachers’ union and the mayor, the ballot measure has attracted support from presidential candidates. But the Chamber of Commerce and the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association have aggressively campaigned against it, saying the school system needs to manage existing funding better. Conventional wisdom suggests that the higher the turnout, the more likely Measure EE will win. Alex Caputo-Pearl, the president of United Teachers Los Angeles, said the union had been “knocking doors every day” to get homeowners’ support. If Measure EE fails, it is unlikely that the district can stick with the promises made amid the strike deal. “In the short term if it doesn’t pass we’re looking at the status quo,” said Yusef Robb, a spokesman for the Yes on EE campaign. “Shortly thereafter it will give way to cuts. When you have 46 kids in a classroom how much further can you go?” (We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

On Tuesday, though, presumably to tide over diners hungry to try Michelin-anointed eats, the organization released its list of 151 Bib Gourmand restaurants from Sacramento to San Diego, where you can get meals of at least two courses, plus a glass of wine or a dessert, for $40 or less. In other words, it’s a neat resource if your budget doesn’t permit you to drop $300 for dinner with any regularity. The only other catch is that if you’re on the Bib Gourmand list, you can’t also be starred. Which means speculation has begun. California Today goes live at 6:30 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

2019,A Basketball Homecoming for Canada,"Canada Letter About an hour before the start of the N.B.A. finals on Thursday night, Commissioner Adam Silver arrived for his pregame news conference and offered a history lesson. [Want more Canada coverage in your inbox? Sign up for the Canada Letter newsletter.] Silver reminded the assembled reporters that Dr. James Naismith, who invented basketball, was originally from Ontario. He also noted that the first N.B.A. game took place in Toronto, at the old Maple Leaf Gardens, in November 1946. The New York Knickerbockers defeated the Toronto Huskies, 68-66. Yes, believe or not, the Knicks won a game. And sure, the Huskies folded one year later. But that was all beside the point. “This,” Silver said, “is a homecoming of sorts for basketball in Canada.” A homecoming because the finals are in Toronto — and in Canada — for the first time, with the Raptors taking on the two-time defending champion Golden State Warriors. I’m Scott Cacciola, an N.B.A. reporter for The Times. Since coming on board in 2013, I’ve been casually (and sometimes not so casually) watching the growth of basketball in Canada. It’s become hugely popular thanks to a number of factors: more opportunities for children to play the game, an international push made by the league, the fact that virtually anyone with an internet connection can watch N.B.A. games anytime they want. The game has gone global, and Toronto has become something of a basketball hub. It’s gotten to the point where more top N.B.A. draft picks are coming out of Toronto than nearly any other North American city. Not to be overlooked, though, is the impact of the Raptors themselves, who arrived on the scene in 1995 and have slowly built a huge following that ranges from Nav Bhatia, a car salesman and self-described Raptors “Superfan” whom I profiled a couple of seasons ago, to the rapper Drake. In addition to sitting courtside for games at Scotiabank Arena, where he regularly gets under the skin of opponents, Drake even has an official role with the organization: global ambassador. But the team has helped legitimize the sport in a city that, for so long, has been synonymous with hockey. On Thursday, during a break between the first and second quarters, a bunch of retired Raptors were introduced to roars of appreciation from the crowd — players like Morris Peterson, Chris Bosh, Tracy McGrady and Dell Curry, a former shooting guard whose son Stephen now stars for the Warriors. (Worth noting: A young Stephen Curry dominated opponents for his Toronto-area middle school while his dad was playing for the Raptors toward the end of his career.) Meanwhile, in an area outside the arena, thousands of fans had packed the aptly named “Jurassic Park” for a huge watch party. Many had lined up since the morning, just so they could view a broadcast of the game together on giant screens. It was another sign of how much the Raptors mean to the city, and how firmly entrenched the game is here. Of course, the Raptors’ run to the finals has been especially rewarding for fans because of the team’s tortured postseason history. For years, the Raptors had fallen short of reaching the finals — in large part because they kept running into LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference playoffs. But James’s decision to join the Los Angeles Lakers last summer opened the door for the Raptors, and they capitalized. The question going forward is whether the Raptors can keep their roster intact. Kawhi Leonard, their star forward, will be a free agent this summer with his choice of suitors. On Thursday, though, none of that mattered as the Raptors stormed to a 118-109 victory in Game 1 of the best-of-seven series. You can follow our full coverage of the series here, and through my colleague Marc Stein’s N.B.A. newsletter.

2019,A Battered but Unbowed Justin Trudeau Vows to Stay the Course in Canada,"OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada has a simple strategy for winning re-election: Ignore the plummeting polls, defend his record and push back against detractors. Despite months of criticism over his handling of a corporate criminal case and treatment of a female cabinet minister — and continuing pressure over his environmental and energy policies — he is not paring back or changing course. “I feel I’ve been true to the values that I hold to, the way I try to look at things,” he said in a recent interview in his newly renovated parliamentary office. “I’m under no illusions that if you actually want to do things, there are going to be people in agreement and disagreement with you on everything.” But a lot of Canadians are disagreeing with him these days, as he has tried to navigate between his ambitious social priorities and economic pragmatism. [Want more Canada coverage in your inbox? Sign up for the Canada Letter newsletter.] Mr. Trudeau took office four years ago with promises to take strong action on climate change, reconcile with the country’s Indigenous population for past wrongs and promote equality for women and minorities. He tried to balance these efforts with economic measures — for example, imposing a nationwide carbon tax but also buying a pipeline in western Canada to give the region’s energy industry a boost. Often, Mr. Trudeau acknowledged in the interview, compromises like this have disappointed some supporters. He also tried to balance priorities in the corruption case involving SNC-Lavalin, a major Montreal engineering company that was accused of bribery in Libya during the rule of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. While Canada had met international commitments to penalize companies involved in corruption overseas, Mr. Trudeau pressed his former justice minister — improperly, she said — to seek a civil penalty in the SNC-Lavalin case. He said he was worried that a criminal conviction, which would bar the company from government contracts, would jeopardize thousands of Canadian jobs. After saturation coverage of the case in the news media, Mr. Trudeau’s polls, which once seemed to defy gravity, have tumbled downward. His Liberal party now trails the Conservatives, and most voters disapprove of Mr. Trudeau’s job performance. Andrew Scheer, the Conservative leader who called for Mr. Trudeau’s resignation soon after the controversy erupted, has repeatedly described it as “corruption on top of corruption on top of corruption.” Even people who flatly reject that view acknowledge that Mr. Trudeau must overcome questions about his political leadership and skills. “The prime minister has frankly looked like he’s lost his mojo,” said Peter Donolo, who was director of communications for Liberal Prime Minister Jean Chrétien and is now vice chairman of the Canada division of the public relations and lobbying firm Hill and Knowlton Canada. “He’s looked tentative and off-key,” Mr. Donolo added. Mr. Trudeau’s friends say the onslaught of recriminations has inspired him to fight harder. Marc Miller, a Liberal member of Parliament from Montreal and a friend of Mr. Trudeau’s since they were classmates at an elite private high school in that city, said the prime minister was not a pushover even if part of his political style was to emphasize consensus building. Pointing out that Mr. Trudeau was introduced to boxing as a child by his father, Mr. Miller said: “He likes the one-on-one confrontation. He likes being tested.” “He also likes winning,” Mr. Miller said. That attitude was on full display in the interview. Buying the pipeline when its American owner was balking at expansion plans was “what I felt was the best thing for Canadians,” the prime minister said. His dispute with Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former justice minister, over SNC-Lavalin was “a disagreement in perspective” and overblown, Mr. Trudeau said, adding that he was confident “that Canadians, as we approach this election, are going to stay focused on the big things that matter.” [The Trump administration has reached agreements with Canada and Mexico to lift import tariffs on metals, resolving a yearlong standoff.] Yet Mr. Trudeau has not been completely immune to pressure. In March, in response to a public backlash against growing numbers of asylum seekers walking across the border from the United States, he announced plans to cut off the flow. And the opposition has seized on his weaknesses, already running attack ads. One Conservative ad suggests that Mr. Trudeau is as mired in “scandal” and “cover-ups” as President Trump, who is deeply unpopular in Canada. Andrew MacDougall, who was communications director for Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper, said the SNC-Lavalin episode severely undermined Mr. Trudeau’s claim to be someone who does politics differently. “People do care that leaders are open, transparent and honest,” Mr. MacDougall said from London, where he is now a consultant. As the son of former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Justin Trudeau was a celebrity from the time he was born on Christmas Day in 1971. And soon after coming into office, he, like his father before him, became that rarest of things: a Canadian prime minister whose name doesn’t provoke blank stares in other countries. He won attention and praise for welcoming large numbers of Syrian refugees to Canada, for forming a gender-balanced cabinet, and for taking bold steps in imposing a carbon tax, increasing taxes on the rich while cutting those on the middle class, and legalizing physician-assisted deaths as well as recreational marijuana. During his tenure, unemployment has dropped to its lowest level in decades. He built schools and set up new health systems in Indigenous areas, and announced an inquiry into the large number of Indigenous women and girls who have vanished or been murdered. Mr. Trump created a major political and economic challenge for Mr. Trudeau by demanding a new North American Free Trade Agreement. But the American leader’s personal attacks on Mr. Trudeau bolstered his standing at home, as did ultimately reaching a new trade deal. On Friday, Mr. Trudeau announced that he had reached a deal to end Mr. Trump’s tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum that does not involve any substantive concessions from Canada. At the beginning of this year, Mr. Trudeau’s record, combined with flagging ratings for the leaders of the two major opposition parties, made it appear that he was on a glide path to win October’s vote. Then came SNC-Lavalin. And Canadians begin to question not only his leadership, but also his feminist credentials and commitment to self-proclaimed open, “sunny ways” in politics. Ms. Wilson-Raybould, who was also the attorney general, portrayed her interactions with the prime minister and his office as an assault on prosecutorial independence. But many came to believe that Mr. Trudeau and mostly male aides had ganged up on her in another example of men ignoring women who speak their minds. Mr. Trudeau expressed regret over the controversy, which led to Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s resignation as well as that of another female minister in solidarity. When asked why he did not apologize, Mr. Trudeau said the answer was simple: He hadn’t done anything wrong. “There was a disagreement in perspective that was real and genuine,” he said. “I regret that it all happened. But there can’t be an apology, there can’t be a genuine apology, when I genuinely do not think that in that disagreement she was right and I was wrong.” He said the decision to seek a settlement had been left with Ms. Wilson-Raybould, who ultimately rejected the idea. Still, Mr. Trudeau acknowledged that the episode had prompted him to change how he deals with his cabinet ministers and other members of his Liberal caucus. His objective now, he said, is to allow anyone with a concern “to actually articulate that to me, and quicker, so we can respond to it rather than let it sort of fester the way apparently it did here.” Mr. Miller, his friend, said the prime minister had learned that it was important to be open “to a number of voices that you don’t necessarily want to hear but you have to for your own development.” “In that sense he’s grown as a leader, and that’s a pretty recent development,” Mr. Miller said. Mr. Trudeau is also fighting back against his critics, for example, threatening to sue Mr. Scheer, for suggesting that he acted criminally. “The fact that he has been doing that and thinks he can get away with that is one of those things that we have to push back against,” Mr. Trudeau said. As he looked back on a winter that turned him from front-runner to underdog, Mr. Trudeau predicted that by October the nation’s political focus will have returned to what he called “the big things, whether it’s environment or climate or growth for the middle class.” Rejecting any suggestion that with several provinces having swung from left-of-center governments to ones led by conservatives, liberalism is on the wane in Canada or the rest of the world, Mr. Trudeau pointed out that he was followed to power by ideologically sympathetic leaders in France, Spain and New Zealand. “There were good moments and tough moments,” he said of the election year’s rocky start. “But ultimately the opportunity to make a meaningful, positive difference in Canadians’ lives with what we do every day here is just unbelievably gratifying and worth it for all the guff you have to go through.”",The New York Times
2019,"Opinion | A Battle in Falluja, Revisited","Opinion Official documents can never tell us the whole story of war. Marines in Falluja, 2004.CreditCreditAshley Gilbertson/VII, for The New York Times Mr. Ackerman is a writer and former Marine. This is the 15th Memorial Day since the battle of Falluja in late 2004, in which 82 American service members died. The battle was a key operation at the outset of the Iraq War and resulted in the fiercest urban combat since the battle for Hue in Vietnam in 1968. I fought in that battle in Iraq, leading First Platoon, Alpha Company, 1st Battalion, Eighth Marine Regiment, and two years later, on a clear January day in Camp Lejeune, I was awarded a medal. My entire family came for the occasion. Our infantry battalion stood in formation while the adjutant for the Second Marine Division read a citation. Most of the Marines I’d fought alongside weren’t there — they’d moved on, to civilian life, to other postings — but a few remained. I searched for their faces, but lost them in the ranks. I was handed the citation and the more detailed “summary of action,” the official story of what happened. When I look at that account now I see gaps. I want to add things, details that a formal government account could never capture, personal reflections that fill the spaces between the lines. So that is what I’ve done, in boldfaced passages from the summary of action, and the recollections they stirred — to record what I hope, beyond that account, will be remembered. Two weeks into the battle, my company commander told me that I was both the luckiest and unluckiest lieutenant he’d ever met. The luckiest because right out the gate I experienced the largest battle the Marine Corps had fought in decades. I was the unluckiest because everything I ever did after that would seem inconsequential. “I can’t take it any more,” one of the Marines tells me. We’re four days into the battle. His squad leader said he needed to talk to me. “I keep thinking about my daughter. Every time I go into a house I think about her.” He is crying and the other Marines are watching and I know that fear is contagious. “Do you want me to get you out of here?” I ask. He keeps muttering that he can’t take it. Twenty minutes later I’m loading him into an amtrack that will drive him out of Falluja alongside wounded Marines. He and another Marine in the platoon are married to a set of sisters, making them brothers-in-law. That other Marine says he’ll never speak to him again. On the back of an M1 Abrams tank there is a little telephone in a box tapped into the crew’s intercom; it’s called a grunt phone. I’ve never been as scared as I was the times I had to run to that grunt phone, bullet impacts dancing on the tank’s armor, their ricochets flashing like fistfuls of thrown pennies. I needed to get on the grunt phone to tell the tanks where to shoot. The tank crew would listen to music on their intercom, so if no one was talking you’d hear pop songs when you held the handset to your ear. The tankers I worked with liked Britney Spears. The squat crew chief, who looked like he was born to fit inside of a tank, told me that he played the music because it helped everyone in the tank stay “frosty.” It is the Corps’ birthday. As we load the tracks, the Marines swap little pieces of M.R.E. cake and placed them gently in their mouths like priests placing communion wafers. I am on my stomach most of the day and each time I peek my head above the wall, I am convinced it’s going to get shot off. Second platoon is in the building next to ours. A friendly airstrike accidentally hits them. We hear them screaming on the radio as they call in their wounded, and it mixes with the sounds of our jets overhead. I catch the Marines stealing glances at me as I talk on the radio. They know that what is said over the radio — an order, a mission — can get them killed, but they have little control over those decisions. When we come home, one of the Marines in our platoon has to see the base psych, or “wizard,” for PTSD symptoms. When I tell him I understand what he went through, he tells me that I don’t. He says, “If you had to drive at 150 m.p.h. down the freeway, what’s scarier: driving the car, or riding shotgun?” When we saw the first insurgents we couldn’t believe how casually they were walking around. They didn’t expect us that far into the city. When we killed them it felt like murder. The Marines are running room to room, shooting into the street. Above the window where one of our machine guns is peeking outside, there is a poster of a lake encircled by snowcapped mountains. I am looking at the poster when three men in black track suits bolt into the open. I don’t see them until they are dead in front of us. One of them is laying on his side, with his head resting on the curb like it’s a pillow. The machine-gunner, a kid named Benji, looks back at me smiling. Back in Lejeune, we give him his helmet as a farewell gift. The other Marine, a 20-year-old named Brown, is shot through the femoral artery. We slip and fall on his blood. The building we’re trapped in is a convenience store, so we find a few bags of salt and empty them on the ground. It takes a long time for the medevac to come. We’re crawling across the room, trying to find the sniper who shot Brown, the salt and the blood crunching beneath our hands and knees. Brown survives. By this point, we’re surrounded. “Benji,” I say, “give me that.” I snatch the machine gun from him and fire a burst for the tanks to see. The arc of my tracers goes clumsily high. “Jesus, give it back, sir,” says Benji. His rounds are on target. The two of us stay up there and do it together. While I’m on the roof, our company executive officer finds our platoon. He rushes inside and asks, “Who’s in charge!” Wounded Marines are scattered all over the ground floor. Someone weakly says, “Doc is,” pointing to our 19-year-old corpsman. When I’m on the roof, I don’t want to come downstairs and see this. You are responsible for everything your platoon does or fails to do. Responsible for everything. I stick my head out of the door and a machine gun’s burst nearly takes it off. On the alley’s far side there is a wall, which a pair of pigeons are trying to land on. Every few seconds there is another burst from the machine gun. The pigeons can’t land, and we can’t get out this way. Coming back into the house, I see Banotai, and I say, “We’re trapped. It’s suicide if we go that way.” Later Banotai tells me that when I told him that it was the most scared he ever was. They shot down at us from the rooftops. I am crouching in a doorway and Ames is next to me with his radio and its damn 10-foot antenna. It’s so loud, the air itself is ringing, and I am soundlessly shouting into the radio, as if the incredible noise has devoured my voice. Little tufts of earth erupt near my feet as bullets impact all around. Two Marines drag Banotai toward an amtrack. He’s been knocked unconscious. An RPG explodes next to another Marine, shredding his pants. His legs are covered in blood and from the waist down he’s naked. Our platoon sergeant, two out of our three squad leaders, four out of our six team leaders, they are all evacuated. My socks are wet. I’ve sweat through my clothes. I finally get a head count. About half of the platoon is gone. Someone offers me a cigarette. It’s the first one I’ve smoked since I was 17 … I once read an account by a German officer in the First World War who said that after each assault through the trenches, he would make sure to have his men eat afterward, that way they knew they were alive. I try to make sure everyone is eating. They were just standing at a bend in the road. They were all wearing black. I took my time calling in the mortars, but because they were at a bend in the road I knew exactly where they were. I whispered the grid coordinates into the radio and then I waited. They just disappeared when the rounds impacted. After a couple of minutes a gentle breeze cleared up the smoke. It looked like someone had dumped a pile of wet black rags in the road. When I come home, more often than you might expect, a stranger will ask me if I ever killed anyone. For a long time, I didn’t know how to answer that question. A friend of mine took to saying, “If I did, you paid me to,” which eventually I also took to saying, but the first person who asks me is my cousin, and she is 6 years old. My first platoon sergeant has been replaced by Staff Sergeant Ricardo Sebastian, who we call Seabass. He leads six Marines downstairs. He’s going to clear out the house next door while the rest of us keep fighting from the rooftop, hoping to keep the insurgents’ heads down while Seabass presses the assault. I’m calling for Seabass over the radio, but he isn’t answering. I don’t know what’s going on next door, so I run downstairs and into the other house. The ground floor is on fire. Landgrebe, a 20-year-old lance corporal, has been shot through both legs and he’s dragging himself toward the front door. A can of gasoline sits in a corner and someone has lit a bunch of blankets and mattresses on fire, as if the insurgents want to burn down the house with themselves and us inside. I’m coughing on the smoke. I find Seabass in the corner. He’s been shot through the arm and leg. We’re lobbing grenades around the corners, there’s dust everywhere, I unload my pistol into the next room because I’m too scared to step into the room with my rifle. I can hear them inside, speaking in gasps, shuffling through the debris, as slowly — grenade by grenade and bullet by bullet — we kill them. For the next few weeks little pieces of steel work their way out of my skin. Our platoon corpsman, who still has acne, picks them out for me at night like he’s popping pimples. After a month, we’re taken out of Falluja and to a base where we get a hot meal, a shower and fresh uniforms. When I take mine off, there are holes in the back and bloodstains there, as well as on the shoulders and the knees. Some guys throw their old uniforms away. I can’t. I tie mine up in a plastic bag and put it in my pack. Two months later, when our tour is up, I worry that some customs officer at the airport might confiscate the uniform, declaring it a sanitary hazard. But that doesn’t happen. When I get home, I put it in my basement, hidden, where it has sat for the past 15 years. My medals, I imagine, I will someday give to my daughter. The watch I wore in the war and still wear now I plan to give to my son. But this uniform — who is it for? Sometimes I think about throwing it out. I don’t need it. Sometimes I think that maybe I should still keep it, but just wash it instead. What would it be like to see it clean? But I haven’t done that either. So it just sits there. And from time to time, I take it out, look at it, press my fingers in the holes, trace out the blotchy stains and wonder what’s to be done with it, that bundle of clothes that despite all the memories is nothing more than an old, bloody and tattered rag. Elliot Ackerman is the author of three novels, and the forthcoming memoir “Places and Names: On War, Revolution, and Returning,” from which this article is excerpted.

2019,A Beer Run From N.Y.C. to Vietnam Ends Up in Hollywood,"[Want to get New York Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.] It’s Friday. What have you done lately for the birds of New York State? There’s new legislation that’s literally for the birds. Weather: Mostly cloudy, with a chance of showers (again). With temperatures in the 50s, you’ll need a jacket. Expect yet more rain over the weekend. Alternate-side parking: In effect until May 27 (Memorial Day). It’s possible that John (Chickie) Donohue, 77, has told his “greatest beer run ever” story in every bar in Inwood over the years. Now the saloon tale will be seen on the big screen. The story — how a patriotic bartender’s suggestion prompted Mr. Donohue to make a daring visit to Vietnam in 1967 as a civilian to deliver beer to his soldier buddies — has caught the attention of Peter Farrelly, who directed the Oscar-winning film “Green Book.” Mr. Donohue’s beer run will be Mr. Farrelly’s follow-up film for Skydance Media, the production company behind such blockbusters as “True Grit” and the “Mission: Impossible” series. Skydance’s president for production, Don Granger, acknowledged that Mr. Donohue’s story was an unusual choice for the company, made on a “leap of faith” because it was compelling and original. Mr. Donohue is nothing if not original. He is a saloonkeeper and a former sandhog, one of the urban miners who dig train and water tunnels deep in New York City’s bedrock. He has spent decades relating his beer-run story, often to incredulous scoffs from friends, strangers, even some relatives. But once people saw his photos and met his soldier buddies, who backed up the tale, he said, “I didn’t have to buy a beer for a long time in Inwood.” [It was the ultimate saloon tale: Read more about the beer run.] Mr. Donohue finally wrote up the story in 2017 in a self-published book called “The Greatest Beer Run Ever,” written with Joanna Molloy, a former New York Daily News writer. Now that Hollywood wants it, he said: “It’s a hoot, it really is a hoot. I certainly never expected the whole thing to get this far.” The story was well known among members of the Sandhogs Local 147. Mr. Donohue promoted the book by doing readings at union meetings and for veterans groups. Mr. Donohue’s story began in 1967, as he was attending funeral after funeral of friends who had died in the Vietnam War. He was drinking in Doc Fiddler’s, one of many Irish bars in Inwood, in Upper Manhattan, when a bartender blurted out that someone ought to go to Vietnam to buy the troops a beer for their service. Mr. Donohue did just that. He had served four years in the Marine Corps and was working as a merchant seaman. He got a job as an oiler on a merchant ship bound for Vietnam, shipping out with a duffel bag full of beer and a minimum of information on a half-dozen friends stationed there. He began his odyssey, using his wiles to visit various military companies to surprise his friends. The journey entailed gutsy navigating through military officialdom and hitching all sorts of rides on jeeps and planes. “The best thing is that all five of my buddies survived and came back alive,” Mr. Donohue said. “Now they’re finally getting a place in the sun.” The Times’s Jeffery C. Mays reports: In the merry, merry month of May, Mayor de Blasio will finally have his say: Will he or won’t he be running for president? For months, the mayor has openly flirted with a 2020 run, with his status evolving from “not ruling anything out” to “sooner than later” to “soon.” Yesterday, Mr. de Blasio put an actual time stamp on “soon.” “I’m going to make my decision in the month of May, and then I’m going to tell you my decision,” he said. Becoming Catholic in the age of scandal: At Easter, thousands of people in the New York area converted to Catholicism even as sexual abuse allegations have rocked the church. Tuition or dinner? Nearly half of college students say they are going hungry. Once as pro-prosecution as any red state, New York is making a big shift on trials. He was trained by Al Qaeda to bomb the subway. Then he switched sides. Nearly $300 million in tax breaks were awarded to four companies with close Democratic ties. [Want more news from New York and around the region?

When it comes to talented street musicians, New York City has such an abundance of riches that its subways, streets and parks could serve as a recruiting ground. That’s exactly what the James Hotel-NoMad in Midtown is doing by kicking off a monthly artist-in-residence program devoted to a different street musician every month. For four Wednesdays in May, the hotel has chosen Najah Lewis, 25, a singer from Brooklyn who was performing in the Union Square subway station recently when a hotel staff member noticed her and offered her the chance to initiate the series. Ms. Lewis gets a paid gig: an hourlong set to go along with hotel’s complimentary wine hour in its lobby on Wednesdays beginning at 5 p.m. Ms. Lewis, who sings and plays guitar, has a repertoire that ranges from originals to R&B to jazz. For any aspiring star, she said, working the subways keeps you sharp and serves as great exposure. “You really hone your craft by singing on the street,” she said. “New Yorkers can be a tough crowd, so if you get applause, you’re doing something right.” Dear Diary: It’s 2:30 a.m. at Jimmy’s Corner bar near Times Square. Despite the hour, the crowd is lively. The only quiet one in the place is Jimmy. A former prizefighter, he is drinking warm tea by the door, seeing all, saying little. Into this shrine to boxing walks a lone giant of a man, a mastiff among pugs. His head is bigger than any other two heads in the joint combined, and they all turn toward him for a moment. Jimmy raises an eyebrow. A stool is offered, and the big man sits down. He hunches over on his elbows, making him more or less everyone else’s height. Conversations, singing and laughter resume. The big fellow keeps to himself. He responds politely when spoken to, but does not engage in conversation. After a single beer, his head begins to nod. He pays, rises and leaves. The door closes behind him, and the room goes quiet again. A slight, bearded man in a trucker hat and flannel shirt who has been treading lightly for the past half-hour, whistles low. “That was one. big. guy,” he says. Jimmy winks. “You could’ve taken him,” he says. — Steve Gorka New York Today is published weekdays around 6 a.m. Sign up here to get it by email. You can also find it at nytoday.com.

2019,"A Bel-Air Mansion, a Raid and 1,000 Guns","California Today Good morning. (Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.) My colleague Tim Arango followed up on the massive cache of guns pulled over the course of hours from a multimillion dollar house in Los Angeles. Here’s his dispatch: It reads like the plotline from an L.A. noir novel: A sprawling house in Bel-Air, close to the Playboy Mansion. An early morning raid. Stacks of bullets and guns of every sort. And a tantalizing connection to a wealthy and famous family. In the early morning darkness on Wednesday, Los Angeles police detectives and federal agents, working on an anonymous tip, moved on the mansion in the affluent Bel-Air neighborhood. “Lo and behold, they found over a thousand guns of all makes, models and calibers,” said Lt. Chris Ramirez, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department, who was at the scene on Wednesday, after officers had spent hours cataloging the cache of weapons. There was seemingly every kind of gun — shotguns, pistols, assault rifles, even Civil War-era weapons — along with over a thousand rounds of ammunition, he said. “They were found just laid out in various rooms in the house,” he said. “There were piles of ammunition on one side of a room. There were piles of guns on the other side of a room.” One man was arrested: Girard Saenz, 57, who was booked at the county jail and released several hours later after posting $50,000 in bail. Mr. Saenz, who The Los Angeles Times said possessed a license to sell firearms, was arrested on suspicion of unlawfully transporting and selling assault rifles, Lieutenant Ramirez said. Lieutenant Ramirez said that agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were also investigating, and that federal charges could be forthcoming. Officers were running the serial numbers of all the weapons, to help unlock the mystery of why a man who lived in one of the country’s richest enclaves had so many guns. “It obviously happened in an affluent area, which is kind of rare,” Lieutenant Ramirez said. “Neighbors were kind of shocked.” According to The Los Angeles Times, the home where the guns were found is owned by Cynthia Beck, a Los Angeles real estate investor who was once in an extramarital relationship with — and had three daughters with — Gordon Getty, the son of the late J. Paul Getty, an oil baron who was once one of the world’s richest men and established the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles. Ms. Beck was not in the home at the time of the raid, and it’s unclear what her relationship is to Mr. Saenz. We’ll be keeping close tabs on the story as it develops. About 66 miles northwest of Salt Lake City, in a vast, desolate expanse, some 20,000 visitors and dignitaries are set to commemorate the 150th anniversary of an event that made possible the California we know today: The completion of the Transcontinental Railroad. Speeches will be made. A re-enactment of the driving of the last spike — a gold one — will be staged. But this year, unlike in past commemorations, historians will be watching to see that the thousands of Chinese workers who built the entire western half of the railway are recognized. “Our hope is that this would become common knowledge in the United States,” said Gordon H. Chang, a history professor at Stanford University, and a co-director of the Chinese Railroad Workers in North America Project. (We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

2019,A Better Cocktail Glass,"Front Burner The Austrian glassmaker Riedel has released a line of barware, tweaked for cocktail enthusiasts. Drink-specific cocktail glasses are nothing new — who doesn’t recognize a rocks glass? — but the Austrian glassware company Riedel has taken it a step further, consulting with Zane Harris, a cocktail specialist, to fine-tune the details for each of the six shapes in a new line. The glasses follow classic contours, yet also take ice (regular and large format cubes) into consideration. There’s a 6 1/2-ounce glass for neat whiskey, a 9 7/8-ounce rocks glass, a 10 7/8-ounce highball, a slightly narrower 9 3/8-ounce tall fizz glass, a 7 5/8-ounce sour glass and a 4 7/8-ounce glass called the Nick & Nora that’s meant for martinis, but isn’t the typical “V” shape.

2019,A Better Way to Artichokes,"City Kitchen Halved and roasted, medium artichokes turn crisp on the outside and tender within. An artichoke is not a vegetable. It is a flower, or it would be, if it were allowed to bloom. At the stage we eat it, before the bright purple blossom emerges, the artichoke is actually a fat, succulent bud. There are many types, some the size of an egg and others as big as baseballs, in colors from pale green to violet. You may see artichokes in the supermarket year-round, but they are at their peak from March to June, freshly harvested and full of flavor. There is no denying, however, that an artichoke requires a bit of work. First, you discard a number of tough outer petals, or bracts. For large artichokes that are to be steamed whole, most cooks snip off the sharp tips of each petal with kitchen shears and cut off a portion of the top. Steaming takes about an hour. Then comes the familiar ritual of plucking off petal after petal and nibbling on the tiny bit of flesh each one offers, anticipating the sweet, meaty heart of the artichoke at the center, the prize of the whole ordeal. All the while, you are dipping into an accompanying sauce, whether melted butter, vinaigrette or mayonnaise. There are other approaches: Roasting is one. An old-fashioned way is to cook smaller artichokes in the hot embers of a wood fire. This gives them, obviously, a smoky, roasted flavor that emphasizes their sweetness. If you have the opportunity, give it a try some time. Another popular preparation is to stuff large artichokes with a savory bread crumb mixture and roast them whole. But I have an easier method for roasting medium artichokes. I trim them, cut them in half and remove the hairy, inedible choke, then simmer them in salted water for 10 minutes. All this can be done well in advance of roasting. A half-hour before serving, I drizzle them with olive oil, tuck a few thyme sprigs here and there and pop them into a hot oven. The artichokes emerge crisp, with a tender interior. I serve them with a zesty, lemony anchovy-flecked mayonnaise. They may, of course, be served as a side dish, but I like them best as a first course, to be enjoyed without distraction. Recipe: Roasted Artichokes With Anchovy Mayonnaise The conventional wisdom says that artichokes are difficult to pair with wine because a chemical in the vegetable makes wines taste sweet. This can be true, especially if you choose a wine that already has some sweetness or one that is oaky. But if you select a dry, unoaked wine, you will not have a problem. The rich anchovy mayonnaise in this recipe will also help to mitigate the issue. A bone-dry vermentino from Corsica, where it is spelled vermentinu, would be delicious. So would an Etna Bianco, or a sauvignon blanc, so long as you are sure it is dry. I would very much enjoy a manzanilla sherry with this dish, while Txakolina, an exuberant dry white from Basque country in Spain, is legendarily good with artichokes.

2019,A Bid to Maintain One of the World’s Oldest Culinary Traditions,"For the ever dwindling Parsi community of western India, food is both pleasure and heritage — and a secret language in danger of dying out. Mumbai’s Britannia & Co., a destination for Parsi cuisine, was founded in 1923 and is still crowded today with old tables covered with checkered tablecloths and a portrait of Mahatma Gandhi on the peeling-paint walls.CreditCreditAnthony Cotsifas TO TASTE DHANSAK at the Ripon Club in Mumbai — whose version of the slow-cooked, densely spiced lentil, vegetable and meat stew is one of the city’s greatest pleasures — you must come on a Wednesday, and you must be invited. Only members and their guests are permitted to enter, and membership is granted only to Parsis, the descendants of Persian Zoroastrians who set sail for India around 1,300 years ago. They were among the last remnants of an imperial dynasty that at its height commanded, according to some historians’ estimates, as much as 44 percent of the world’s population, reaching from the Indus Valley in the east to northern Africa in the west. So you are reliant on the kindness of Parsis, who, as it happens, are known for their charity; their religion encourages both the creation of wealth and its righteous distribution. Last September, friends of friends in Mumbai introduced me to the gregarious Zarine Commissariat, a retired office manager, who took me one postmonsoon afternoon to this low-profile Gothic Revival building a short walk from the Bombay High Court, convenient for the many club members who are lawyers. The elevator is still equipped with its original hand crank; a sign warns passengers that they may ride it up but not down. It ascends with a shudder, and on the third floor, its door folds in like an accordion, and time stalls. [Coming later this spring: the T List newsletter, a weekly roundup of what T Magazine editors are noticing and coveting. Sign up here.] The dining room is long, a stately configuration of marble floors, Burma teak sideboards and walls of peeling paint in eggshell hues. Yellow spines of National Geographics gleam from glass-paned bookcases. A garland of marigolds rings a bust of Sir Pherozeshah Mehta, who established the club in 1884 for Parsis who were “Western-cultured” and had spent time in England. The British themselves were excluded (to the consternation of the cricketer Lionel Tennyson, grandson of the poet Alfred, who visited in 1885), in part as a riposte to the colonial clubs whose infamous signs declared “No Indians and dogs allowed.” Still, the Ripon Club has always been Anglophiliac in spirit, from its name — a homage to the progressive George Frederick Samuel Robinson, First Marquess of Ripon and Viceroy of India from 1880 to ’84, who championed native Indians’ rights — to the portrait of Queen Victoria that the writer V.S. Naipaul observed still hanging in the club secretary’s office as late as 1975. To the table come bottles of Pallonji’s raspberry soda, Ferrari-red and heart-stoppingly sweet; crispy lengths of Bombay duck, the local name for lizardfish, caught in the waters off Mumbai, deep-fried whole and still succulent, not deboned and flattened as in other Indian traditions; and goat brain cutlets sheathed in prickly bread crumbs, insides creamy as custard. The dhansak awaits at the far end of the room, where a waiter stands stoically blank behind three silver-domed chafing dishes. First on the plate is rice, a loose scoop of Basmati steamed with whole spices and a touch of sugar, caramelized, for a hint of sweetness; it is incomplete without fried onions scattered on top. Then there is the dhansak itself, here cooked with mutton, although the meat is secondary to the glorious sauce, uncompromisingly brown. It’s made of several kinds of dal (lentils) — in the 2007 cookbook “My Bombay Kitchen,” the American Parsi anthropologist Niloufer Ichaporia King prescribes a mix of pigeon peas, chickpeas, red lentils and mung beans — along with a meld of adu lasan (ginger-garlic paste) and three masalas, one spiked with a few chiles, the heat of which fortifies the other flavors. Adornments include rugged little kebabs and half a lime to add brightness, but what matters most is that pool of sauce. Soon the body grows leaden and you understand the purpose of the row of lounge chairs by the windows, with elongated arms over which to drape your legs as you nap. (Or otherwise: The chairs are nicknamed Bombay fornicators.) But as the room fills with calls of greeting and gentle ribbing, the talk among the Parsis at my table turns to their community’s decline. Their numbers in India have dwindled, from close to 115,000 in 1941 to just over 57,000 in 2011 (the date of the last nationwide census), with another 15,000 estimated to live in North America and a few thousand more around the world. (Measuring the population is tricky, as not all who follow Zoroastrianism, itself in decline, are Parsi, an identity that encompasses Persian ancestry and Indian origins along with the faith.) One of my dining companions was the 73-year-old Jehangir Patel, editor since 1973 of the English-language magazine Parsiana, which tracks Parsi births and deaths in India and abroad. In the Sept. 7, 2018, issue, 29 Parsis were reported to have died in August and only one was born. The Parsis do not rage over such facts. They chuckle, resigned to their doom and blame only themselves, for being both too conservative, discouraging conversion and limiting the definition of a Parsi to patrilineal descent — in effect, preferring extinction to dilution — and too liberal, believing in free will, even if it leads you away from the fold. Upstairs, on the fourth floor, the Ripon Club is empty. Sunlight slants through the windows and smokes on the green baize of the billiards table. But for the Parsis, it is already dusk. When a culture vanishes, it takes with it a singular vision of the world — a vision that for the Parsis is expressed in large part through their food and the labor and love devoted to it: its status as at once communal rite, historical record and private language. When a language is no longer spoken, we lose not just words but possibility, a sense of what we are capable of, in our power to imagine and give names to the things that surround us and, through that naming, to change them. So, too, when a cuisine is lost, erasing the ingenuity of the cooks who shaped it over centuries. An individual’s time on earth is finite, but we trust in the momentum of history and the generations that follow; we are certain we will continue. How do you live, then, knowing that your grandchildren may be the last of their kind? Who will wear the kusti, the sacred cord around the waist, and feed sandalwood and frankincense to the temple fire? Who will make dhansak? ONE OF THE WORLD’S earliest monotheistic religions, Zoroastrianism arose out of a revelation to a prophet called Zarathustra in Avestan (a language now dead but still used in the recitations of Zoroastrian priests, learned by rote). He is believed to have been born in northeastern Iran or southwestern Afghanistan, and might have lived at any time between 6500 and 600 B.C.; the Roman historian Plutarch places him five millenniums before the Trojan War, while sacred texts cite a date two and a half centuries before the rise of Alexander the Great. Some scholars argue that Cyrus the Great, founder of the Achaemenid Empire in 550 B.C. — at that point the largest empire the world had ever seen — was a proto-Zoroastrian, although he did not impose the creed on those he conquered, which in retrospect may have been a mistake. Today’s small community of Iranian Zoroastrians (around 14,000 as of 2011) welcomes converts, but Parsis do not — a pity, because there’s much that appeals about the religion right now, especially its tenets of tolerance and its early recognition of women as equal to men in moral agency, with a modern corollary of championing women’s education and pursuit of career. According to Zarathustra’s teachings, there is one god, Ahura Mazda, and two forces at war in the world, light and dark; the light, of God and of the illuminated human mind, is represented by the fire tended in Zoroastrian temples, never to be extinguished. The Zoroastrian mantra is manashni, gavashni, kunashni: good thoughts, good words, good deeds. But goodness does not require typical monastic asceticism. The opposite, in fact: Adherents must commit to engagement in the here and now, which includes embracing earthly delights, however fleeting. The last of the Persian Zoroastrian empires fell to the Arab Caliphate in the seventh century A.D. Forced to choose between Islam and exile, many Zoroastrians fled, and several boats of refugees made it to the west coast of India in what is today the state of Gujarat. It is here that the story of the Parsis (the people from Pars, or Persia) begins, with food as an allegory for survival: As legend has it, the local Hindu ruler sent the newcomers a brimming cup of milk, to show that there was no room for more people in his kingdom; the Persians slipped in a spoonful of sugar, which disappeared, sweetening the milk without spilling it. This was a promise: They would assimilate and enrich India without altering its character. Adaptation was key to their perseverance, and it remains the defining feature of Parsi food today — “a real magpie cuisine,” as King says, characterized by “gleeful borrowing.” From the Hindus: warm and musky spices and fondness for the seafood abundant along the Gujarati coast. From the Muslims, who took control of Gujarat at the end of the 13th century: an embrace of meat and viscera like lungs and heart, and the many ways to cook them. From the 16th-century Portuguese colonizers: the New World’s glory of chiles, potatoes and tomatoes. And from the British, who arrived in the 17th century: custard, soufflé and a somewhat stodgy fish-in-white-sauce recipe that Parsis improved with a slosh of vinegar. The cooking also remains true to its ancient Persian roots, with liberal use of dried fruits and nuts and an emphasis on the interplay between sweet and sour. Unlike their first neighbors, the Gujaratis, who are predominantly vegetarians, Parsis are incorrigible carnivores and have no food restrictions. “We eat everything,” says Jeroo Mehta, 92, the Mumbai-based author of “101 Parsi Recipes” (1973) and an advocate for offal; her cookbook presents three elegant approaches to sheep’s brain. Animal protein is so fundamental to the Parsi diet that even during the holy month of Bahman, when Zoroastrians are supposed to abstain from meat, they’re permitted fish and eggs. Vegetables, on the other hand, are almost never eaten in isolation. While dhansak is typically made with spinach, eggplant and squash, the Mumbai-born, 47-year-old chef Jehangir Mehta of the New York restaurant Graffiti Earth believes that “not being able to see the vegetables” makes Parsis more likely to eat them. “There is nothing like a vegetable dish on our menu — or if there is, there will be an egg on it,” he says. Prowess in egg eating, at least three per day, is something Parsis boast of, and the phrase per eeda (“egg on top”), can be applied to almost anything: Eggs might be whisked and poured over okra, then steamed; broken into the hollows of sautéed fenugreek leaves and briefly sizzled, so the yolks still wobble; or simply fried over a bed of crushed potato chips. THE PARSIS KEPT their promise to the Gujaratis. They learned to speak the local language, stopped eating beef out of respect for the Hindus and didn’t proselytize. In the 17th century, they started settling in Mumbai (then Bombay), when it was still just seven islands mired in a network of swamps. As merchants and intermediaries, they helped the British transform the archipelago into a city and acquired what would become some of its most valuable real estate. They spearheaded the Indian industrial revolution by building the first steel mills and textile factories; they built ships and launched the country’s first airline; they used their wealth to endow hospitals, laboratories and schools. They were also the first to adopt the British game of cricket, and their extravagant musical theater productions paved the way for Bollywood. The Kolkata-born novelist Amitav Ghosh has argued that the Parsis “essentially created modern India.” Yet this enormously influential minority, which constitutes less than .05 percent of India’s population, remains largely invisible and inaccessible to the foreign visitor. In Mumbai, nonbelievers are denied admission to sacred Parsi sites, including the fortresslike Atash Behrams, holiest of the fire temples, in the seaside Marine Lines district, and the great circular Towers of Silence in Malabar Hill, the city’s poshest neighborhood, where the Parsis have historically left their dead to be stripped by vultures, an act of purification. (Like the Parsis themselves, these sites and their traditions are under threat: Orthodox Zoroastrians fear that the sanctity of the temples may be compromised by an impending subway tunnel, and local vultures are dying out, poisoned by an anti-inflammatory drug given to the cows they feed on; without a reliable flock, Parsis have had to resort to solar mirrors to hasten corpses’ decomposition — a method that takes longer and, during monsoon season, doesn’t work at all.) Nor is Parsi food widely available at the city’s restaurants. The cuisine thrives in homes and during celebrations like a child’s navjote (a Zoroastrian initiation akin to the Jewish bar and bat mitzvah) or the elaborate thousand-guest weddings that typically take place from November to March each year. The vast majority of these feasts are overseen by the indomitable Parsi caterer Tanaz Godiwalla, 49, who commands an army of day laborers 300 strong at the height of the season. She knows each by name. They are almost all men, Hindu and Muslim farmers who come down from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, inured to wielding 26-pound ladles and balancing 80-pound pots over open wood fires. Sometimes there are four or five weddings in a single night. Many take place in the banquet halls of the Parsi residential colonies known as baugs, some established by Parsi philanthropists as an affordable housing option for lower- and middle-class members of the community. Guests eat in shifts, sitting down at long tables while those waiting hover behind. Prep cooks turned waiters run back and forth with the food, spooning it onto fresh banana leaves that function as plates. (As the leaves grow warm under the food, they release oils, adding both fragrance and flavor.) There is always delicate-fleshed pomfret fish, either in the form of patra ni machhi, thickly daubed with a coconut-and-green-mango chutney, then wrapped in a banana leaf and steamed; or saas ni machhi, submerged in white sauce with a dash of vinegar. Everyone wants the fish’s tail — “What to do madam, there is only one tail per fish,” a waiter says consolingly to a disappointed guest in Avan Jesia’s 2012 novel “Tower” — so that’s the only part that Godiwala will serve, reserving the rest for making cutlets and stock. Then comes chicken, perhaps deep-fried with a lacy crust or in a red sauce heaped with sali (matchstick potatoes that snap), or lamb in a creamy white sauce of coconut and cashews; and pulao with dal and kebabs, uncannily close to dhansak — but not quite: Dhansak, while delicious, is considered inauspicious for a wedding, since it is customarily served on the fourth day after a loved one dies, to announce that mourning is over. An egg dish might follow, or a collection of fried offal. As the wedding unfolds, there might be a few in-between bites (the more, the fancier), such as topli na paneer, soft rounds of lunar-white cheese bobbing in whey, which the Mumbai-based food writer Meher Mirza describes as “blancmange crossed with mozzarella.” Cardamom-scented lagan nu kastar, brought to a burnish in the oven, is offered as a palate cleanser; in some recipes it’s studded with fat golden raisins and charoli, indigenous to India, buttery as pine nuts but with the evanescent sweetness of pistachios. Such a feast is repeated almost every night for five months straight, yet no one tires of it. The whole point of a Parsi wedding, more than one Parsi told me, is to eat. AKURI, A PARSI scramble of eggs and onions, appears on the breakfast menu at the Willingdon Sports Club in Mumbai, whose marble terrace overlooks a private golf course and whose membership rolls have been closed to new blood since 1985. Again, it’s not open to the public; a friend will have to sneak you in. More proletarian and arguably better meals may be had at the city’s Irani cafes, dingy eateries equipped with bentwood chairs, prominently posted rules (“Please do not argue with management”) and photographs of Zoroastrian bodybuilders. Some are more than a century old, like B. Merwan & Co. by Grant Road Station, where gingham shirts hang over the sink in the open kitchen and, hour after hour, cooks turn a rubble of mawa — milk boiled down until the liquids evaporate, leaving a sweet, creamy, craggy fluff — into tiny cakes, bronzed and cracked at the top and somehow dense and ephemeral at once, disintegrating instantly in the mouth, like poundcake called to a higher destiny. Note, however, the distinction between Parsi, signifying those who trace their ancestry back in India 1,300 years (and who often speak Gujarati), and Irani, a term for Iranians — mostly Zoroastrian but some Muslim — who left Persia in the late 19th century (and speak Dari, an ethnolect of northwestern Iran, or Farsi). As the 34-year-old historian Simin Patel, daughter of Parsiana editor Jehangir, recounts in her forthcoming book on Irani cafes, many of these more recent immigrants started selling chai from corner storefronts. (Popular lore has it that such spaces were cheaper to rent because Hindus deemed corners unlucky.) These informal canteens cater to a lower- and middle-class clientele and serve comfort foods that are part of the Parsi canon but also belong to Mumbai at large, like brun maska, crusty bread with the inner loft of a pillow, not so much buttered as sandwiched around butter; and keema pav, soupy minced lamb simmered with chiles, to be sopped up with a soft roll. Irani cafes once numbered in the hundreds and were an integral part of city life, so much so that one of the most popular, Leopold Cafe, was targeted, along with Mumbai’s main commuter train station and the five-star Taj Mahal Palace hotel (itself founded by a Parsi), by Pakistani militants in the 2008 terrorist attacks. Now only a few dozen exist; their owners — grandsons of the original founders and “alpha males, tough guys,” according to Simin — are approaching their 80s and 90s. (At B. Merwan, the septuagenarian Bomi Irani still comes to work daily at 3 a.m., as he has for more than five decades.) It’s not clear if their children will carry on the family business. Instead, people of neither Parsi nor Irani descent are trying to replicate the aesthetic of the cafes, notably at Dishoom, which opened in London in 2010 (and which has since added six locations throughout Great Britain), and at MG Road, which opened in Paris in 2014. Simin doesn’t see this as cultural appropriation — since 2013, she has consulted on Dishoom’s design, with its spotted mirrors, dangling electric wires and mood of sepia twilight — as long as the original cafes aren’t being glamorized, “because they weren’t glamorous,” she says. But even some non-Parsis have expressed reservations about the homegrown Indian chain SodaBottleOpenerWala, which opened its first outlet in 2013 in Gurgaon, a suburb of Delhi, and today has nine branches. (Its name is a play on the Parsi practice of taking surnames connected to professions, like Doctor, Reporter and, yes, the couriers known as Sodawaterwalas.) It’s slightly disconcerting to see a simulacrum so close to the original, the sleek, replicable model ready to push out the old and take its place. But is this the only way these traditions can survive? For dishes to last over time, must they transcend the culture of their birth, enter other kitchens and find a place on the tables of strangers? THE THREAT OF EXTINCTION, however wittily parried by the Parsis who face it, is no exaggeration. Among the peoples who have disappeared from the earth, along with their culinary traditions, are the Emishi of northern Honshu, Japan, whose traces faded out about a millennium ago. Others are critically endangered today: the El Molo, who live on fish caught from the now receding Lake Turkana in Kenya, and whose population has been reported at fewer than a thousand; the Nukak Maku, who were driven out of their ancestral home in the Amazon jungle of Colombia by the country’s decades-long civil war and in 2015 numbered less than 500; and the Bo tribe of India’s Andaman Islands, with 52 members remaining as of their last counting, in 2010. Of the Shakers, an American religious community that demanded celibacy of its members and thus relied on converts to survive, only two are said to be left, and their culinary legacy — of simple, thrifty recipes that made use of nature’s bounty, and of pioneering techniques in preserving and canning produce — remains largely unknown. In a hopeful sign, however, other decimated groups have rebounded. The population of native Hawaiians was barely 24,000 as of the 1920 U.S. census but by 2013 had reached 560,000 nationwide, and traditions nearly erased under colonialism have seen a renaissance, notably in the embrace of precontact staples like poi (pounded taro root) and breadfruit. Theirs is just one of the cultures around the world that has begun resurrecting forgotten foodways in the past few decades, from indigenous North American tribes who lost their land in the 19th century and, hemmed in on reservations, became dependent on the heavily processed foods available as government rations, to young Cambodian chefs trying to salvage memories from before the Khmer Rouge genocide of the 1970s, when an estimated 1.7 million people — around a fifth of the population — died, including many elders whose minds were repositories of unwritten recipes passed down orally through generations. Food is heritage, and cooking and eating it are daily acts of continuing, a means of preserving identity in even the most desperate and unspeakable of circumstances. During the Spanish Inquisition, “secret” Jews who had been forcibly converted to Catholicism still refrained from cooking on the Sabbath and made unleavened bread for Passover, despite the risk of being exposed by servants or neighbors; as recounted by David M. Gitlitz and Linda Kay Davidson in “A Drizzle of Honey” (1999), one woman was burned alive on the evidence of her having made a distinctly Sephardic stew of lamb, chickpeas and hard-boiled eggs, known as adafina. Later, during World War II, Jewish women in the Theresienstadt concentration camp, north of Prague in what is now the Czech Republic, recorded recipes on scraps of paper — both an act of defiance and a way of leaving a mark on the world. In the Canadian Parsi writer Rohinton Mistry’s novel “Family Matters” (2002), one character suggests burying a time capsule so that history will remember the contributions of the Parsis after they’re gone. First among its contents: “recipes for dhansak, patra-ni-machhi, margi-na-farcha and lagan-nu-custard.” The dishes are signs, a code that unifies, through which Parsis recognize themselves in one another. IN AN UNDATED Pahlavi (Middle Persian) text from the Sasanian Empire (A.D. 224-651), a young nobleman whose family has fallen on hard times applies for a role at court and must prove his worth by answering 13 questions posed by the Zoroastrian king. Nine of them concern food. When asked what makes the best meal, the aspiring page says (as translated by the writer Shahrzad Ghorashian on her Persian food website Aashpaz), “It is the meal you eat when you are hungry and in good health, when your soul is free of fear.” Parsi food has come far from its ancient origins, and is evolving still, even as its makers grow few. Back in New York at Graffiti Earth, Mehta, who rose to acclaim 15 years ago as a provocatively cerebral pastry chef at the city’s now-shuttered Aix, has quietly introduced a few dishes that nod to the pleasures of home: a dhansak-like braise of beef ribs with brown lentils; squid or scallops in a sweet-and-sour tomato sauce; and a Persian toast that is his take on brun maska, with a sly wink at Parsis’ penchant for whisky, pairing the bread with so-called butterscotch — in fact a butter-and-Scotch emulsion. Halfway across the world, the 35-year-old Shezad Marolia, a Mumbai-born chef with a résumé that includes stints in the Merchant Navy and restaurants in London, is bringing a more straightforward update to Parsi food. He recently settled in the small, drowsy town of Udvada, Gujarat, just north of Mumbai — a holy town whose temple contains a fire believed to have been burning steadily for more than 1,300 years. Parsis make weekend pilgrimages here, some even buying second homes — modern condominiums that look jarring amid the crumbling bungalows with broken windows. Marolia and his mother, Hilla, run the Sohrabji Jamshedji Sodawaterwalla Dharamshala, one of Udvada’s rest houses for religious travelers. While accommodations are open only to believers, anyone is welcome to eat at the restaurant, Cafe Farohar. In September, I drove up with Farrokh Jijina, a Parsi journalist and the son of a part-time Zoroastrian priest. (The role of clergy is hereditary in Zoroastrianism, and not surprisingly, there’s a shortage; although Jijina was eligible to become a priest, he chose not to.) It was four hours from Mumbai, plus 30 minutes waiting for permits at the state line. As we approached the town, he gestured toward a shock of greenery by the side of the road, behind which lay a Tower of Silence. There, consignments of the dead are rare, he told me. At Cafe Farohar, the food was startlingly fresh: scrambled eggs vivid with green garlic uprooted from the backyard; aleti paleti, an herb-strewn sauté of chicken livers, kidneys and lungs; and a glass of pristinely sour yogurt to be mixed with sev: skinny, crunchy strands of chickpea flour tossed with raisins and charoli, dusted in sugar and cardamom and given a flicker of rose water, scent deepening into flavor. Afterward, we walked through the empty Zoroastrian museum, turning the fans on and off in each room as we went, as I tried to absorb the stupefying amount of information crammed onto the wall placards. A paragraph on food noted that the sweetness of sev “reminds one to have a sweet nature.” I was barred from entering the temple, so while Jijina paid his respects, I wandered the narrow streets alone, past hulks of houses appearing to hold their breath. Time was a stilled pulse. On the beach at the end of town, the sea ran caramel against sand like baked ink. We returned to Cafe Farohar on the way out of town, at Marolia’s insistence. He said there was a dessert I must try: malido, a labor-intensive production of semolina and wheat flour mixed with eggs, sultanas, almonds and ghee, requiring constant, vigilant stirring until its texture approaches fudge. On its own, malido is rich enough, but here it was buried under ice cream and melted chocolate and presented seething on a cast-iron plate — a wink at a Mumbai trend from a few years back of “sizzling” brownies. It was an odd, if exuberant, punch line to the journey. But there remains something defiant about such excess. I thought of dhansak and its heavy lake of sauce, repeatedly replenished from a seemingly endless buffet, and, so, too, the ritual of consuming the stew to break the fast after a loved one’s death — as if only such a rich, torpor-inducing dish could properly stun you and let you expand, freed from the vise of grief. It struck me suddenly that eating it in the midst of sorrow, or diminishment, was an extraordinarily optimistic act. To Jehangir Mehta, food is a way to pull people back from the brink and return them to the important business of life. “We don’t believe in mourning,” he said. “We believe in happiness.” Which is to say: We are still capable of pleasure. We are still here on earth. Production: Kamalan. Retouching: Anonymous Retouch.",The New York Times
2019,A Billion-Year-Old Fungus May Hold Clues to Life’s Arrival on Land,"matter A cache of microscopic fossils from the Arctic hints that fungi evolved long before plants. Scientists reported on Wednesday that they have discovered the oldest known fossils of fungi, a finding that may reshape our understanding of how life first arrived on land from the oceans. Fungi are the invisible giants of the natural world, even if most people are only dimly aware of them as toadstools along a hiking trail, or mushrooms sprinkled across a pizza. Scientists have identified about 120,000 species of fungi so far, but estimate there are as many as 3.3 million species in all. By comparison, all living mammals comprise fewer than 6,400 species. The success of fungi results largely from their unique way of feeding. Rather than absorbing sunlight like plants or devouring other organisms like animals, fungi spew out powerful enzymes. These break down surrounding cells or even rock, which the fungi slurp up. Fungi use this strategy in a variety of ways. Some attack our bodies, creating serious risks to health. Other types thrive on the skins of frogs and salamanders, threatening hundreds of species with extinction. Plants are victims, too: Some fungi pose a huge threat to the world’s crops. But many other fungi are vital partners to animals and plants. Cows grow fungi in their stomachs to help break down the tough grass they eat. Most plants intertwine their roots with networks of underground fungal threads that supply nutrients. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] And when plants and animals die, fungi use their powerful enzymes to quickly break down the dead tissue, liberating nutrients for the living to enjoy. The world would become a stinking charnel house if fungi disappeared. The ecological importance of fungi has left scientists to wonder about their evolutionary history. But the spores and tendrils fungi grow don’t often form fossils, making the story hard to uncover. In the early 1900s, researchers found a cache of remarkable fungal fossils in Scotland that were 407 million years old. The fungi had turned to stone in mineral-rich hot springs, preserved in microscopic detail. Some of them seemed to have partnered with plants that also left fossils behind in the rocks. Others appeared to have specialized in breaking down dead plant matter. Until now, those fossils have been the oldest clear evidence of fungi. Many scientists considered them a snapshot of the early conquest of land. Fungi and plants came ashore together as ecological partners, it seemed. Together, they transformed barren lands into a soil-carpeted habitat. Recently, though, some researchers have grown dissatisfied with this scenario. By comparing the DNA of different species, scientists have drawn an evolutionary tree of fungi. If the Scottish fossils were among the earliest members of the fungal kingdom, you’d expect that living fungi would share a common ancestor not much before 407 million years. But that’s not what the DNA trees tell us. The genes of living fungi indicate that their common ancestor lived over a billion years ago. Could there be a 600-million-year gap in the fossil record? In recent years, scientists have searched for fungi in rocks older than those in Scotland, and they’ve found a few microscopic fossils that looked like they might be fungi. But they were too ambiguous to convince many experts. The new fossils came to light during a geological expedition to the barren fringes of the Canadian Arctic. In 2014, Robert Rainbird, a research scientist at the Geological Survey of Canada, noticed black flecks on a piece of shale. He knew that sometimes flecks like these turn out to be microscopic fossils. “I thought, ‘I should grab some of this stuff, because it looks juicy,’” he said. Dr. Rainbird sent the material to Emmanuelle Javaux, a paleontologist at the University of Liège in Belgium. She asked Corentin Loron, a graduate student, to analyze them more closely. Mr. Loron put the rocks into an acid bath to strip out the minerals. He ended up with a black paste of organic matter, which he smeared onto slides. When he looked at them under a microscope, he saw hundreds of tiny fossils. The fossils were single-celled organisms. They were much bigger than bacteria, but Mr. Loron couldn’t determine exactly what they were. Dr. Rainbird’s analysis of the rocks showed that these organisms, whatever they were, had fossilized a billion years ago in an estuary, where a river flowed into a sea. On an expedition in 2017, Dr. Rainbird, Mr. Loron and their colleagues discovered some peculiar fossils in the rocks. They were composed of spore-like spheres, often joined to long filaments that sprouted T-shaped branches — the kind of shapes found today in fungi. Mr. Loron used electron microscopes to survey the fine structures, and found that the spheres and filaments had double walls — another hallmark of fungi. To see what molecules were contained in the fossils, Mr. Loron and his colleagues fired infrared beams at them and measured the light they released. Three fossils produced a pattern that matches that of a substance called chitin. All fungi make chitin to build their tough walls. Only insects and a few other species do the same. The researchers concluded they had found an ancient fungus, which they named Ourasphaira giraldae. “This is the first evidence that fungi are a billion years old, even though we’ve thought they were for a long time,” said Mary Berbee, a mycologist at the University of British Columbia, who was not involved in the new research. But Dr. Berbee and other experts said they would have more confidence in the findings with more data, especially about the fossils’ chemistry. “I don’t have any doubt that they’re fossils, and that alone is fascinating,” said George Cody, an organic geochemist at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington. But the infrared results could have been produced by molecules other than chitin, he added. If the Arctic fossils are indeed fungi, it’s a mystery how the tendril-sprouting organisms made a living. Today, fungi that sprout tendrils can grow to huge sizes by feeding on vast amounts of plant matter. A single subterranean mat in Oregon is three times larger than Central Park. A billion-year-old fungus would have had no land plants to feed on. The oldest known plant fossils are no more than 470 million years old. “The fungi were probably colonizing the land before the plants,” Mr. Loron speculated. The fungi had to be eating something. One possibility: bacteria. Researchers have found signs that crusts of bacteria were growing on land as long as 3.2 billion years ago. It’s also possible that these ancient fungi lived on the bottom of the estuary, perhaps feasting on underwater mats of algae. Land plants evolved from green algae, and so perhaps the estuary habitat was where fungi and the ancestors of plants first formed partnerships. It’s possible, Mr. Loron said, such ancient estuaries provided “the toolbox for everything that’s going on land afterward.” An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the chitin present in fungi. It is a polysaccharide, not a protein.",The New York Times
2019,A Billionaire Will Pay Morehouse Students’ Debt. This Reaction Was Priceless.,"When the billionaire Robert F. Smith told Morehouse College’s class of 2019 on Sunday that his family would eliminate their student loans, no one was more surprised than Henry Goodgame. You need only to watch the video of the moment to see that: Mr. Goodgame’s jaw plummets, his eyebrows jump to the brim of his graduation cap, and his eyes dart from side to side like he is searching — somewhere, anywhere — for comprehension. When he finds that certainty — that this is indeed happening — his disbelief turns to pure joy. Still, it takes another moment for him to find his legs for a standing ovation. Mr. Goodgame was seated behind Mr. Smith at the time of the announcement, because it is his job to raise money and keep graduates connected to Morehouse, the private, all-male, historically black college in Atlanta. [Read more about what the announcement means for students at Morehouse.] “I heard the words, but I just couldn’t believe it,” Mr. Goodgame, a 1984 Morehouse graduate and the college’s vice president for external relations and alumni engagement, said on Monday morning. “I looked at the audience to see, and it was registering at the same time for all of us. When he said it, it was an authentic no-clue-at-all look.” Mr. Goodgame, who has worked at Morehouse for 25 years, called it a “transformational moment” for his alma mater and one that could lead to greater recognition of the work of historically black colleges and universities. [Who is Robert F. Smith? Read more.] “To have someone else say that the work our institutions do is worthy of investment and reinvestment is significant,” he said. “We have the population that is most vulnerable not to make it to 18. We show them you can have a fine education that is designed and built just for you, that’s more than just chemistry or physics.” Mr. Goodgame said it had cost him $5,000 a year to attend Morehouse in the 1980s. Now, full-time tuition at Morehouse is $25,368, and other expenses, including room and board, books and fees, can push the total cost of attendance above $48,000. [Here’s the state of student debt in America.] The son of a steelworker and a teacher who was raised in Birmingham, Ala., Mr. Goodgame said he understood that there was a “domino effect” on graduates when they could not make their first loan payment six months after graduation. It can hurt their confidence and their credit score, he said, and they might decide to put off starting a family. “Now the dreams that they have do not have to be deferred,” he said. More than 90 percent of Morehouse students receive some form of financial aid, according to the college, including scholarships, grants, work-study jobs and loans. About half qualify for Pell grants. [Read about the racial disparities in student debt loads.] According to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Education Department data, the majority of historically black college and university graduates have not paid down even $1 of their original loan balance in the first few years out of college. Their federal-debt load is about one-third higher than graduates of other public and nonprofit four-year institutions. Mr. Smith made a donation to Morehouse earlier this year to finance scholarships. He told the audience on Sunday that his student-loan-eliminating gift, intended for the 396 graduating seniors, was meant to set an example of paying forward. “Shackling them with so much debt leaves so many clouds out there,” Mr. Goodgame said, alluding to the Morehouse College seal, which shows a rising sun above the clouds. “Now the clouds have rolled back, and the rain is gone. There is a clear path to success.”",The New York Times
2019,"A Black Officer, a White Woman, a Rare Murder Conviction. Is It ‘Hypocrisy,’ or Justice?","[For more coverage of race, sign up here to have our Race/Related newsletter delivered weekly to your inbox.] The national debate over race and policing has felt particularly close to activists in Minneapolis, who viewed several cases in their region as examples of police officers not being held accountable for killing black civilians. But when the justice system finally came down on an officer in a fatal shooting this week, it was not exactly the victory those activists had been seeking. Mohamed Noor, who is black, Somali and Muslim, became the first Minnesota police officer convicted of murder in an on-duty killing, when a jury found him guilty on Tuesday in the fatal shooting of Justine Ruszczyk, who was white. While many in the community said Mr. Noor should have been held accountable, they could not help but wonder what the outcome would have been if the races of the officer and the victim had been flipped. “This is an anomaly based on the race of the officer, and the race and affluence of the victim,” said Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights lawyer and activist in Minneapolis. “The system treats African-Americans and white people differently, whether they are the victim in a police-involved shooting case or whether they are the police officer. This is absolutely outrageous.” Even as activists and community leaders said that Ms. Ruszczyk deserved justice and expressed their condolences for her family, the verdict raised uncomfortable questions about the racial dynamics of the case. Some saw a system and a society that was quick to embrace and sympathize with Ms. Ruszczyk, a benefit that black victims rarely enjoy. Others felt that Mr. Noor did not get the vocal support of the police establishment that they usually see in police-shooting cases and wondered whether this would deter black people from law enforcement careers. “The only difference is that the officer involved in the shooting in this case happened to be a black Muslim immigrant, and the deceased person is a Caucasian lady,” said Waheid Siraach, a former police officer and a founder of the Somali-American Police Association. “People can put the two and two together.” [Read about Ms. Ruszczyk’s family receiving a $20 million settlement from Minneapolis.] Legal action against police officers involved in fatal shootings is exceedingly rare. Since 2005, 101 nonfederal officers have been charged with murder or manslaughter in shootings while they were on duty, according to Philip Stinson, a criminologist at Bowling Green State University. About 36 percent of those officers have been convicted, but only four of them on murder charges; the others were for lesser offenses. In 2016, a police officer in a suburb of St. Paul, Minn., shot and killed Philando Castile, who was black, during a traffic stop. The officer, who was Latino, was charged with manslaughter and acquitted by a jury after saying he had feared for his life. In the Noor case, Mike Freeman, the Hennepin County prosecutor, was criticized by some who said he was holding Mr. Noor to a different standard than he has white officers — an accusation that the prosecutor fiercely denied after the verdict was announced. “I’ve heard a small group in the community make disparaging remarks about me and this office to the effect that I won’t charge white cops who shoot black people, but I’ll charge black cops who shoot white people,” he said during a news conference. “That simply is not true. Race has never been a factor in any of my decisions and never will be.” In 2016, Mr. Freeman chose not to charge officers in the shooting death of Jamar Clark, who was black, saying Mr. Clark had grabbed one officer’s holstered gun. Last year, he did not charge the officers who pursued and shot at Thurman Blevins, killing him; Mr. Freeman said Mr. Blevins, who was also black, had a gun and did not follow the officers’ commands. In the killing of Travis Jordan this January, the prosecutor said the police officers had faced a deadly threat because Mr. Jordan, who was Hawaiian, had a knife and was coming toward them. Mr. Freeman argued that the details in those cases were different from those in the shooting of Ms. Ruszczyk. Each case is handled on its own merits, he said, and the facts showed that Mr. Noor, who was fired from the Minneapolis Police Department after the shooting, had acted unreasonably. Ms. Ruszczyk, who sometimes used the last name of her fiancé, Don Damond, had called the police late one night in July 2017 to report hearing what sounded like a woman in distress in the alley behind her house. Mr. Noor and his partner were in their squad car in the alley investigating when Ms. Ruszczyk approached. Mr. Noor, 33, testified during the trial that he had heard a bang and had fired one shot from the passenger’s seat when Ms. Ruszczyk appeared at the driver’s side window. Mr. Noor’s explanation did not convince the racially diverse jury, which convicted him of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Prosecutors seemed to imply at one point during the trial that Ms. Ruszczyk’s appearance should not have been threatening. “Her whole blonde hair, pink T-shirt and all, that was all threat to you?” Amy Sweasy, an assistant county attorney, asked Mr. Noor during cross-examination, according to The Star Tribune. Minnesota has a large Somali population, and many have expressed their displeasure with what they saw as unfair treatment of Mr. Noor. A demonstration in Minneapolis on Wednesday brought together various social justice organizations, including one called Justice for Justine, which advocated for Ms. Ruszczyk. Speaking at the demonstration, Drew Rosielle, a member of the group, sympathized with the complicated racial dynamics of the case. “What Justine has received, we want for everyone,” he said, according to a written statement provided by the organization. “If Justine is the only one to be treated this way, this is not real justice, but another racist wound inflicted on our community.” Mr. Siraach, the Somali-American former police officer, said there seemed to be a rush to judgment against Mr. Noor. He was upset with statements made by the former Minneapolis police chief that he felt suggested that Mr. Noor had acted improperly. He also did not think that the Police Federation of Minneapolis, the union representing officers, was as vocal as they usually were when officers were accused of wrongdoing. Lt. Bob Kroll, the president of the federation, disputed that in an email. “This is a very ignorant statement made by those that are naïve about our role and the process, and by those that quickly play the race card without merit,” he wrote. Lieutenant Kroll said he had been helping Mr. Noor and his lawyers throughout the process. He did not speak out because Mr. Noor’s legal team had kept mostly quiet, he said, and because his public statements could have been used to make him testify. Mustafa Diriye, a community organizer working in Minneapolis, said he had advocated vigorously for justice for Ms. Ruszczyk, just as he had for black victims of police shootings. He was pleased with the verdict, he said. Yet he could not help but be bothered that the system had worked so well for a white woman when it had failed so many black people, he said. “‘I fear for my life’ — that’s what all white cops get away with,” said Mr. Diriye, who is originally from Somalia. “That only works for white officers. They can fear for their life. But if you are black, no, no you cannot be fearful.” Mr. Diriye said he felt that if white people would demand justice for black police-shooting victims the way they did for Ms. Ruszczyk, things could be different. “The hypocrisy is there,” he said. “That is my frustration.” An earlier version of this article misidentified the racial background of Travis Jordan, who was shot by Minneapolis police officers in January. He was Hawaiian, not black. video",The New York Times

WAR AND PEACE FDR’s Final Odyssey, D-Day to Yalta, 1943-1945 By Nigel Hamilton Admittedly, it is a pretty geeky parlor game, maybe one that has faded with time. But for years in many households, it provoked endless dinnertime debate. In the annals of the 20th century, who was the greater, more significant historical figure: Franklin D. Roosevelt or Winston Churchill? The case for Churchill is powerful. He rallied Britain against Hitler’s hordes when the rest of Europe had fallen. While the United States remained on the sidelines and the Soviet Union embraced its devil’s-bargain alliance with Nazi Germany, Churchill virtually single-handedly defied the Third Reich in the face of existential threat: He was personally at risk, along with his countrymen, amid the cascade of bombs raining down on London during the Blitz. But count Nigel Hamilton in Roosevelt’s camp — not just in his camp but perhaps his most passionate and eloquent champion. In “War and Peace,” his latest book on the American wartime leader, Hamilton presents a farsighted Roosevelt riding to the rescue of freedom, then setting the stage for a new world order to come. Churchill is depicted as a military dunderhead who let ego and imperial ambition get in the way of sensible strategy. Courageous? Yes. A stirring orator? Absolutely. But if not restrained by Roosevelt, Churchill, in Hamilton’s view, might easily have lost World War II for the Allies. “War and Peace” is the third and final volume in Hamilton’s “F.D.R. at War” trilogy and certainly as gripping and powerfully argued as the first two, “The Mantle of Command” and “Commander in Chief.” Hamilton, as the historian Evan Thomas once observed, ended up producing the extended memoir that Roosevelt himself never got to write. Throughout Hamilton’s three books, Roosevelt is the wise and clever sage fending off myopic cabinet secretaries, generals, admirals and colleagues to steer the Allies to victory and the world to a better future. Hamilton, a British-born historian and naturalized American at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, is known for a well-regarded multivolume biography of Bernard Montgomery, the British field marshal during World War II, as well as more controversial books on Bill Clinton’s presidency and John F. Kennedy’s salacious personal life. He set out to write a single stand-alone book on Roosevelt, only to have it evolve into a decade-long project that required three titles to complete, with the goal, as he put it, “to set the record of this man’s contribution to the history of humanity straight.” Hamilton’s disdain for Churchill will surprise no one who has read the first two installments. Unlike more sentimental accounts of the relationship between Roosevelt and Churchill, like Jon Meacham’s engaging best seller “Franklin and Winston,” Hamilton’s trilogy presents the American as more exasperated than enamored when it came to his London partner, leery of the prime minister’s latest schemes and intrigues and constantly maneuvering to keep the war heading in the right direction. In “War and Peace,” as in the first two books, Hamilton condemns “Winston’s erratic course,” his “sheer amateurishness,” his “new madness,” his “autocratic and often wild behavior” and his “homicidal meddling” in military matters. “Time and again,” he writes, “Churchill had been infamously wrong on strategy.” The wrongheaded Churchill obsessively continued pressing for military action in the Mediterranean and Balkans while resisting the cross-channel D-Day invasion that even the Nazis foresaw would decide the fate of the war. “Whitewashed by generations of subsequent historians, this was the great tragedy of the war in late 1943,” Hamilton writes. In Hamilton’s view, his three volumes are a long-overdue correction to the mythmaking in Churchill’s own six-volume account of the war. After all, Churchill famously said, “History will be kind to me for I intend to write it.” Hamilton seems intent on rewriting it. “I deeply admired” Churchill, he informs readers, noting without elaboration that as a college student he “proudly stayed for a weekend at Chartwell, his home in Kent, before he died.” But, Hamilton adds, “I do not think it unfair to his memory, 65 years later, to correct the record regarding his version.” Hamilton’s Roosevelt, by contrast, was an all-knowing demigod, at once judicious and cunning, so visionary that he devoted much of his energy in the final chapters of the war to what would follow. Roosevelt did not live to see the United Nations that was his brainchild but, Hamilton argues, fairly enough, that no one did more to create a global structure that might forestall a third world war. Since Roosevelt left no lasting record of his life and thoughts following his untimely death in Warm Springs, Ga., in April 1945 at age 63, Hamilton relies on those left by others, including insightful diaries by Mackenzie King, the Zelig-like Canadian prime minister who always seemed to be on hand at key moments, and Henry L. Stimson, the Republican secretary of war who at times resisted Roosevelt’s judgments only to come around to recognize the virtues of the president’s approach. As “War and Peace” opens, Roosevelt has entered the twilight of his presidency, no longer the commanding figure of the first two books, heading inexorably toward an early grave, aided and abetted by a doctor and aides who considered him too necessary to America and the world to let him ease offstage to tend to his failing health. Though his faculties were fading, Roosevelt remained the driving force behind the strategy for winning the war and winning the peace. “Without F.D.R.’s extraordinary military leadership after Pearl Harbor,” Hamilton writes, “the course of World War II might well have turned out differently — and I would probably not be here, writing about it.” The centerpiece of Roosevelt’s strategy, of course, was Operation Overlord, the Normandy invasion, which Roosevelt advocated relentlessly despite doubts, arguments and even sabotage by Churchill. The prime minister, aware that the sun was setting on the empire on which the sun never set, suggested almost every other option. He pressed for more Allied focus on Italy, as well as landings in Greece and the Aegean. He was consumed inexplicably with the island of Rhodes. He fixated on the bloody battle of Anzio. Roosevelt batted away one Churchill effort to derail the D-Day invasion after another, single-mindedly determined to seize the beaches of Normandy. Hamilton’s case for Roosevelt is a compelling one. Even in decline, the president had a vision that eluded others, including his closest partner. Yet if the author’s antipathy for Churchill’s strategic miscalculations is buttressed by prodigious research, it nonetheless seems to sweep aside too easily the profound importance of his singular resolve, grit and determination to defeat Hitler — not to mention his cleareyed view of Stalin and the looming Soviet threat that Roosevelt, ever confident of his own powers of persuasion, mistakenly thought he could manage. To Hamilton, Churchill’s inspiration was no match for Roosevelt’s sagacity, his stirring speeches no substitute for the American’s strategic brilliance. Roosevelt was the architect and engineer who translated Churchill’s grandiloquence into a plan for victory. The Allies did fight on the beaches, as Churchill once memorably vowed, but it fell to Franklin Roosevelt to make sure they were the right beaches.",The New York Times
2019,A Bodega Cat Was Taken. The Neighborhood Wants Her Back.,"[Want to get New York Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.] It’s Wednesday. Weather: The gloom clears. It’ll be mostly sunny, with a high in the mid-60s. Alternate-side parking: In effect until May 27 (Memorial Day). If the internet has cats, New York City has bodega cats. The bodega cat is so beloved that we look at them on Instagram, rate them on Yelp and rejoice when “Saturday Night Live” includes them in a skit. So when one goes missing, New Yorkers get upset. “The incident happened at 7:19 a.m. Friday,” Anik Ahmed said. “She went outside at like 7:20, and the guy picked her up at like 7:23. And we noticed the cat was missing by 7:35.” Mr. Ahmed, 27, was referring to Lexi, the year-and-a-half-old tabby who has been a fixture at 71 Fresh Deli and Grocery, his store in Kips Bay, Manhattan. Surveillance video appears to show the cat vanishing when a man passes by. “This was my first pet,” he said. “That’s more heartbreaking than anything.” She was “the neighborhood’s cat,” one worker told NY1. The Daily News described how “bereft” workers were searching for “the furry darling.” Pets disappear with some regularity in the city (though for most, there’s no video evidence). Last year, 344 cats, 472 dogs, 14 kittens, 14 puppies, four birds and one reptile were reported missing, according to Animal Care Centers of N.Y.C. Fliers with Lexi’s picture are being distributed. Mr. Ahmed said he thought the catnapping was intentional, but added, “I’m not going to press charges.” Lexi came into Mr. Ahmed’s life when a friend’s cat had a litter. Soon, Mr. Ahmed said, he found himself with a curious kitten who befriended customers and workers alike. She even started helping around the store: Mr. Ahmed said the building’s superintendent noticed a reduction in the rodent population. Before opening the deli about five years ago, Mr. Ahmed was a software engineer tester, looking for potential breaches in new websites and apps. He acknowledges now that he could have kept Lexi more secure. He had removed her collar months ago, and she was not microchipped. The chips, which are implanted under pets’ skin, can help locate animals. “I’ve got to make sure I don’t leave a cat unattended anymore,” he said. “She had all the freedom.” The Times’s Jeffery C. Mays reports: Barry Grodenchik, a city councilman from Queens, admitted yesterday that he sexually harassed a council staff member for over a year and resigned as chairman of the Parks and Recreation Committee. The Council’s Committee on Standards and Ethics determined that Mr. Grodenchik paid “unwelcome and inappropriate” attention to the staff member by blowing her a kiss during a meeting, and hugging and kissing her at other times. The woman stopped attending meetings at City Hall to avoid Mr. Grodenchik, according to Councilman Steven Matteo, the chairman of the ethics committee. “I understand that my actions caused the Council staff member to suffer embarrassment, stress and discomfort and emotional distress, and that her work environment was adversely and negatively affected,” Mr. Grodenchik said in a statement. “I am deeply sorry for my conduct.” Mr. Grodenchik had initially denied the accusations, saying in an earlier statement that he had only briefly shaken hands with and hugged several colleagues after a meeting. He acknowledged yesterday that the statement did not “fully or accurately” reflect his behavior. As The Times reported, the City Council had hired Carrie H. Cohen, a former federal prosecutor, to prosecute Mr. Grodenchik. Mr. Matteo said the ethics committee agreed to forgo a disciplinary hearing only if he “agreed to terms in line with what the committee was likely to recommend proposing at the conclusion of the hearing.” In addition to resigning his chairmanship, Mr. Grodenchik will pay for and attend sexual harassment prevention training.

Harold Holzer is a Civil War-era historian who on Monday was thinking of more immediate affairs. “We have Bob Caro about to storm the place, in the storm,” Mr. Holzer said. Robert Caro, a Lyndon Johnson biographer, was expected to speak at Hunter College in Manhattan. But it was unseasonably cold and wet, and Mr. Holzer was wondering if Mr. Caro’s fans would materialize. (They did.) History buffs are also heading to the college, where Mr. Holzer works, for a glimpse into the life of a Johnson predecessor: The school is displaying a cache of (relatively) recently discovered letters written by Franklin Delano Roosevelt to Margaret Suckley, known as Daisy. Or, as Mr. Holzer described her, “his cousin and confidante and friend, or more — nobody really knows.” “It was a really close relationship,” Mr. Holzer added. The letters feed a curiosity that people, not just historians, have about world leaders. “I think there’s always intense interest about the private lives of American presidents,” Mr. Holzer said. “President Kennedy’s private life, President Clinton’s private life. All of these remain of huge interest to people.” Roosevelt sought (with some success) a level of privacy that seems unthinkable by today’s standards; notably, he kept his need for a wheelchair mostly quiet. But in the letters to Ms. Suckley, from 1935 to 1944, the American president is unguarded. He gossiped about world leaders. He acknowledged the difficulties of “having to keep on my ‘braces’ from early morn till nearly midnight.” And, just 11 months before his fatal stroke, Roosevelt wrote about having met with a doctor, but noted that his heart “does queer things still.” In our era of information overload, it’s odd to think back to a time when a president from New York used handwritten letters to discuss matters of the heart. Roosevelt sent the letters from all over the world, from Hyde Park, just north of New York City, to Casablanca, Morocco, where, as Mr. Holzer put it, the president was “probably completely exhausted and also planning D-Day.” Through the letters, he said, a person can practically peer inside Roosevelt’s inner sanctum. “It’s not edited. It’s not ghost written. It’s his outpouring of thoughts,” Mr. Holzer said. “The big mystery is, when did he find time to do this? It’s more than a tweet, and it’s more than an email. It takes time and effort and patience to write a longhand letter.” The comparisons to Roosevelt’s latest successor seem unavoidable. The letters, Mr. Holzer said, were “not meant for a million followers.” Instead, he said, they’re “meant for an audience of one that the writer knows is not going to share a word.” And indeed, that audience obliged. The letters were found in a suitcase under her bed after her death in 1991, at age 99. The Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute at Hunter College will display the letters through May 31.

My income was negligible, and I could barely afford even the cheap hotel where I was staying. Still, as I was walking through Herald Square, I couldn’t resist stopping to browse at a small used-book stall. I found a couple of “Saint” paperbacks by Leslie Charteris that I hadn’t read. I paid a nickel for each of them, and started to read one that evening. When I got to the end of the first chapter, I found a $10 bill tucked inside. A little further into the book, I found another one. I continued flipping through the book and ended up with five $10 bills.

2019,A Brandy That Nods to Pisco,"Front Burner Frísco, a spirit from Northern California, is distilled from wines made with Muscat de Alexandria grapes. San Francisco was the North American city that first embraced pisco, the Peruvian grape spirit, and drank it from the Gold Rush to Prohibition. It seems fitting that a new, clear, unaged brandy, inspired by pisco, comes from the area (it’s bottled in Ukiah, to the north). Punningly called Frísco, it is distilled in copper pot stills from wine based on Muscat de Alexandria grapes grown in California. The result is smooth and aromatic, with some heat (90 proof) and decided sweetness on the finish. It does not deliver the vanilla and dried fruit notes typical of brandy that has spent time in oak barrels, so it can stand in for vodka in summery cocktails.

2019,A Brexit Backlash in Local Elections: Main Parties Lose Seats,"LONDON — For months, there has been little doubt that the British electorate is disgusted, disillusioned and furious with the political dysfunction and the chaos of Brexit. But there hadn’t been an outlet for the public to vent that anger — until now. Across much of England, election results for around 8,400 local seats, tabulated on Friday, delivered a vicious backlash against the country’s two main political parties, the governing Conservatives and the Labour opposition. The Conservatives lost more than 1,300 seats, while Labour lost around 80. “What the voters have been saying is, ‘A plague on both your houses,’” Britain’s leading polling expert, John Curtice, a professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, told the BBC. It was a furious electoral tidal wave with unlikely winners: The centrist Liberal Democrats, Greens and Independents picked up hundreds of seats, even as they are marginalized in Parliament. Still, the local results seem unlikely to immediately alter the paralyzed state of Brexit, although that will be tested next week when talks resume between the Conservatives and Labour to try to find a compromise. For now, Britain seems stuck in a feedback loop, even as the country is facing the likelihood of holding European parliamentary elections in less than three weeks, despite trying to leave the bloc. The calculus in Parliament, where lawmakers have been unable to pass much of anything, remains unchanged. “We have the same situation as before — only more so,” said Anand Menon, professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King’s College London. “The incentives to agree to something are now greater, but the constraints on anyone’s ability to deliver that are probably greater, too.” The basics of Brexit, the troubled plan for Britain to quit the European Union. While the results increase pressure on political leaders to strike a deal across party lines on Brexit, their internal critics who strongly support or oppose Brexit are likely to be more implacably opposed to any possible solution, leaving a stalemate, Mr. Menon said. The infighting among Conservatives seems certain to continue: The local results summoned calls yet again for Prime Minister Theresa May to resign. Her rival, the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, is under pressure from the pro-Brexit and anti-Brexit wings of his own party. The local results show that Mr. Corbyn’s balancing act over Brexit, designed to appease both supporters and opponents of withdrawal, is pleasing neither side, presenting him with an excruciating dilemma. Some lawmakers representing pro-Brexit areas, mainly in the north and middle of England, want Mr. Corbyn to agree next week on a plan to help Mrs. May push withdrawal through a deadlocked Parliament in the hope that this will defuse the crisis. On Friday, Mr. Corbyn acknowledged that pressure when he told ITV News: “An arrangement has to be made, a deal has to be done, Parliament has to resolve this issue. I think that is very, very clear.” But an equally vocal faction, representing most of the party’s members, wants Labour to commit to putting any Brexit agreement back to the voters in a referendum with an option to remain in the bloc — an idea that Mr. Corbyn has so far resisted. As for Mrs. May, her position is under more pressure than ever, though she has already promised to stand aside once her Brexit withdrawal agreement has been approved. In a new low for her premiership, she was heckled on Friday at a meeting of her own party members in Wales by a former county councilor, Stuart Davies, who called for her to resign. Mrs. May, who is nothing if not stubborn, acknowledged in her speech to Conservative Party members in Wales that the results of Thursday’s elections had been “very difficult.” Mr. Corbyn, for his part, speaking in the north of England, said he was disappointed by the results and “wanted to do better.” Though big losses had been predicted for the Conservative Party, with many questioning Mrs. May’s leadership over Brexit, Labour’s disappointing performance was more of a surprise, analysts said, particularly given the recent chaos surrounding Mrs. May’s government. According to a BBC projection, the Conservatives and Labour would tie at just 28 percent of the vote if a similar pattern were repeated nationally. In a 2017 general election the two parties together scooped up more than four-fifths of the vote. Worse is likely to come for Britain’s two big political parties. They must now gear up for elections to the European Parliament on May 23, when two new parties that did not run on Thursday will take part: the Brexit Party, which backs leaving the European Union quickly and without an agreement if necessary; and Change UK, which wants to remain in the bloc. The Brexit Party, led by Nigel Farage, the former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party, is being particularly closely watched — recent opinion polls suggest it is tied with Labour for the lead in those elections, or even ahead, and taking much of its support from former Conservative voters. But as usual in Britain, politicians are drawing different conclusions from the latest Brexit-induced crisis. On Friday, Mrs. May argued that “there was a simple message from yesterday’s elections to both us and the Labour Party: Just get on and deliver Brexit.” But some Conservative lawmakers saw the results as a verdict on Mrs. May and called on her to resign, or at least name a date for her departure. On the Labour side, the shadow chancellor John McDonnell underscored confusion over his party’s stance by writing on Twitter that the message from local elections had been, “Brexit — sort it,” adding, “Message received.” But when that was seen as a suggestion that an agreement on Brexit with Mrs. May was becoming more likely, Mr. McDonnell protested that he had been misinterpreted. “I was simply making the point we need to get on with sorting this out whichever way,” he wrote.",The New York Times
2019,"A Broken Skull, a Dubious Paper Trail: Australian Justice for One Aboriginal Man","Medical records obtained by The New York Times suggest Patrick Cumaiyi was a victim of police brutality that fits a pattern in Australia — including a cover-up. Patrick Cumaiyi has been imprisoned for three years after pleading guilty to several charges, including assaulting two officers. But records indicate he was a victim of police brutality.CreditCredit DARWIN, Australia — Patrick Cumaiyi boarded a small plane on the airstrip in Wadeye, one of Australia’s most remote Aboriginal communities, and waved to his family with shackled hands. He was being flown to Darwin, the capital of Australia’s Northern Territory, to face a domestic-violence complaint. But before takeoff, an argument broke out. An officer delivered a sharp blow to Mr. Cumaiyi’s head with a metal flashlight, according to witnesses on board, then another officer dragged Mr. Cumaiyi headfirst onto the tarmac. In a video from the scene, about 20 people can be heard shouting in distress. “Warrundut pelpith!” — “He landed on his head!” — screams a woman in Murrinh-Patha, the native language of the 2,200 people who live in Wadeye, a tropical outpost in Australia’s far north. By The New York Times “I just sat down and cried,” said Stephanie Berida, Mr. Cumaiyi’s aunt, who was present. “What could we do?” The treatment of Mr. Cumaiyi, which left him with a fractured skull, provides a rare glimpse into an Australia that has never fully shed the dark legacies of its colonial past. Police abuse of Aboriginal Australians, including failure to provide medical care, remains a persistent problem, with nearly 150 Indigenous people dying in custody in the last decade alone. Mr. Cumaiyi’s experience adds another troubling facet: Medical records and other documentation obtained and verified by The New York Times suggest that not only was he a victim of police brutality, but also that health officials and the police covered up the causes and severity of his injuries, while the courts nodded without question. In places like Wadeye, this casual disregard for black lives is frighteningly common. The town, which can be reached only by boat or plane during the rainy season, is a world unto itself. Systemic racism and abuse often grow unchecked in remote hamlets like this one, where a white minority dominates the police, health care and other services for a population that is almost entirely Aboriginal. “There is no scrutiny in places like Wadeye — they can do whatever they like,” said Marcia Langton, an anthropologist at the University of Melbourne who has worked in remote communities. “Aboriginal people are processed, and nobody pays much attention.” [For more Australia coverage with perspective, sign up for the Australia Letter.] Mr. Cumaiyi, 31 and described as shy by relatives, was never prosecuted for domestic violence after his arrest. Nonetheless, nearly three years later, he is still in a Darwin prison after pleading guilty to other charges, including assaulting two officers and “endangering the safety of an aircraft.” Now, Stewart Levitt, one of Australia’s most prominent lawyers, is demanding that Mr. Cumaiyi’s case be reconsidered. He lodged a complaint on Wednesday with the Australian Human Rights Commission, accusing the Australian government of human rights violations and negligence stemming from systemic racial discrimination. Mr. Levitt said the evidence of a cover-up was clear: The official police account said nothing about the eyewitness reports that Mr. Cumaiyi was struck in the head with a flashlight and slammed onto the tarmac. Instead, it suggests that he hurt himself the day after his arrest by jumping from a police van traveling at 50 miles, or about 80 kilometers, per hour — a claim that two medical experts dismissed as unlikely given his injuries, and that Mr. Levitt called “implausible, counterintuitive and not witnessed by anyone.” The Northern Territory Police Force did not respond to requests for comment about the case. Mr. Levitt, who won a large judgment last year for another Indigenous community confronting police mistreatment, said that “there seems to have been a determined effort to deflect all attention away from the police assaults.” He added, “This is an example of the racial discrimination that’s so endemic.” Mr. Cumaiyi’s treatment fits a pattern in Australia. In 2008, a Ngaanyatjarra elder died of heat stroke in Western Australia after being kept for hours in a prison van where temperatures reached more than 130 degrees Fahrenheit (about 55 degrees Celsius). In 2014, a 22-year-old Aboriginal woman who had been jailed for unpaid fines died after she suffered complications from a broken rib. A year later, David Dungay Jr., a 26-year-old Indigenous Australian with asthma, died in a Sydney prison cell after repeatedly telling officers he could not breathe. And last month, an Aboriginal woman, Cherdeena Wynne, 26, died in the hospital five days after she became unresponsive after being handcuffed by the police in Perth. In all, between 2008 and 2018, 147 Indigenous people — who make up 3 percent of Australia’s population but 27 percent of its prison population — died while under the care of the authorities. The deaths have continued to occur even after a royal commission running from 1987 to 1991 investigated the problem and made 339 recommendations to improve the safety of Aboriginal Australians interacting with the police. “One of the main recommendations of the royal commission involved duty of care,” said Dr. Langton, who served on the commission. “You can see over and over again — in every case since the commission — health officers, hospital staff, police, they don’t abide by the principle of duty of care. They just process people.” Especially in places like Wadeye (pronounced wad-air), scholars say, Australia’s colonial past cannot be separated from its present. The town, about 250 miles from Darwin, has been a tribal meeting place for thousands of years. But it is also a mission town where in 1935 a Catholic priest gathered 20 different clans to be “civilized.” More recently, the government’s presence in Wadeye has tended to float in and out. Government housing is in short supply. There often is no full-time doctor. The town’s 13 police officers typically stay for two years, then move on. [Massacres shaped Australia’s past. Read how one small town grappled with history.] “For the people flying in, what often gets set in place is an ‘us versus them’ mentality,” said Sean Bowden, a lawyer in Darwin who represented the town in litigation that forced a change to a discriminatory school-funding formula. Tensions among clans and between residents and the police have often boiled over. In 2004, a police officer fatally shot an Aboriginal teenager in Wadeye; in 2017, an officer fired warning shots after being confronted by residents. Mr. Cumaiyi’s own run-in with the police came a few months earlier. Based on his investigation so far, Mr. Levitt said the altercation on the plane on Nov. 9, 2016, started when Mr. Cumaiyi asked for his wrist restraints to be loosened. An officer refused, leading to an argument. Two prisoners who were on the plane with Mr. Cumaiyi, Mr. Levitt said, insisted in separate interviews that a police officer hit him with a two-foot metal flashlight. The official paper trail begins immediately after Mr. Cumaiyi — who stood 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighed 135 pounds — was dragged off the plane and taken to the Wadeye Health Clinic. A nurse’s report states that he had been “tackled twice” and “subdued with punches to the head and body.” It noted several injuries, including “swelling to the left temporal lobe.” But Mr. Cumaiyi was not referred to a doctor, violating protocols for head injuries and potentially risking death. Instead, he spent the night in a cell. By the time he reached Darwin the following afternoon, a new story had emerged. A referral letter sent to Royal Darwin Hospital points to a separate incident from that morning, on Nov. 10 — “escaping from top of vehicle as it was travelling approximately 80klms per hour.” The police asserted in court that, as they tried to drive Mr. Cumaiyi to Darwin, he kicked the roof of the van twice before jumping out. The referral letter lists his injuries as “trauma to left ear, superficial abrasions to left skull, left elbow and both knees.” Dr. Timothy Peltz, a reconstructive plastic surgeon in Sydney, said it was “rather comical” to expect only “superficial abrasions” from a fall at highway speeds. Dr. John Crozier, a trauma surgeon, said that “a fatal outcome would not be uncommon, with a high likelihood of multiple fractures.” One of Mr. Cumaiyi’s aunts, Christine Cumaiyi, said he had told her “it was a setup.” Adding doubt to the police account, a CT scan performed at the Darwin hospital found a left temporal bone fracture and damage to Mr. Cumaiyi’s ribs — injuries consistent with those reported by the nurse the day of his arrest. No new injuries, which would be expected if he had jumped out of a moving vehicle a day later, were identified. The Northern Territory Health Department, citing patient privacy laws, declined to answer questions about Mr. Cumaiyi’s diagnosis and care. Even now, Mr. Cumaiyi’s family says he seems different, morose, confused, possibly suffering from a brain injury. “He was such a happy boy,” said his mother, Assumpta Gumbaduck, recalling a time when Mr. Cumaiyi enjoyed music and dancing. “Until this.”",The New York Times

[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] The blaze was so intense that the heat melted the inside of the car.

Her father had fled the car as it burst into flames, the authorities said. He also caught on fire and plunged into a nearby pond to save himself. The police said that they were treating the child’s death on Sunday night in Queens as a homicide and that the girl’s father, Martin Pereira, 39, had been taken into custody for questioning. Investigators believe Mr. Pereira intentionally set the blaze that killed his daughter, a police official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss an open investigation. Mr. Pereira was discovered in a shallow pond a short distance from the car, the police said. He was taken to Weill Cornell Medical Center’s burn unit, where he was recovering from extensive burns. Investigators found two gas canisters — one in front of the car and one in the rear seat — and a 20-pound propane tank in the trunk. The tank had a hose attached to it that ran into the back seat, according to a city official close to the investigation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release information. While Mr. Pereira’s possible motives were still unclear, investigators said he and Zoey’s mother had been engaged but broke up in March. They were embroiled in a custody dispute and had been due in Family Court on Monday to discuss a child support arrangement. Mr. Pereira, 39, a construction worker, had been distraught in recent weeks over the custody battle, one of his former co-workers, Angel Rivera, said. Mr. Pereira had told Mr. Rivera that the court was against him and had complained he was only going to see his daughter every two weeks. “There was a lot of stress building up in him,” Mr. Rivera said. “It made him explode up like that.” The episode is the latest in a string of cases in which children have been killed during custody battles between parents. The Center for Judicial Excellence, an organization that tracks the safety of children in family court disputes, estimates that 679 have been killed by a divorcing or separated parent throughout the country since 2008, or about 60 each year. Nearly a year ago, a 47-year-old mother killed her 7-year-old son by pushing him off the balcony of the Gotham Hotel in Midtown Manhattan before jumping herself. She had also been in a custody dispute. The city Administration for Children’s Services had a file of past complaints concerning Zoey, but the reports appeared to be related to her parents’ custody battle, said an official familiar with the situation, who was not authorized to release the information. It is not uncommon for a parent in a custody dispute to accuse the other of abuse, the official said. Mr. Rivera, the former work colleague, said Mr. Pereira had expressed fears that his daughter was being physically abused and exposed to marijuana smoke. He had told Mr. Rivera that Zoey’s mother had punched him in the face during one fight. “I said, ‘Why didn’t you go straight to the police?’” Mr. Rivera recalled. “‘Maybe if you had, you could get custody of your daughter easier.’” Zoey’s mother, Cherone Coleman, declined a request for an interview. Mr. Pereira was arrested once before, six years ago, on charges of aggravated harassment involving a young woman, but the outcome of the case was sealed, the police said. The episode that ended with Zoey’s death began shortly before 9 p.m. on Sunday, when the authorities responded to a 911 call for a car on fire near Baisley Pond Park in the Springfield Gardens neighborhood, the police said. A witness told investigators that Mr. Pereira, in flames, ran from the car and jumped into the pond in the park, the city official said. When the witness raced to give him a blanket, he said, “I have my child in the car.” The witness also told the police he had seen Mr. Pereira driving erratically, the official said. The car had mounted the sidewalk and turned around before stopping at 154th Street and Baisley Boulevard. The official said the two rear doors of the Audi sedan had been chained shut from the inside. The heat melted the door handles, allowing firefighters to pry them open despite the chain and free the toddler. Firefighters pulled her out and began chest compressions, eventually taking her to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead. Photos of the car showed the extent of the blaze. The plastic and leather upholstery was charred to a crisp, and fabric hung like stalactites. A chain was seen on the floor in the rear of the vehicle. At the scene on Monday, a few relatives laid flowers on the side of the road. They declined to talk to a reporter. On a Facebook page, Mr. Pereira posted several pictures of himself with the little girl. Just hours before the fire, he had updated the cover photo, showing the girl sitting in a room decorated with pink and purple balloons. “I cannot believe my friend did that,” Mr. Rivera said.

2019,A Buzzer-Beater Sinks the Liberty in Their Opener,"A layup by Teaira McCowan at the buzzer lifted the Indiana Fever to an 81-80 win over the host Liberty on Friday night in the season opener for both teams. Tina Charles had made two free throws to give the Liberty a 1-point lead with seven seconds left. Then on the final possession, Candice Dupree drove the lane and dished the ball off to McCowan, who laid it in just before the buzzer sounded. The officials did a quick video review to confirm that the basket counted. Tiffany Mitchell led Indiana with 22 points. Her free throw with 2 minutes 16 seconds left gave Indiana a 79-78 lead. Neither team could score again until the final seven seconds. Charles had a game-high 32 points and 12 rebounds. McCowan, the Fever’s first-round draft pick, finished with 11 points. This was the Liberty’s first regular-season game under their new owner, Joe Tsai. An investment group led by Tsai bought the Liberty in late January. Tsai, who helped found the e-commerce giant Alibaba Group, bought a 49 percent stake in the Nets last year. Tsai was in attendance in White Plains, along with the incoming W.N.B.A. commissioner, Cathy Engelbert, and Mark Tatum, the acting W.N.B.A. president. Engelbert officially starts on July 17 after finishing her current job as chief executive of Deloitte US next month. The three met at the half. Indiana got off to a rough start, missing its first eight shots before a layup by Shenise Johnson nearly five minutes into the game. Johnson sat out last year while recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament tear sustained in 2017, and then a hamstring injury. Indiana built a 39-33 lead at the half, despite 16 points by Charles. The lead grew to 54-42 with 3:19 left in the third before Reshanda Gray and Bria Hartley rallied the Liberty, who scored 18 of the final 20 points to end the period. Gray’s putback with three seconds left capped the run and made it 60-56 for the Liberty.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | A Case for Mercy,"Northern Ireland, Adnan Syed and life behind bars. Opinion Columnist This article is part of David Leonhardt’s newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday. I’ve been thinking lately about the concept of mercy. I started thinking about it while reading an excellent book called “Say Nothing,” by Patrick Radden Keefe. It’s a history of the Troubles, the long war between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland that was full of horrific violence — extrajudicial assassinations by British troops, bombings by the Irish Republican Army (known as the I.R.A.), shootings, stonings and more. Many I.R.A. members served time in prison during the Troubles, sometimes long stretches. But even the people whom Keefe describes being convicted of violent acts, like bombings, eventually tended to get out of prison. As terrible as the conflict was, the British laws, courts and government leaders — including even at times hard-liners like Margaret Thatcher — still retained some sense of mercy. And the I.R.A. members who were released often went on to lead productive, nonviolent lives. [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] Around the same time that I finished reading “Say Nothing,” I also watched “The Case Against Adnan Syed,” a four-part documentary by H.B.O. A few years ago, Syed was also the subject of the first season of the megahit podcast Serial. Despite murky evidence, he was convicted in 2000 of killing his ex-girlfriend, Hae Min Lee. They were both in high school at the time. I finished the H.B.O. series still not sure whether he committed the crime or not, which is also how I felt after listening to Serial. But a few things are clear: The prosecution’s version of the crime doesn’t stand up to scrutiny. It’s based on an implausible timeline, an unreliable witness and questionable cellphone records. Syed also suffered from having an incompetent lawyer at his trial. Given these issues, two different Maryland courts recently ordered his conviction to be vacated, which would have led to a new trial. But a panel of appellate judges recently ruled against him, by a vote of four to three, reinstating his original conviction. Syed is again facing the prospect of spending the rest of his life in prison for a murder he may not have committed. I wish the facts were clearer — that his innocence or guilt could be established. But that seems unlikely. Instead, we’re left with a 38-year-old man who was convicted on dubious evidence, in a trial that fell well short of fairness. He has already spent nearly 20 years behind bars. The just outcome remains unknowable. The merciful outcome — unless he’s convicted again, at a new trial — is for him to go free, sooner rather than later. For more Serial doesn’t take sides on whether Syed committed the crime. The H.B.O. show does, arguing that he’s innocent. Vox’s Aja Romano offered both praise and criticism for the H.B.O. show, noting that it raised good questions about the prosecution’s case but also failed to grapple honestly with inconvenient evidence. “As someone who personally believes in Syed’s probable innocence, and who definitely believes his trial was unjust, I was left frustrated by The Case Against Adnan Syed’s unwillingness to objectively present me with the case against Syed — especially given how loudly the case for his innocence has already been trumpeted,” Romano wrote. In Slate, Mark Joseph Stern wrote: “I do not know if Adnan Syed killed Hae Min Lee on Jan. 13, 1999, and neither do you … What matters is that the prosecution of Adnan Syed comports with the Constitution — and so far, it plainly has not. We all deserve better than this masquerade of justice.” If you are not a subscriber to this newsletter, you can subscribe here. You can also join me on Twitter (@DLeonhardt) and Facebook.

2019,"Opinion | A Century Ago, America Built Another Kind of Wall","There was a time when even Ivy League scientists supported racial restrictions at the border. Mr. Okrent is the author of a forthcoming book on the history of immigration and race in America. In early 1921, an article in Good Housekeeping signaled the coming of a law that makes President Trump’s campaign for immigration restriction seem mild by comparison. “Biological laws tell us that certain divergent people will not mix or blend,” it read. “The dead weight of alien accretion stifles national progress.” The author was Calvin Coolidge, about to be sworn in as vice president of the United States. Three years later, the most severe immigration law in American history entered the statute books, shepherded by believers in those “biological laws.” The anti-immigrant fervor at the heart of current White House policymaking is not a new phenomenon, nor is the xenophobia that has infected the political mainstream. In fact, race-based nativism comes with an exalted pedigree — and that pedigree is something we all should remember as the Trump administration continues its assault on immigrants of specific nationalities. The scientific arguments Coolidge invoked were advanced by men bearing imposing credentials. Some were highly regarded scholars from Harvard, Princeton, Yale and Stanford. One ran the nation’s foremost genetics laboratory. Another was America’s leading environmentalist at the time. Yet another was the director of the country’s most respected natural history museum. Together, they popularized “racial eugenics,” a junk science that made ethnically based racism respectable. “The day of the sociologist is passing,” said the Harvard professor Robert DeCourcy Ward, “and the day of the biologist has come.” The biologists and their publicists achieved what their political allies had failed to accomplish for 30 years: enactment of a law stemming the influx of Jews, Italians, Greeks and other eastern and southern Europeans. “The need of restriction is manifest,” The New York Times declared in an editorial, for “American institutions are menaced” by “swarms of aliens.” Keeping people out of the country because of their nationality was hardly a novel idea. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was avowedly racist. In 1923 a unanimous Supreme Court declared that immigrants from India could be barred from citizenship strictly on racial grounds. What was different about the new, putatively scientific campaign was that even whiteness was no ticket to entry. Writing about Slavic immigrants, the sociologist Edward A. Ross of the University of Wisconsin — later the national chairman of the American Civil Liberties Union — declared, they “are immune to certain kinds of dirt. They can stand what would kill a white man.” The president of Massachusetts Institute of Technology said newcomers from eastern and southern Europe were “vast masses of filth” who were “living like swine.” The Washington Post editorialized that 90 percent of Italians coming to the United States were “the degenerate spawn” of “Asiatic hordes.” A Boston philanthropist, Joseph Lee, his city’s leading supporter of progressive causes, explained to friends why he became the single largest financial backer of the anti-immigrant campaign: His concern, he wrote, was that without a restriction law, Europe would be “drained of Jews — to its benefit no doubt but not to ours.” The “biological” justifications for this nativism were first developed in Cold Spring Harbor, on Long Island, in laboratories financed by the widow of the railroad baron E.H. Harriman. (One of her goals, Mary Harriman said, was preventing “the decay of the American race.”) The laboratory’s head, the zoologist Charles B. Davenport, took the ideas of the British gentleman scientist Francis Galton — who had coined the word “eugenics” in 1883 — welded them to a gross misunderstanding of the genetic discoveries of Gregor Mendel, and concluded that the makeup of the nation’s population could be improved by the careful control of human breeding. One of the first steps, he believed, was to impose new controls on open immigration. At first, Davenport wished to bar the immigration only of people afflicted by specific disorders — epileptics, the “feebleminded” and others of similarly troublesome (to Davenport) disability. But soon he was caught up in a racialist whirlwind initiated by “The Passing of the Great Race,” a book by Madison Grant, the founder of the Bronx Zoo and the era’s most prominent conservationist. A bilious stew of dubious history, bogus anthropology and completely unfounded genetic theory, Grant’s work persuaded Davenport and others that the American bloodstream was threatened not by suspect individuals, but by entire ethnic groups. First published in 1916 and reissued in a series of revisions over the next eight years — all of them brought into print by Maxwell Perkins, the celebrated editor of F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway — “The Passing of the Great Race” savagely denigrated the peoples of eastern and southern Europe while exalting the “Nordics” of northwestern Europe. With the presumed authority of scholarship, he summarized the essential argument of racial eugenics. “Whether we like to admit it or not,” Grant wrote, “the result of the mixture of two races, in the long run, gives us a race reverting” to the “lower type.” Lower than Nordics were the questionable “Alpines.” Lower than the “Alpines” were the woeful “Mediterraneans.” And, he concluded, “the cross between any of the three European races and a Jew is a Jew.” Grant was not an actual scientist. But Henry Fairfield Osborn, a world-famous paleontologist and his closest friend, definitely was. Osborn, who once expressed his opposition to the extension of the Westchester Parkway near his country estate because it would bring thousands of “East Side Jews” to the area, presided over the American Museum of Natural History for 25 years, and made that institution the beating heart of the combined eugenics and anti-immigration movement. “I am convinced,” said Osborn, that the “spiritual, physical, moral and intellectual structure” of individuals is “based on racial characteristics.” It wasn’t a matter of ethnic bias, he said — it was “cold-blooded” science. Other scholars rallied to the cause. Robert M. Yerkes — his name immortalized today at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center in Atlanta — conducted a severely flawed series of tests of American servicemen purporting to establish the intellectual inferiority of eastern and southern Europeans. Charles W. Gould, a lawyer in New York, sponsored “A Study of American Intelligence,” by Carl C. Brigham, a young Princeton psychologist (and later the inventor of the SAT). Brigham’s conclusion: “There can be no doubt that recent history has shown a movement of inferior peoples or inferior representatives of peoples to this country.” At the same time, Perkins and his colleagues at Charles Scribner’s Sons published a raft of books promoting racialized eugenics. Scribner publicists wrote in one promotion piece: “The inrush of lower races is threatening the very blood of our country.” Perkins’s authors were echoed in the country’s leading magazine, The Saturday Evening Post. “Race character is as fixed a fact as race color,” the Post declared. “Thirty years ago,” the magazine insisted in another article, “science had not perhaps sufficiently advanced to make us fully aware” of the danger of open immigration. Now it had. When the 1924 Immigration Act reached the floor of Congress, passage was assured. Albert Johnson, chairman of the House Immigration and Naturalization Committee, declared that “the fundamental reason” for immigration restriction was “biological.” During the floor debate, one congressman said the law was provoked by “the necessity for purifying and keeping pure the blood of America.” Given the arguments presented by so many of the nation’s leading scientific figures, who could disagree? The resulting law established quotas by nation; they cut like a scythe. In the last year before their introduction, more than 220,000 Italians entered the United States. The quota slashed that number to less than 4,000. Reductions nearly as harsh were imposed on other eastern and southern European groups, while tens of thousands of slots reserved for Britons, Scandinavians and other “Nordics” went unfilled. The 1924 quotas remained in force for more than 40 years — while the economic devastation of a worldwide depression hit southern Europe especially hard; while a 1939 measure that would have allowed 20,000 German Jewish children into the United States died in Congress, and the savagery of the Holocaust began; while the Nazis and their allies starved 350,000 Greeks and slaughtered 200,000 Serbs; and while displaced-persons camps stretched across the ruins of postwar Europe. In 1920, Charles Davenport had asked Madison Grant, “Can we build a wall high enough around this country” to keep out the unwanted? They could, and they did.

2019,Opinion | A Chain of Species Destruction at Yellowstone,"The havoc caused by stocking the park’s lake for sport fishing ravaged ospreys, pelicans, bald eagles, grizzly bears and the lake’s own native cutthroat trout. Contributing Writer Recreational fishing is a pastime in which people have come to expect the fish they want in the places they happen to want them. That is, they want their fish stocked and ready to catch, even in places those fish never originally lived. This practice can seem harmless, or even beneficial. But the introduction of one “beneficial” species in Yellowstone National Park suggests how rejiggering the natural world for human convenience can cause ecological disaster for almost everything else. All it took at Yellowstone Lake, the 136-square-mile centerpiece of the park, was the introduction of lake trout, a fish originally found mainly in the Northeast and Canada and beloved by anglers everywhere. The federal government had transplanted them to smaller lakes within the park in the 1890s, a time when planting fish in remote fishless lakes seemed like a smart way to spread around America’s amazing abundance. But a century later, in 1994, the introduced species turned up in Yellowstone Lake, which was already celebrated for its own native Yellowstone cutthroat trout. Park managers theorized that an angler illegally introduced the fish, either by accident or in the misguided belief that it would improve a big lake with plenty of potential for further sportfishing. One result is that anglers now catch 20,000 lake trout a year there. But the lake trout went on to gorge on the young of the cutthroat trout, and the population of the native subspecies plummeted. Because there were fewer cutthroat trout around to eat them, large water fleas soon proliferated. The water fleas in turn gobbled up the microscopic plants at the bottom of the food web, causing the lake water to become clearer and probably also warmer near the surface, according to a new study published in the journal Science Advances. When the cutthroat trout largely vanished from the shallow waters they prefer, the lake trout didn’t take their place, because they like deeper waters. So the switch deprived ospreys, white pelicans, bald eagles and other fish-eating birds of their main food source. The osprey population around the lake soon dropped from 38 nesting pairs, with almost 60 percent of them successfully fledging young birds, to just three nests with zero success. Eagles likewise declined almost to a level last seen during the height of DDT use in the 1960s, again with zero reproductive success. Because far fewer cutthroat trout were making their springtime spawning run up streams around the lake, grizzly and black bears that once lined the banks to feed on them had to go elsewhere in search of food. The density of river otters also fell to the lowest levels known for that species. To casual park visitors the lake no doubt still looked wild and beautiful (that clear water!). But it was like visiting a celebrated European city when all the locals have vanished and everybody you bump into is a tourist. What happened at Yellowstone Lake is a familiar story for conservationists, because fish stocking has produced cascading ecological disasters pretty much everywhere. For this, Americans can thank Robert B. Roosevelt, a 19th century congressman, conservationist, and uncle of Theodore Roosevelt. He was the fishing world’s version of the infamous New Yorker who set out to give his fellow Americans every bird mentioned in Shakespeare and instead bequeathed us a plague of starlings. Roosevelt was a leading proponent of the post-Civil War “fish culture movement,” which espoused hatchery-reared fish as a means of replenishing depleted stocks of native species. But Roosevelt also promoted hatcheries as a tool for swapping species willy-nilly across the continent and the globe, with fish eggs shipped “from one end of our country to the other with as little trouble or danger” as a letter dropped in the mail. “Rivers that are now deserted could be filled to repletion,” Roosevelt gushed, “so that there would be abundance for netters, seiners, and fishermen of all kinds, whether they fished in season or out of season, early or late, and with murderous or legitimate implements. This is the object to be obtained.” In 1871, Congress established the United States Fish Commission, the first federal agency set up to address the depletion of a natural resource. Roosevelt ensured that the legislation included a mandate to move fish into new territories. “There is no reason why the waters of the West should be less prolific than those of the East,” he argued, “provided the right species were introduced; and were trout, salmon, bass, shad and sturgeon to take the place of catfish, pickerel and suckers, the gain would be manifest.” Some anglers even now subscribe to this magical belief that introducing new species and replacing dull natives with flashy newcomers will make everything better. Until recently, many state fish and wildlife agencies — largely funded by hunting and fishing license fees — felt the same way, introducing new species as a matter of policy. But these introductions have had disaster built in from the start. “Think about it,” the University of Washington ecologist Julian D. Olden recently told Scientific American. “The fish that we stock are those that grow rapidly, are highly fecund, and are great on the end of the hook. It shouldn’t be too surprising that the same attributes we love as anglers are also responsible for the high impacts we are witnessing on native species and ecosystems.” So what can we do about it now? The spectacle of a pristine ecosystem being wrecked almost overnight forced Yellowstone to undertake a major effort to remove lake trout, according to Todd Koel, who heads the park’s native fish conservation program. As a result, the cutthroat trout population is slowly recovering and the spawning run in nearby streams is rebuilding. But the control program costs taxpayers and donors $2 million a year and will continue to do so, says Dr. Koel, “for the foreseeable future.” A better plan is of course to prevent these introductions from happening in the first place. Some anglers now recognize the threat and work to educate other anglers about how doing things that may seem beneficial or even humane — dumping a bucket of live bait at the end of the day, or releasing unwanted fish from one lake into another — can wreck the fishing for everybody else. Some jurisdictions have also begun to enlist anglers in the control effort, by removing bag limits or banning catch-and-release for problem species. At Yellowstone Lake, the rules announce in bold face and italics that lake trout “must be killed — it is illegal to release them alive.” State and federal agencies have refrained in recent decades from stocking nonnative species into new territories. Some agencies have also begun to designate native species conservation areas, removing barriers to upstream spawning areas and maintaining barriers against downstream intruders. But the practice of stocking nonnative fish into water bodies where they already exist remains standard for now, because the people who pay fishing license fees want it and an entire recreational fishing industry depends on it. The theory, in any case, is that the damage is already done — though that may prove to be wishful thinking, as increased flooding causes introduced species to spread to new habitats, and to still other new habitats beyond that. A Saturday morning spent fishing is at least still an opportunity to get outdoors and enjoy what nature remains to us — and maybe even forget for a little while the recent news about the extinction emergency now threatening a million or more species worldwide. But for an angler standing by a stream and casting out a line, the thought that rises helplessly to mind is that every species we lose, every habitat we compromise in the name of “human convenience,” is one more piece of the American character and of our own souls inadvertently washed away into oblivion.

2019,A Changing Sumo Will Welcome a Slipper-Clad Trump Into the Ring,"TOKYO — Like sushi, Mount Fuji and kimonos, the ancient sport of sumo wrestling is a touchstone of traditional Japanese culture. On Sunday, President Trump plans to attend the final match of an annual summer tournament in Tokyo, where he will present a custom-made trophy to the winner, drawing international attention to the country’s national sport. The four-day presidential visit to Japan comes at a time when sumo, with its ritualized spectacle of oversize men grappling in carefully coifed topknots and loincloths, has come under intense scrutiny for discriminatory practices, hidebound traditions and bullying scandals. Yet the sport also reflects a pivotal moment for Japanese society as it inches away from a deep-rooted insularity and opens to an increasing number of foreign workers. Many traditions of sumo, whose origins can be traced to early Shinto rites and ceremonies conducted in eighth-century imperial courts, have not changed in more than 200 years. But in at least one regard, the sport has been transformed in recent decades, as a growing number of its champions have come from abroad. Today, about a quarter of sumo’s top-ranked wrestlers are foreign-born. More and more fans are also coming from abroad to enjoy sumo’s combination of brute force and nuanced psychological maneuvers, buoying sold-out tournaments, known as bashos, around the country. Mr. Trump will be the first American president to present a trophy at a sumo tournament, although foreign ambassadors and other dignitaries often hand out special cups to the winning wrestlers. Some critics in Japan are dismayed that the final bouts of the spring tournament are being turned into a diplomatic showcase for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Mr. Trump. “Trump is taking a seat for Abe’s promotion,” said Shizuka Wada, the author of “A View of a Female Sumo Fan.” Ms. Wada said that she resented seeing her favorite sport being used to advance a political agenda. “It looks ridiculous,” she said. “I just don’t want them to use sumo for such a purpose.” For some, the agitation is intensified because Mr. Trump and his entourage will displace some fans who bought advance tickets and have now required special accommodations. While fans with ringside seats typically sit on the floor on cushions atop traditional tatami straw mats, Mr. Trump at ringside will be given a low-backed chair, according to an official working on logistics for the visit who was not authorized to speak publicly. And while shoes are not allowed in the sumo ring, Mr. Trump will be given a pair of slippers to wear when he steps inside to award the trophy. There is no official word yet on whether the trophy will bear Mr. Trump’s name and, if so, how big the lettering may be. A Foreign Ministry official said it would be a “president’s cup,” but declined to give further details. Experts say there are likely to be a few other adjustments. Typically, when fans celebrate an upset victory, they fling their seat cushions, or zabuton, toward the ring. Such actions take place in spite of official prohibitions, but with Mr. Trump at ringside, Secret Service officers are likely to clamp down. Minor disruptions aside, analysts of the longstanding alliance between the United States and Japan say that Mr. Abe chose shrewdly in extending the sumo invitation to Mr. Trump, who for decades appeared on television in the United States at professional wrestling extravaganzas. “It kind of embodies the very muscular kind of power that he likes,” said Sheila A. Smith, a Japan expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. “It’s maybe a more comfortable and interesting setting for him than some of the more pomp-and-circumstance red carpet settings.” The spring basho runs for two weeks, and there have already been some upsets. The final is likely to be a nail-biter, with the championship expected to come down to a battle between a Japanese wrestler and a top-ranked Mongolian wrestler, whose countrymen have dominated the sport for almost two decades. Seasoned sumo watchers say the prominence of foreign-born wrestlers shows that the sport has in some ways been at the vanguard of Japan’s incremental globalization. Sumo wrestlers from Hawaii came to Japan in the 1980s, and champions from Bulgaria, Georgia, Estonia and Mongolia followed. There has been some backlash, but for the most part, Japanese fans have embraced the new champions. “Sumo, which is the most Japanese of sports, was under no pressure to do so, but opened its doors to foreign workers decades ago,” said John Gunning, an Irish-born, English-language sumo commentator on NHK, the public broadcaster, who represented Ireland in the world sumo championships. “There might be an image of them being an old, stuffy, conservative organization, which is an accusation that has some merit,” said Mr. Gunning, who also writes a sumo column for The Japan Times. “But in general, they have led the way and shown Japan this is what can be done and the world doesn’t come to an end just because you let a few foreigners in.” As Japan prepares to admit more foreign workers in the face of severe labor shortages, some analysts regard foreign-born sumo wrestlers as “model immigrants.” “They work hard, master the language and are well adopted into the society,” said Satoshi Miyazaki, a linguist at Waseda University and author of “Why Do Foreign Sumo Wrestlers Speak Fluent Japanese?” In other respects, sumo has been fiercely criticized for its outdated traditions. Last spring during an exhibition match in Kyoto, a referee shooed women out of a ring when they rushed to offer lifesaving measures to a politician who had collapsed while delivering a speech. The incident set off a media firestorm about whether the sport was using its tradition of barring women from the ring as an excuse to reinforce gender discrimination. The Japan Sumo Association, which governs the sport, has committed only to studying the issue. Sumo’s rigid rules and customs — wrestlers are not allowed to drive; about 90 percent of them are not paid; and younger apprentices are required to clean, cook and perform endless tasks for their elders — have created a culture in which hazing and bullying have led to some high-profile scandals. Allegations of match fixing and of ties to organized crime have also plagued the sport. “Tradition is not an absolute value,” said Takayuki Harada, a professor of criminal psychology at the University of Tsukuba. “It should be changed. We need to raise awareness for human rights.” Although sumo continues to garner a sizable fan base, some experts warn that could change if the sport does not modernize. The sumo association “sits back as they are enjoying lots of fans,” said Takanobu Nakajima, a professor of economics at Keio University who served on an independent committee to review the governance of sumo after the match-rigging scandal was exposed. “But most of the fans are getting old. So can sumo survive in the future?”",The New York Times
2019,"Opinion | A Charge of ‘a Cover-Up,’ a Trump Tantrum and the Gears Grind to a Halt","The president stormed out of a meeting with congressional Democrats, saying he won’t negotiate while they investigate. What now? Ms. Cottle is a member of the editorial board. Late Wednesday morning, President Trump headed into what was supposed to be a meeting with congressional Democrats on how to fund a $2 trillion infrastructure package he and they had agreed on last month. Instead, he spent three minutes berating Democratic leaders for saying unpleasant things about him, before proclaiming that he would not work with them until they stopped investigating him. Mr. Trump then strode out to the Rose Garden, where the news media had been hastily assembled to hear him deliver a similar message, and delivered another tirade about the illegitimacy of the special counsel’s Russia investigation. “This whole thing was a takedown attempt at the president of the United States,” he asserted. Affixed to his lectern was a printed sign declaring, “NO Collusion. NO Obstruction.” The proximate cause of Mr. Trump’s outrage was an accusation by the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, made earlier in the day, that he “is engaged in a cover-up.” “I don’t do cover-ups,” he said in his Rose Garden remarks. Rather than talk roads and bridges, the president issued a challenge: “I told Senator Schumer and Speaker Pelosi, ‘I want to do infrastructure. I want to do it more than you want to do it. But, you know what? You can’t do it under these circumstances. So get these phony investigations over with.’ ” Put another way, don’t expect any progress on any legislation any time soon. This week has been particularly vexing for the president in his continuing oversight struggle with Congress. A federal judge ruled against his efforts to block a subpoena from the House Oversight Committee for his business records — a decision the president is appealing. The House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Hope Hicks, a former top aide to the president and a member of his inner circle, and another former White House aide, Annie Donaldson, who was a key witness in the investigation by the special counsel, Robert Mueller. The Department of Justice has agreed to turn over some documents related to the Mueller report to the House Intelligence Committee. Mr. Trump’s lawyers are in court fighting to block a congressional subpoena of his records with Deutsche Bank, his lender of last resort. (A federal judge ruled against Mr. Trump in the bank case late Wednesday.) And New York State lawmakers approved a bill allowing Congress to obtain Mr. Trump’s state tax returns. There’s visible strain on the Democratic side of the fight as well. Ms. Pelosi is under growing pressure to move forward with impeachment. While a majority of her caucus remains opposed, Mr. Trump’s moves to stonewall all investigatory efforts are adding to frustration. Even some members of the speaker’s leadership team, albeit at the lower levels, have jumped on the impeachment bandwagon. Ms. Pelosi’s “cover-up” allegation, made immediately after a caucus meeting, was explicitly intended to placate restive elements of her caucus in an attempt to head off a revolt. Where does everyone go from here? Since taking over the House, Democrats have been adamant that they can pursue a dual-track strategy of working with the president on shared policy aims, even as they investigate his administration. Mr. Trump has effectively blown up that plan. Policy discussions are not possible, he said, as long as he is under investigation. “We’re going to go down one track at a time,” he said. Obviously, the investigations will continue. So if policy is off the table, how will Mr. Trump spend his days? Go into full campaign mode? Spend more time visiting his properties? More executive time? Perhaps he will immerse himself in foreign affairs, where he doesn’t have to worry so much about congressional meddling. And Ms. Pelosi? “I pray for the president of the United States,” she said after the aborted meeting with Mr. Trump. “And I pray for the United States of America.” The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2019,A Chef Tells the Story of the Slave Trade Through Dinner,"Eric Adjepong, a Ghanaian-American chef and finalist on “Top Chef,” cooks the meal he was unable to finish on the recent season finale. Nearly a year ago, the chef Eric Adjepong stood in Macau on the set of the “Top Chef,” having made it to the finals of the cooking competition show. The only thing standing between him and the title was a four-course meal, served in two parts. He’d decided to use his menu to show the judges how influential Africa’s culinary heritage is on other parts of the world, including America. “I wanted to tell the story of the trans-Atlantic slave trade from Africa through Caribbean ports, the American South and South America through food,” he said recently. “It’s an unfortunate story, but one that needs to be told.” Mr. Adjepong, 31, is first-generation Ghanaian-American, and grew up in the Little Ghana neighborhood of the Bronx. He was the first West African contestant on “Top Chef,” which just aired its 16th season, introducing some viewers and judges to dishes like fufu and egusi stew. And then, after the first course, Mr. Adjepong was eliminated, after the jerk sauce in his Jamaican-inspired steak tartare overwhelmed the flavor of the beef, and his yuca chip garnish spent too much time in the fryer. He lost to two white Southern chefs, which he found ironic: “Their story is rooted in West Africa, too,” he said, “just in a different way.” The episode, which aired in March, elicited strong reactions from fans on social media, with some viewers calling for more diverse judges who would understand the nuances of the various cuisines of the African diaspora referenced in Mr. Adjepong’s cooking. “The support was overwhelming,” he said. “People were just so proud to see the food that I was cooking.” Alexander Smalls, a New York restaurateur and author focusing on African-American foodways, was a judge for the second part of the finale, after Mr. Adjepong was eliminated, and he was confronted with the outcry after the episode aired. “Folks were really looking forward to his meal and felt like they had lost something by not getting to see it,” he said. “It was more than a meal, it was educational.” The chef Tom Colicchio, the head “Top Chef” judge, said that he had anticipated that reaction; he reached out to Mr. Adjepong after the episode aired to see if he wanted to do a dinner and finish cooking his menu. And so on May 13, at Mr. Colicchio’s restaurant Craft in Manhattan, Mr. Adjepong presented the full menu: “The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Through Food,” a dinner that zigzags across the Atlantic Ocean, retracing the forced migration of enslaved Africans and illuminating the deep and lasting global culinary influences of the continent. Over the four courses, Mr. Adjepong combined ingredients from Ghana, Nigeria and Senegal with influences from countries and regions along the slave trade routes, tracing lines to Jamaica and other islands in the Caribbean, Brazil and the southeastern United States. A course of king crab, the meat twirled into bundles like angel hair pasta, rested in a pool of beurre blanc made with palm wine, a West African drink made of palm tree sap, the sauce studded with puffed Carolina Gold rice. Onion jam mimicked the tangy, spiciness of the Senegalese stew poulet yassa. Cassava, also known as yuca, showed up in multiple courses, a reflection of its importance in the cuisines of the diaspora. A dessert of corn and goat’s milk pudding was served with piles of tangy magenta tapioca pearls made with Nigerian hibiscus, familiar to anyone who knows the drinks zobo, sorrel or sobolo. (“Hibiscus is such a familiar flavor and color across the diaspora, I wanted to include it,” Mr. Adjepong said.) This was the first in a series of dinners at Craft highlighting chefs with strong culinary voices who do not have brick-and-mortar restaurant spaces. Through mid-June, Craft will host dinners by the chefs Omar Tate, a Philadelphia chef who uses food to explore blackness in America at his pop-up Honeysuckle; Gabriela Álvarez, who uses food to tell the story of Puerto Rico before and after Hurricane Maria; and Behzad Jamshidi, who uses spoken word and art in addition to food to create a multisensory Persian experience. Mr. Colicchio said more diners are seeking out these kinds of stories instead of “just ingredients on a plate,” and that he wants to use his platform to support this kind of work. “I’m Italian-American, but I grew up cooking French food and was taught that’s what you had to do,” he said. “I think a lot of people are turning around and saying, ‘No, we don’t have to do that food.’” “Young chefs who have worked under older chefs are now seeing that they don’t have to cook French and Italian, and they can tell their own stories,” he added. Monday night’s dinner gave Mr. Adjepong the opportunity to finish this particular story and continue his mission of making African food more prominent in America. From an open kitchen, with the help of a team of six chefs, he cooked the meal he hopes will illustrate Africa’s culinary influence on the world. “So, you’re going to have the steak tartare first, but there’s been some adjustments,” he said to the diners as he laughed, while Fela Kuti’s “Water No Get Enemy” played softly in the background. That night, the tartare sat under herbs with flaked salt and fresh shallots, with a pool of the jerk sauce on the side and fried plantain chips adorning the dish like polka dots. “I was supposed to do this meal for the finale,” he said to the crowd. “But being at home in New York, this feels a lot better.” Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.

2019,A Chinese Millennial Looks Back on Her Life,"Nonfiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. UNDER RED SKIES Three Generations of Life, Loss, and Hope in China By Karoline Kan The subtitle of Karoline Kan’s bracingly forthright memoir flags one intended audience: fans of multigenerational Chinese family sagas. And it has much to offer those hooked on this enduringly popular genre. High points of “Under Red Skies” for such readers include Kan’s sensitively told stories about a grandmother influenced late in life by the folk tales about animal spirits she heard in her youth and of a grandfather who found solace in the 1990s in Falun Gong exercises and beliefs — until an official drive to eradicate the group forced him to cut his ties to the organization. “Under Red Skies” may be of even more interest to a second set of readers: those fond of stories about determined women who overcome obstacles. We quickly learn that Kan’s mother is such a woman. Consider, for example, the actions she took during the months leading up to the author’s birth in 1989. Kan’s mother already had one child, a boy born in the mid-1980s. Under the strict family planning policy in effect at the time, this meant that Kan’s parents should have considered their household complete. But Kan’s mother, determined to have a daughter, was ready to take risks and used subtle forms of subterfuge to achieve this goal. On one visit to a doctor, she even hid a metal ring under her coat to trick an X-ray machine into thinking she was using a mandated birth control device. The book also tells us a great deal about another determined woman: Kan herself. The village she was born in and the provincial town she grew up in were the sorts of communities whose young inhabitants rarely gain admittance to Beijing institutions of higher learning and almost never become published authors. Kan beat long odds to do both. After earning a finance degree from a university in the capital, she pursued her dream of making a living as a writer, despite urging from her parents to follow a safer career path. Through a mixture of luck, determination and the strong English skills that subsequently allowed her to write “Under Red Skies,” she secured jobs as a writer for a Beijing expat magazine and then as a researcher for The New York Times. Eventually she landed an agent and a book deal. Hers is, in short, a true-life Horatio Alger tale, albeit one with distinctively Chinese, 21st-century and feminist elements. These features are all on display late in the book, when Kan returns to her hometown and struggles to explain her new life to the cousin who had been her best friend in childhood but stayed put and followed a more conventional path. Though generational differences loom large in “Under Red Skies,” Kan also conveys the importance in China of rural-urban divides. She strives, with only limited success, to get her perplexed onetime confidante to grasp why she is unconcerned that she is still unmarried in her mid-20s and how excited she is to be performing in a Chinese version of “The Vagina Monologues.” A final set of intended readers for Kan’s book are those, like me, who are personally or professionally concerned with making sense of today’s China, including the experiences of its millennials. Her account has much of value to offer us as we seek to understand how China has been changing and look for help in explaining these shifts to others. “Under Red Skies” follows on the heels of several recent English-language books about Kan’s generation, but, unlike those, it has actually been written by a member of the complicated cohort in question. This gives a fresh feel to its handling of by-now familiar topics, like the tension produced when a jingoistic education is confronted with a longing to participate in global popular culture. She isn’t the first to describe the attitude of many Chinese of her age, who feel resentment toward certain countries for bullying China in the past even as they adore those countries’ cultural exports, from episodes of “The Big Bang Theory” to the latest Japanese manga. But she handles this discussion particularly well. While admiring Kan’s book, I would be remiss if I failed to mention that she sometimes jumbles her facts about periods before her teenage years. She is right that the Chinese authorities continue to lie to members of her generation, as well as others on the mainland, about the Tiananmen movement. But while she is correct that, contrary to the official line, soldiers killed a great many people in central Beijing, she is wrong when she says that “most” of those killed in the early June massacre were students. The majority were ordinary Beijing residents belonging to other social groups. Earlier in the book, Kan similarly goes astray when she claims that for three years beginning in 1983, a “powerful police state” form of control returned. When I arrived in Shanghai in 1986, an unusually tolerant era was underway. Many felt that the state, aside from its intrusive birth control measures, had recently retreated from micromanaging people’s private lives. In this era of ratcheted up repression, there is now understandable nostalgia in some quarters for the looser mid-1980s. Despite its occasional missteps, there is much to admire in “Under Red Skies.” It’s enjoyable to get to know Kan on the page; she tells moving family tales as well as poignant personal stories, and serves as an engagingly candid guide to the fascinating generation she is a part of. She and they have faced the distinct challenge of coming of age as their country experiences its own dizzying transformations.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | A Chip in My Hand Unlocks My House. Why Does That Scare People?,"Implant technology can change the world — unless politicians give in to the hysteria against it. Mr. Istvan writes and lectures about transhumanism. Over the past few decades, microchip implant technology has moved from science fiction to reality; today hundreds of thousands of people around the world have chips or electronic transmitters inside them. Most are for medical reasons, like cochlear implants to help the deaf hear. More recently, body-modification enthusiasts and technophiles have been installing microchips in their bodies that do everything from start a car to send a text message to make a payment in bitcoin. The market for nonmedical implant technology is virtually unregulated, despite the fact that thousands of people around the world got chipped in the past 12 months. That may be about to change: Over the past few years, calls to heavily regulate or even ban voluntary implants have grown increasingly loud. There’s a place for regulating implants, like any technology — but also a need to separate the fear from the reality. [As technology advances, will it continue to blur the lines between public and private? Sign up for Charlie Warzel’s limited-run newsletter to explore what's at stake and what you can do about it.] I was excited to get my implant in 2015 at a biohacker gathering called Grindfest in Tehachapi, Calif. — specifically, in a garage in a dentist’s chair, surrounded by vintage medical posters. These implants — often called radio-frequency ID or near-field-communication tags, depending on the technology involved — are about the size of a grain of rice and are installed in people in seconds via an oversize syringe. They each have a unique identification number and cost as little as $50. Most people get them injected in the tissue between their thumb and index finger. Microchipping is still a fun part of a semi-underground culture, but interest is growing in more serious quarters. In 2016, the Navy asked me to consult on a study led by James P. Wisecup, a retired vice admiral and the director of the Chief of Naval Operations Strategic Studies Group. One of the concerns they had was how civilian implants in sailors could affect the workings of a nuclear submarine. More recently, implanting made national news when a Wisconsin technology company called Three Square Market announced it was having a chipping party for its employees. Workers were offered implants that allowed them to be tracked at work, replacing timecards. Workers could also use the implants to operate copy machines and buy food from the company’s vending machines. Not surprisingly, such interest from the military and the corporate sector has raised concerns, and not just among civil libertarians. Religious advocates have cautioned against the ethical challenges of implants. In February, Skip Daly, a Democrat in the Nevada State Assembly, introduced a bill to make involuntary microchip implants illegal; he later amended it to include voluntary microchipping as well. The bill — even though it is in just one state and has yet to pass — set off a storm of concern in the biohacker community because it seemed to be the first step in a crackdown we all fear is coming. Currently, no state has a law banning voluntary microchip implants, though along with Nevada, Arkansas, New Jersey and Tennessee are drafting legislation centered around implants. California, Wisconsin, Missouri, Oklahoma and North Dakota have laws in some form that ban involuntary implants. I can’t think of many biohackers — or any citizens — who wouldn’t support a ban on involuntary microchipping (though at least for now, that’s a baseless fear). But the fear of government- or corporate-imposed programs should not overwhelm the promise that voluntary, recreational chipping has to offer. I’ve had my chip for over three years, and I’ve grown to relish and rely on the technology. The electric lock on the front door of my house has a chip scanner, and it’s nice to go surfing and jogging without having to carry keys around. For some people without functioning arms, chips in their feet are the simplest way to open doors or operate some household items modified with chip readers. The military is considering implants for soldiers that may be useful to monitor their health data and even recovering them if they’re captured or lost in war. Microchip implants aren’t for everyone, and while the health risks are minuscule, like any technology, implanted chips will grow old, become outdated and need to be replaced — a process that will be moderately bloody and painful. And there are legitimate privacy issues, similar to the current concerns over tracking phones. So far, though, implants can be detected by someone only at a distance of a few feet. Above all, the microchip implants illustrate a defining principle of the transhumanist movement, popularized by the philosopher and futurist Max More: morphological freedom — the right to modify one’s body in whatever way one wants, so long as it doesn’t hurt anybody else. The uproar over Mr. Daly’s bill seems to have worked. After being deluged with public comments and emails, he altered his bill yet again, with new wording to exempt implants for self-expression and medical purposes. (The bill recently passed in the Nevada Assembly and is being considered by the Nevada Senate.) With implant technology becoming smaller and easier to put into bodies, every state will soon have to address the question of recreational implants. The knee-jerk opposition is real, and it could easily lead to overbearing laws. People should be able to do whatever they want with their bodies — and lawmakers, if they study the facts, will quickly realize that the benefits of a lightly regulated biohacking culture outweigh the risks.

2019,A Clam Pizza Worth Waiting For,"How clam pizza, with all its charms, remained trapped in New Haven for most of a century is a mystery that may never be unraveled. At least it has escaped now. For the past decade or so, Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana, the 93-year-old establishment said to have invented the regional delicacy, has been exporting it to its other branches in Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. There is also a small cult of the clam pie among New York pizzaioli. It has become a fixture at Lombardi’s and some Staten Island pizzerias, as well as inspiring lovingly considered tributes at Pasquale Jones, Motorino and the Clam. The New York Times I have eaten most of them, and happily, but on a recent trip to Connecticut I was led to what I now realize is the clam pie against which all others should be measured. It is baked at Zuppardi’s Apizza in the city of West Haven. Unlike the coal ovens used to fire New Haven’s more famous “abeetz,” to use the Connecticut-Neapolitan dialect, the ovens at Zuppardi’s are fired by gas. As a result, Zuppardi’s pies are not nearly as blackened as the ones from Pepe’s, but the crust still bulges with air pockets and emerges with a pleasingly dry, thin and crackery crunch. [Learn how to make pizza at home with this guide from NYT Cooking.] Zuppardi’s tops its clam pizza (market price, typically $32.45 for a medium pie) with fresh garlic, olive oil, dried oregano, cracked red pepper and littlenecks. Smaller clams may be opaque when they reach the table. Larger specimens will be just warmed through. All will taste as if they had just been shucked, as in fact they were. Opening clams to order means that the clam pizza takes longer than Zuppardi’s other specialties, like the plain pie (tomato sauce, grated cheese, no mozzarella), itself worth a detour from Interstate 95, which rumbles by about a cherrystone’s throw away.

2019,Opinion | A Coast-to-Coast Marriage of American Railroads,"The 150th anniversary of the transcontinental railroad is a good reminder of national unity “if not in spirit, in fact.” Contributing Opinion Writer BOZEMAN, Mont. — A president can get a lot done in Washington when a slew of congressmen — the ones who hate his guts — skip town for four years. In 1862 alone, between the blood baths at Shiloh in April and Antietam in September, President Abraham Lincoln abolished slavery in the District of Columbia, created the indispensable Department of Agriculture — “the people’s department,” the former boy bumpkin called it — and signed into law a series of westward-facing bills that the secessionist quitters would have never O.K.’d, including the Homestead Act on May 20 and the Pacific Railway Act on July 1. The railroad bill established a transcontinental telegraph line and link to established eastern railroads originating at the Missouri River. The Union Pacific — manned by Irishmen, Civil War veterans and emancipated slaves — would advance across Nebraska toward Central Pacific tracks forged by Chinese laborers starting in Sacramento, across the Sierra Nevada Mountains to the Mormon settlements near the Great Salt Lake. Which brought me, not to brag, to “Spike 150,” a transportation history party in rural Utah. On May 10, about 20,000 people, including Mitt Romney in jeans, gathered at the Golden Spike National Historical Park in Promontory Summit; we were there to celebrate the sesquicentennial of the merger of the eastern and western tracks. The dark side of the Transcontinental Railroad is a story of greed, corruption, venereal disease, pay disparities between white and Chinese laborers, violence unleashed by and against the Plains tribes, and — given the ungodly amount of timber required for ties, bridges, cars and fuel — deforestation. But it is mostly, and justifiably, beloved as a sort of infrastructure Appomattox. The marriage of the railroads, and therefore the Atlantic and the Pacific, simulcast coast to coast by telegraph on May 10, 1869, symbolized, as the keynote speaker Jon Meacham told the “Spike 150” crowd, that just four years after the end of the Civil War, the United States was once again united, “if not in spirit, in fact.” Given that Beto O’Rourke’s Texas Senate campaign politicized Willie Nelson, the final American we had all agreed to like, it was tempting to be too chastened by memories of lost solidarity. Especially when you’re getting a sunburn watching the premiere of a new musical titled “As One,” in which actors playing ex-slaves and Chinese and Irish immigrants sing about a man’s need to “blow off steam” while dancing with women who might represent the prostitutes the railroad workers patronized (if only because it’s rare to see that many sleeveless dresses in Utah). This is how extreme things are right now: I was excited to meet Mitt Romney. The old-timey Republican of yore smiled through a photo op for the unveiling of a new sculpture of an American bison, a species that almost went extinct when, among other things, travelers on the railroad we had gathered to glorify shot buffalo from the windows of passing trains. Yet on the drive home to Montana, outside West Yellowstone my family and I were almost murdered by seven bison lunging out in front of our car. So to do the endangered species math, apparently buffalo now outnumber moderate Republicans seven to one. The last time I came to Promontory Summit was in 1995, not long after Timothy McVeigh — wearing a T-shirt printed with words shrieked by John Wilkes Booth as he assassinated President Lincoln — bombed our fellow citizens in Oklahoma City. Visiting Promontory Summit is always relevant and accusatory because the United States is always about to come undone. The Civil War is not only the defining event in American history, it’s the central metaphor of our public life. Still, Mr. Meacham wondered, “I would rather be dealing with Facebook than Fort Sumter, wouldn’t you?” I would — way less humid. My sister Amy was there with me, hearing the shout-out for the attendee Sandy Dodge, a descendant of the Union Army general and railroad engineer who advised President Lincoln on the Union Pacific’s route. It’s a sign of national healing that when I informed Amy that during the Civil War, Mr. Dodge’s ancestor Grenville was shooting at our Confederate great-great-grandfather Stephen at the Battle of Pea Ridge, all she said was, “Howdy, neighbor.” It was worth a six-hour drive to get there just to hear the joy in Connie Young Yu’s voice as she proclaimed, “I am a descendant of a Chinese railroad worker, an American, speaking about American history.” Fifty years ago, at the centennial in 1969, Philip Choy, president of the Chinese Historical Society, was bumped from the official festivities by the arrival of a surprise guest, John Wayne; and Ms. Yu’s mother, the only descendant of Chinese railroad laborers present, had to listen to Secretary of Transportation John Volpe utter this baloney: “Who else but Americans could chisel through miles of solid granite?” Ms. Yu enumerated the deadly challenges faced by her great-grandfather Lee Wong Sang of Guangdong Province and thousands of his countrymen, digging and blasting through the snowy Sierra as they inched toward Utah. There, with a handful of Irishmen, they famously laid 10 miles of track in a single day. “This record-setting feat on the road to Promontory is unequaled in history,” she marveled. “The trust and cooperation between workers with a common purpose was a zenith of the human spirit.” A few days after the sesquicentennial, President Trump, whose German grandfather arrived on these shores and found work as a barber before owning brothels, unveiled a snobby new “merit-based” immigration plan, aimed at privileging impeccably educated, English-speaking immigrants. The plan was promptly laughed into oblivion, most notably by the speaker of the House, Nancy D’Alesandro Pelosi, who dismissed it as “condescending.” The one thing we all have in common, besides an eroding devotion to the Constitution that young Abraham Lincoln revered as the shared “political religion of the nation,” is the fact that at some point in the last 40,000 or more years a citizen or her ancestors migrated to the Americas from another continent, some not by choice and others well before Angles and Saxons rowed across the North Sea and invented English. One hopeful lesson of the United States in general — and the Transcontinental Railroad in particular — is that the renewable resource of (paid) immigrant labor has nearly nothing but merit. When I got home from Utah, I dug up an old family memoir about my great-great-grandparents David and Carolina Larm, who emigrated from Sweden in 1890 with their 12 children. Upon arrival in Kansas City, David got a job as a janitor. His son Karl, who went by Charley in Kansas, quoted the Old Testament to explain the new citizens’ success: “They had a mind to work.” Sarah Vowell, a contributing opinion writer, is the author of ""The Wordy Shipmates” and “Lafayette in the Somewhat United States.” The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2019,A Connecticut Retreat Designed to Attract Houseguests,"ON LOCATION Finding a home in the country was the easy part. Creating a place their Manhattan friends would want to visit was the challenge. 9 Photos View Slide Show › When Manhattanites Matt Rappoport and Beno Varela began looking for a new home in Connecticut, they had mixed feelings about making the move. Mr. Rappoport, an attorney, was ready to leave his job at a large law firm, and Dr. Varela, a gastroenterologist, had found a practice he planned to join in Hamden, Conn. But their friends and social lives were in New York, even though Mr. Rappoport had grown up in Fairfield, Conn. “We were moving out of the city to a neighborhood where we had no social ties, other than Matt’s family,” said Dr. Varela, 35. “There were nerves, as a gay couple, without kids, moving to the suburbs,” said Mr. Rappoport, 31, who is now the chief executive of a finance start-up. But they had an idea about how to calm those nerves: Find a charming house and transform it into a destination so compelling that it would lure their friends for regular visits. “It was really important to us to create a beautiful space,” Dr. Varela said. “I wanted to feel like we could host and welcome people from the city.” When they began hunting for a house in late 2016, they realized there was another issue: Most homes on lots with the leafy, country feeling they wanted were far too large — between 4,000 and 6,000 square feet. “Coming from a 1,200-square-foot apartment, which was really big for the city, to a house that was 4,000 square feet seemed crazy to us,” Mr. Rappoport said. Finally, they found a 2,500-square-foot, three-bedroom home in Fairfield, dating to the 1830s. It was far from perfect: The main entrance opened directly into the kitchen; it didn’t have the home office Mr. Rappoport needed; and an oddly placed powder room made the ground floor seem dark and chopped up. But they bought it for $937,500 in March 2017 with the intention of making some changes. The house had originally been built a short distance away, serving as a general store in the 19th century. It was moved to its present location and converted into a home in 1929. A renovation in 2011 produced the kitchen that Mr. Rappoport and Dr. Varela liked and planned to keep. To overhaul the rest, they turned to Jack Franzen, of J.P. Franzen Associates Architects, and Rena Cherny, an interior designer who owns RC Studio, who developed plans to reconfigure the ground floor by demolishing the powder room — which sat at one end of the living room, blocking light from two windows — and create a single, bright living-and-dining area. Then they used the footprint of the old formal dining room to create a new powder room and home office. The objective was “to clean it up, but to keep the charm of it, while making better use of the spaces,” Mr. Franzen said. “We wanted it to be cozy for entertaining, but definitely modern and fresh, while maintaining all the elements of an old home: the original windows, doors, hardware and shutters,” Ms. Cherny said. “The vibe of a country home, but with fresh furnishings.” Achieving that took about a year and $250,000, as Ms. Cherny delicately negotiated the purchase of furniture and accessories that suited Mr. Rappoport’s preference for midcentury-modern design and Dr. Varela’s desire for softness and a touch of the traditional. “Part of what we needed her for was to mediate between us,” Mr. Rappoport said. “To understand both of us, and find things that worked.” Added Dr. Varela, “She was really our therapist for that entire year.” Ms. Cherny furnished the living room with a carefully chosen mix of clean-lined, comfortable furniture, including a cushy Montauk sectional sofa, a corduroy wool Tibetano rug and a large custom-upholstered ottoman. The dining area has harder, more angular elements, including steel-and-wood Standard chairs from Vitra, an Agnes chandelier from Roll & Hill and a slender concrete dining table from ABC Carpet & Home, as well as a moody Jenny Boot photograph that the couple bought at the New York Affordable Art Fair. Beyond a Dutch door, Ms. Cherny also designed a patio with a lounging area around a firepit, and a separate outdoor dining area with a long table that can seat eight, to take advantage of the bucolic, one-acre lot. This spring, Mr. Rappoport and Dr. Varela are rerouting the driveway, to bring guests to the proper front door of the house rather than the kitchen door. But since finishing the majority of the renovation last summer, they have been pleased to discover that their house is already having the desired effect on friends. “They enjoy it,” Dr. Varela said. “People actually do want to get out of the city more than I thought they would.” For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

2019,A Czech Billionaire Buys a Piece of Le Monde,"PARIS — Blaise Gauquelin, the Central Europe correspondent for Le Monde, called his editor at the paper’s Paris headquarters one day last fall to pass along something of interest: One of the two French businessmen who controlled the 75-year-old daily was selling part of his stake to a Czech billionaire named Daniel Kretinsky. The news sent a tremor through the newsroom of the august national publication. Le Monde’s journalists looked into Mr. Kretinsky and noted that he had built his fortune largely on power plants and coal mines across Europe. He also owns part of a pipeline that brings Russian gas through Slovakia to the West. Why would an international energy magnate be interested in an anti-Kremlin newspaper that had invested heavily in covering climate change? Mr. Kretinsky’s earlier foray into French media, the purchase of the center-left newsweekly Marianne for 5 million euros last year, contributed to the staff’s wariness, given that his first big move was to install the conservative commentator Natacha Polony as editor. Mr. Kretinsky, 43, has had a rapid rise under the tutelage of two of the most successful privatization barons in the post-communist Czech Republic and Slovakia, Patrik Tkac and Petr Kellner. His main business, EPH, comprises more than 50 companies and has annual revenue of 6 billion euros. With part of his fortune, Mr. Kretinsky bought 49 percent of the stake in Le Monde’s parent company held by Matthieu Pigasse, the chief executive of Lazard France. That deal made Mr. Kretinsky the owner of a little more than 13 percent of the paper and its sibling publications. Although Le Monde reported that Mr. Pigasse had initially hoped to sell his entire stake to the Prague energy executive, Mr. Kretinsky said in an interview at the Georges V hotel in Paris that he was content, for now, with his status as a minority owner. “The idea is to support and to one day be around the table, and have exchanges and talks and debates,” Mr. Kretinsky said. “You cannot jump over to Paris for one day a month and believe you can be the sole shareholder of Le Monde. It would be a great pleasure to be there, and if they needed to be supported, that is something we would do with great pleasure.” Mr. Kretinsky, who is fluent in French, said he fell in love with France as a child while watching French films on Czech television. As a young man, he spent a semester studying law at the University of Dijon. Even if he were to become the leader of Le Monde, he said, he would not interfere in the newsroom. “If you become the chairman of a media company, its audience, its spirit, its convictions and its values are things you will never try to take from it,” Mr. Kretinsky said. “Your personal political convictions must be completely disregarded.” His stake in Le Monde, an afternoon paper with more than 300,000 subscribers, allows him to play a more prominent part in supporting “trans-Atlantic democracy,” he said, and to push for greater regulation of Facebook, Google and other internet giants, which, he argued, undermine the free press. “Being around Le Monde, it’s much easier to launch this debate as a real member of the family of French publishers,” Mr. Kretinsky said. “The Czech Republic is just too small.” Le Monde’s executive editor, Jérôme Fenoglio, said that the other two major shareholders, Mr. Pigasse and the internet entrepreneur Xavier Niel, have kept the proper distance from the paper’s journalists since taking control of Le Monde Group nine years ago. “The newsroom is completely independent,” Mr. Fenoglio said. Le Monde’s reporters and editors had a controlling stake in the paper from its founding in 1944 until it was sold with their approval in 2010, and they still have a say in how it is run. What troubled some in the newsroom about Mr. Kretinsky’s entry into the ownership group, the editor added, was the lack of transparency surrounding it. “The problem is that we heard it through the grapevine, truly the worst way to win our trust,” Mr. Fenoglio said. “The condition that would allow us to have confidence in Mr. Kretinsky is simply to agree to our right of approval, and our right to approve or block his ownership in the company. Whoever the new shareholder is, if he loves Le Monde and wants to help it grow, he has to respect its independence.” Alain Beuve-Méry, the editor of Le Monde’s economic opinion pages, and the grandson of the newspaper’s founder, Hubert Beuve-Méry, noted that Mr. Kretinsky had yet to meet with Le Monde’s reporters and editors. “If the value of a newspaper is its journalists, then, when you buy a newspaper, the first thing you do is you try to win over the journalists,” Mr. Beuve-Méry said. Asked what the arrival of Mr. Kretinsky could mean for the paper, Louis Dreyfus, the chief executive of Le Monde Group, responded with a shrug. “He announced it in October,” he said. “We haven’t seen any changes in strategy from our shareholders.” Le Monde has made a turnaround in the nine years Mr. Dreyfus has been in charge. He has reduced the size of the back-office and printing staff while increasing the number of journalists at the paper, to 450 from 310. He also started a glossy weekly, M, and a paywalled newsletter, La Matinale. A newly established editing hub in Los Angeles allows for a steady flow of news through the Parisian night, and an online African edition, started in 2015, has given Le Monde a greater presence among the world’s 300 million French speakers. When Mr. Dreyfus arrived, Le Monde had about 140,000 print subscribers and roughly 30,000 digital subscribers. Today, the paper has fewer than 100,000 print subscribers, but more than 200,000 who pay for online access. “Our strategy for the past nine years has been to keep Le Monde independent,” Mr. Dreyfus said. “For that, it’s important that it be financially independent.” Before buying the magazine Marianne and the stake in Le Monde, Mr. Kretinsky was already a force in the media business in Prague, where he owns Blesk, a celebrity tabloid. He said he bought it in 2013 to keep it from falling into what he called “the wrong hands.” “Blesk is a journal that addresses ordinary people, not the top five or 10 percent of intellectuals, but the mass population, which could be manipulated.” he said. “So for us, it was a protective measure, a way to make sure that things are going well.” If Czech media outlets had the same guarantee of editorial integrity that Le Monde has, he said with a laugh, “we wouldn’t have to buy them.” Nearly all newspapers in the Czech Republic are in the hands of local billionaires, said Robert Brestan, editor of HlidaciPes.cz (or Watchdog.cz), a site focused on the news media. They use the publications to “maintain a balance of power” with the country’s prime minister, Andrej Babis, who owns two dailies. “In the Czech media world, reporters know very well who the owners are,” Mr. Brestan said. “They have self-censorship, and they know what not to write about.” Sophie des Déserts, who covers the media for the French edition of Vanity Fair, said Le Monde had little reason to worry about its new shareholder. “I don’t see Daniel Kretinsky threatening the newspaper,” she said. “It’s not in his interest.” Sylvie Kauffmann, a columnist for Le Monde who was formerly its executive editor, said she would not rush to judge Mr. Kretinsky, but noted that the paper’s journalistic and financial success depend on its refusal to kowtow to the rich and powerful. “A newspaper that can’t be independent,” she said, “is not a good newspaper.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | A Dark Milestone for Women’s Rights: A State With No Abortion Clinics,"Missouri may soon show America what abortion access will look like if Roe v. Wade is overturned. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. In this threatening time for reproductive rights in America, a dark milestone is looming: Planned Parenthood announced on Tuesday that it would most likely be forced to stop providing abortions at its clinic in St. Louis, the last abortion clinic in Missouri, making it the only state in the country with zero abortion clinics. The ending of abortion care in St. Louis would make clear that while Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion in the United States, continues to protect the right to abortion in all 50 states, that is becoming a right in name only in many places. What good is a legal right to abortion if a woman can’t get one? Missouri has been one of six states with just one abortion clinic, after lawmakers and officials approved a tsunami of regulations that shut down the other facilities or forced them to stop providing abortions. The Supreme Court opened the door to such hurdles with its 1992 decision Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which both reaffirmed and modified the core of Roe, announcing that states may not impose an “undue burden” on a woman seeking an abortion. Opponents of the procedure have tested the court’s definition of “undue burden” ever since. Anti-abortion measures in Missouri include strict limits on the use of private and public insurance to cover abortion, a ban on the use of telemedicine to administer abortions by medication, a parental consent requirement for minors, a mandate that doctors counsel patients in a way that’s intended to dissuade them from getting an abortion, and a mandatory 72-hour waiting period. And as of last year, the state requires that abortion providers have admitting privileges at a hospital within 15 minutes of their clinic — a burden that reproductive health experts agree is medically unnecessary. Missouri’s governor, Mike Parson, also recently signed a measure banning abortion after eight weeks of pregnancy, without exceptions for victims of rape or incest. The legislation is part of a rash of near-total abortion bans being passed around the country this year — nearly all of which are being held up in the court system and will not go into effect unless Roe v. Wade is overturned. Despite all efforts against it, the St. Louis Planned Parenthood has managed to hold on, while four other clinics in the state stopped providing abortions over the past decade. What seems likely to finally do in the clinic’s ability to perform abortions is a dispute with the state health department over the renewal of its license, which expires on Saturday. Planned Parenthood says that to make it more onerous to provide abortions, the health department has created new rules and started enforcing others that have long been understood to be outdated. One rule would require that doctors perform two separate pelvic exams on surgical abortion patients, despite protests from doctors that such a requirement is medically unnecessary and could be traumatic for patients. Planned Parenthood says that the clinic will not agree to comply with all of the rules, and the group plans to sue the state over the matter. If the St. Louis clinic stops performing abortions, Missouri will show America what abortion access would look like in much of the country if Roe were overturned, as some experts fear it will be in the years ahead. The coasts and parts of the Midwest would still have a decent number of clinics, while the entire Southeastern portion of the country and the region from Texas up through Missouri would likely not. Abortion would become, even more than it is today, a procedure for the upper classes: Women with the financial means to travel, to pay for child care or to take time off from work would be able to get one in a clinic, while those who are poor would not. For now, many Missouri women looking to have an abortion would most likely travel to clinics in Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Illinois and Iowa — in fact, many women in the state are already doing exactly that. But many of those states are facing their own attacks on abortion rights, and if anti-abortion lawmakers keep racking up political wins, the options for women will continue to dwindle. It has been remarkable to see the surge of alarm for the state of reproductive rights in recent weeks, as Americans tuned in to the ban on nearly all abortions in Alabama and the so-called fetal heartbeat laws in Georgia and other states. But the situation in Missouri is a reminder that anti-abortion forces have already so worn away the right to abortion in America that it’s now being held together by threads. For too many women, the nightmare of a post-Roe America is already here. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2019,A Darkly Glittering Novel That Imagines the Earth’s Final Hours,"Fiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. LAST DAY By Domenica Ruta Domenica Ruta’s first novel, “Last Day,” celebrates the end of the world, an international doomsday holiday that begins on May 27. Like the pagans of old during an eclipse, no one expects to survive the night. People burn their favorite things, settle debts and make dramatic amends, from I’m sorry graffiti to full-page apologies in The New York Times. Oddly enough, no one decides to do much worse than get drunk — no one stabs his mother-in-law, no one drives over a cliff and no one machine-guns the White House. For 15-year-old Sarah, “Last Day” is “a dramatic holiday of self-inflicted upheaval drawn out into a public performance.” A “sworn asexual,” she has a serious crush on Kurt, a 40-something tattoo artist, and they go off to build a bonfire at the beach. Like the beginning of a joke, a trio of astronauts — an American, a Russian and a Japanese billionaire — celebrate Last Day from space. Bear, the American, believes everything is A-O.K.; vodka-swilling Svec swears he has never vomited in space; and Yuki’s attention is completely absorbed by his twin on earth, symbolized by his devotion to a two-headed mouse pup. The opening flits among the characters, but once the mentally ill but well-meaning Karen shows up, the novel ignites. Ruta, who is also the author of a best-selling memoir, “With or Without You,” deeply sympathizes with the damaged and their worlds. Karen lives in a group home with Bear’s younger sister, who has Down syndrome, but the bond between them, like that of others in the book, is inconsequential, suggesting that our network of associations, in the end, does not matter. Despite the heavy subject matter, comic moments leaven the book. The astronauts lasso corn puffs with dental floss and record their cholesterol readings on graphs shaped like penises in the color of their country’s flags. “Oh, the places you’ll go — now or never!” the library display reads. The mall urges customers to “Buy now — before it’s too late,” and Italians believe anyone who doesn’t change his sheets on Last Day will be impotent for a year. Ruta makes occasional startling observations, as when the tattoo artist is about to seduce Sarah. “Kurt turned his face toward hers like she was the last thing left to eat.” Or when she remarks that women’s answer of “nothing” to the question “What’s wrong?” is “the grenade of all pronouns.” There is a memorable description of a mother whose “cheeks sagged as though her prettiness had been pawed off her face by her children.” Unusual evocations of clouds begin to appear toward the end of the book, as if the reader should see portents in the sky: “Gold clasped unevenly to the edges of a dark, stormy-looking mass.” Am I giving away anything by saying that the book doesn’t end well? Last Day’s celebrants have already passively accepted the end, indeed normalized it, in today’s parlance. Is this what our current administration has led us to? Is it just a question of when? There’s little mention of fault, and it’s an unexpected relief not to have venal and irrational heads of state quarreling over their red phones. Teenage Sarah strips away all holiday pretense: “Everyone was celebrating an imaginary apocalypse while schools filled with children were bombed by dictators and pipelines leaked millions of tons of crude oil into the sea.” In this novel, humans behave as if they were just another unconscious species, unaware of their culpability. “Chill,” a storefront preacher urges. Instead of staging a mass die-off from flu as Emily St. John Mandel brilliantly imagined in “Station Eleven,” Ruta is realistic: There are no scrambles to a shelter, no messy survivors, no lingering horrors. “A world … that never ends is even scarier,” Kurt protests. Happy Last Day.",The New York Times
2019,A Daunting Operation Offers Relief to Obese Teenagers,"Gastric bypass surgery works as well in adolescents as it does in adults, researchers report. But the procedure requires a major commitment. At least six million obese teenagers in the United States are candidates for weight-loss surgery, experts estimate. Fewer than 1,000 of them get it each year. Many of these adolescents already have complications of obesity, like diabetes or high blood pressure. But doctors have been uncertain just how well surgery works for young patients, and whether they can handle the consequences, including a severely restricted diet. A new study provides some hopeful answers. Researchers followed 161 teenagers aged 13 to 19, and 396 adults aged 25 to 50, for five years after weight-loss surgery. The teenagers actually fared better than the adults. The adolescents lost at least as much weight, and were more likely to see high blood pressure and diabetes ease or go away, the investigators reported on Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. “This really changes the game,” said Dr. Amir Ghaferi, a bariatric surgeon at the University of Michigan, who was not involved in the research. The paper, he said, added to evidence that obesity, like cancer, is best treated early, before long-term damage from related conditions, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, sets in. [Read more about teenagers and bariatric surgery.] To have the surgery, teenagers in the study had to meet the same criteria as adults: a body mass index of at least 35 — for instance, a person who is 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 192 pounds or more — and obesity-related health problems. Alternately, the adolescents could have a B.M.I. of at least 40 — such as a person who is 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighs at least 220 pounds — without other conditions linked to obesity. There is no exact data on the number of teenagers who meet those criteria in the United States, said Dr. Thomas Inge, chief of pediatric surgery at Children’s Hospital Colorado and lead author of the new study. He estimated that about 8 percent of American teenagers would qualify. “These are not kids who are pleasantly plump,” said Dr. John Morton, a bariatric surgeon at Yale University. “Once you have a B.M.I. of 30, it is really difficult to lose weight on your own.” There is no other treatment that results in a substantial and sustained weight loss in people who are severely obese. But the operation, gastric bypass surgery, is demanding. Surgeons close off most of the stomach, leaving a small pouch, and reroute the intestines. Afterward, patients must eat tiny meals at frequent intervals for the rest of their lives. It is a scenario that gives many parents pause. Should their teenagers wait, hoping science will come up with a less drastic solution? Or should their children have the operation before even more serious harm to the body occurs? Adding to the quandary is the fact there are just six accredited bariatric surgery centers in pediatric hospitals. Although some adult programs operate on teenagers, most of such procedures are done in pediatric settings, Dr. Morton said. Adults, by contrast, may choose from 850 accredited medical centers for weight-loss surgery. Although the new study included adolescents with B.M.I.s of 35, most were much heavier. The average was 50, the same as the average for adults in the study. For most of the adolescents, the surgery was a success. On average, they lost about a quarter of their body weight, enough to make life much easier and for most to shed health problems. The teenagers weighed 324 pounds on average when they had the surgery. Five years later, the figure was 244 pounds. The adults weighed the same at the start and had a nearly identical result. An unlucky minority of patients — both adults and teenagers — did not fare as well. Some remained saddled with high blood pressure or diabetes. A few lost almost no weight, or even gained weight, in the five years after the surgery. The study did not randomly assign patients to have the surgery or not, which is the gold standard for clinical research. Since the adults had been obese for a much longer time, their condition might have been harder to treat with surgery. That makes it difficult to directly compare the teenagers and adults. But Dr. Ghaferi said the message is clear: It is best to intervene early. And if that is true, other experts wondered, what about even younger children? “What if an eight-year-old comes in, or a ten-year-old comes in, and they are severely obese? Why don’t we offer this treatment and study the results?” Dr. Inge said. Already he has operated on children who are severely obese and have related medical conditions. The question now, he said, is whether to operate even before a child develops high blood pressure, diabetes, or sleep apnea. That question will require careful study, with researchers following children for years after surgery, Dr. Inge said. Even operating on teenagers raises issues that may not apply to adults. Can a miserable adolescent, for example, really can give informed consent to such a drastic, life-changing operation? And can a teenager be expected to commit to following the very restricted diet required after the surgery, not to mention taking the needed vitamins and minerals? “Are they prepared to do that for the rest of their lives?” asked David B. Sarwer, a psychologist at Temple University who works with bariatric surgery patients. Substantial weight loss can have unexpected psychological consequences in teenagers, he added. Severe obesity “sets adolescents up for stigmatization,” he said. A severely obese teenager “is likely known by every other student in the high school not because she is a prom queen, but because she is physically the largest student in the school.” Stigma often leaves teenagers isolated and lacking social skills, a deficit that can hinder their development even after surgery to lose weight. And when formerly obese teenagers go to college, Dr. Sarwer said, often they are so ashamed of having been fat that they keep it a secret. Yet weight-loss surgery can be transformative. Eric Decker, 33, a bartender and freelance makeup artist in Detroit, had the operation in 2006 when he was 17. He was 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighed 385 pounds; no amount of dieting seemed to help. He tried to find a surgeon in South Carolina, where he lived, to operate on him, but no one would do it. He was referred to Dr. Inge, then at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital. Mr. Decker lost more weight than most — he now weighs between 205 and 210 pounds. He speaks up now when someone speaks derisively of a person who is obese. He knows how it feels to be shunned for what medical researchers now deem a chronic disease, not a lifestyle choice. Without that experience, he said, “I don’t think I would have that lens of compassion for people with their struggles.”",The New York Times
2019,Alabama Executes a Murderer a Day After Banning Abortions,"Alabama executed a convicted murderer on Thursday, a day after the state enacted a near-total ban on abortions — two actions on contentious social issues that often have people across the political spectrum invoking the sanctity of human life. “It’s a contradiction that I always observed,” said Hannah Cox, the national manager of Conservatives Concerned About the Death Penalty, an advocacy group. Approving of executions, Ms. Cox said, is “a stance that cheapens the pro-life argument.” Ms. Cox, who is originally from Alabama and opposes both abortion and the death penalty, said that more conservatives were coming to feel the same way, offering as evidence Republican-sponsored bills to repeal the death penalty that have been introduced in 11 state legislatures. Michael Brandon Samra was executed by lethal injection Thursday evening, according to the Alabama attorney general, Steven T. Marshall. Mr. Samra and a friend, Mark Duke, were convicted in 1997 of killing four people — Mr. Duke’s father, the father’s girlfriend and the girlfriend’s two young daughters — after a dispute over a pickup truck. Both defendants were sentenced to death, but Mr. Duke’s sentence was later overturned because he was 16 at the time of the killings; Mr. Samra was 19. Though the timing was coincidental, the actions taken by Alabama on consecutive days served to highlight widely held positions on the political right that some people say are in conflict, with protecting human life held paramount in one context but not another. Gov. Kay Ivey, who declined to halt the scheduled execution, has expressed some discomfort with her role in the death penalty. Early in her tenure, she said she did not “relish the responsibility that I hold” in capital cases, and she has repeatedly depicted it as an unwelcome duty of her office. “How to proceed when faced with a potential execution is one of the most difficult decisions I will ever have to make as governor,” she said after one execution. “No governor covets the responsibility of weighing the merits of life or death; but it is a burden I accept as part of my pledge to uphold the laws of this state.” Even so, Ms. Ivey has not used her authority under the state constitution to reprieve or commute any death sentence since she took office in April 2017. The state, which carries out executions at an aging prison near the Florida border, has executed six people during her tenure; Mr. Samra was the seventh. A spokeswoman for the governor did not respond to messages on Thursday seeking comment, but Ms. Ivey issued a statement after Mr. Samra was put to death. “Alabama will not stand for the loss of life in our state, and with this heinous crime, we must respond with punishment,” the statement said. “These four victims deserved a future, and Mr. Samra took that opportunity away from them and did so with no sense of remorse. This evening justice has been delivered to the loved ones of these victims, and it signals that Alabama does not tolerate murderous acts of any nature.” Alabama currently has 176 more prisoners awaiting execution. All but two of them were convicted of murder; 65 have been on death row for more than 20 years. While death penalty opponents like Ms. Cox wonder how Christian conservatives like the governor can oppose abortion but uphold execution, others say the two stances become coherent when viewed through a lens of innocence and guilt. “In a sense, it’s perfectly comprehensible,” said Mark Silk, a professor of religion at Trinity College. “Their view is that unborn babies and fetuses are innocent life. They’ve done nothing to merit the death penalty. Whereas murderers have done something to merit the death penalty. It’s an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. It’s how they look at the world.” Professor Silk said that white evangelicals in particular, who make up more than half the electorate in Alabama, may run into difficulty when men or women “find their way to Jesus” while on death row. “So much of evangelicalism has to do with conversion,” he said. “That’s such a core experience for them. A murderer or rapist finding their way to God is as powerful a manifestation of conversion that you can find.” Ms. Cox said she found the argument that life is something to be protected only when it is innocent to be “flimsy.” “People should be still held accountable, but there should be more nuance,” she said. “You are not the sum of the worst thing you’ve ever done.” The Catholic Church’s teachings oppose both abortion and capital punishment on similar grounds. “Pro-life values are meaningless when they are inconsistent,” said Krisanne Vaillancourt Murphy, executive director of the Catholic Mobilizing Network, a group working to end capital punishment. “The sanctity of human life applies to each and every person, innocent and guilty,” she said, adding that the church teaches that a person’s God-given dignity “is not lost even after the commission of very serious crimes.” “As Pope Francis has said, ‘There is no just penalty that is not open to hope,’” Ms. Murphy said. “That is why the death penalty is neither Christian nor human.” A scholar of evangelical Christianity said that most evangelicals in Alabama probably feel no tension between support for the death penalty and opposition to abortion. “Most conservative evangelicals wouldn’t think twice about executing someone and then going to a pro-life march the next day,” said John Fea, a history professor at Messiah College. He said their views have often been shaped by the political battles that have raged over social issues in recent decades, so that, for example, they also tend to oppose spending tax money on government programs that might reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies. Progressive evangelicals see the issues differently, Mr. Fea said, but “they are a minority in the state of Alabama and most of the evangelical South.” The Southern Baptist Convention, the largest evangelical denomination, says its support of the death penalty has roots in biblical teachings. “Imposing the death penalty can help the murderer restore the broken relationship with their creator, not just with humankind,” says an article posted by an arm of the convention that addresses public issues. “While we have an interest in a criminal’s return to society, we should be even more concerned with the state of their soul.”",The New York Times
2019,"A Day Trip to Cold Spring, Complete With Kayaking and a Castle","Things to Do in N.Y.C. This Summer This article was originally published in 2018. We’ve revived it for the summer of 2019. Sign up for the Summer in the City newsletter to get more of the best things to do in New York City during the hottest season on the year. What to do Take a ride alongside the Hudson on the Metro-North Hudson line and you won’t believe your scenic good fortune. All river all the way, the water catches the sun, sparkling the surface as you zoom past palisades, marinas and mountains. If you’ve taken this train before, perhaps on the way to Beacon for art or even to Poughkeepsie, you’ve most likely noticed Pollepel Island, where the crumbling yet still imposing Bannerman Castle sits. This time, get off at Cold Spring and investigate. The village, which is home to excellent hikes, a bucolic Main Street and scads of suburban charm, is also the start site for some awesome kayak tours of the Hudson, including to Pollepel Island and other notable sites. I kayaked to what most people call Bannerman Island with Hudson River Expeditions, a three-hour, seven-mile loop that felt like a spiritual reset button. Freed by the water and harbored by mountains, city worries melted away. Between dips in the water (I asked to learn how to climb back into my kayak without tipping), our guide, “Awesome Ken,” shared stories of the historical markers we paddled by. Most impressive were West Point, with its strategic location on the riverbank, and the Catskill Aqueduct, a century-old passage point for New York City’s water supply. But the Pollepel story is the kicker. Starting in the 1800s, a New Yorker named Francis Bannerman collected and sold surplus military equipment. A lot of it. When Bannerman’s collection, which included explosive black gunpowder, became too unsafe to store in the city, he bought Pollepel Island and constructed the castle to store his supply. And with a facade reading “Bannerman’s Island Arsenal,” then clearly visible from the train, the castle functioned as an advertisement for his wares. A fire in 1969 began the process of decay that leaves the castle in ruins today. While the castle no longer peddles its wares, it continues to do its job of enticing city passengers to experience the joys of the Hudson. Rinse, repeat. Metro-North train schedules can be found here, and P.S.A.: Power outlets are scarce on this train. Hudson River Expeditions, located between the tracks and the Hudson, offers kayak and paddleboard rentals in addition to a variety of guided tours (ours cost $90 per person). More about the hikes and other lovely Cold Spring things below. Use our Google Map to get directions to Cold Spring. Where to eat Hudson Hil’s Cafe on Main Street serves simple country meals, ideal for before you head out on an expedition, that include stacks of lemon-ricotta pancakes, local eggs and sausages, and French toast made from the kitchen’s own chocolate-cinnamon babka. If the wait is too long and you’re rushing out to the water, pop into Cold Spring Pizza across the street for a quick, solid slice of eggplant-ricotta warmed up in the oven. And for something sweet, grab a Go-Go Pop at the Cold Spring Cheese Shop. Rincon Argentino should be your last stop in town before you catch the train back. At the small, family-run cafe, conveniently located on the New York-bound side of the tracks, you can polish off a scoop of banana-stracciatella ice cream as you wait for the train, or pack up some drinks and a few juicy empanadas to eat on the way home. See the restaurants on our Google Map. Where to drink Doug’s Pretty Good Pub has friendly, laid-back village vibes. And if you’ve been in the sun all afternoon, it’ll feel like a particularly welcoming, cool, dark retreat, with basic beers on draft and bar snacks like wings and burgers (including a few veggie options). See Doug’s Pretty Good Pub on our Google Map. What to check out nearby Definitely enjoy Cold Spring with the family or a friend crew. There are plenty of to-dos for non-kayakers: • The hiking in Cold Spring is wonderful, though trails are often crowded on summer weekends. Take the moderate five-mile Cornish Trail and pass by the ruins of the Northgate mansion and dairy farm. Or for greater intensity, try Breakneck Ridge. On Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, the train will make a special stop near the trailhead if you ask. • Not into nature? Main Street is chock-full of shopping. Stroll through the many antique stores, or head to Old Souls for Instagram-worthy outdoor gear and Poor George for casual apparel. The Shoppes, with many vendors under one roof, offer handmade soaps, records, posters, crystals, wood furniture, jellies and jams … it’s upstate in a box. • Ten minutes away is the West Point Foundry Preserve, an outdoor museum on the site where Union munitions were made during the Civil War. • From our experience, the best coffee in Cold Spring is easy to miss. Find it at the Pantry, inside the Cold Spring Apothecary. See the nearby spots on our Google Map.",The New York Times
2019,"A Day at Fort Tilden, a Peaceful New York Beach","Things to Do in N.Y.C. This Summer This article was originally published in 2018. We’ve revived it for the summer of 2019. Sign up for the Summer in the City newsletter to get more of the best things to do in New York City during the hottest season on the year. What to do It’s almost as if, with its hip bazaar and splashy programming, Jacob Riis Beach is a decoy to keep the masses out of Fort Tilden. But make it past the end of the Riis promenade, 10 minutes from the bazaar, and you’ll find a serene, scrubby beach minding its business. Grasses, poking through the white sand, bend in the breeze. Terns and piping plovers roost in cordoned-off preservation areas. Craggy and gently winding, the coastline runs on, sparsely dotted by sunbathers, birders and leisure fishermen pulling in floppy skates and rays. Yes, you are still in New York City. But this nature area wasn’t always this peaceful. The fort, established in 1917 to protect New York Harbor from naval attacks, was armed, locked and loaded through both world wars and most of the Cold War. If you enter the thicket behind the beach and whack your way through the overgrown trails (and poison ivy, watch out!), you’ll come across abandoned bunkers, derelict batteries, missile sites and munitions dumps, left to nature and to graffiti artists since the military base was decommissioned in the ’70s. The National Park Service has since taken over the base, which is now a stretch of the Gateway National Recreation Area. Winding through the brush to find these forgotten sites feels a little illicit and very adventurous — like playing Robinson Crusoe as a kid or maybe like being in high school, on the hunt for a decent place to party. But you’re of age now and you’re just after a good sunset. So climb to the top of your favorite battery and open yourself to the sweeping, painted skies, set against a tiny profile of the distant Manhattan skyline. Adulthood is where you left it, but you don’t have to think about that now: You’re at the beach. To get here, you can take the 2 to a bus, but we encourage you to come on wheels. Luxe bike lanes line the route all the way from Prospect Park. Also, seclusion comes with a lack of infrastructure, but Riis has bathrooms. Use our Google Map to get directions to Fort Tilden. Food to pack If you can pack a snack in advance and tuck it into a cooler, try this herby yogurt dip and take a whole bunch of tasty things to swipe through it: raw radishes, soft flatbread, washed lettuce leaves, blanched Romano beans, whole Persian cucumbers, salty chips, you name it. A sweet, spicy side of chilled watermelon chaat will be absolutely perfect after you’ve taken in some sun and get hungry all over again. Want to go all out? Make these fried chicken biscuits with hot honey butter, which you can wrap up individually in parchment paper. Bake or fry the components the day of, if you like, but give yourself an extra hour so the chicken and biscuits can cool all the way down before you sandwich them — steam will make things soggy. Food to buy Starting on Memorial Day, most of the vendors in the Riis Park Beach Bazaar open at 11 a.m. with ready-made snacks and drinks. Keep an eye out for: • Excellent cheeseburgers in puffy sesame buns with crisp, perfectly salted French fries at Two Dudes. • Rockaway Clam Bar’s obscenely buttery split-top rolls filled with fried clams and the lobster boils, which you can set up on the picnic tables on Fridays. • The big plastic cups of frosé and frozen margaritas, churning away at various bars all along the bazaar. See the restaurants on our Google Map. What to do nearby • Fort Tilden’s old administrative area at Breezy Point looks like a vintage postcard to us, but some buildings are still in use. Poke around the patchy soccer fields and working theater, and wonder what year it is after all. • If you want to get the most out of that sunset, you can camp nearby at Floyd Bennett Field. Just reserve a spot in advance. See the nearby spots on our Google Map. An earlier version of this article included an outdated reference to Ed & Bev’s.

2019,A Day at Wave Hill in the Bronx (and Where to Eat and Drink After Wandering the Gardens),"Things to Do in N.Y.C. This Summer You’re reading Summer in the City, our limited-edition newsletter that rounds up the best things to do in New York City during the hottest season of the year. Sign up here to get future editions delivered to your inbox. What to do It’s finally warming up, so get yourself to Wave Hill, stat. Part park and part public garden, this oasis in the Bronx triggers one of those “Am-I-really-in-New-York?” moments. The answer: Yes, yes, you are. A 19th-century estate now owned by the city, Wave Hill aims to help people connect with nature, and after all those months inside, you’ll most likely need a refresher. So come see its 28 acres of green, open to the wide sky above, the Hudson below and the Palisades beyond. With these views, you could spend an entire afternoon lounging on the lawns, but there’s plenty more to (forgive me) dig into: Root around the terraced herb garden, where fennel grows alongside lungwort and feverfew. Wind through shady trails past gazebos and flower beds. Or peek into the fragrant Alpine House, which is packed with tiny potted plants, and imagine your own thumbs being so green. Because Wave Hill is so peaceful, the estate feels like your personal garden, as it was once to both a young Teddy Roosevelt and an aging Mark Twain. The Wave Hill House, where they stayed, is now home to a cafe serving coffee, wine, beer and snacks. And in other buildings on the property, you’ll find galleries and a shop where you can buy a new plant friend or some seeds. For those seeking more structure, Wave Hill offers garden highlights walks most afternoons — download a self-guided tour if you can’t make those hours — and morning yoga classes most Sundays. And if you come on select Wednesdays and Thursdays this summer, the grounds are open late for concerts and tours. Two pro tips for your visit: Admission to Wave Hill is free from 9 a.m. to noon on Tuesdays and Saturdays, and there are free shuttle vans running at intervals to Wave Hill from both the Van Cortlandt Park–242nd Street stop on the 1 train and the Metro-North stop at Riverdale. Take advantage of them — Riverdale is hilly! Use our Google Map to get directions to Wave Hill. Where to eat Estrellita Poblana Taqueria Express is part of a chainlet of locally loved affordable Mexican restaurants in the Bronx. Its homestyle braises like mole poblano and cochinita pibil are well worth ordering, but the tacos and Dagwood-stacked cemitas also get the job done nicely. If you’re with a crowd, toast the weekend with an order of queso fundido — its molten cheese bubbles over its lava-rock molcajete like magma — and don’t sleep on the crisp churros. Liebman’s Deli is more of a walk, but worth it for a taste of Jewish history. Little has changed at Liebman’s since it opened in 1953, and it’s a fine place for a Dr. Brown’s black cherry soda and a nosh, or to pack up sandwiches to eat at Wave Hill. You’re best served by staying close to the classics here: pastrami, corned beef or tongue on rye with plenty of mustard, or natural-casing hot dogs with lots of snap. See the restaurants on our Google Map. Where to drink Bronx Alehouse is one of the better craft beer bars in the borough with a dozen-plus taps that may just introduce you to some lesser-known breweries from the New York area. The pub grub is solid, should you want some fried pickles or wings, but the real draw: games! Lots of them, ideal for settling scores and making bets after a day of arboreal adventure. Beyond the usual darts and arcade boxes you can play Jenga, a variety of board games, chess, checkers and, best of all, Skeeball. Tilila is a nice local break from the TV-wallpapered Irish bars that dominate the neighborhood. A Dominican restaurant, good for kids, with modest prices and a mean happy hour from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. on weekdays — plus a full bar and live music every night of the week — it’s a pretty great place to celebrate the start of summer. See the bars on our Google Map. What to check out nearby • Riverdale Park is just below Wave Hill. Walk down the hill and see the Hudson on its own level. • Riverdale Historic District is code for “mansions.” From Wave Hill, head north on Bingham Road and wind between 252nd and 254th Streets to catch a glimpse of the good life. • Van Cortlandt Park’s thousand acres contain a trove of activities just a quick car ride away. Watch horseback riders at the stables, reserve a tee time at the golf course or swing by the Van Cortlandt House Museum. • Lloyd’s, a beloved local bakery, churns out 1,000 simple but sublime carrot cakes a week. Don’t leave Riverdale without picking up a slice as an edible souvenir. See these nearby spots on our Google Map. Something free or cheap Wander the Museum of Street Art at the CitizenM Hotel in the Bowery. The hotel has devoted 20 floors of stairwell to artists whose work was demolished at 5Pointz, the graffiti mecca in Queens. Your tour will be self-guided, but ask for Ayman to learn some background on the works, and cap off your visit with a drink on the roof. Something for the weeknight Grab a friend and head to the Elevated Acre in FiDi. This raised meadow is somehow still under the radar, which means you and your buds will have space to spread out against the view of the East River and the Brooklyn Bridge. It’s not quite the Palisades, but it’s not half bad for a Tuesday. Enter at 55 Water Street. Something from a reader Eat and drink your way through the Bronx Night Market at Fordham Plaza. It’s “the Bronx spin on Smorgasburg and the Queens Night Market,” writes Syed A., a Summer reader from Parkchester. Do you have a favorite thing to do in New York City during summer?

2019,A Day at the Astoria Pool (and Where to Refuel Nearby),"Things to Do in N.Y.C. This Summer This article was originally published in 2018. We’ve revived it for the summer of 2019. Sign up for the Summer in the City newsletter to get more of the best things to do in New York City during the hottest season on the year. What to do They say Astoria is where you go to have it all: great food, more space, cheaper rent. But it’s the Astoria pool that really seals the deal. This gem sandwiched between Astoria Park and the East River offers that lovely, lazy, classic day-at-the-pool day, right here in New York. Kids scream playfully in Spanish and English as they fail to escape in games of tag. Adults splash gently through the lap swim lane. A rainbow of towels brightens the pool’s edge. And the pool din is punctuated by short, reprimanding whistles of orange-clad lifeguards keeping a watchful eye as their off-duty colleagues flirt on the sideline. It’s a vision of summer. (Yes, I get paid to do this.) Even the snack bar is the stuff of memories: Get hot dogs or hamburgers made to order, or go straight to the ice cream case for a rock-hard ice-cream cookie sandwich or the pink-pebbled Strawberry Shortcake bar. There’s also coffee — phew. Good thing they’ve got all the goodies because you can’t bring in your own food. That’s high on the long list of rules on what you must and must not carry with you when visiting any city pool. Musts include a bathing suit, to be shown at entry, and a combination lock to secure your other belongings within the vast, dank changing rooms. For the unprepared, locks, suits and more are available to buy at a stand outside. The list of contraband includes glass bottles, newspapers (we broke this rule) and, amazingly, phones and other electronic devices. The technology-free zone forces you to keep track of your people analog-style. Inevitably this leads to intercom announcements like: “Laura, please come meet your boyfriend under the clock. He’s waiting for you.” You know what else is waiting for you? Summer. And it won’t stick around for long. Off you go. All public outdoor pools open for the season on June 27. The Astoria pool will then be open seven days a week from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. (That hour is a closure for cleaning.) Sign up for extended lap swim hours here. Use our Google Map to get directions to the Astoria pool. Where to eat You’re in Astoria, so eat well: For a dinner of perfectly fried summer vegetables, Greek-style dips, slabs of fried Kefalograviera cheese and maybe a whole grilled fish (if you’ve still got a little room), go to Telly’s Taverna. Add another location to your list: Milkflower. Its bubbly, beautifully charred wood-fired pies come scattered with what’s in season. See the restaurants on our Google Map. Where to drink There’s good reason that Bohemian Hall, built by Czech and Slovak immigrants more than 100 years ago, may be the most well-known beer garden in the city. (Read all about the history in its walled courtyard of maple and sycamore trees here.) An alternative location to drink those beers outside is Judy & Punch, which has a $5 happy hour with big bowls of popcorn and tables that can fit large groups on its back patio. Cronin & Phelan’s isn’t fancy, but it’s friendly — the kind of no-nonsense, old-school dive bar that’s so much rarer in New York than it used to be. As a bonus, if you’re hungry, there’s an unexpectedly extensive food menu. See the bars on our Google Map. What to check out nearby • The Socrates Sculpture Park, right on the water, is an eccentric open-air museum and park where artists create sculptural works in an outdoor studio. The park also offers loads of free programming, including yoga, kayaking and tai chi. • Across the street from the park is Château le Woof. With treats for humans on one side and a play space for dogs on the other (equipped with equally fancy canine treats), you might call this cafe your happy place. There’s also a table with children’s books — what have they not thought of? Please continue to write us at summer@nytimes.com with tips or suggestions on what you like to do or see.

2019,Opinion | A Deal for Iran: Normalization for Normalization,"The theocratic regime could not long survive if the Islamic republic acted like most nations. Opinion Columnist There has always been a fair and symmetrical formula for the United States and Iran to resolve the full range of their differences: full normalization for full normalization. Donald Trump, who may — but probably doesn’t — want a war with the Islamic republic, should propose it, publicly and in detail, and see what happens. It will be clarifying for everyone. What is normalization? From the U.S. side, it would mean the immediate suspension of every economic and diplomatic sanction imposed by this or previous administrations. It would mean an American Embassy in Tehran and an Iranian one in Washington. It would mean direct flights between Iranian and American cities. It would mean two-way trade, direct investment, and the end of secondary sanctions that punish non-U.S. companies for doing business in Iran. It would mean tens of thousands of Iranian students once again enrolled in U.S. universities, and tens of thousands of American tourists once again exploring the grand bazaars of Iranian cities. Iran’s people could surely use that deal. Since Trump reimposed U.S. sanctions last year, Iran’s oil exports have fallen by more than half, inflation has spiked to close to 40 percent and the rial has lost about 60 percent of its value against the dollar. Iran’s economy is expected to contract by 6 percent this year. By some estimates, a third of all Iranians live in absolute, not relative, poverty, unable to afford the most basic staples of life. As for the Iranian side, normalization would mean behaving like a normal country. A normal country, with the world’s fourth-largest proven oil reserves, is one that wouldn’t need to embark on multiple underground programs to enrich uranium and produce plutonium. It wouldn’t engage in extensive experimental work to figure out how to detonate a fissile nuclear core. It wouldn’t retain an illicit network to circumvent Western restrictions on the sale of dual-use technologies for its missile programs. A normal country is one that would not perpetrate terrorist massacres in Argentina. It wouldn’t seek to murder (via a Mexican drug cartel) the Saudi ambassador at a Washington, D.C., restaurant. It wouldn’t attempt an assassination plot in Denmark, or a bombing attack in France. A normal country would not furnish military, financial and logistical support for Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, who seems to have resumed using chemical weapons against his enemies. It wouldn’t supply the Taliban with weapons, training and new recruits. It wouldn’t provide its proxies in Yemen with ballistic missiles, especially now that those proxies are firing missiles at Mecca. It wouldn’t be a principal sponsor for militias and terrorist groups throughout the Middle East. It wouldn’t constantly avow and seek, at considerable cost to itself, the destruction of another state with which it has neither a historical nor territorial conflict. A normal country wouldn’t hang gay people. It wouldn’t imprison women in their own clothes. It wouldn’t constantly arrest foreign nationals, including American journalists, on trumped-up charges as a means of gaining diplomatic or financial leverage. In short, under the terms of a normalization-for-normalization deal, Iran could relieve itself of all U.S. pressure by permanently abandoning its nuclear ambitions, its human rights outrages and its reckless international behavior. That’s not a big ask. Or at least it shouldn’t be, which is why Trump ought to deliver it in a carefully written speech — the kind normal presidents make about vital international and domestic topics. Mike Pompeo laid out roughly similar terms in his own speech on Iran a year ago, but his tone was more bellicose than beguiling. Trump prefers the combination of brash moves with simple messages. This would be it. It would also be unlikely to win over Iran’s leaders. Death to America — and to Israel — aren’t propagandistic slogans for the regime. They are its reason for being and its motive for action. The regime’s objections to the United States don’t date to 1953 and U.S. connivance in the ouster of Mohammad Mosaddegh as prime minister of Iran (a coup the clerics supported at the time). They date to 1776 and the birth of political liberalism, the enemy of all theocratic and virtue-centric politics. An American bombing campaign in Iran could hurt the regime. Complete and genuine normalization would, over time, be fatal to it. It would mean, as Trump put it the other day, Iran’s “official end” — not as a nation, but as the regime that has tyrannized that nation for 40 years. Last week’s saber-rattling is unlikely to lead to a confrontation neither side wants. Trump thinks that avoiding war is crucial to his re-election. Tehran thinks Trump is more likely to be a one-termer if it can wait him out without a war. These are incompatible analyses, but they should induce mutual caution. All the more reason for Trump to seize the initiative. Normalization for normalization is a concept this and future U.S. administrations could embrace. It’s one ordinary Americans and Iranians alike could understand. And it’s one Iran’s leaders would fear. Let them be the ones to explain why Iranian children should go hungry so Hamas can aim its fire at Jews. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2019,A Debut Novel Revisits a Tragedy in an Asian-American Family,"Fiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. THE UNPASSING By Chia-Chia Lin Throughout Chia-Chia Lin’s somber debut novel, about the muffled anguish of a Taiwanese-immigrant family struggling to adapt to the Alaskan wilderness amid the recent death of their youngest child, questions of home persist. A theme so timeless as to suggest a certain stolid permanence, this vagueness of home inspires even as it eludes members of a single household, creating a familiar world within an unfamiliar land, a country that is simultaneously everywhere and nowhere. The challenge for the narrator (and, to a certain extent, the reader) becomes how to reconcile the static “unpassing” of memories and identities, despite the exposure of time. Set within a Lorelei-like rural landscape 30 miles outside Anchorage in the 1980s, “The Unpassing” is narrated by the Taiwanese-born Gavin, whose family brought him to this peripheral expanse of America on the edge of the Pacific when he was 3. Trawling through a vast ocean of memories years later, Gavin revisits the period when, at 10 years old, he contracted meningitis, fell into a coma and was hospitalized. Once recovered, he learned of his little sister’s fate — she was infected, too, but did not survive. The tragedy inevitably magnifies unspoken tensions in the already struggling immigrant family, which are heightened further when subpar work by Gavin’s plumber father (he was an engineer in Taiwan) results in the fatal poisoning of a young boy. [ This book is one of our most anticipated titles of the month. See the full list. ] Gavin’s search for a lost geographical and spiritual center underscores his longing for an idealized past from the fragmented present. Peering from the forbidding Alaskan wilderness just beyond the cultivated security of his family’s yard at one point, he says: “In the woods, it was darker and stiller, and I streaked through it all. I wasn’t heading home, though I suppose I was. There was always just this one path, headed one way. I had no choice, really; I was always headed home.” Later, when his younger brother loses his way in the forest during an especially stormy evening, Gavin explains: “The truth was, we didn’t know the woods at all. We only knew the path. Once you stepped off of it, there was no telling what you’d find.” As Susan Sontag has written, “to remember is to voice — to cast memories into language — and is, always, a form of address.” This raises an obvious question: To whom is Lin’s deracinated narrator addressing his homesick telling and retelling of his family’s history? Strikingly, the only character who remains unnamed throughout the novel is Gavin’s mother, who represents both his origin and the implied endpoint of his trip down memory lane. Although discomfiting and unreliable, memories promise comfort and self-discovery, and it is hardly coincidental that an adult Gavin returns to his birthplace in search of home: “I went to Taiwan, trying to find the village that lived in my memory of my mother’s memory.” But he comes to realize his relationship to the place is ambiguous, both distinctly of it and separate from it. It is a hard-won, elegiac truth about an unsalvageable past, this Sebaldian secondhand memory, the eventual recognition that he cannot step into the same river twice, which he presages at the very beginning of his narrative: “Although we tried, each in our own way, no one was able to go back even one step.” Wisdom in hindsight is, after all, one of maturity’s age-old graces. If the novel seems unrelentingly cheerless at times, its tone reflects Gavin’s struggle to come to terms with his family’s particular history of displacement and loss. Immigrants, just like Joseph Brodsky’s exiled writers, are often “retrospective and retroactive beings.” Nevertheless, Gavin’s articulation of his family’s circumstances bears the inexorable imprint of an American collective memory that is variously functional and symbolic. Punctuating his thoughts are neither contemporary Taiwanese nor Asian cultural references, but rather the Space Shuttle Challenger explosion, Time magazine and the Exxon Valdez oil spill off the Alaskan coast. His mottled identity creates familial strains: Disappointed with his visit to Taiwan, Gavin remonstrates: “It was a kind of violence, what my father had done. He had brought us to a place we didn’t belong, and taken us from a place we did. Now we yearned for all places and found peace in none.” For all of its pathos, its themes of cross-cultural intermingling, its stories of immigrant arrival, marginalization and eventual accommodation, “The Unpassing” is a singularly vast and captivating novel, beautifully written in free-flowing prose that quietly disarms with its intermittent moments of poetic idiosyncrasy. But what makes Lin’s novel such an important book is the extent to which it probes America’s mythmaking about itself, which can just as easily unmake as it can uplift. Before he revisits Taiwan, Gavin heads back to his Alaskan house — his father’s old dream. “My father … fancied himself some kind of pioneer,” he reflects, but “the expanse made him totally unfettered. The distance stripped his words. There was no self-consciousness, only sentiment.” If the United States is merely an idea that it forms of itself, then let the nostalgic among us be warned: We may be longing to return to a time that no longer exists — or perhaps never did.",The New York Times
2019,"A Debut Novel Set on the Brooding, Remote Kamchatka Peninsula","Fiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. DISAPPEARING EARTH By Julia Phillips The first chapter of Julia Phillips’s superb debut, “Disappearing Earth,” begins with two sisters at the edge of a bay on a summer day. One wants to venture deeper, the other clings to shore, embarrassed by the childish antics of her younger sibling. By chapter’s end the sisters will have disappeared — kidnapped, it seems, by a man in a shiny black car. It’s a familiar setup in a wholly unfamiliar setting — the remote and beautifully bleak Kamchatka Peninsula in far eastern Russia. What follows this abduction is a novel in the form of overlapping short stories about the women who are affected both directly and indirectly by the kidnapping. The purpose of these stories is not to unite a community around a tragedy as a less daring and more conventional narrative would have it, but to expose the ways in which the women of Kamchatka are fragmented personally, culturally and emotionally not only by the crime that jump-starts the novel, but by place, identity and the people who try, and often fail, to understand them. It’s a well-worn cliché of book jacket copy to say that place is as important a character as any of the people in a book, and yet the women who populate Phillips’s novel are so intrinsically and intelligently identified with their region that it’s impossible to understand or even consider them without Phillips’s precise evocation of Kamchatka. She describes the region with a cartographer’s precision and an ethnographer’s clarity, drawing clear distinctions between the relative metropolis of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the south, where the sisters are kidnapped, the verdant town of Esso with its hot springs and wood cabins in the middle, and Palana, a tiny city of Soviet architecture nestled in a valley at the foot of the Koryak Mountains in the sparsely populated north. [ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of May. See the full list. ] Phillips introduces us to a cast of women who are emblematic of the ethnic and cultural conflicts of each region — Ksyusha, a reindeer herder’s daughter who is at university in the capital and finds herself torn between her controlling white boyfriend and another indigenous student she meets in a native folk dance troupe; Zoya, a bored policeman’s wife dangerously drawn to the Uzbek and Tajik immigrants who are doing construction work across from her apartment; Marina, the white mother of the missing sisters who travels to a cultural festival in the north where she confronts a Native woman whose teenage daughter also disappeared under similar circumstances but whose case sparked little interest. [ These stunning photos show the natural beauty of Kamchatka. ] As the novel progresses, the links between the stories and the women coil tighter in surprising and troubling ways. Sometimes the sisters’ disappearance is in the foreground but more often it lingers at a distance — an echo on the news or a remote unease that serves as a baseline refrain to the other tragedies, small and large, that permeate the narrative. It falls to Oksana, the sole witness to the kidnapping, to link the missing sisters to her own plight, the loss of her dog, and in doing so she articulates an anxiety common to the women of “Disappearing Earth”: “It hurts too much to break your own heart out of stupidity, to leave a door unlocked or a child untended and return to discover that whatever you value most has disappeared. No. You want to be intentional about the destruction. Be a witness. You want to watch how your life will shatter.” But these women are never granted such a vantage point. There will be those eager to designate “Disappearing Earth” a thriller by focusing on the whodunit rather than what the tragedy reveals about the women in and around it. And if there is a single misstep in Phillips’s nearly flawless novel, it arrives with the tidy ending that seems to serve the needs of a genre rather than those of this particularly brilliant novel. But a tidy ending does not diminish Phillips’s deep examination of loss and longing, and it is a testament to the novel’s power that knowing what happened to the sisters remains very much beside the point.",The New York Times
2019,A Debut Novel of Political and Personal Upheaval in Late-20th-Century Nigeria,"Fiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. PRINCE OF MONKEYS By Nnamdi Ehirim “Prince of Monkeys” speaks in constant hyperbolic language; the kind where characters use adages like, “Every problem has its own man of God ascribed to it,” and chapters close with phrases such as, “Always pay attention to the secrets in colors that are too terrible to be spoken aloud.” And how could they not? Taking place in Nigeria during the 1980s and ’90s, Nnamdi Ehirim’s first novel shows us a Nigeria that exists in both fantastic and tragic terms. It’s a Nigeria in which a group of friends, anchored by the protagonist, Ihechi, can lose almost everything in a single night out, to see their idol, Fela Anikulapo Kuti, perform at the Afrika Shrine. That night is punctuated by a sudden riot that serves the same purpose as others that occur throughout the novel: It is both a funeral and an awakening. In “Prince of Monkeys,” though, those become necessary baptisms, offering a diverse cast (Ihechi, a “nonbeliever” named Pastor’s son, Mendaus, Maradona, Zeenat), separated by class, religion, education and eventually much, much more, a chance to redefine themselves by those contradictions and inequalities, and by the strife that continuously pocks their homeland. Their preachy vernacular and pop-culture diversions (“Citizen Kane,” “The Aristocats,” Chaka Khan and Luther Vandross) all become exercises in avoiding vulnerability directly. This dishonesty, inherited from their elders, who also speak in a too-golden tongue, plagues these characters as both children and adults. The group experiences the aftermath of a classist unrest that they were not there to witness. Traversing from Lagos to Enugu, Ihechi encounters firsthand Nigeria’s religious extremes, from his mother’s Ifa to his Aunt Kosiso’s devout Christianity. To Ihechi, the Ifa practice appears grotesque, where the practices of the Pentecostal church are smoothed out to appear proper — despite the bloody history of how it insinuated itself into Nigerian society. But time and again “Prince of Monkeys” reminds us that differences of religion are arbitrary tools given by the white man to Nigerians for sowing deep divides among themselves, divides that are used to justify abandonments: of families, faiths, morals, entire systems. Mistakenly thinking that the scarcity they’re sold to believe in represents the only option they have, each character struggles to be born anew, whether that be Maradona of the many identities; Mendaus, who goes from a bookish rascal to a movement leader; or Ihechi’s cousins, Tessy and Effy, who slip in and out of clothes just as easily as they do their adherence to their faith. “Prince of Monkeys” is rife with character soliloquies that relay some of the central issues of Nigerian life, then and now. Given the exhausting struggle to get by amid what feels like an uninterrupted cycle of bombings, riots and corruption, you can’t blame these characters for relentlessly remaking themselves. Their facades often break not in the most violent moments, but in the quietest, when they’re left with nothing but the memories of the choices they have made and those who have been buried. And so at Ihechi’s home in Lagos, his father screams mercilessly at the nightly news while his mother feverishly prays to the Ifa gods, and in Enugu, Aunt Kosiso retells of a bloody day that shattered the family’s innocence. Because so much goes painfully unspoken between characters, Kosiso is heartbreakingly unaware of how much her nephew relates to what she shares. Yet Ihechi struggles to clarify those connections for himself sometimes; his own maddening motivations, to either restore order to the people or profit from the chaos, place him within forces he’s slow to understand as he becomes ensnared in Nigeria’s political systems. The protagonist, as a result, doesn’t see Nigeria as clearly as Ehirim presents it for us: Nigeria is beset by a commanding, contradictory menagerie of would-be gods of money, power and avarice — the very same afflictions that dig Nigeria’s face into the mud and hold it there. When “Prince of Monkeys” finally emerges on the other side of sociopolitical crisis, an early passage comes into sharper focus as media cameras capture a rapturous Mendaus’s proclamation to a gathered mass: “We, once heirs of paradise, live by choice as monkeys in a zoo. … And we, once princes of monkeys, shall die kings among men in paradise.” As Ihechi climbs the ranks of society toward financial freedom, he paradoxically finds later in the novel that, as he wrestles with a past he seeks to make peace with, its collisions with his present and future feel as calamitous as the riots. As the novel closes, Ihechi finds himself involved in another moment of upheaval, one that proves he can be transformed yet again.",The New York Times
2019,A Designer Who Turns Simple Paper Shapes Into Kaleidoscopic Textiles,"In Studio Working out of her Zurich studio, Sonnhild Kestler makes clothing and objects inspired by travel, folklore and even her own history. Kestler piecing together a pattern for a textile.CreditCreditNick Ballon SIX DAYS A WEEK (unless it’s snowing), the Swiss textile designer Sonnhild Kestler rides her black Ciao moped west across Zurich, from the wooded residential neighborhood of Zurichberg — where she lives in a green-shuttered 1914 apartment building with her partner, Arthur David, a visual artist — toward the Limmat River. She has navigated the city this way for 35 years, a clutch of reusable striped shopping bags fanning out from her handlebars or a large roll of fabric balanced precariously across her thighs. Invariably, she’s making her way either to her printing studio, on the second floor of a former weaving factory that backs onto the river in the industrial area of Höngg, or to Thema Selection, an influential fashion boutique in the city’s Old Town where she maintains a vibrant shop-within-a-shop stocked with her wares: handcrafted dresses, pillows, scarves and home goods screen-printed with gleeful, kaleidoscopic patterns. The shop is on a narrow cobblestone alleyway near the Cabaret Voltaire, one of the sites where Dadaism was born over a century ago: The artists Sophie Taeuber, Jean Arp and others used to gather there to give performances and discuss the creation of a new aesthetic philosophy over drinks. It’s a fitting stage for Kestler’s own avant-garde sensibility. The designer, 55, who grew up in a small village outside of Baden, Switzerland, arrived in Zurich at 17 to study textile design. After graduating, she opened a fashion store with the designer Matthias Georg where she sold her first pieces. A few years later, she got to know the owners of Thema Selection, which was founded in 1972 by a group of freethinking friends from the city’s then thriving squat scene. In the decades since, her creations have earned her a loyal local following, and in 2010, the Swiss Federal Office of Culture awarded her its Grand Prix of Design. [Coming later this spring: the T List newsletter, a weekly roundup of what T Magazine editors are noticing and coveting. Sign up here.] Still, she is not widely known outside of Switzerland. Kestler’s time-intensive, almost ritualistic process is what makes her work so exceptional and is also the primary obstacle to its wider circulation. Her company, which she started in 1988 and which sells products under the label S.K. Hand-Druck, is a one-woman textile manufacturer, its every product the result of long hours spent painting sheets of paper in custom shades of gouache (dusty lemon, petrol blue, flamingo, marzipan), cutting them into shapes (abstract flowers, radiating palm fronds, elephants, temples) and then arranging the shapes into elaborate collages that she uses as the basis for screen prints. Kestler prefers to work alone, often barefoot, so that she can walk across her long wooden worktables, which are almost always laid with colorful constellations of paper, surveying her cutouts from above and adjusting their placement as she goes. “Her approach is different than that of anyone else I’ve worked with,” says Mary Murphy, the senior vice president of design at the New York-based textile company Maharam, which is releasing a collection of three cotton upholstery textiles and two rugs designed by Kestler this month. “So many people call themselves designers nowadays, but Sonnhild is the real thing.” One of Kestler’s Maharam fabrics has an interlocking teardrop motif inspired by 19th-century German tapestries made from military epaulets. Another distills her unique language of symbols — naïve botanical shapes, building-block-like stacks of small diamonds and squares — into a patchwork of abstract icons, while the third features stripes inspired by a photograph of a streaky night sky. On the two handwoven cotton rugs, meanwhile, cutout shapes repeat in dizzying sequences that recall the hypnotic designs of Buddhist sand paintings. KESTLER’S STUDIO IS as idiosyncratic as her patterns. It’s a work space, yes, but also an ever-expanding library of references and treasures: Papers and tokens spill from the wooden bookshelves and antique haberdashery cabinet and climb the walls. There are locally sourced mementos: A paper laurel wreath from a 1931 Swiss sports competition encircles an upper corner of an oil-painted canvas depicting a steamboat on Lake Thun in the Bernese Oberland. But for the most part, Kestler’s discoveries are from farther afield: a beaded yellow parakeet from Syria, an inflatable blue cat from Japan, a pair of latticed gold jutti slippers from northern India and a papier-mâché mask depicting the Hindu goddess Kali, with her lolling blood-red tongue. “I like it because it’s too much,” she says. Kestler designed her first collection for Maharam in 2008. Back then, she was experimenting with motifs from traditional European crafts and folklore — for instance, the densely embroidered fota, or wraparound skirts, of traditional Romanian dress — but increasingly, her ideas originate in India, which she now visits at least once a year. On a trip last year to northern Rajasthan, Kestler was enchanted by a mural depicting black clouds at a haveli, an ornate merchant’s house. Back home, she captured its mood in a new motif. Kestler compares her traveling self to a vessel, or a conduit for images and ideas that she’ll later reconfigure, with scissors and gouache, until she has created something that appears outside of time and place, maybe, but is rooted in her own aesthetic. In fact, she has begun to see her practice as a way to forge connections between people and places both left behind and newly discovered. As a child, she visited her grandparents in the East German medieval port of Wismar for three weeks each summer. That city, with its spired Gothic churches and windswept shoreline punctuated with striped beach chairs, still exerts some indeterminate influence over her work. In her studio, she keeps a four-foot-tall carved wooden head that she found on a trip back to the area in 1990. She has decorated its rough, almost primitive contours with bright strings of beads, metallic rosettes and a pompom-adorned crown. Like a totem of her own personal folklore, it isn’t entirely new or old, homespun or exotic, but, rather, allusive: to the many-colored stories that live somewhere in between.",The New York Times
2019,A Designer Whose Ideal Woman Is PJ Harvey,"Profile in Style Sander Lak, the creative director of Sies Marjan, shares his many inspirations with T. “I’ve always felt like a bit of a nomad,” says Sander Lak, the creative director of Sies Marjan. Born in Brunei, he grew up between Malaysia, Gabon and Scotland before settling with his family in the Netherlands (his father worked as an engineer for Royal Dutch Shell). Despite being exposed to so many cultures, though, it wasn’t until high school that Lak started paying attention to clothes — and to the mid-90s indie fashions featured in Dutch magazine in particular. “I remember paging through at a gas station and thinking, ‘What is this beautiful form of storytelling?’” says Lak, 35. After getting rejected from film school, he enrolled at an arts college in Arnhem, and then at Central Saint Martins in London, which led to stints at Marc Jacobs, 3.1 Phillip Lim, Balmain and, most notably, Dries Van Noten, where he worked alongside the designer for five years. In 2015, Lak moved to New York to start his own label and became a seemingly out-of-nowhere sensation. An expert colorist, he is known to get waves of nausea from certain shades of neon, whereas “weird combinations,” such as the pink and blue of the Baskin-Robbins logo, send him into a Zen-like calm. Over the course of seven seasons, he’s put out kaleidoscopic furs, iridescent trench coats and fuchsia-to-azure ombré dresses with Fortunyesque swirls of sunray pleating. “Instead of using sketches, mood boards or precise themes, I make color cards and pair them with hyper-dramatic textures,” explains Lak, who, in June, will hold the label’s first dedicated men’s show. “I think the concept of masculinity is in a surprising place right now, but I also wanted to do men’s for selfish reasons,” he says. “I needed clothes, and so this new collection is made up of the pieces I want to be wearing every single day.” [Coming soon: the T List newsletter, a weekly roundup of what T Magazine editors are noticing and coveting. Sign up here.] “A recent portrait of me in my Chelsea apartment taken by Tina Barney. I’ve looked at her work for my entire adult life, so to have her come into my home was so bizarre and wonderful, and we’ve actually become friends. I live on 23rd Street — it’s not a very attractive area, but I really like it. I’m so over beautiful cities.” Left: “It’s rare that I’m in awe of someone else’s color use, but the German artist Neo Rauch is one of the best colorists alive. This work of his is called ‘Chor’ (2011). What he does with the paint — the combinations and the distorting of bodies — just floors me. Once I’m able to afford one of his paintings, I’ll truly have made it.” Right: “Last year, I traveled to New Caledonia, off the coast of Australia, where one of my best friends is from. It’s a part of the world where life is entirely different, and I saw the strangest things, like islands with pine trees growing right next to palm trees. As with all good trips, so much of my experience there was unexpected.” Top: “I’ve long been drawn to the photography of the Dutch duo Blommers & Schumm. It’s dry. It’s simple. It’s the opposite of David LaChapelle or anything exaggerated. I think they are really underrated and should be shooting everything.” Bottom: “My surname is pronounced in Dutch like the word ‘luck,’ which prompted a friend to give me this horseshoe. I’ve worked very hard to get where I am, but I have also had a truly lucky life. Seeing this on my bookshelf reminds me of that every time.” Left: “Dallas BBQ in Chelsea is my favorite restaurant. It has a fun mix of characters — you’ll see an old couple sitting next to a group of drag queens. I don’t care about eating at the hot new places, as I think most New York restaurants are loud and too expensive for the quality. I’m more intrigued by things that aren’t highbrow, like diners, which are such an American invention.” Right: “My favorite look from fall 2019 was this dusty rose sheath dress overlaid with a diaphanous layer of bunched-up chiffon. The collection was about falling in love, which was something that was happening to me at the time. It was also about challenging myself to fall back in love with things that I didn’t like, like neon and lace.” Left: “I lived in Gabon, in Middle Africa, from age 4 to 8. Here I am in a field with a friend — I’m the one in the red T-shirt. We lived in a Shell camp in the middle of nowhere with other Dutch and German families. It was like a utopia — or a cult.” Right: “I have a love-hate relationship with pink. It used to be my favorite color, but we’ve done so much of it for Sies Marjan that lately I’ve been straying. Still, I collect all-pink images, like this one of Meryl Streep in ‘She-Devil’ (1989). I make a point of only looking at the color and not the content, and I don’t use Instagram for research — it’s dangerous, because you keep seeing the same things.” “My thesis collection at Saint Martins was a study of the color blue. I’m not a nostalgic person and rarely think back on old work, but I realized recently that it was actually a lot like my first Sies Marjan collection — both were explorations of color, proportion and texture.” Left: “This is the cover of a 2013 book of Nigel Shafran’s pictures. A few years later, when Sies Marjan started, I asked him to do a campaign called the Girlfriends Project, for which he shot my friends in the clothes. Nigel has this way of transcending fashion or art, so his work is entirely its own thing. He’s also been at it forever but is still so hungry to keep learning. I hope I’m like that when I’m older.” Center: “PJ Harvey has been the soundtrack of my life, and she’s one of the few people whose work I feel keeps getting better and better. Whenever I’m designing, I always think, ‘Where is PJ in all of this?’ She embodies this ideal woman for me in so many ways.” Right: “This little pocket book is my parents’ wedding album. My dad was named Sies and my mother’s named Marjan, and they got married in the ’70s in Vught, Holland. I didn’t want to name the label after myself because I’m not interested in fame or recognition, but I did want there to be a personal connection. Sies Marjan is just that, but still something I can hide behind.” Left: “As a student, I also did a collection inspired by the writer and painter Jan Cremer. I went to Amsterdam to interview him, and one of my questions was about what types of clothing he wore. Afterward, he gave me his paint-splattered work pants, and I’ve had them hanging on a wall of wherever I’ve lived ever since.” Right: “As a teenager, I was obsessed with the film industry and kept a diary of box-office numbers on Hollywood hits, starting, like a real ’90s kid, with ‘Jurassic Park.’ I still follow the industry today, and I can’t explain why. My head is full of useless information, and yet I don’t know things most people know.”",The New York Times

2019,A Dog’s Box-Office Journey,"With “A Dog’s Journey” and “John Wick: Chapter 3” in theaters, we look at how well canine stars contribute to ticket sales. It is a great weekend to be a Hollywood canine. There’s the release of “A Dog’s Journey,” the sequel to “A Dog’s Purpose,” which in 2017 tugged at the heart strings of animal lovers so enticingly it took in $205 million worldwide. And Keanu Reeves reprises his role as cinema’s most vengeful dog owner in “John Wick: Chapter 3 — Parabellum.” This time around, feisty Belgian Malinois join in on the action. Audiences often can’t resist when man’s best friend makes it to the big screen. “A remarkable 70 live-action films with dogs central to the plot have been released theatrically since 1974, and together these have grossed more than $2.2 billion at the domestic box office,” said Brad Brevet, the editor of Box Office Mojo, a service that tracks theatrical grosses. “There is a timeless, enduring quality to the relationship between people and their dogs, and people of all ages like seeing this reflected on screen.” But can studios just put them into any scenario and expect success? Which dog movies are the runt of the litter? Let’s take a closer a look. In the same way that Tom Hanks makes for a winsome everyman, an “everydog” is a heightened version of our pets onto which we can project larger themes and ideas. The cuter the dog the better, too. Twenty-seven years after its release, “Beethoven” is still the quintessential example, as the sight of the adorably gormless St. Bernard repeatedly enraging Charles Grodin led to a resounding worldwide gross of $147.2 million (via Box Office Mojo), which is $266.70 million adjusted for inflation. In “Marley & Me” (2008) it was a Labrador retriever’s turn to wreak havoc, but ultimately enchant Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston, which helped the movie to a haul of $286.5 million adjusted. The success of the puppy-populated “Beethoven’s 2nd” ($207.9 million adjusted) and the 1996 live-action “101 Dalmatians"" ($518.45 million adjusted) may show that throwing more dogs into the chaos works a treat, too. Which could be why “Snow Dogs” ($162.5 million adjusted), “Eight Below” ($151.82 million adjusted) and “Hotel for Dogs” ($138.6 million adjusted) were hits, even though they were instantly forgettable. “A Dog’s Purpose,"" “Cats & Dogs” ($288.24 million adjusted) and the king of laughably bad titles “Beverly Hills Chihuahua” ($176 million adjusted) finally gave dog owners who have tried to interpret a bark the chance to learn about their pets’ thoughts and motivations. Even the stunted vocabulary of Scooby-Doo inspired two early ’00s films to $632 million adjusted. Although that was more to do with his storied history as a cartoon rather than his riveting conversation. As you’d expect, Disney paved the way for animating dogs. “Lady & The Tramp” (1955) made $344.31 million adjusted, then, six years later, “101 Dalmatians” amassed $119.02 million adjusted. These timeless classic have been rereleased so often they’ve pocketed around $500 million in the decades since. “The Secret Life of Pets,” which has a sequel coming this summer, shows that this formula still works, grossing $875.6 million in 2016. Maybe moviegoers just want to see dogs being dogs rather than sports stars, cops or killers. “Air Bud"" is the most successful high-concept film with a dog, and even those illogical exploits on a high school basketball team made just $42.76 million adjusted. Sure “Max “and “See Spot Run,” with dogs as law enforcement officials, did make more, but their returns were soft when compared with their bigger budgets. The same can be said when dogs are overly aggressive, too. Sam Fuller’s “White Dog” (1982), about a canine trained for racial attacks, was a flop. And the deadly dog thriller “Man’s Best Friend” (1993) only made $25.8 million adjusted. Even the 1993 adaptation of Stephen King’s “Cujo” simply did fine: it grossed $54 million adjusted. Not exactly “Jaws” on four legs.",The New York Times
2019,"A Dream Delivered, and Another Dashed, in One Unforgettable Moment","On Soccer Tottenham stunned Ajax with three goals to earn a date with Liverpool in the Champions League final. AMSTERDAM — A single minute remained, maybe less. Maybe just a few seconds separated Ajax from the Champions League final. Somehow, even as the energy drained from their legs and the tension gripped their minds, this team that glimpses the future and echoes the past, had clung on. It had resisted everything Tottenham Hotspur could muster. It had steadied itself after throwing away a carefully constructed two-goal lead in the space of four minutes. It had maintained its poise even as it stood on the high wire, aware that a single slip might give Spurs a third away goal, the advantage, the tie. And now the clock ticked down through five minutes of injury time, each somehow slower, more agonizing than the last. Tottenham poured forward, pummeling Ajax. Hugo Lloris, the Spurs goalkeeper, trotted upfield for a corner. It came to nothing. That is, traditionally, the final roll of the dice, the last act. Once that has failed, it is over. Eyes drifted to Felix Brych, the German referee, the man who could bring the torture to an end. Ajax had the ball, deep in Tottenham territory. The wait was almost over. Ten months’ work. Just another few seconds. A decade of painstaking rebuilding, of thought and planning. Not long now. Twenty-three years since Ajax last graced club soccer’s greatest game. Almost there. And then, in the blink of an eye, it was gone. Time sped up. Everything became a blur. The ball nestled in Ajax’s goal. Lucas Moura, his hat trick complete, was buried under an avalanche of teammates. Tottenham’s coaching staff and substitutes poured on to the field, racing to join in. They screamed past the Ajax players scattered over the grass, lying face down, barely able to move even when Brych told them to get up, told them they had to finish the game, told them — though he was, it turned out, not correct — that they would have one more chance. It was not supposed to end like this. A season of such joy was not supposed to lead such pain. There were two stories here. One is about Tottenham, the team that did not sign a single player last summer or in January, the team that seemed to have run out of steam and, at one point, bodies, the team that lost its best player to injury, the team that has collapsed since February in the Premier League, running on empty, and yet now finds itself — 3-2 winners on the day and through on away goals — in its first ever Champions League final, against Liverpool on June 1 in Madrid. That story centers not on Moura, the hero of this game, or on Harry Kane, watching from the stands, or on any of the players who mustered improbable reserves of courage and steel and effort to drag Spurs back from the brink, but on Mauricio Pochettino, the club’s coach. Pochettino has never won a major honor. He has twice crafted Premier League title challenges, seemingly out of nowhere, before ultimately falling short. He has been roundly condemned for his very obvious disdain for England’s domestic cups, for his belief that what matters is qualifying for the Champions League, not winning the Carabao Cup. And yet now he stands on the cusp of one of the unlikeliest, finest managerial achievements imaginable: winning the Champions League in a season with, by modern English standards, the scantest resources imaginable. He said, on the eve of Wednesday’s game, that if Spurs were to make it to Madrid and win, he might have to leave. In the circumstances, he suggested, there would be no more worlds left to conquer, no way of exceeding such a feat. But the other story is about Ajax, about those players crumpled on the ground, about the fans standing silent in the stands. Nobody has put more into this competition than Ajax: literally, really, seeing as its campaign started not in the group stages, as Tottenham’s did — the good fortune of being part of one of the big leagues, the big television markets that are busy greedily bending the Champions League to their will — but several weeks before they began. Ajax’s first game on the road to Wednesday night was against Sturm Graz, of Austria, on July 25. It was only a couple of weeks after the World Cup final. Erik ten Hag, the coach, was without a handful of players who had been present in Russia. He had only seen Dusan Tadic, signed from Southampton for a substantial fee and Premier League wages, train a couple of times. Ajax came through that — the second qualifying round, graced by teams such as Moldova’s Sheriff Tiraspol and Kukesi, of Albania, and Lithuania’s Suduva Marijampole — and had to play Standard Liege, in the third qualifying round. Victory in that set up a meeting with Dinamo Kiev, in the playoff round. Ajax’s ambitions, at the start of the season, extended no further than surviving that obstacle course and making it to the lucrative group stages, where it had not set foot for five years. But its momentum grew and its confidence with it. Twice, it stood up to Bayern Munich. Benfica was dispatched. It made it to the round of 16. That would have been enough, more than enough, but Ajax was only just getting started. Ten Hag’s team did not just beat Real Madrid in the Bernabeu, it bewitched the reigning champion. A few weeks later, Cristiano Ronaldo and Juventus stood dazed in Turin, the player signed as a guarantee of glory rendered a statue by Ajax’s dazzling geometric patterns. In the first leg of this semifinal, Ajax produced 30 sublime minutes that left Spurs flat-footed, dizzied, uncomprehending. In the second, its superiority in the first half was so absolute that, ahead by 2-0 at halftime, the fans felt secure enough to start the party. That it was all brought crashing down, that Spurs’ players clawed their way back into the game, that they wrestled control away from Ajax, that they extinguished their dreams in the cruelest, most brutal fashion should not diminish what Ajax achieved, what Ajax meant. Real Madrid was not the greatest opponent this Ajax team overcame. Nor was Juventus. Its biggest challenge, by far, was the fact that this competition is no longer for teams like this. Ajax and its ilk are, at best, tolerated by the superclubs who see the Champions League as their birthright: their continued presence ranks somewhere between a nuisance and a hangover from history. That is why Ajax, last season’s Dutch runner-up, had to start its campaign in July, and Tottenham and Liverpool — third and fourth in the Premier League last year — could wait until September. It is why, for the first time, this season’s competition had 16 places reserved for the top four teams in England, Germany, Spain and Italy. Only two, the English pair in the final, have added as much to the gaiety of the competition as Ajax, and even that is debatable. It is why Andrea Agnelli, the president of Juventus, has spent much of the season pushing for even greater change: free entry for historical giants, a league structure, a permanent group of Champions League clubs. It is why, as fans gathered in central Amsterdam, UEFA was busy announcing proposals that might, essentially, make Agnelli’s vision a reality. If those clubs had their way, Ajax would not really have chance to be here. And that was why it was all the more important that it was here, that it came this far, even if — in the immediate aftermath — its players and its fans might wonder if the hurt was worth it. It will take time for Ajax’s young players, no matter how bright their future, to recover from this. But when they do, they will recall that they are not just the team that lost to Spurs in the last minute. They are also the team that beat Real Madrid and Juventus, the team that proved that the size of a television deal is no guarantee of quality, the team that reminded a continent that excellence can exist outside of the Premier League, La Liga, the Bundesliga and Serie A. They are the team that almost went all the way from Sturm Graz to the final. They are the team that came within a minute of doing what nobody imagined they could do, that many have tried to stop them doing. They are the team that came within a minute, a minute that never seemed to end, of making a dream come true.",The New York Times
2019,"A Dying Craft, Made to Order","On the outskirts of Mexico City, a cobbler makes handmade soccer cleats in a family workshop, preserving a tradition all but extinct in the era of mass production and Nafta. It took José Luis Rivera 22 years to fully learn how to make a pair of handmade soccer cleats. He was taught by his father-in-law, who once made a pair for Pelé. His wife’s family has made custom soccer cleats in Mexico City for generations. Rivera began as an apprentice to his father-in-law, David Rivas, who for more than four decades dedicated himself to making shoes that rose to fame in the 1970s on the amateur and professional soccer fields of Mexico. They were called Colmenero. When Rivera married Rivas’s daughter, he was 20 years old and the 1986 World Cup in Mexico was approaching. With no job prospects, he began helping out in the Rivas family workshop. His first tasks were simple, like cutting patterns in the leather. But little by little he began to learn which textures were the best fit for each part of the shoe, and how to handle the sewing machine. The last skill to perfect was attaching the sole and the studs. Once he mastered that, he was finally able to fit a whole pair together himself. “It was a job that required precision and, above all, the patience to learn,” Rivera said. Now 52, Rivera still toils at his craft in a small workshop in the eastern outskirts of Mexico City, proudly preserving a vanishing skill. Mass-produced shoes have edged out most of his business, but after four decades in his adopted trade, he refuses to let his artisanal business die. It is, he admits, a fight that was always going to be difficult to win, especially in the face of fierce competition from international companies like Nike, Puma and Adidas that flooded the Mexican market with cleats after the signing of the North American Free Agreement in 1994. Rivera is the last living heir to a tradition that began in 1960, when a professional player from Guadalajara, Eduardo Colmenero, grew tired of using cleats that hurt his feet. His solution? Make his own. “He took apart some shoes he had and replaced the plastic with leather,” Colmenero’s daughter, Ana Gabriela, said in an interview. His first pairs were only for his himself, but soon after Colmenero retired from the game in 1966, he dedicated himself to the shoe business full time. “He made them for players who had some irregularity in their feet,” Ana Gabriela said. “Like one foot wider than another, or one shorter than the other. He was able to custom-make everything to size.” As demand for his specialized shoes grew, Colmenero needed someone who could help him produce them. He went searching for an apprentice along the streets of the rough Mexico City neighborhood of Tepito, where all the city’s shoemakers converged to buy supplies and use communal sewing machines. There he found Rivas, recently was laid off from a shoe factory. Rivas and Colmenero realized they had an affinity for the same sewing machines and a shared vision for a business. They began a partnership that lasted 45 years, until Colmenero’s death in 2010. Their workshop grew to five people, and during the 1970s and ’80s they were making 600 pairs a month, sometimes working through the night to complete orders. The fame of their brand grew among players. During the 1970 World Cup, Rivas and Colmenero made shoes for Brazil’s Pelé and England’s Bobby Charlton. Later, they stitched a pair for the Mexican star Hugo Sánchez, Colmenero’s daughter said. “At that time it was difficult to find good soccer shoes,” said Felix Fernández, a former goalkeeper for Atlante and Mexico’s national team who now works as a commentator for Univision. Before Colmenero, he said, “even as a professional player, the only option was to buy black market imports in Tepito.” In those days, Mexico did not have access to the global market in the same way it does today, and the foreign goods that did make it into the country were prohibitively expensive. “Those were different times,” Fernández said. “Now all of the brands are available.” After Nafta brought down trade barriers in the 1990s, cheap, factory-made cleats from abroad poured into Mexico. “The demand for our shoes fell,” Rivera said. With well-known brands in every Mexican mall, young players no longer wanted to wear the bespoke blackout shoes with no logo made by the aging men in Tepito’s market. By the early 2000s, Rivas and Colmenero’s production had been cut in half — to about 300 pairs a month. By 2008, when Rivera, the apprentice, had finally learned how to masterfully assemble the perfect shoe, the business was on its last legs. “We would get orders for five to 10 pair of shoes a week, or sometimes no orders at all,” he said. In 2012, after Colmenero’s death, Rivas turned what was left of the business over to his son-in-law. The business is dead, Rivas told Rivera. Take all the machines to your house, they are yours. “If anyone calls,” he told Rivera, “then you can handle it.” Two years later, Rivas was dead, too. “I would say he died when he stopped making shoes,” Rivera said. At Rivas’s funeral, Colmenero’s heirs asked Rivera if he would continue the business in their father’s name, and he agreed. He continues to make about five to 10 pairs of cleats a month for a few loyal shoppers; they cost 1,200 pesos (about $62) a pair. The workshop is now next to his home in the working-class neighborhood of Valle de Chalco, along an unmarked dirt road. In the sparsely furnished room, he has a wooden table, a sewing machine and rolls of leather. It takes him about three hours to make a pair of cleats now, as he carefully works each shoe over a wooden mold with tools to tan and shape the leather. Each one is made to order, he stresses, ensuring that no two ever come out the same. “They are like gloves for your feet,” Rivera said. “Unique. And we make them with a lot of love.”",The New York Times
2019,"A Fake Heiress Called Anna Delvey Conned the City’s Wealthy. ‘I’m Not Sorry,’ She Says.","Anna Sorokin was convicted by a Manhattan jury, but told The New York Times from jail that she did nothing wrong — and would do it all again. [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] Even on her way to prison, even after a jury convicted her of swindling almost everyone she knew and a judge accused her of running “a big scam,” Anna Sorokin was sticking by her story. For years, Ms. Sorokin pretended to be Anna Delvey, a German heiress with a trust fund that paid for a life of glamorous ease. She lived in boutique hotels, wore designer clothes and hung out in Manhattan’s moneyed party circles. In reality, Ms. Sorokin, 28, was a Russian immigrant who walked out on bills, connived her way into luxury, and persuaded a bank employee to give her $100,000 she never intended to pay back, the jury decided in convicting her last month. But in two interviews with The New York Times at the Rikers Island jail complex, where she has been held since October 2017, Ms. Sorokin was eager to explain her actions as the naïve missteps of a young woman worried that she would not otherwise be taken seriously. “The thing is, I’m not sorry,” she said on Friday, a day after she was sentenced to four to 12 years in prison. “I’d be lying to you and to everyone else and to myself if I said I was sorry for anything. I regret the way I went about certain things.” She said she always intended to pay back her creditors, which included two downtown hotels, a private jet company and banks. In all, the jury found, Ms. Sorokin bilked these places out of more than $200,000 and tried to dupe a hedge fund into giving her a $25 million loan. In an interview about a week before her sentencing, Ms. Sorokin acknowledged that friends knew her as Anna Delvey. But that was just her mother’s maiden name, she said. (Her lawyer, Todd Spodek, later told The Times that he did not believe that was the case, and her parents had told New York magazine they did not recognize the name.) It was true, she said, that she had falsified some bank records, but only because she had a big dream. She had wanted to start a $40 million private club, and potential investors pushed her to open it before they would put up their own money. Ms. Sorokin insisted she was worried that as a young woman, she was vulnerable to men who would “cheer me on” and then seize control of her vision for the club, which she called the Anna Delvey Foundation. The attention of influential men in finance and real estate validated her, she said. “My motive was never money,” she said, dressed in a khaki jail jumpsuit and Céline glasses. “I was power hungry.” Friends may have thought she had millions of dollars at her disposal, she said, but that was a misunderstanding. She said she never told anyone she had that kind of money — they just assumed it. Still, while Ms. Sorokin made excuses for her actions, she did not apologize for her character: “I’m not a good person.” Ms. Sorokin said she was born in Russia and grew up in Eschweiler, Germany, where her father worked as an executive at a transport company, which eventually became insolvent. At 19, she left her parents and brother for Paris in pursuit of a fashion degree. Ms. Sorokin, who spoke only vaguely of her childhood, said she was not close to her “conservative” parents; she noted that they did not attend her trial. In Paris, she said she took on the name Anna Delvey when shooting photographs for Purple, a fashion, art and culture magazine. There, her attention turned to art. Earning just 400 euros a month, she remained financially dependent on her parents, who paid for her apartment, she said. But after experiencing a breakup, she headed to New York in the late summer of 2013 for a trip to Montauk and then Fashion Week. New York was not supposed to be a permanent move, but she found more friends than in Paris and decided to stay. For a while, she worked at Purple’s New York office, she said. But eventually, she quit that, too. This, prosecutors said, is when the striver Anna Delvey became the grifter Anna Delvey. She moved from boutique hotel to boutique hotel, handing out $100 tips and putting off bills with promises of wire transfers that never materialized. She organized dinners at expensive restaurants, hired a private personal trainer and wore Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent. She also began pitching her idea for her private club, which she called A.D.F., with exclusive memberships and rotating arts exhibits. She gained access to André Balazs, the hotelier; Roo Rogers, the British-American entrepreneur; and Aby Rosen, the real estate developer. In 2015, she befriended Gabriel Andres Calatrava, an architect and the son of Santiago Calatrava, the architect who designed the Oculus, the birdlike centerpiece of the World Trade Center transit hub. But time was running out. She said she felt pressured to open the club in order to attract more investors. Prosecutors said her ruse was collapsing. In late 2016, she said, she returned to Germany for a few months where she worked out the details of A.D.F. and created four fake bank statements in Photoshop, which she said took surprisingly little time. She returned to New York in early 2017. She would use those same documents again and again in pursuit of different loans, she said. Ms. Sorokin was first arrested in July 2017 for skipping out on thousands of dollars of bills at the Beekman and W New York hotels and a lunch bill of less than $200 at a restaurant at the Le Parker Meridien hotel. After being released, Ms. Sorokin was again arrested in October 2017 and held at Rikers. Ahead of trial, she said, she was offered a plea deal with a sentence of three to nine years in prison, but she considered that too long and took her chances on a trial. Although she was sentenced to a longer term than she had been offered in a plea deal, she said she did not regret going to trial. She said she has balked against authority in Rikers and has been disciplined 30 times, including a few weeks in solitary over Christmas. Because of her behavior, Ms. Sorokin said, she has been held in a maximum security section. A city corrections official confirmed the stint in solitary and said Ms. Sorokin had 13 infractions for things like fighting and disobeying orders. She said she had achieved a measure of fame among other inmates for cheating the rich but said she did not support that characterization of herself. Ms. Sorokin said she still has some infrequent visits from friends. But she has not seen Rachel Williams, a former Vanity Fair photo editor who testified against Ms. Sorokin at the trial. Ms. Williams accused her of stealing more than $60,000 for an opulent trip they took together to Marrakesh in 2017. A jury found Ms. Sorokin not guilty of the charge. On the stand, Ms. Williams had burst into tears, calling the theft the worst experience of her life. “She should try a week here,” Ms. Sorokin said dryly, of Rikers. Ms. Sorokin has started writing a memoir about her exploits in New York. She plans to write a second book about her experience at Rikers. In a subsequent phone interview, Ms. Sorokin said she was looking forward to finishing both books while in prison. “I guess I’m fortunate enough to go to real prison, so I’ll have more material,” she said. After her release, she is likely to be deported to Germany, but she said she then hoped to move to London. She said she had already made some “smaller investments” in technology and cryptocurrency with personal money routed through an L.L.C. Ms. Sorokin said she was also interested in criminal justice reform, artificial intelligence and the banking industry, adding: “Ideally, if all goes well, I’ll have my own investment fund.” Mr. Spodek, her lawyer, said: “I don’t know how realistic some of these business endeavors are. But I’m confident that this won’t be the last time we hear from Anna, and I know that she will go on to great things.” Others are also writing Ms. Sorokin’s story: Ms. Williams has deals with HBO and Simon & Schuster. And Netflix purchased the rights to the New York magazine story for an undisclosed amount. Shonda Rhimes, the creator of “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Scandal,” has been tapped to dramatize it. As guards signaled the end of the visit before her sentencing, Ms. Sorokin was asked if, given the chance, she would do the same things again. Ms. Sorokin shrugged. “Yes, probably so,” she said, laughing. An earlier version of this article misspelled part of the name of a television show created by Shonda Rhimes.

2019,A Family Finally Comes Together Under One Roof,"Vows When Gabriel Friedman came into Laura Hamm’s life in July 2015, she was already living with someone she had met 10 months earlier at an IHOP in Baton Rouge, La. “We began living together almost immediately after I met him, and my parents were very concerned about that decision,” said Ms. Hamm, who was born and raised in Shreveport, La., in what she described as “a very conservative, faith-driven, Southern Baptist family.” Ms. Hamm’s situation seemed to leave no room in her life for Mr. Friedman, a colleague from the Philadelphia area who met her — and refused to forget her — during a work conference in Boston at the national headquarters of City Year, a nonprofit organization that trains tutors and mentors for public schools. “She was this amazing, kindhearted, beautiful woman,” said Mr. Friedman, who worked in City Year’s Boston office. “I was so completely taken with her that I reached out to a mutual friend and asked him to put in a good word for me.” Ms. Hamm, then the executive director of City Year’s Baton Rouge office, recalled the first of what would be many endorsements of Mr. Friedman by their mutual friend. “He told me that Gabe was a really kind and respectful person, just an overall great guy who was very interested in me,” she said. “He went on to say that Gabe was such a gentleman, he might be reluctant to pursue me.” Ms. Hamm’s initial response, relayed by their mutual friend to Mr. Friedman, was not exactly what he was hoping to hear. “I like Gabe, but what’s the point,” she said of a potential get-together with Mr. Friedman. “It will never work because Gabe is in Boston and I’m here in Baton Rouge — with Logan.” Ms. Hamm was referring to Logan Circello, “an energetic and precocious 8-year-old boy,” as she described him, who was the same person she met at IHOP in September 2014. She had been introduced by a friend to Logan’s parents, whose struggles with drug addiction placed Logan in jeopardy of entering Louisiana’s foster care system. “I saw this little boy who was so skinny and unkempt,” said Ms. Hamm, now 37. “It was apparent that he needed some help, so I told him that he could live with me and that we would figure out a way to make it work.” Ms. Hamm took swift legal action and became Logan’s foster mother and legal guardian, “which meant that he could grow up in a stable environment,” she said. While her family supported this decision, Ms. Hamm’s father, Dr. David Hamm, a thoracic surgeon in Shreveport, said what worried them the most was that “raising Logan meant that Laura herself had to grow up almost overnight.” “When you bring a child into your home, life is no longer all about you, or where you want to go or what you want to do, as there are many responsibilities attached to being a single parent,” he said. “Yet Laura was determined and ready to make sacrifices, and she fully embraced her new role.” As Ms. Hamm was figuring out how to make it work with Logan, Mr. Friedman, then 1,600 miles away, was figuring out how to make it work with Ms. Hamm. “From the moment I met Laura, I couldn’t get her off my mind,” said Mr. Friedman, 31. “The fact that she sacrificed so much of herself for Logan spoke volumes about her character. It told me all I needed to know about her kindness, unselfishness and the endless amount of love in her heart.” He continuously peppered her with phone calls and texts, and exchanged messages with her on Facebook, all the while hoping for a chance “to be a part of her world.” Though Ms. Hamm often told friends at the time that she “was not of a dating mind-set,” she admitted to enjoying her frequent chats with Mr. Friedman. “Knowing there was something in the air between me and Gabe definitely added some fun and excitement to each and every one of our conversations,” she said. “We never had a bad call, or ran out of things to say to each other.” Through those conversations, Mr. Friedman came to know that Ms. Hamm was an avid churchgoer who graduated from Louisiana State University, and that she is the only daughter of Suzanne McConnell Hamm, a Sunday school teacher in Shreveport, and Dr. Hamm, who is also a managing partner in Red River Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgeons there. “I also learned how much Laura loved Logan, and how deeply committed she was to him,” said Mr. Friedman, who graduated from Yale and was a Fulbright fellow in Brazil in 2011. Mr. Friedman was raised in Merion, Pa., a son of Hallie Boorstyn Friedman and Stewart D. Friedman. His mother was a former clinical psychologist in Philadelphia. His father is a professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and the author of a series of books on leadership, including “Leading the Life You Want: Skills for Integrating Work and Life” (Wharton Digital Press, 2014). “Early in their relationship, Laura came along with us on a trip and I found her to be loving, flexible, generous and all-accepting of everyone,” said Mr. Friedman’s mother, Hallie Friedman. Mr. Friedman’s father was equally impressed. “Gabe looked into Laura’s soul and saw someone, maybe for the first time, who was more giving than he was,” Stewart Friedman said. During one of their conversations in November 2015, Ms. Hamm and Mr. Friedman realized they would both be in Manhattan during the same weekend. Ms. Hamm had planned what she called a “girls weekend out,” with three of her friends, and Mr. Friedman and his sister, Lody Friedman, had purchased tickets to see “Hamilton.” They all met for drinks on a Saturday night, and the next morning, Mr. Friedman paid a visit to Ms. Hamm at her hotel to make his case for a relationship. “Look, last night was fun, but we’re actually not dating and we live in two different cities,” Ms. Hamm told Mr. Friedman. “As I said before, what’s the point in doing this.” This time, however, Mr. Friedman was in a much better position to field Ms. Hamm’s question. He brought along a mental blueprint of sorts that mapped out their potential future together, with Logan front and center every step of the way. Ms. Hamm was thrilled. “He instantly came back with a very-well-thought-out plan for the three of us that made a lot of sense,” she said. “He was like ‘Well, we can start dating now and then in two years we can move to New York together.’ He really had the whole thing laid out in his mind, a plan with so many incredible details, and he was so confident about it, it was just phenomenal.” Suddenly, there was another man in Ms. Hamm’s life. They began dating long distance and were sailing along until April 2016, when Logan’s world was rocked by the news of his mother’s unexpected death. (Ms. Hamm and Mr. Friedman attended her funeral, with Logan. ) Two months later, Logan’s father, who had just completed a rehabilitation program, contacted Ms. Hamm and told her he was ready to reclaim custody of Logan, and shortly thereafter picked up his son and they drove away, leaving Ms. Hamm and Mr. Friedman “with a whole lot of mixed emotions,” he said. “While we were thrilled that Logan was reuniting with his father,” he said, “it saddened us to know that we would hardly ever see him again.” In July 2016, Ms. Hamm and Mr. Friedman moved to Manhattan — in two separate apartments — as per Mr. Friedman’s blueprint. She relocated to the Upper East Side, and began working remotely for City Year’s Baton Rouge office. He moved to the Upper West Side, and was back in the employ of another education nonprofit group, Eye to Eye. In August 2016, severe flooding ravaged parts of Louisiana, and thousands of houses and businesses were submerged, including the home that Logan had been sharing with his father. Logan’s father decided to move in with a friend while searching for a new place where he and Logan could live, and in the interim contacted Ms. Hamm to ask if she could take Logan back in for a brief period of time. In the ensuing days, Ms. Hamm and Mr. Friedman waited in angst for a call from Logan’s father to make arrangements to take Logan with him again, but that call never came. Instead, Ms. Hamm and Mr. Friedman received a call from someone close to Logan’s father saying that he had suffered a relapse during his ongoing rehabilitation and was no longer in a position to care and provide for his son. “Once again, mixed emotions,” Mr. Friedman said. “We were ecstatic about having Logan with us again, but completely saddened by everything his father was going through.” In August 2017, Ms. Hamm took a job as the executive director of City Year’s New York office, and four months later Ms. Hamm, Mr. Friedman and Logan all moved into an apartment on the Upper East Side, where they were finally one family living under one roof. Sarah Samarasinghe, a longtime friend of Ms. Hamm who was once her boss at City Year, said, “Laura, Gabe and Logan work very well as a family.” “Gabe was an easy fit,” she added. “Like Laura, he’s fun-loving, and he’s giving, and that’s why he so beautifully complemented the life that Laura and Logan had already established.” In September 2018, Mr. Friedman enrolled at N.Y.U., where he is now studying for a master’s of public administration degree and working at N.Y.U.’s Furman Center as a research assistant on housing and urban policy. “As for Logan, we thought it was important for him to understand that we were slowly building a family that included him,” Ms. Hamm said. “He’s 12 now and really super curious, and because there has been so much uncertainty in his life, he sometimes gets nervous about living with us and starts wondering where exactly he fits in.” Ms. Hamm and Mr. Friedman were married April 13 in a brief traditional Jewish ceremony at the Parker Hotel in Midtown Manhattan. David Hamm Jr., the bride’s brother, became a Universal Life minister for the occasion. “You are an endless source of inspiration,” he said to his sister before 155 guests. About that time, Logan, looking dapper in a blue suit as one of three groomsmen standing a few feet from the bride and groom, began fidgeting. Later at the reception, he explained the reason he appeared somewhat nervous, especially during the exchange of vows. “I was a little bit overwhelmed,” he said, “because I began thinking that once they were married they were pretty much going to be my real parents, and after all this time, we were all going to be an official family.”",The New York Times
2019,"A Festival of German Theater, Where More Is More","Theater Review BERLIN — This year’s installment of Theatertreffen Berlin, the spring festival of the best of German-language theater that has been going strong since 1964, required some sitzfleisch — that is, the ability to stay planted on your derrière without fidgeting for the duration of a Wagner opera. From a 10-hour Greek-inspired epic to takes on August Strindberg and David Foster Wallace that lasted four hours apiece, the program seemed to argue that, when it comes to cutting-edge drama, more is more. With roughly 150 state-funded theaters and a similar number of independent stages, Germany has a uniquely rich theatrical landscape. (Last year, the Foreign Ministry applied for the country’s theaters and orchestras to be placed on Unesco’s list of intanglible cultural heritage.) But Theatertreffen 2019’s nine productions also spanned the German-speaking world, with Austria and Switzerland, two smaller nations with robust theater scenes, well represented. Last year, the festival kicked off with Frank Castorf’s acclaimed seven-hour “Faust,” the director’s penultimate production for the Berlin Volksbühne, which he led with an iron fist for 25 years before being ousted in 2017. Castorf’s messy and unhinged vision of Goethe’s classic felt like a celebration of the wild, unpredictable Berlin that many feel is fast disappearing. This time around, the festival spoke with a less pronounced Berlin accent. The city’s leading ensemble theaters were virtually shut out: The Deutsches Theater was the only one to make the cut, although its entry, a gripping chamber version of the Ingmar Bergman film “Persona,” was first seen in Sweden at Theater Malmö, which co-produced it. The two other Berlin shows were both independent productions. In one, Thorsten Lensing’s quick-witted and energetic version of the novel “Infinite Jest,” the four hours miraculously whiz by as six nimble actors appear in multiple roles in a reduced version of David Foster Wallace’s 1,000-page postmodern epic. The madcap story of the Incandenza brothers and the dysfunctional damaged characters who cross their paths unspools on a mostly bare stage, with the actors performing in front of, leaning against or, occasionally, mounted on a large rust-colored wall. Despite its minimal trappings, Mr. Lensing’s production is resolutely traditional in the sharp focus it places on the highly disciplined cast, whose emotionally and physically raw performances careen from wild slapstick humor to downright cruelty to genuine pathos. Throughout this surreal and frequently hilarious ride into existential despair, Mr. Lensing and his troupe manage to walk Mr. Wallace’s tightrope between irony and sincerity. A similar degree of theatrical purity, if not rigor, was on display in the festival’s final entry from Berlin, “Oratorium,” by the performance collective She She Pop, a predominantly female group with a penchant for the experimental. Described as “a collective meditation on a well-kept secret,” this 100-minute show about the runaway housing market in Berlin uses a ritualized call-and-response between the actors and the audience to reflect on the place of the individual, especially non-property-owners, in a deeply unequal society. The debt to Bertolt Brecht and his “Lehrstücke” — the didactic plays from the 1920s and 1930s that collapse the divide between stage and spectators — is immediately apparent. Max Knoth’s songs, accompanied by trumpet and vibraphone, recall the stage music of Hanns Eisler and Paul Dessau, two of Brecht’s collaborators. The onstage marching and flag waving lend the production an agitprop feel, while the text itself is a far cry from Brecht’s idealism: The show rails against the inequities and abuses of late capitalism without proposing radical solutions. At one point, members of the audience with an inheritance are requested to come onstage and calculate the combined net worth of their property. This is done without ridicule or scorn, but rather with a frank acknowledgment that, while extreme inequalities are present in contemporary society, privilege is not, in itself, a crime. The wittiest and most refreshing moments come early in the evening, with reams of projected text addressed to various segments in the audience: single mothers without fixed incomes; freelancers; retirees with ample pensions; retirees without ample pensions. In response, the members of these cohorts raise their voices tentatively at first and then with mounting confidence. After a while, however, the novelty wears off, and the show’s coda — in which the audience sings along with the Beatles’ “Because,” a beautiful song (with tricky harmonies!) about appreciating the way things are — ends the show on a note at once sentimental and defeatist. Theater as communal ritual is also a central element of “Dionysos Stadt,” Christopher Rüping’s staggering 10-hour production based on Greek epics, which was arguably the festival’s most lauded entry. In fall 2018, “Dionysos Stadt” kicked off the Münchner Kammerspiele’s season on a high note, and it has since become one of the season’s biggest hits, with further performances planned in Munich for later this season and next. Over the past week, Berlin critics and audiences swooned at discovering the play, which encompasses Prometheus, the Trojan War and the Oresteia, to name a few of the episodes. Mr. Rüping, 33, is an in-house director at the Kammerspiele, and this marked his second consecutive appearance at the festival to represent Munich’s storied playhouse. (His muscular “Drums in the Night” was a highlight last year.) The most perplexing show I saw at the festival was Sebastian Hartmann’s “The Insulted and Humiliated,” based on an early novel by Dostoyevsky, one of two productions from the Staatsschauspiel Dresden. Over 160 intermissionless minutes, nine jittery actors attempt a deconstruction of the Russian writer’s sprawling and tragic melodrama. The performances are undeniably fearless, with two members of the theater’s ensemble, the virtuosic Luise Aschenbrenner and the magnetic Torsten Ranft, particularly memorable. But the production itself is bewildering: It incorporates a lecture on poetics delivered piecemeal throughout the performance by an actor, a late-evening monologue about Surrealism, and a massive canvas that is constantly painted and repainted on the rotating stage. How and why “The Insulted and the Humiliated” beat out nearly 400 productions for a coveted spot in the Theatertreffen lineup were almost enough to make me lose faith in the festival’s selection committee. But Claudia Bauer’s production of “Tartuffe, or the Pig of Wisdom” the following evening succeeded in restoring it. Theater Basel in Switzerland commissioned this zany rewrite of Molière’s comedy about the unmasking of a lecherous charlatan from the German electropop musician and writer PeterLicht, and cast it with eight of the company’s superb actors. PeterLicht filled in the basic contours of Molière’s original with exuberantly hilarious dialogue that seems to follow Monty Python logic. With its neurotic silliness and its linguistic obsessiveness, the text also seems to owe a debt to the quirky writer-director René Pollesch. The frequent repetition can be tiresome, like a comedy sketch gone on too long, but there’s no denying the delirious pleasure that comes from watching this cleverly contrived and nimbly executed farce. In the buildup to this year’s festival, Theatertreffen faced a backlash for the underrepresentation of female theater makers. (Just a third of the nine productions were by women.) In response, Theatertreffen announced that starting next year, half of the offerings will be directed by women or majority female collectives: a bold proviso in such a male-dominated industry. But can a quota system translate into quality? That’s what theatergoers will be wondering when the next Theatertreffen rolls around.",The New York Times
2019,A Fiat Chrysler-Renault Merger Would Put Nissan in a Bind,"When Japanese police officers surrounded Carlos Ghosn’s Gulfstream jet last November and packed him off to a Tokyo jail, they unwittingly provoked a seismic realignment of the global auto industry. Mr. Ghosn’s sudden fall set off a chain of events that, this month, prompted Renault’s chairman, Jean-Dominique Senard, and John Elkann, the Fiat Chrysler chairman, to jump on their mobile phones and entertain a crazy idea: a deal to create the world’s third-largest automaker, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions. After a flurry of phone calls and meetings between the two men over several weeks, Fiat Chrysler formally asked Renault to merge on Monday. If the deal goes forward, the combined Renault and Fiat Chrysler would elbow past General Motors in car sales and create a new challenger to Volkswagen and Toyota, the global leaders. And if Fiat Chrysler and Renault can patch up strained relations with Nissan, with which the French company has a formal alliance, the three would be de facto the biggest car manufacturer in the world by a wide margin and might force other large automakers to rethink their strategies. Whether this industry-changing behemoth ever takes shape, though, may depend on what was likely to be a tense meeting Tuesday, which will continue on Wednesday, in Tokyo between Mr. Senard and Hiroto Saikawa, the Nissan chief executive. Without Nissan, Fiat Chrysler and Renault would be a big but far less formidable competitor, heavily exposed to the lackluster European economy and lacking any significant presence in China, which has become the world’s biggest car market. But Nissan’s management has previously rejected Renault’s appeals for a closer partnership, and even a merger. Renault executives kept Mr. Saikawa in the dark about their talks with Fiat Chrysler until days before the deal was announced, according to multiple people with knowledge of the talks. The slight could only have aggravated relations already strained after Mr. Ghosn’s arrest revealed deep differences about the future course of the Renault Nissan Alliance, which also includes Mitsubishi. The Europeans were secretive because they worried that the Japanese might feel threatened and try to interfere by leaking the details to government officials or the press, according to a person with knowledge of their thinking. That was hardly a show of trust between companies that until recently were held up as a model of cross-cultural cooperation, an example of how carmakers can acquire the size and geographical breadth they need to survive while retaining their own identities. “It speaks volumes about the relationship,” said Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst at AutoTrader. “How are you going to make all this work when there are such bad feelings?” The companies say they want to continue to work together. But the lack of communication is inauspicious for an undertaking that, with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in the mix, would be a hybrid of Japanese, American, French and Italian corporate cultures. Any two of those would be tough enough. “If you add F.C.A., there will be a power struggle,” said Yoshio Tsukuda, an auto industry analyst at the Tsukuda Mobility Research Institute. With the proposed Fiat-Renault deal in hand, Mr. Senard arrived in Tokyo this week with a lot more clout than the last time the partners met, in April. Nissan, on the other hand, is weakened after it reported less profit than Renault for the first time in a decade. But Nissan is wary of the Renault-Fiat merger, according to a person familiar with the company’s thinking. After Mr. Ghosn’s ouster on charges of financial misconduct, which he denies, Mr. Saikawa complained about what he saw as Renault’s unfair dominance of the alliance. Renault owns 43 percent of Nissan. But Mr. Saikawa argued that the Japanese company sells far more cars: 5.5 million in its last fiscal year compared with fewer than four million for Renault. With Fiat Chrysler on its side, Renault would become an even more overbearing partner. Fiat and Renault had combined sales last year of 8.7 million vehicles. And Mr. Senard and Mr. Elkann, a scion of the Agnelli family, which has controlled Fiat for more than a century, have much in common. Though Mr. Senard, 66, formerly the head of the tire maker Michelin, is Mr. Elkann’s elder by over two decades, both are products of elite European universities and speak French with each other. They have known each other for many years. There is no such bonhomie with Mr. Saikawa. The deal with Fiat Chrysler also sets up a turf battle in the United States that will be difficult for Nissan to win. Renault and Nissan largely stayed out of each other’s way in the two decades since they formed an alliance. Renault concentrated on Europe, Russia, the Middle East and Africa; Nissan focused on Asia and the United States. They bought parts together and shared the cost of developing new models, with their savings topping billions of dollars. But Fiat Chrysler and Nissan are in a war of attrition in the sagging American market, where both are heavily discounting their vehicles to get them off the lots and selling to rental fleets, which is less profitable than selling to consumers. “Previously Renault and Nissan were kind of complementary in their geographic coverage,” said Christopher Richter, an auto industry analyst at CLSA, a research firm. “Now you’ve introduced a new maker who is very big in the U.S., which is one of Nissan’s core markets, and Nissan is competitive with Chrysler in the U.S., so that’s another problem to solve.” After the arrest and ouster of Mr. Ghosn it became obvious how much the alliance depended on his personality and limitless self-confidence. By the time Mr. Senard took over in January, relations had seriously deteriorated. He tried to smooth things over, still hoping — like Mr. Ghosn — to eventually create a closer alliance, maybe even a single company. Mr. Senard spoke with Mr. Saikawa regularly, according to a person familiar with their interactions. They created a new leadership board for the Renault Nissan Alliance in March that gives equal weight to the Japanese side of the partnership. To soothe Japanese sensibilities, Mr. Senard insisted that there was no rush to revive talks about strengthening the alliance, at least until the leadership vacuum left by Mr. Ghosn was filled. Privately, Renault executives were increasingly concerned about Nissan’s flagging financial performance. Nissan had regularly contributed about 2 billion euros, or $2.2 billion, annually to the alliance. But Nissan cut its profit forecast in February, citing difficulties in the United States and Europe. Soon after the new leadership board’s first meeting in Paris in April, in which Mr. Saikawa and executives of Nissan and Mitsubishi were wined and dined at a dinner atop Renault’s flagship showroom on the Champs-Élysées, tensions flared. Mr. Senard had put together what advisers said was an informal proposal to merge with Nissan under a holding company. The plan was drafted in secret, but almost immediately leaked to the Japanese news media. Nissan angrily rebuffed the idea. Mr. Senard was taken off guard by the leaks and saw them as a serious breach of trust, according to a person with knowledge of his thinking. The leaks help explain why no one told Nissan about the talks with Fiat Chrysler. At the same time, Fiat Chrysler hoped to avoid alienating the Japanese, who were seen as essential partners. Mr. Senard and Mr. Elkann had already spoken informally about the idea of a tie-up, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. Fiat Chrysler had been more or less openly looking for a merger partner for several years, and Mr. Elkann was eager to move ahead. But the discussions accelerated in early May after Nissan issued a profit warning, a further sign of its financial distress. Speaking often by mobile phone, and with the discreet approval of the French government — which is Renault’s largest shareholder — Mr. Senard and Mr. Elkann hammered out a deal within a month. From the French perspective, linking with Fiat Chrysler presented a chance to increase Renault’s international reach. A merger would also reinforce Renault’s balance sheet, which was looking bleak because of Nissan’s flagging profits. A deal with Fiat would bring immediate cash to help weather a downturn in the European car market. Renault and Fiat Chrysler could also save billions by buying supplies and components together and sharing the cost of developing new technologies. In some respects, Nissan would be getting what it wanted, too. Mr. Senard will no longer press the idea of a merger with the Japanese automaker, according to three people with knowledge of the situation. The deal would reduce French government influence over Renault, long a sore point with the Japanese. And because the new company would be based in the Netherlands, Nissan could exercise voting rights it has been denied under French law. But for Nissan, the episode is also a lesson in being careful what you wish for. The company would be left with markedly less influence in an alliance it probably can’t survive without. “At the end of the day,” said Koji Endo, an auto analyst at SBI Securities in Japan, “I think Nissan has no choice but to say yes.”",The New York Times
2019,"A Filipino-American Memoir of Racism, Abuse and Heartbreak","Nonfiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. THE BODY PAPERS A Memoir By Grace Talusan Much of Grace Talusan’s memoir, “The Body Papers,” will be familiar to any reader of immigrant narratives. But what renders the book memorable — perhaps what earned it the Restless Books Prize for New Immigrant Writing — is the author’s unstinting self-portrait. We see Talusan clearly in the present, warts and all, precisely through the stark, lucid representations of herself in the past. Having moved with her family from the Philippines to suburban America when she was 2 years old, Talusan recalls complex feelings of loss, displacement and adjustment. The titular “body” is not only biological but also cultural and sexual. She all but forgets her native tongue, Tagalog. On visits to Manila, she looks as if she belongs, but once she opens her mouth it is immediately apparent that she’s from the United States. As she dryly notes, “This is what happens when assimilation brings erasure.” Luckily, however, she doesn’t have to worry about communicating: Thanks to United States colonization, English is one of the country’s official languages. But language isn’t the only marker of Talusan’s Americanness. In a humorous sequence set amid the chaotic traffic of Manila, where “about one pedestrian is killed every other day,” she orders drivers to stop so she can get to the other side in one piece. “As soon as I step into a Manila crosswalk,” she writes, “I distinguish myself by losing my cool.” Then there’s the inevitable exposure to racism, as a brown-skinned girl growing up in a predominantly white Boston neighborhood. She is teased by a third grader who makes “ching-chong sounds while pulling back the corners of his eyes.” Later, when she dates white men from the military, she can’t help recalling how back home, Filipina bar girls were looked down upon for liaisons with Americans in uniform. The depth and virulence of racism is brought home to her when her African-American husband gets beaten up so badly she can hardly recognize him in the hospital. Reading W. E. B. Du Bois, Talusan recognizes her own experience in his notion of “double consciousness.” She too knows what it is to be Othered: “I was constantly refracting myself through multiple mirrors, wondering who I was perceived to be by others, how I perceived myself.” Despite her and her family’s United States citizenship, the recent Muslim travel ban still engenders moments of paranoia. “Even though I had lived in America since I was 2 years old, I felt the tectonic plates of identity shift. I started carrying my U.S. passport with me whenever I left the house.” The memoir’s social concerns, however, pale in comparison to the challenges Talusan confronts in the private sphere — within her own physical body. For seven years, starting when she’s only 7, she is sexually victimized by her paternal grandfather, who “entered my life like lava, incinerating everything in its path.” Menstruation awakens her to potential motherhood, spurring her to finally rebuff the sleazy patriarch, shoving him out of her room, upon which “my rage turned to joy.” Her triumph is short-lived. The psychic pain worsens as she grows up, debilitated by depression. In college she fights the urge to self-mutilate. Informed of the sexual abuse, her father writes to his father, his ama, “You are dead to me now.” As it turns out, he too was regularly brutalized by the paterfamilias as a child. Another physical challenge springs from Talusan’s heredity: She and her sisters have a genetic predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer. She opts for a pre-emptive double mastectomy and an oophorectomy. At the doctor’s office, she weeps for the children she will never have, assuaged only by the unshakable love between her and her husband. In such powerful, evocative scenes as this one, “The Body Papers” comes fully alive. Now a lecturer at Tufts University, Talusan chronicles that fraught passage from one world, one body, to another, marking with sensitivity how an American life can be both burden and benediction.",The New York Times
2019,A Financial Checklist for Your Newly Minted High School Graduate,"We’ve got budget, retirement account, credit, information security and insurance advice for your independent adult, college student, gap-year taker or future soldier. The summer after high school graduation inevitably includes monthslong encounters with various to-do lists. Extra-long-sheet purchases and milk crates for future collegians. A résumé for job seekers. Thank-you notes for all. But let me suggest one more itemized offering: a list of financial tasks. If you want to set your child up properly for college, work, military service and the years beyond, there are several things you ought to do, help them do or teach them before too long. Got a younger teenager? No time like the present to get started with a lot of this. Is one of your children already in college? You probably haven’t done all of these things yet. This list applies to teenagers who face no major mental or physical health challenges. If your child does, revise at will, and please send me your own list via the email address below so I can publish one next year for young people who function differently. Let’s get started. [Sign up for the Your Money newsletter and every week you’ll receive tips on retirement, paying for college, credit cards and the right way to invest.] Begin with a conversation about who is paying for what: room, board, phone, transportation, insurance. Pencil it out with a simple spreadsheet or one of the many budgeting apps that did not exist even a decade ago. Food costs often flummox teenagers moving out for the first time. Takeout is tempting if they haven’t cooked much. If they splurge for meat, fresh fruits or vegetables at the grocery store, spoilage may take its toll. A practice month or two at home — where you don’t let them cheat by relying on staples like spices and oils already in your pantry — might be useful. First bank account? Teach your teenager to balance a checkbook. Turn off overdraft protection to enforce budgeting and avoid fees, or at least make certain he or she knows how high fees are. Set up low-balance alerts. Install the institution’s app. Are adults providing some funds from time to time? Make sure the transfer mechanism from their accounts is seamless and free of fees. Then, test how long it takes for the money to land. Many teenagers are more facile with money-transfer apps like Venmo than adults. But when you can push money to anyone in an instant, mistakes will happen. And it may not be easy to fix them quickly. Begin by setting up multifactor authentication and a PIN. Believe the warnings Venmo issues about not using the app to pay people you don’t know. Use the app’s code system — or at least the user profile picture — to be certain you’re paying the correct Emily Smith. Speaking of mobile payment apps, just how good is your teenager’s password? Is it something a rogue piece of thieving software could easily guess? Has your child repeated passwords across sites in a way that might leave them vulnerable? This is a good time to ask. Identity theft doesn’t just happen electronically. Make sure your child’s Social Security card isn’t in a wallet; it’s better to carry the number in memory. Moreover, help your teenager learn when not to share it. Debbie Schwartz, founder of the Road2College website, heard from her daughter that her sorority was asking after her Social Security number. “She questioned why, and they didn’t have a good answer,” she said. Her daughter never handed it over. Doctors often ask for a Social Security number. Have your child ask if the doctor truly needs it, or leave the spot blank on an intake form and see if anyone cares. Has your child ever made a doctor’s appointment? Fix that. Outsource form management as well. My teenager was twice as fast as me on the tablets that many doctors use for intake these days anyway, so good riddance to all that paperwork. Your children can stay on your health insurance plan until the age of 26, thanks to the Affordable Care Act. If you plan on having them pitch in for deductibles, it’s probably time to sit down and explain how your family coverage works. At the very least, they need to know what a co-pay is. According to the scores of parents who responded to my query on Grown and Flown, a website and Facebook group for parents of teenagers and young adults, filling a prescription for the first time is filled with interesting obstacles, especially on refills for regular but essential medicines. So introduce your child to the various insurance cards and account numbers he or she needs, and do a walk-through with your local druggist or whatever mail-order pharmacy your insurance company forces you to use. Most employers that issue formal paychecks will require your teenager to fill out the Internal Revenue Service’s W-4 form. So review it to explain what it is and what kind of taxes, if any, your teenager might pay. Do you get confused when you have to fill out your own every so often? There’s no shame in that, and the I.R.S. has a calculator that can help. And if it looks like too much money, or too little, is showing up in the first check after the withholding of taxes that you specified, you can revise the form. If compound interest isn’t officially the eighth wonder of the world, then it ought to be. The sooner teenagers start saving, the more they could benefit from its magic as it unfolds over a half-century or more. Show your teenager a chart of the vastly higher returns possible for those who begin earlier, like the one I tweet out from time to time. Then, set your child up in a Roth I.R.A., where money can grow tax-free for decades and isn’t subject to taxes once it’s withdrawn in retirement. You can open a Roth I.R.A. only for someone who has already earned money working, but it doesn’t matter how young the person is. If there isn’t much money, that’s fine; getting started early is partly about making savings a habit. Fidelity, Vanguard and other brokerage firms offer ways to open an account for next to nothing in fees. Many young people have spotty credit reports for the first few years of adulthood. Perhaps they’re confused by our confounding student loan system and miss a few payments early on, or they miss other bills here and there before someone explains that every late payment matters. Parents can help set a good baseline by getting what’s known as an “authorized user” card in a child’s name. Even if you just put it away in a drawer, away from temptation, your own regular payments will accrue to your child’s formerly blank credit report. Card companies handle these accounts in different ways. You’ll want to ask whether an authorized user needs to be a certain age, whether there’s an annual fee for the extra card and whether the card company will penalize children if parents pay their own bills late. Child identity theft is a problem, and the three big credit bureaus — Equifax, Experian and TransUnion — have grudgingly begun to allow people under 18 to freeze their credit files. When a file is frozen, creditors generally won’t open a new account because they can’t check the applicant’s credit. That should stop thieves who are trying to impersonate your child. Setting up a freeze is a bit of an ordeal, and I’ve written a column-length guide to the process and a follow-up on how Equifax was making it needlessly difficult for some people. But it’s worth the effort. A credit freeze isn’t supposed to prevent you from adding your child as an authorized user on your credit card. But just to be safe, it’s probably best to wait to set one until after you have an authorized user card in hand. When applying for financial aid, which includes the ability to gain access to the federal student loan system, families must fill out a Free Application for Federal Student Aid form. It contains lots of financial information, including household income. Students and a parent are both supposed to sign it and attest to its accuracy. If your child was an active participant in filling out the form, great. If not, go over it now. It’s as good a time as any to talk to your teenager about how much money you make. After all, if your child aspires to a life like the one you’ve provided (or wants to live larger or thinks less will do), he or she needs some context. This knowledge can influence your child’s choice of major, so better to have it now. Worried about children blabbing? Remind them that most people don’t care about your family income and that if they talk about their parents’ higher-than-average earnings, people will probably think they’re a jerk. Students borrowing from the federal government will get different loans at different times over their college years. Keeping a running tab and a list of loan numbers is a good idea so you can be organized when repayment begins. If your undergraduate is already a few years in, you can look up all of his or her federal loans via the National Student Loan Data System. Got private loans? You’ll need to contact your lenders for information. Once you have the data you need, make a list so you have everything in one place. The internet is filled with simple spreadsheet templates that make this easier. Once children turn 18, they have all the grown-up privacy rights that come from the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and the power to make their own medical decisions. This can create challenges when a student gets sick or is incapacitated, and parents are sometimes shocked to find that paying tuition doesn’t necessarily give them overarching authority or instant access to information. Parents who want to preserve some authority and access will want to consider filling out two forms, according to Molly E. Philipps, chief counsel of the civil division of the student legal services group at Ohio State University. First, there’s the health care power of attorney, which some people call a medical power of attorney or a health care surrogacy form. This form gives someone else the ability to make medical decisions for someone who is incapacitated, and it may also grant the right to see the patient’s medical records. Not every undergraduate will like the idea of granting access to health records, so be prepared for a possibly complicated discussion. The second form, a Hipaa release, might seem duplicative, given that it also provides access to medical records. But Ms. Philipps said the Hipaa document extended that access even after a person’s death, which makes it useful if the quality of care is a source of dispute. General Hipaa releases exist on the internet, but it’s worth asking each medical practitioner or a university health services or counseling office whether it has its own proprietary forms that it wants families to use. Even if you’re paying every penny of your child’s college tuition, you do not have the right to see his or her grades or disciplinary record. The federal Family Educational Rights Privacy Act sets the rules for who gets to see what when. If you want access to your child’s grades, you’ll have to have that (perhaps challenging) conversation first and then have your child sign a release, probably through the college registrar’s office. Ms. Philipps at Ohio State has seen it all, given that hers is one of the largest collections of undergraduates in the United States. And insurance problems come across her desk more than you might think. When it comes to automobiles, she encourages parents to talk to their insurance companies about liability coverage if a student is going to be living in a different state for a while. Planning on removing your student from the family insurance policy while he or she is on campus? You may want to reconsider: People sometimes drive their friends’ cars. Off-campus landlords sometimes require renters insurance, so you may be shopping for a policy whether you want to or not. Even if you have thorough homeowners insurance that extends to an on-campus child, a separate policy may be a better bet. Your own deductible may be high enough that a stolen iPad isn’t worth a claim — especially if it might still cause your premiums to surge. Health insurance is a particularly thorny topic: Some colleges and universities push their own policies, and campus or local clinics often maintain their own idiosyncratic insurance rules. My colleague Roni Caryn Rabin wrote an excellent primer on all of this two years ago, walking readers through the insurance questions they should ask: Does the campus health center take my family plan? What are the costs if it doesn’t? Is there an in-network doctor near campus? What about the type of specialist my child needs to see regularly? Once you sort your situation out, you can explain to your child what, if anything, care might cost. Let us help you work through the essentials of your financial to-do list. Tackle a simple money task each day for a week to strengthen your financial well-being. Helping a teenager who is about to enlist is a trickier matter. Your authority is diminished — you’re not writing tuition checks, and your child will no longer be living with you. And some young adults may have chosen this path in part because they seek independence at the earliest possible age. Nevertheless, most teenagers don’t know what they don’t know about money. (Middle-aged people too, for that matter.) And a multiyear stint in the military is a real job with benefits that would be foolish to ignore. So try to at least get a few things under their noses if you can. The Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard all have their own websites that outline salary and benefits. The Marine Corps cleverly directs interested parties to a recruiter who can answer questions. Here are two you might suggest asking of a more experienced enlisted person: What benefit have you valued most, and which one do you wish you had known about or started using sooner? Starting an automatic savings habit ought to be high on the priority list, and members of the military have access to the government’s Thrift Savings Plan to prepare for retirement. The Consumer Federation of America coordinates a campaign called Military Saves that can help both with establishing financial goals and making plans to meet them. Young adults getting regular paychecks for the first time are prime targets for shady financial services companies. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Office of Servicemember Affairs sends out email blasts and maintains social media accounts that provide tips. It has also published a number of useful guides to borrowing money safely and dealing with debt collectors if things go awry. Finally, there are the education benefits that come with military service. It’s not too soon to start thinking about how the G.I. Bill can help pay for higher education, including vocational training. Email: lieber@nytimes.com.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | A Floundering Candidacy,"Revisiting Obama’s 2007 struggles. The lesson? Calm down. Opinion Columnist This article is part of David Leonhardt’s newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday. It was the fall of 2007 — only a few months before the presidential primaries would begin — and Barack Obama’s campaign wasn’t looking good. He was trailing Hillary Clinton by about 25 percentage points, polls showed. “There are some real questions about electability,” one pollster said of him. He was even losing to Clinton among African-American voters — “one more indication of just how steep a climb remains for his campaign to overtake Clinton,” Politico wrote. “His senior aides said they were now spending much of their days fielding calls from concerned donors and other supporters,” The Times reported. Those supporters were expressing “mounting alarm” about “his lack of assertiveness.” [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] Less than three months later, of course, Obama would beat Clinton in Iowa, transforming the race. I encourage you to keep this history in mind when watching the current presidential campaign. It remains in its early stages — its very early stages, before any debates have begun. The current polls may bear little resemblance to the eventual results. So if you’re frustrated or disappointed that one of your favored candidates — say, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker or Beto O’Rourke — isn’t doing better, take a deep breath. Elizabeth Warren’s campaign provides a good reminder. A few months ago, everyone seemed to be asking why she was struggling. In recent weeks, The Times, Vox, The Washington Post and New York magazine have all written about a Warren boomlet. The right approach for Democratic voters at this stage is to figure out which candidates they want to win, not which ones are likely to win or seem most electable. Remember: At various points in their own primary campaigns, Obama, Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan were all dismissed as unelectable. “In contemporary politics,” my colleague Michelle Goldberg has written, “the quest to find an electable candidate hasn’t resulted in candidates that actually win. Voters don’t do themselves any favors when they try to think like pundits.” Related: The California Democratic Party holds its annual convention this weekend in San Francisco, and it is likely to be “the biggest single gathering of contenders so far,” The Wall Street Journal’s Emily Glazer writes. Fourteen candidates, including all of the big names except for Joe Biden, will be there, and each will receive a seven-minute speaking slot. Yes, he is a crook. If you have two-and-a-half minutes to spare, watch this video in which former federal prosecutors make a strong, succinct case against President Trump. “We all strongly believe that there is more than enough evidence to indict President Trump for multiple felony counts of obstruction of justice,” the prosecutors say (summarizing a statement signed by more than 1,000 former federal prosecutors). “If he weren’t in the White House, President Trump would be charged with serious crimes. This isn’t even a close case. If you or I did what President Trump did, we’d be facing prison.” If you are not a subscriber to this newsletter, you can subscribe here.

2019,"A Friend to Israel, and to Bigots: Viktor Orban’s ‘Double Game’ on Anti-Semitism","BUDAPEST — In late November, the office of Hungary’s far-right prime minister, Viktor Orban, announced it would donate $3.4 million to causes fighting anti-Semitism in Europe. The next day, a magazine controlled by Mr. Orban’s lawyer devoted its cover to an image depicting Andras Heisler, the leader of Hungary’s largest Jewish organization, showered with bank notes. Jewish groups across the world swiftly denounced the cover as anti-Semitic. Mr. Orban refused to criticize the magazine. It was a vivid example of how the Hungarian leader has both opposed and implicitly condoned anti-Semitism — sometimes in the same week. “There is this double game,” Mr. Heisler said in an interview. He described the Orban administration’s relationship with Hungary’s 100,000-strong Jewish population as “incredibly positive,” but added that officials often make gestures that “ruin the values that they purport to espouse.” [Amid rising German anti-semitism, official warns Jews not to wear skullcaps in public.] A hero to many far-right nationalists in Europe and the United States, Mr. Orban won a major public relations prize on Monday: an Oval Office meeting with President Trump. The two men gushed over each other. Mr. Trump described the Hungarian leader as “controversial,” but he clearly meant it as a compliment — Mr. Trump said some people considered him controversial, too. The meeting itself caused controversy, as critics accused Mr. Trump of coddling a neo-authoritarian leader accused of rolling back democracy in the heart of the European Union. Nine Democratic members of Congress had demanded that Mr. Trump cancel the meeting because of Mr. Orban’s record of alleged anti-Semitism, as well as his remarks critical of Muslims. But if anything, Mr. Orban and Mr. Trump have followed the same playbook, with each leader navigating to his own political advantage the confusing and contradictory ways in which anti-Semitism has resurfaced in Europe and North America. It is a point of overlap for both the far left and the far right, for Islamists and Islamophobes, for those who revile Israel as well as those who support it. Mr. Orban is the apogee of these contradictions: He is a far-right leader of a country whose Jewish citizens say they face less harassment than Jews in any other part of Europe. Mr. Orban and his party, Fidesz, have used anti-Semitic tropes to promote his vision of Hungarian nationalism, and have been accused of trying to understate Hungarian complicity in the Holocaust — even as he has bankrolled many Jewish institutions and causes. And he has drawn close to the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in a bid to win respectability abroad, even as he instigated a series of anti-Semitic political campaigns in Hungary in an attempt to appeal to bigots at home. “It’s a very contradictory picture,” said Paul Hanebrink, an associate professor at Rutgers University who has studied the history of Hungarian anti-Semitism. “On the one hand, he can hold up a very good relationship with Israel. And yet on the other hand, there are these very clear instances of anti-Semitic tropes circulating in Hungary from the government and people close to the government.” It is possible to see both sides of this paradox within five blocks of central Budapest, in a stroll from Rumbach Street to Szabadsag Square. Both sites have new government-funded building projects. On Rumbach Street, there is a renovated synagogue, one of several Jewish sites that the Orban government has helped to build or restore. At Szabadsag Square stands a stone memorial whose motifs implicitly play down Hungarian complicity in the Holocaust. It shows an eagle — a symbol of Nazi Germany — attacking a prostrate angel representing Hungary, a juxtaposition implying that Hungarian officials were victims of Nazi aggression, rather than partners in Nazi atrocities. Mr. Orban’s government has sometimes acknowledged Hungarian complicity, most notably in 2013. But the monument shows how it has also glossed over the role of Hungarian authorities in the Holocaust and in prewar acts of anti-Semitism. Another example is the attempts to rehabilitate the reputation of Adm. Miklos Horthy, the ruler of Hungary from 1920 to 1944, and other figures of that era. Many Hungarians have a pessimistic view of their country’s contemporary history, having seen defeat in two world wars, occupation by Russian and German troops, and the extensive loss of land and population during the 20th century. Mr. Orban, a staunch nationalist, has sought to paint a more glorious picture, and has concentrated on polishing the reputation of Admiral Horthy’s interwar government, which kept Hungary largely independent of foreign influence but instigated some of the most egregious anti-Jewish laws outside Nazi Germany. “The argument is that, ‘Yes, well, they might have been anti-Semitic, but that was kind of incidental,’” said Gabor Gyori, an expert on Hungarian anti-Semitism at Policy Solutions, a Budapest-based research group. “‘Look at all the things they did for Hungary.’” Mr. Orban has described Admiral Horthy as an “exceptional statesman.” His government also founded and funded a new research organization, Veritas, to research alternative interpretations of Admiral Horthy’s rule. Its status is now protected in the Hungarian Constitution. The group’s director, Sandor Szakaly, has said that the Horthy regime was legally justified in deporting 18,000 Hungarian Jews in 1941 who were later massacred in Ukraine. Under Mr. Orban, anti-Semitic authors from the Horthy era have been added to the national curriculum, and the Constitution has been rewritten to imply that the Horthy government was not responsible for its actions during the final 14 months of World War II, a period during which the vast majority of Hungarian Jews were deported and murdered. Mr. Orban’s unfinished Holocaust museum has set off its own uproar. The museum, known as the House of Fates, has been criticized by officials at Yad Vashem, Israel’s official Holocaust memorial, for failing to involve the Hungarian Jewish community in its planning. “Particularly missing is the role played by Hungarians in the persecution of their Jewish neighbors,” the director of the Yad Vashem libraries, Robert Rozett, wrote about the original plans for the museum. “The museum concept clearly avoids addressing the role and responsibility of Miklos Horthy and other Hungarian leaders of that era.” In response to the backlash, the government turned the ownership of the museum over to a pro-Orban Jewish group: a small chapter of Chabad, a global network of Hasidic Jews who came to Hungary after the fall of Communism. Chabad denies any accusations that the museum plans have whitewashed history. “I would never take part in something like that,” said Rabbi Slomo Koves, the leader of Chabad’s Hungarian affiliate. “Our plan is to show a full and authentic picture.” But some see Chabad’s involvement as an effort to sideline the majority of Hungarian Jews, who are mostly secular and considered broadly critical of Mr. Orban’s government. Hungarian officials “want Jewish organizations that give them cover,” said Mr. Gyori, the anti-Semitism expert. “Chabad can embody the Jews in the way Fidesz want them to be,” Mr. Gyori added. “They’re very traditional and conservative in outlook, and they have no desires to change Hungary.” Mr. Orban’s critics acknowledge that his approach to Judaism has a certain political logic. He supports the Israeli prime minister because the two politicians share a wariness of Islam and cosmopolitan liberalism. He rehabilitates historical anti-Semites and instigates anti-Semitic political campaigns because he wants to retain the support of the more extreme parts of his right-wing base. “I’m convinced that the prime minister himself is not an anti-Semite,” said Rabbi Robert Frolich of Budapest’s Great Synagogue, the largest Jewish temple in Europe. “But our government uses the code language of anti-Semitism and racism to maximize their voter numbers,” Rabbi Frolich added. For Agnes Heller, a Hungarian philosopher and Holocaust survivor, the quest for political hegemony explains not just Mr. Orban’s approach to anti-Semitism, but also his steady dismantling of Hungarian democracy. “The question is not whether Viktor Orban is anti-Semitic, because he has no ideology,” Ms. Heller said. “His only goal is power,” she said. “And whatever means is going get him more power, he is going to use it.” OpinionIvan Krastev",The New York Times
2019,"A Fund to Support the Muslim American Community, Inside and Out","Wealth Matters The founders of the Pillars Fund seek to strengthen a network of Muslim support groups while countering negative perceptions and stereotypes. Anas Osman, a founding trustee of the Pillars Fund.CreditCreditJason Henry for The New York Times After attaining professional success and wealth, Anas Osman, a technology entrepreneur and executive, turned to philanthropy. He wanted to help other Muslim Americans embrace the opportunities in the United States. So he and some friends from Chicago, who had also achieved financial success, came up with an idea that was decidedly unconventional. They didn’t want to build an app for charity or introduce a new metric for giving. Instead, Mr. Osman and his friends, all Muslim Americans, created a model that more closely resembled a 19th-century benevolent society. Their organization, the Pillars Fund, would hark back to what similar groups did for Irish, Italian and Chinese immigrants: support organizations working in an ethnic community while trying to counter negative perceptions. The organization started in 2010 as a donor-advised fund, an investment vehicle created to manage donations on behalf of charities. It was set up at the Chicago Community Trust, a community foundation in their hometown, Mr. Osman said. In the first year, it received a matching grant from a group founded by George Russell, whose company created the Russell stock indexes. “That helped seal our fate together,” he said. “There was a greater sense of responsibility and duty. We got into the flow.” In using an earlier model of philanthropic engagement, the founders of the Pillars Fund aimed to support service organizations in the Muslim American community. But they also wanted to help groups working to change the narrative of Muslims and present a more diverse view of the community than extremists and Hollywood generally portray. Doing this in an age of social media, with its easy engagement and rapid dissemination of news, presents an opportunity that benevolent societies of the past did not have: promoting positive portrayals while also responding to negative ones in real time. Succeeding in that mission, even with the aid of technology, is not easy. Leslie Lenkowsky, professor emeritus at the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy, said an organization like Pillars could thrive simply by acting as a vetting organization. Philanthropy needs that type of scrutiny, he said, citing an example in which, after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Muslims gave money to a faith-based charity that was actually funneling the donations to Islamic terrorist groups. Mr. Osman said he was raised to give back. His parents had come to the United States from Syria to work as doctors. They invested their time in community building, helping to put up a mosque in the Chicago suburb where they lived. His first endeavor in philanthropy was starting a group to help Muslim American students and young professionals contend with their identities after the Sept. 11 attacks. The strategy of Pillars is different. It looks to community organizations that are too small to attract support from large foundations like the Open Society or the Ford Foundation (which has provided funding to Pillars). In this way, Pillars acts like a venture capital incubator for social ideas. “We wanted to give unrestricted support for three years and hope the organizations matured,” Mr. Osman said. “And if they matured sufficiently, Pillars would be in their rearview mirror.” The challenge was expanding their fund-raising beyond the five founders. Kashif M. Shaikh, who was working at the Robert R. McCormick Foundation, a large foundation in Chicago, initially volunteered to help the founders run their fund. As it grew, he became Pillars’ executive director, charged with bringing in more funders while honing the organization’s mission. Last year, the fund made 26 grants totaling about $625,000. That’s small for any nonprofit organization. The organization, though, is trying to pick its spots: fighting poverty, combating racism in the Muslim community and promoting entertainment with positive role models, like “Ramy,” a series on Hulu about the life of an Egyptian-American living in New Jersey. “We’re not going in saying we are going to eradicate racism,” Mr. Shaikh said. “What we’re saying is, we’re combating these stereotypes” of Muslims as terrorists. Sameer Shamsi, who works as an investment banker in New York, joined Pillars as a trustee. Young and successful, he had been giving in a traditional way: sending money to his college and business school, because, he said, they had asked him. Having grown up going to Catholic school by day and Muslim school at night, he toggled between the two worlds and learned how to exist successfully in both. He said he had been drawn to Pillars by the opportunity to do the same on a larger scale. “Many of the initiatives Pillars supported then and continues to support today were early in their life cycle,” said Mr. Shamsi. “I felt we were seeding really exciting investments.” One initiative Pillars supports is an oral history project at the Brooklyn Historical Society. It aims to show the scope of the Muslim community in Brooklyn and its contribution to the borough and the country. Another is an anti-racism group focused within the Muslim community. Margari Hill, a co-founder and executive director of the Muslim Anti-Racism Collaborative, said that Muslims in the United States were roughly divided into thirds — black, South Asian and Middle Eastern — and that they did not necessarily get along despite their shared faith. “We want to change the conversation,” said Kalia Abiade, director of programs at Pillars. “We think American Muslims can contribute to society in a way that advances opportunity for all people.” The funders behind Pillars looked to other faith-based organizations, particularly in the Jewish community, for guidance, but they also wanted to leverage the dollars in a more substantial way. Dilara Sayeed, who founded vPeer, a mentorship group, and her husband, Yousuf, a doctor, redirected their own donations to Pillars to increase the effect they could have. “I didn’t want to be figuring it out ourselves,” said Ms. Sayeed, who is now a trustee. “How did other groups do this? How could we use models from L.G.B.T.Q. and Jewish groups and not have to reinvent this all ourselves?” Outside organizations have taken note. The Ford Foundation has given $1.65 million to Pillars since 2016, to support grants around creating community engagement and preventing bias and discrimination. The Nathan Cummings Foundation, whose money is derived from the wealth of the founder of Sara Lee baked goods, has given both money — $300,000 — and support as a Jewish faith-based charity. Measuring success isn’t as clear. Mr. Shamsi, the banker, said one measure was the level of interest. There were 200 inquiries in 2018 for the 26 grants that were awarded, about the same as the year before. But on the bigger issue of the perceptions of Muslim Americans, change was not going to be quick. “We have to be patient with the long game,” Ms. Sayeed said. “It’s not frustrating, but it’s required us to keep our focus.” Professor Lenkowsky of Indiana University said that changing the perception of any ethnic group took decades and that even then, it was never fully transformed. “The old stereotypes to some degree fade away, but they never really do,” he said. “They never really fade, but people make their way and they get past some of this.” But for Mr. Osman and his co-founders, being a voice in that debate is crucial. His goal is to give to more groups to increase their visibility and through that “to ultimately humanize American Muslims and underscore the breadth of what American Muslim means — as opposed to a very narrow definition.”",The New York Times
2019,A Funeral for Two Birds,"Ties My great-grandmother was a scientist who did not weep over impermanence, but my cousin and I did. The summer I turned 11, we buried two wild birds and we did not bury my great-grandmother. We did not bury my great-grandmother because she had donated her body to science. I imagined this meant her brain floating in glowing liquid in a jar on a laboratory shelf. Later I learned that a medical school used her cadaver for teaching. She came from the scientist side of my family — she was a geologist and avid bird-watcher — so this was a fitting end. Just before her memorial service, I spent a week with the artist side of my family, including a cousin my age, renting a house in the woods of Vermont. To a kid like me from the suburbs, it was an explosion of green. The air smelled like pine needles and springs flowing down from the mountains. I was intoxicated, running to look under every fern and moss-spangled rock, catching fireflies at dusk and letting them go. By morning, the forest echoed with the calls of birds that sang as if their lives depended on it. The house we rented was on a hillside, and at the bottom of the hill was a tiny pond ringed with water lilies and cattails. It was just big enough for my older sister and me to launch two small kayaks and float. The pond was home to fat green frogs that lazed on the lily pads or hid in the muddy shallows. Their croaks sounded like a plucked banjo string, and I loved them immediately. My sister and I discovered that if we slid a kayak paddle gently underneath a frog, then lifted the paddle just a few inches, the frog would sit and stare placidly back at us like a creature from a fairy tale. My sister named them all, inspired by her college reading: Julius Caesar, Cleopatra, Augustus. But as in all fairy tales, there was death in the woods, too. My cousin and I found it in our walks through the undergrowth. The first body we found was a tiny jeweled thing, a ruby-throated hummingbird that must have crashed into a window and broken her neck. I laid the bird out on a leaf. Then we found a dead ruffed grouse hidden under a rhododendron bush. It was a bigger, quail-like bird with speckled brown and gray feathers. We laid out the second body solemnly. My biologist father helped us identify both species. I loved learning about science from my father — I still share his desire to understand and name the natural world. But my cousin and I were kids with a slightly dramatic, dreamy side. We needed a ceremony for this sad event, so we agreed we needed to stage a funeral. My great-grandmother Isabel’s memorial service had been an unreligious one, held on a hillside in Western Massachusetts where her ancestors had lived. My relatives sat in a circle and took turns sharing their memories of her. I was born too late to remember much of her before the nursing home and dementia. I have a memory of playing piano for her in a sunny room with a Persian rug. Isabel was known as the bird lady in her neighborhood outside Chicago, where she lived with her best friend for several decades after her divorce. The two of them fought over who got to wash the dishes, because the window over the sink had the best view of the bird feeders. Isabel gave impromptu science lessons with the array of specimens she kept in a glass-front curio cabinet: drawers full of taxidermied birds, rocks, fossils and sand glass formed by lightning strikes. She volunteered as an environmental educator in local schools and mentored young naturalists. Kids from the neighborhood brought injured birds to her house for help. She was a rational person, my father tells me. I can’t imagine her crying over dead birds. My family placed a granite plaque carved with Isabel’s name in the nearby cemetery. Every few years, my relatives visit the marker and scrub lichen from its lettering. Nature is always trying to take over, and given enough time, even stone will wear away. In the woods of Vermont, my cousin and I gathered scrolls of birch bark that had fallen to the ground. I composed an epitaph for each of the birds and wrote them on the bark. Together, my cousin and I dug two holes in the hillside and lowered the bodies down. The earth was soft and rich from years of leaf litter decomposing into loam. We covered the birds over with soil, tamped it down. But then we came to a crisis. My cousin and I could not agree on how to mark the graves. I wanted to place the birch bark epitaphs on top of each grave and leave them there. No, he said, we had to attach the scrolls to something, or they would blow away in the wind. I may have said something about the impermanent nature of all things, but philosophizing didn’t help. We kept arguing. Our voices got louder and louder. I refused to compromise, and so did he. I insisted that making markers for the graves would ruin the spirit of the entire ceremony. Finally, we were shouting at each other and crying. We wound each other up until I was sobbing so hard that I started to have an asthma attack. I stumbled down the hillside, tears streaming down my face, my breath wheezing in my throat. My uncle had to come and break it up. He cajoled us to speak one at a time, take deep breaths, and explain from the beginning. He calmed us down until I could breathe normally again and my cousin had stopped crying, too. We made peace and placed the birch bark scrolls on the graves. Maybe my cousin pinned them down with a small stone. But in a few days or weeks, a thunderstorm was sure to roll through, bringing wind that lashed the branches and rain that soaked the soil. Sooner or later, our carefully written elegies would be gone, just as we would be.

2019,A Gay Theater and James Baldwin’s N.Y. Apartment May Get Landmark Protection,"The landmarks commission will consider giving landmark status to six buildings based on their historical, not architectural, significance. All six played a critical role in the gay rights movement. One was a storefront restaurant that New York City officials described as the city’s first gay theater and the place where Off Off Broadway got its start. Another was home to a number of lesbian and feminist groups in the 1970s and 1980s. Now, the city’s Landmarks Preservation Commission is moving toward considering landmark status for the six sites. The agency was born in the 1960s in response to the anger over the demolition of the old Pennsylvania Station, which the novelist Thomas Wolfe described as “vast enough to hold the sound of time.” Since then, the commission has conferred landmark status on individual buildings and on neighborhoods based mainly on architectural significance and historical merit. But over the years the commission has also granted landmark protection based on historical or cultural significance. The six places under consideration do not include the Stonewall Inn, a Greenwich Village bar and the site of a major turning point in the gay rights movement, because it has already been recognized. The commission gave it landmark status in 2015 because of its significance in lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender history. In 2016, then-President Barack Obama designated the building and the area around it the Stonewall National Monument. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising and the World Pride celebration will come to New York City for the first time. Five of the six landmarks-to-be are already in designated historic districts, so the protection afforded by landmark status would be new for only one. But Sarah Carroll, the chairwoman of the landmarks commission, said the new designations would add “an extra layer of protection” if future owners sought permission for exterior changes. “We wanted to explicitly recognize the association with LGBT history,” she said. “In most cases, the designation of the historic districts in which the buildings already exist did not recognize this history.” Since its start, the commission has expanded its mandate toward recognizing buildings for what happened in them, not just their presence on the landscape, with a number of other designations, among them Louis Armstrong’s house in Queens, a landmark since 1988. A year ago, the commission created a historic district in Harlem, citing the “rich social, cultural and political life” that went on there as well as the architecture. It includes the home of the ragtime composer Scott Joplin and the national headquarters for the March on Washington in 1965. The six most recent sites were chosen based on their contribution to gay history. Recognizing more than architecture “is really important,” said Andrew S. Dolkart, co-director of the LGBT Historic Sites Project, which recommended sites for the LGBT designations. “In general, it’s really important that preservation move beyond just works of architecture, not to denigrate that — I’m an architectural historian,” he said, adding, “We really need to recognize places of cultural and historical significance.” Giving the six buildings landmark status would put documentation about them in the commission’s files that would be taken into account if owners sought to make changes to the outside, Ms. Carroll said. That information, she said, “would guide our thinking” and could prove especially important for facades that “might not have been seen as typical or traditional in that particular historic district.” She said that could be a concern for one of the six buildings, at 137 West 71st Street. It was the New York home of the writer and civil rights activist James Baldwin from the mid-1960s on. For years he mainly lived in France and died at his home there in 1987. But he described himself as a “commuter,” not an expatriate. The landmarks commission noted that he kept an apartment in the 71st Street building “where he worked on plays, screenplays and novels and corresponded with other prominent literary and cultural figures” when he was in New York. His niece Aisha Karefa-Smart wrote in 2013 that the building’s “energy and vitality” surged “to a fever pitch as soon as he hit the door.” The building was built as one in a line of four rowhouses in 1890 but was altered in 1961. The original facade was stripped off, replaced with light-colored brick. Stairs leading to the parlor-floor entrance were demolished, the front door was moved down to the street level and glass-brick windows were installed next to it. Baldwin bought it in 1965. His family sold the building in 1994, according to the current owner, Romeo Salta, who said he was “ambivalent” about a landmark designation. “Quite frankly, we were contemplating, not in the immediate future but sometime down the line, fixing up the facade because in my opinion, it’s not a very good-looking building,” Mr. Salta said. “I’ve got no problem with honoring Mr. Baldwin,” he said, but added, “I think there are other ways of honoring Mr. Baldwin short of declaring his old building a landmark because it has no architectural merit at all.” The commission described another of the six buildings as the birthplace of Off Off Broadway, a four-story tenement-and-store building at 31 Cornelia Street in Greenwich Village. From 1958 to 1968, the store space was occupied by a restaurant called Caffe Cino. At the time, the commission’s staff noted in a report on the building, “portraying homosexuality in theatrical productions was illegal,” but Caffe Cino “became a center for gay artists to share their work” as the city’s first gay theater. Playwrights who got their start there included John Guare, who later wrote “Six Degrees of Separation,” and Lanford Wilson, who wrote “Fifth of July,’’ according to the commission. It is in the Greenwich Village Historic District, just as the Baldwin House is in a historic district on the Upper West Side. The one building not within the boundaries of a historic district is a former firehouse once known as the women’s liberation center. The building, at 243 West 20th Street, is still owned by the city and is now rented to a group that trains women for construction and maintenance work. Ms. Carroll said she and members of the commission’s staff worked with the City Council speaker, Corey Johnson, and the New York City LGBT Historic Sites Project. She said Mr. Johnson did not suggest specific sites, but he said through a spokesman that the choices “will make excellent additions” to the roster of landmarks. The commission will decide on Tuesday whether to begin the formal process of landmarking the sites, including holding public hearings and, eventually, votes on official designation. Simeon Bankoff, the executive director of the Historic District Council, a preservation group, called the six potential designations “a terrific step forward to recognizing unrecognized history.” But he and William Dobbs, a historically minded advocate, said they wished the commission would designate more landmarks of significance in the gay rights movement. Mr. Dobbs mentioned a building on the corner of 14th Street and the Avenue of the Americas that was the meeting place of the Gay Liberation Front, the first activist organization formed after the Stonewall rebellion. That building has been sold to a developer and is being demolished. “The story of these landmarks is they get torn down,” he said. “It’s especially painful because there aren’t very many LGBT landmarks.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | A Graduation Surprise: No Student Debt,"letter A reader praises a billionaire’s generosity and urges others to follow his example. To the Editor: Re “A Gift to Graduates: Your Loans Will Be Paid Off” (front page, May 20): Gosh, what can billionaires do with their vast quantities of money? Buy a $91 million rabbit (the price just paid for a Jeff Koons sculpture) or pay off an entire graduating class’s student loans? Robert Smith’s inordinate act of generosity and love to Morehead College graduates brought tears to my eyes. One can only hope that others who are members of the top 1 percent of our society could be moved to do the same. Kathleen McCordEncinitas, Calif.",The New York Times
2019,A Graphic Novel That Answers a Child’s Question About Being Biracial,"Graphic Content For a person of color in America, the term person of color can be both useful and divisive, at once a form of solidarity and a badge of alienation. There’s a flattening effect, too: A multitude of ethnicities and cultures, with their own color-coded nuances, get crammed into the initials P.O.C. Among its many virtues, Mira Jacob’s graphic memoir, GOOD TALK (One World, $30), helps us think through this term with grace and disarming wit. The book lives up to its title, and reading these searching, often hilarious tête-à-têtes — with her parents and brother, confidantes and strangers, employers and exes — is as effortless as eavesdropping on a crosstown bus. Mira lives in New York with her husband, Jed, who is white and Jewish, and their young son, Z., who is dark-skinned like his mother — a poster for racial harmony that can, in the current climate, feel like a target. Born in New Mexico to parents who immigrated from India in 1968, Mira is simply “brown,” if ethnically obscure, while growing up (“You’re Indian like feathers or Indian like dots?” a boy asks her). Ironically, she first feels the stigma of skin color on trips to her parents’ native country, thanks to not being as “fair” as the rest of her family. As a girl, Mira envisions the “lighter, happier, prettier me.” In fifth grade, Mira tastes literary glory when she wins an essay contest sponsored by the Daughters of the American Revolution (on “Tools of Early America”). A stern but proud teacher drives her across town to the Elks Lodge, where Mira addresses the politely confused sponsors with an eye-opening claim: “Hammers were among the most used tools of the early American settlers.” (Jacob’s comic timing is impeccable.) The chapter conveys a dream of integration that’s at once heartwarming and dated — a model-minority moment, complete with the teacher’s fierce pep talk: “You are an American … don’t you ever let anyone tell you that you’re not.” Over the years, though, Mira finds plenty of people who do just that. In the wake of 9/11, the horror binds people in the city together, but then there are others, like a man at a bar Mira goes to, who suddenly feel emboldened to make comments like, “How do we know you aren’t plotting to kill everyone in here if you won’t even talk to us?” “I guess America got kind of weird for us for a while,” Mira tells her son, while withholding all the micro- and macroaggressions she’s endured on the subway, in a diner, on the street. Included within that “us” are mother and son. But where does that leave Jed? After the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, 6-year-old Z. starts to question his place in society. “Is it bad to be brown?” he wonders. “Are white people afraid of brown people?” Progressive to the gills, with a lifetime of P.O.C. wisdom, Mira-as-mom carefully deflects and reassures. Then comes the kicker: “Is Daddy afraid of us?” The biracial Z. is trying to parse the color line, circa now, and see which side he’s on, as if there would be some comfort in knowing. It’s a skill he’ll have to hone all his life, the way his mother has, and the way his father has never had to. Throughout “Good Talk,” Jacob reproduces the same black and white figures, like cutouts you can turn into finger puppets, often set against colorful photographs: a Chelsea street, her parents’ kitchen. Even her major characters have just a few avatars, with fixed poses and expressions. Jacob zooms in and out, juxtaposes, crops. The figures work well as delivery systems for her dialogue, at times generating a deadpan humor, like the clip-art ciphers in David Rees’s “Get Your War On” (2002). On occasion, the photocopied feel dilutes the text, as in a fight between Mira and Jed over his parents’ full-throated support for Trump. Their faces, adequate in prior situations, appear oddly dazed and distracted. But the medium is part of the magic of “Good Talk.” The old comic-book alchemy of words and pictures opens up new possibilities of feeling. During one searing argument, Mira asks Jed if his Jewish, MAGA-spouting folks — who are doting grandparents to their mixed-race child — would be O.K. if she voted for an anti-Semitic candidate. “I don’t know that it’s helpful to be so black and white about it,” Jed retorts. In a flash, the graphic elements (monochrome cutouts, photos) of “Good Talk” seem to be a commentary on race. The people are black and white — except, of course, they’re not. * In NOBODY’S FOOL: The Life and Times of Schlitzie the Pinhead (Abrams Comic Arts, $24.99), the virtuoso comic-strip artist Bill Griffith gives voice to a true outcast — the sideshow attraction born Simon Metz (probably) in the Bronx (probably) in 1901. He fills the biographical lacunae with vivid info on the sideshow life, Hollywood in the ’30s, and linework so rich you could eat it. A microcephalic, or “pinhead,” “Schlitzie” drew crowds for nearly 50 years, variously presented as some biological oddity (“The Missing Link”), lost-race survivor (“Last of the Incas”), and/or female (“Monkey Girl”). Because of his mental disability, his vocal output was limited to nonsense repetitions: “Boffo!” “I like dishes.” “Is he married?” Yet he made an indelible appearance in “Freaks,” Tod Browning’s notorious 1932 sideshow-revenge movie, and in this way affected the course of cartooning history. As a Pratt student in the early ’60s, Griffith caught a late-night revival of “Freaks,” and was immediately drawn to Schlitzie. Attempts to render this vision came to naught, but years later, embedded in San Francisco’s underground comic scene, Griffith was inspired to cast a pinhead as one point in a romance-story parody; in the last panel, he gave him the name “Zippy.” Zippy became the titular star of a weekly strip in 1976, which was picked up a decade later for daily syndication, allowing Griffith to showcase his hero’s hyperverbal, free-associative riffs seven glorious times a week. The collected works read like a looking-glass version of “Doonesbury,” the same cultural and political inputs producing something wildly random and addictively funny. (Peak Zippiness for me remains 1985’s mind-blowing “Are We Having Fun Yet?,” with cameos by everyone from Officer Big Mac to Leona Helmsley.) “Nobody’s Fool” is an act of homage and loving reclamation. Griffith hasn’t forgotten the influence Schlitzie had on his art, and in this way the book makes a fitting companion piece to “Invisible Ink” (2015), a memoir of his parents’ marriage that focused on his mother’s long affair with Lawrence Lariar, a prolific, now forgotten cartoonist. It’s a brave and moving investigation into a lurid family secret, as well as an apt origin story for Griffith. (The prolific Lariar actually had work in the very first all-original comic book, “New Fun.”) Though Schlitzie’s biography leaves scant traces in the historical record, Griffith brings each scene to life, from F. Scott Fitzgerald freaking out over the “Freaks” invading the MGM commissary, to Schlitzie’s sharing a bill with the Beach Boys at a citrus farmers’ promotional show in 1962. Sold by his family to a manager in 1909, constantly crisscrossing the country, Schlitzie leads a life of tragic dimensions, including a harrowing stay at the L.A. County Hospital. Yet this is an uplifting, wonderfully humane book. The so-called freaks have a winning camaraderie, and one of Schlitzie’s last managers even legally adopts him. Practically mute, Schlitzie is not really the jabber-jawed Zippy, but his gentle spirit somehow shines through. With “Nobody’s Fool,” Griffith suggests a transmigration of souls.",The New York Times
